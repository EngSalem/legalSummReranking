She also said that she had been assaulted by the accused several times while she was sleeping in the bedroom. She said that the assault was so intense that she feared for her life. She testified that she was afraid that he would leave her alone if he ever said anything like that again. She was also afraid that if he said anything about the “mischievous flaunting” or the shower-watching, she would call the police and the accused would be arrested. The following evidence was found to confirm the complainant’s testimony: 1)The accused had an opportunity to sleep on the floor of the basement. Most of the incidents complained of happened in that room. The alleged assault was consistent with the accused having an opportunity. He had the opportunity to spend time with the complainant and she had the ability to report back to him. He did not have the opportunity and the evidence was circumstantial.

The only concerns she had were depression or withdrawal, her sliding school performance, anger and self-consciousness and her passage through puberty into adolescent behaviour that seems to put greater emphasis on body image as opposed to brains. 2)The accused had no reasonable doubt that the complainant had been sexually assaulted. He did not have the opportunity to defend himself against the allegations of sexual assault. He had the opportunity and the evidence to prove it. He was not guilty of any of the allegations. The court found that the evidence of both the complainant and the accused was circumstANTIAL. 3)There was no evidence of any threats or threats. The Court found that although the accused had a reasonable chance of being found guilty, it was unlikely that he would be found guilty.","Although his explanations for touching and his evidence of the complainant’s behaviour are at odds with the Crown’s evidence, there is simply not enough confirmatory evidence surrounding the allegations for there to be proof of guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. Although I am suspicious of his evidence I have compared and contrasted it with that of the Crown’s and, having done so, I am unable to find him guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. 32. The accused is, therefore, not guilty of either count on the Information.",0.0782122905027933,0.17241379310344826,The accused was charged with sexual assault and touching contrary to s.271(1) and 153 of the Criminal Code. The alleged offences occurred in the complainant's home when she was between the ages of 13 and 15. HELD: The accused was found not guilty on both counts. 1)There was insufficient confirmatory evidence for proof of guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. The evidence showed an escalating pattern of intrusive behaviour by the accused who admitted to touching her on two occasions and to have been on top of her once. His explanation that he fell on her was farfetched but the other explanations were not outlandish. None of the complainant's allegations involved alcohol nor was drunkenness alleged to be a factor. The evidence of the complainant's depression or withdrawal could have other explanations.,"The accused was charged with sexual assault and touching. The evidence of the complainant was that the accused often slept on the couch in the basement of the house adjacent to the room where the family watched TV. There was a couch or love-seat in that room. The accused often went to bed late at night. Sometimes he slept down there because he was angry with the complainant's mother for not wanting to have sex with him. He frequently came into the bedroom and touched her inappropriately. She called the police. An expert witness in the area of sexual behaviour testified to this evidence. HELD: The accused was found guilty of both charges. 1)The accused had an opportunity to be found guilty. He had a reasonable chance of being found guilty on all of the counts. 2)The evidence was circumstantial. The complainant had no concerns about the accused and his behaviour toward her. He was severely drunk and had a history of aggressive behaviour. The alleged incidents were consistent with his repeated repeated assaults on her. 3)The complainant's evidence did not confirm the accused’s guilt. The only evidence that he was guilty was that he had been physically abusive to the complainant and that he did not have a place to live in a house where he lived with his children. He also had the opportunity to spend time with his grandchildren. 4)Although the accused was acquitted of all charges, the evidence of his alleged victimization of his own daughter was strongly supported by expert testimony. The court found that the evidence that the complainant had been sexually assaulted by the accused in her own home did not corroborate the allegations against her.","Although his explanations for touching and his evidence of the complainant’s behaviour are at odds with the Crown’s evidence, there is simply not enough confirmatory evidence surrounding the allegations for there to be proof of guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.

When the behaviour finally escalated to groping at her in the bedroom while she was sleeping, she called the police. HELD: The accused was found guilty of both charges. 1)The evidence was circumstantial. The complainant had the time in the sense that the complainant went to bed late in the evening or in the early morning hours at time when most of the household would be asleep. There were also four occasions when the accused walked into her room (he said he thought she was awake) and ran out. He said that he was chasing kittens. That explanation sounded too contrived. No one had mentioned cats or kittens before. 2)The accused had the opportunity to sleep downstairs about two-thirds of the time. However, he also had the chance to sleep in the living room with his mother. The mother testified that she never had any concerns about the accused and his behaviour toward her daughter. The only concerns she had were depression or withdrawal and her sliding school performance, anger and self consciousness. 3)There was no threat to the complainant or to herself or to anyone else. The assault was escalating and the accused had a pattern of intrusive behaviour that escalated over the course of several years. The alleged incidents were consistent with the accused’s repeated repeated assaults on the complainant and his repeated threats to leave and take her baby brother with him, which would have alerted her mother if he got off on his own. Although he was severely drunk, she could only recall only one other time when he was that drunk. She said that it was rare for him to be drunk. Alcohol was not problem. It was only after the complainant called the Police that she was able to report the assault to the RCMP. She testified that he only touched the complainant when she was reaching for something above the stove and began to fall. He always used one hand. The touching only lasted seconds each time ending as soon as she said stop.","Although his explanations for touching and his evidence of the complainant’s behaviour are at odds with the Crown’s evidence, there is simply not enough confirmatory evidence surrounding the allegations for there to be proof of guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.

2005nssc364.txt,"The Agency applied for permanent care of a young child, with no access to the parents. Each of the mother, the biological father and the psychological father sought to have the child placed in their care. The child had been apprehended due to unsafe and unhealthy living conditions. The mother and psychological father no longer lived together and for the past few months, the mother had been maintaining a clean and tidy apartment and attempting to improve her education and had taken parenting courses. The psychological father, with whom the mother had ended a tumultuous relationship, wanted the child returned to his care, stating that he planned on residing with the mother who would assist him in caring for the child. The mother was against this plan. The biological father only reappeared on the scene after the child was taken into care and acknowledged that the child did not know him as her father. Child placed in the permanent care of the Agency with no access to the mother or the psychological father; access ordered to the biological father for a period of six months at which time the access order will expire automatically unless an application to vary is made; the Agency is to arrange for a parental capacity assessment of the biological father. The child continued to be at substantial risk of physical harm due to neglect if she was returned to the mother's care and the child would be at risk of exposure to violence if returned to the psychological father's care due to the tumultuous relationship between the mother and him. Although some improvements had recently been made in the mother's life, she had a history of frequent changes of residence and did not appear able put the child's needs ahead of her own. The Agency had not had an opportunity to assess the appropriateness of a placement with the biological father.",The agency applied for an order of care and custody with no provision for access with respect to the child. The agency alleged that the respondent parents had failed to cooperate in addressing the risk factors identified at previous court hearings and acknowledged by the Respondents in consenting to a protection finding. The child was placed in the care of the respondent mother and psychological father. The biological father opposed the application and requested an order returning the child to his care. The mother's sister opposed the request and requested that the child be placed with another family. The respondent parents were to have unscheduled access to the applicant's residence. The applicant's sister was to be placed in temporary foster care. HELD: The child remained in the agency's custody. The court found that the circumstances had changed since the previous disposition order and that the parties had failed in addressing risk factors. The Agency was concerned that the biological father was not prepared to cooperate with the agency in addressing their risk factors which affected the health and safety of their child. This was the basis for the application for a protection order. The father was to have access to her residence.,"[1] The Children\'s Aid Society of Cape Breton-Victoria (agency) applied for an order of Permanent Care and Custody, with no provision for access, with respect to the child, S.N.D., born [in 2003].

HELD: 1) The present circumstances are remarkably similar to the circumstances in Bzowey v. Bzowey, 2005 SKQB 12. In both cases, the Court is asked to make the change based solely on the wishes of the child. There is even evidence from the custody and access report from 2005 that the children, or at least the older child, Jill, expressed similar sentiments about living with her mother. It cannot even be strenuously argued that the wishes of the child, Jill, have in fact changed. Those considerations were before the Court in the form of the custody and access report when the decision was made in 2005. 2) The Court should be loathe to make a variation order solely on the expressed wishes of a child of 11 or 12 years of age without some evidence as to why that current expression of interest has been stated. It may well be that the child truly does wish a change. It may also be that the child, as was referred to in the custody and access report, may be simply reflecting the views and therefore the pressures placed on the child by the non-custodial parent. 3) No evidence has been put forward about the negative impact of the continuation of the current order. There is no information before the Court to suggest that the current situation is no longer in the best interests of the children. No material change has been demonstrated. The application is dismissed.","The father brought an application for an order varying the child support order granted by the court.

The landlords are mother and son. The mother lives out of province for a number of years. She returns in summers to reside in the premises.

She sought an order that the Tenant vacate the premises. The Hearing Officer found he had no jurisdiction to deal with the dispute between the two landlords. He found he could only deal with the situation between the landlords and the tenant and found that the tenant had signed a lease in good faith and is entitled to the rights the lease affords and is entitled to remain in the premises.

It can be counterbalanced by other circumstances that the judge finds may prevent the accused from testifying or be outweighed by factors that demonstrate that the interests require a joint trial.  3)Sellance is required in the interests of the justice. It is not necessary to have all the counts tried together because the accused will not be able to rely upon the evidence of proximity on April 14th to support the inference of its use on April 8th. 4)The only factor that can be weighed against severance application is whether it is necessary in the interest of justice to have the counts severed. The purpose of severance is to reduce the burden on the accused to persuade the court on a balance of probabilities that it is in the right interests to sever.  5)It is impossible to substitute his or her own view for that of that of the accused and determine that the accused should testify or not on some counts but not others. The obvious risk when counts are tried together is that the issues are different (identity on the former, and knowledge and control of the gun on the latter) and that there is substance to his testimonial intentions. The only possible link conceded is the firearm which assumes an unproven connection of possession of the firearm on both days. 6)The fact that there are two sets of counts in one indictment does not necessarily grant severance.

First, on the basis of the dates of the occurrences and, secondly, to separate the so-called 'status offences' based on a pre-existing firearm prohibition order. It was argued the Crown had combined all the counts into one indictment to improve its evidentiary position with regard to the unproven connection of possession of the gun on the two separate dates and to be able to cross-examine the accused on the events of both days should he choose to only testify on the events of one day. The Crown argued that expert evidence showing a match between the gun used in the shooting on the first date and that found by the arresting officers on the second date showed a temporal and continuity nexus between the two events. The accused's  videotaped statement to the police was also a common piece of evidence to both dates. Application for severance dismissed. The most significant issue was the possibility of the accused being subject to cross-examination for events of both days if he chose to testify only concerning the events of one day but his position that he had no association with the gun and that it was not in his possession on either day indicated that his decision on whether to testify would most likely be the same in relation to both sets of counts and, given that there was no jury involved, there was no risk of improper inferences being drawn.

HELD: The application for severance was dismissed on both the bases proposed. The court must engage in weighing exercise of all the relevant factors in deciding whether to sever or not. 1)The interests of justice encompass the accused's right to be tried on the evidence admissible against him, as well as society's interest in seeing that justice is done in reasonably efficient and cost-effective manner. 2)The accused's testimonial intention should be objectively justifiable. This requirement is balanced with all the others. It can be counterbalanced by other circumstances that the judge finds may prevent the accused from testifying or be outweighed by factors that demonstrate that the interests require a joint trial.  3)Sellance is required in the interests of fairness, as per s. 591(3) of the Code. It is impossible to substitute his or her own view for that of that of the accused and determine that the accused should testify or not on some counts but not others. The obvious risk when counts are tried together is that the issues are different (identity on the former, and knowledge and control of the gun on the latter) and that there is no common evidence. The only possible link conceded is the firearm which assumes an unproven connection of possession of the firearm on both days. The Court may, where it is satisfied that the interest of justice so require, order the accused be tried separately on one or more of the counts.","[1] The accused is charged with 21 counts under an indictment dated September 1, 2010 consisting of one count of attempted murder, several charges pertaining to the unlawful possession and use of a firearm, and a number of status offences based on a pre-existing firearm prohibition order.

The accused were both in the early hours of November 8, 2010. The complainant had purchased some cocaine from a friend of the friend. The two accused were driving around the strip mall when the altercation occurred. The victim was injured in the right eyebrow and left eye. The second accused, who was driving his mother's car at the time, was also injured. The third accused, the accused's girlfriend, who testified that she was drinking, was the main aggressor. The physical altercation in this case was precipitated by jealousy or by a drug deal gone bad. The actions of the accused were aggressive. The assault was threatening behaviour and the accused said that he felt threatened. The Crown and defence both testified that they were drinking and that they had been drinking. The court found the accused not guilty of the first count on information 24414281. The Court found the second count on Information 24414282. The first count was dismissed on information 24314281 because the accused had not been drinking at the accused’s house. The evidence was that the accused both had been in the middle of a fight and that the complainant was trying to break the back passenger window of the car. The altercation was violent and threatening. The three photographs of the injured parties showed the accused in the street fighting. The defendant was driving the car at a high rate of speed and was yelling at the victim to get out of the way. The driver was driving slowly by the trailer when the assault occurred. He was on top of the victim when the two accused got in the car and punched the victim in the face. The vehicle was then driven away from the trailer. The police were unable to prove that the damage was done to the car or that the driver was injured. HELD: Whether the physical altercation was precipitating by jealousy, by a drugs deal gone good, there was no doubt that the two men were the aggressors throughout. This was threatening and the defendant when he said that the person he felt threatening was the complainant when he told the accused he felt attacked. The injuries were not severe. The other accused was not there to apologize. The defence did not cross-examine on this point. The injured parties were both wearing protective clothing and wearing protective equipment. The alleged altercation was not justified. The assaults were violent and the complainant admitted that she had been involved in the altercation.

2_2011nssc486.txt,"The parties were married almost nine years and have two children, ages eight and 10.  The mother was highly critical of the father's ability to parent, and opposed his application for shared custody. She accused him of abusive behavior, using drugs/abusing alcohol, and claimed he did not help parent when they lived together. The level of conflict between the two was high. Each lived with new partners. They both filed expense statements showing significant monthly deficits but, since they had declared bankruptcy, there was no evidence of how they were meeting the shortfall. The mother sought a share of the father's pension, including his pre-marriage contributions, spousal support and child support. She worked through most of the marriage, but earned a lot less than the father did. Interim shared parenting, with a review in eight months. This is not an ideal arrangement, but the alternatives will leave the children worse off. The father was more credible; the mother's allegations are unsubstantiated. While he's contributed to the conflict in the past, he is making an effort while the mother and her partner are not. The mother will have the final say on health related matters, and the father will have the final say on the choice of childcare and helping with homework (because he is francophone and better able to help). If the mother is unable to learn how to work with the father, the court will consider awarding him custody. On review, the court will consider the parties' ability to communicate and cooperate, including whether or not they are able to agree about extracurricular activities for the children. The father will pay child support in the set-off amount. While he has twice her income, the mother hasn't proven the set-off amount is insufficient to enable her to meet the children's needs while they're with her. It's impossible to have a deficit without disclosing the debt instruments used to support debt accumulation. Her partner is either meeting her shortfall or her expenses are overstated. It would be unfair and unconscionable to award her half of the pre-marriage pension contributions based on the length of the marriage and the fact she wasn't economically dependant on the father. She's not entitled to spousal support. Even if she was, the father has no ability to pay given his obligations to the children.","Family Law – Shared parenting, Shared Parenting, Federal child support, Spousal Support, Divorce Legislation – Section of the Federal Child Support Guidelines – Section 7 The parties were in a shared parenting arrangement and the respondent was the primary care parent. The respondent had been paying a proportionally greater share of the child support than the mother and had not considered the economics of the choice of after school care. The evidence provided by the respondent and his witnesses was credible. The court found that the respondent's evidence concerning the respondent’s involvement in parenting was credible and that the information provided by his witnesses in respect to the respondent had not been proven to be unreliable. The Court held that the evidence did not support the respondent having a significant financial or emotional problem with his or her parenting arrangement. The parties had a common interest in living together and the relationship was sustainable. The father’d been paying the proportionally larger share of child support and the evidence showed that the relationship had not deteriorated. The mother’ll be entitled to counselling from the respondent. The child support table was to come into effect January 1, 2012. The parents were to obtain a date on the docket for a return to this court eight months from the date of this decision for a review to determine whether the conflict between the parties has ceased or at least been substantially reduced. The children were to be in the joint custody of the respondent with the mother. The information provided was credible as well. The applicant’ s income for 2010 was $73,698. The Father’ed income for 2011 was $70,698 and the child was entitled to a monthly credit card payment of $100. The debt payment to the Trustee in Bankruptcy was $100 and the monthly credit-card payment of a $100 was $1,256. The relationship was characterized as a “friction” between the respondent, the respondent father and the mother, and the parties’ relationship was one of mutual respect and respect. The petitioner’S income was not considered. The agreement between the petitioner and the father was that the parties would jointly pay the proportional share of this child support. The fact that the father had been paid the proportionate share of that child support was not a factor in the decision to grant the respondent joint custody. The decision to allow the respondent to continue the children in the care of the mother was not made lightly. The joint custody arrangement was not appropriate.","I have decided that the information provided by the Father and his witnesses, is credible. [11] The Father requests joint custody of the children in a week about shared parenting arrangement. Given that the Father will be paying the proportionally greater share of this expense, and given my expectation he will not place the children in an inadequate care situation, he will have final say on the choice of before and after school care. [27] The parents are to obtain a date on my docket for a return to this court eight months from the date of this decision for a review to determine whether the conflict between the parties has ceased, or at least been substantially reduced, and whether, as a result of that analysis, any change is required to the terms of the order. It is not possible to have a deficit without disclosing debt instruments used to support debt accumulation. In these circumstances I consider it ""unfair and unconscionable"" to equally divide the Father’s premarital pension benefits. But even if she does have “need”, and I have decided she does not, I believe it is useful to complete an analysis of the Father’s ability to pay. 5) The Father is to have final decision making authority concerning the children’s education and choice of child care facility or program. 6) The Mother is to have final decision making authority concerning the children’s regular health care (not including counseling) and dental care.",0.23845007451564829,0.13784764207980654,"The parties were married almost nine years and have two children, ages eight and 10.

The Crown applied under s. 752.1(1) for an order remanding the accused for an assessment by an expert for use as evidence in an application to have the accused declared a dangerous offender. The defence opposed the application on the basis that the predicate offence was not a serious personal injury offence and it was not within the realm of possibility that the accused could be found to be a dangerous offender. The accused was 50 years old. He had a criminal record commencing in 1976 which included 58 Criminal Code convictions. Fifteen of his prior convictions were for violent offences and six related to police officers. He had violated mandatory supervision orders on three separate occasions and had breached a conditional sentence order. The crimes of violence on his record involved the use of a weapon on more then one occasion. The facts of the predicate offence involved swinging a branch at a police officer. The officer had tasered the accused, but it had no effect. The accused grabbed a branch and swung it in sufficient proximity to cause the officer to back up, drop his taser and draw his sidearm. The officer provided a victim impact statement outlining the fear he experienced and the psychological impact the offence had on himself and his family. HELD: The offence is a serious personal injury offence as defined in s. 752. The accused picked up the branch with the intention of using it against the officer and it was of sufficient size that if the accused had struck the officer it would have caused serious damage. The accused's actions were found to have endangered or been likely to endanger the officer's life or safety and to have inflicted or been likely to inflict severe psychological damage.

The accused has demonstrated indifference to the reasonably foreseeable consequences to other persons of his behaviour.

Defence counsel submitted the offence was a serious personal injury offence and the accused did not use violence. The accused had a lengthy criminal record and had 67 prior convictions, four of which were for violent offences. The Crown had alleged that the accused had used violence against the police officer. The court found that the offence is a serious injury offence as defined by s.752. The offence is classified as a serious'serious personal injury' offence as determined by s752(1)(a)(ii) and jurisprudence that has interpreted this section states that a person with a long history of violent or dangerous behaviour is a person who is at a high risk of injury. The offender has a long record of violent and dangerous behaviour and the Crown must prove a substantial degree of indifference on the part of the offender respecting the reasonably foreseeable consequences to other persons of his behaviour. The Court found that given the accused's lengthy criminal history, the Crown's application to remand him for an assessed assessment was not unreasonable. The fact that the Crown had relied on s.713(1(a)(i) and s.705(1)) in its approach to the sentencing of the accused, which was based on the conclusion that the offences were violent and that the offender had a history of violence, the accused was likely to cause serious injury, and the court found the accused to be a dangerous person.

He had violated mandatory supervision orders on three separate occasions and had breached a conditional sentence order. The crimes of violence on his record involved the use of a weapon on more then one occasion. The facts of the predicate offence involved swinging a branch at a police officer. The officer had tasered the accused, but it had no effect. The accused grabbed a branch and swung it in sufficient proximity to cause the officer to back up, drop his taser and draw his sidearm. The officer provided a victim impact statement outlining the fear he experienced and the psychological impact the offence had on himself and his family. HELD: The offence is a serious personal injury offence as defined in s. 752. The accused picked up the branch with the intention of using it against the officer and it was of sufficient size that if the accused had struck the officer it would have caused serious damage. The accused's actions were found to have endangered or been likely to endanger the officer's life or safety and to have inflicted or been likely to inflict severe psychological damage. Given the number and nature of violent offences on the accused's record, the fact that many of the offences involve violence against police officers and the accused's prolonged issues with alcohol, a pattern of behaviour has been established. The best predictor of future behaviour is past behaviour and there is likelihood that the accused will cause injury in the future. The accused has demonstrated indifference to the reasonably foreseeable consequences to other persons of his behaviour. Given the serious nature of the offence and the accused's prior record for similar offences, a sentence of two years or more is possible.  It is not beyond the realm of possibility that the accused could be found to be a dangerous offender. The assessment under s. 752.1 was ordered.","The Crown applied pursuant to s. 752.1(1) of the Code for an order remanding the accused for an assessment performed by an expert for use as evidence in an application to have the accused declared a dangerous offender. Defence counsel submitted the offence was a serious personal injury offence and the accused did not use or attempt to use violence. The weapon was of a size that, as the court noted when giving the decision after trial, there was no doubt that if struck in the head with this object it could cause serious damage.","[2] The Crown has applied, pursuant to s. 752.1(1) of the Code, for an order remanding Mr. Ben for an assessment performed by an expert for use as evidence in an application to have Mr. Ben declared a dangerous offender.

A Board of Inquiry appointed under the Saskatchewan Human Rights Code concluded in 1993 that the appellant's complex impeded physical access to the premises, facilities and services and lacked proper amenities for persons who are wheelchair-reliant. The Board specifically ordered it remained seized of the matter and the hearing would be reconvened to hear further evidence. The Court of Queen's Bench confirmed the Gallery continued to discriminate against disabled members of the public by failing to provide access and accessible services and ordered the appellant to construct or renovate washrooms to meet requirements of the National Building Code of Canada. The Court of Appeal set aside the Queen's Bench decision and restored the Board's decision. During those proceedings, the property was transferred to HKR, which undertook further renovations. In 1997 upon request by the Commission, the Board reconvened and concluded there had not been compliance, which was confirmed by the Court of Queen's Bench. This was not appealed.

The accused was found guilty of driving while having the ability to drive while his blood alcohol content was over the legal limit. The Court found that the accused's evidence raised a reasonable doubt as to his guilt. HELD: The Court held that the evidence was not supported by the evidence. The blood alcohol level was below the legal threshold and the evidence together with the other evidence did not support the accused’s diagnosis of a panic attack. The court found that evidence togetherwith the other factors involving consumption of alcohol and the signs and symptoms of impairment by alcohol did not prove beyond a reasonable limit that the officer’d ability to operating a motor vehicles was impaired. The defence position was that the signs, symptoms of impaired displayed by the accused were the result of a Panic Attack. The evidence did support the officer who testified that he was in the throws of a “panic attack”. The officer who was driving the police vehicle testified that the symptoms of a possible panic attack were the symptoms consistent with a panic assault. The police officer testified that they were focused on impairment by the presence of alcohol because they had been told by their dispatcher that the operator of the two-toned brown Ford pick-up might be drunk. The officers testified that this focus blinded the police from seeing any other possibilities. The test results did not provide a reasonable suspicion as to the accused being in the 'palladium court' as the accused was driving a truck that swerved into the left-hand side of the road more than four times. The breath test was performed to determine whether the accused had a panic disorder. The results of the breath test were negative. The alcohol was not involved in the test results. The tests were negative and the blood alcohol was found to be within the legal definition of a 'possible' panic attack, which is a severe form of alcohol intoxication. The symptoms of the accused when he testified that his panic attack was consistent with one were: a panic, a generalized anxiety disorder (G.A.D.), severe fatigue, shortness of breath, short shortness in breath, and shortnessness of air. The medical evidence did raise a reasonable question as to whether the officer was impaired in any way.

S.100 requires a conviction on an indictable offence involving violence against a person where the maximum sentence available is 10 years imprisonment or more. 3)The maximum sentence for assault under S.266 is 5 years if the Crown proceeds by indictment and 6 months if, as here, the Crown proceeds summarily.","The accused was convicted of an assault contrary to s. 266 of the Criminal Code.

The current support order is based on the father's income of $87,794. His income is considerably higher now. His child support payments are adjusted accordingly.","The respondent father applied to vary an order made May 14, 2002 by Justice M.E. Wright. The order provided for child support payable to the petitioner mother on behalf of the two youngest children, Michael, born March 15, 1990, and Jessica, born December 30, 1991. The parties divorced in 1998. The father decided to move from the west side of Saskatoon to a larger, more expensive apartment in order to accommodate what he understood to be Michael's interest in moving in with him and Jerrilyn, his older sister. Michael began living with his father at least 40% of the time in September 2006. This ended in January or February 2007, which is a period of no more than 5 months. HELD: 1) The parties are responsible for their proportionate share of expenses according to their income. While it is not necessary that there be in all circumstances written or oral, the father's share is 80% of that amount, or $3,408.80, for the s. 7 expenses until further order, or for as long as Michael and Jessica remain children within the meaning of the Act. 2) It is not practical to order the mother produce receipts for reimbursement from the father.","[1] The respondent father applied to vary an order made May 14, 2002 by Justice M.E. Wright. Mills J. directed a trial on the issues of the residence of Michael in 2006; the incomes of the father and mother, for the purposes of the Federal Child Support Guidelines [SOR/97-175, as am.] (the “Guidelines”); and, any s. 7 expenses. I am satisfied that from September 4, 2006 until, approximately, February 22, 2007, the parties shared custody of Michael.

The parties had been divorced for over a year. The father had the use of his mother's vehicle because she was in Viet Nam visiting her husband.

The respondent father's proportionate share of child support was 80% and the mother's was 20%. The father's share of the expenses were to be amortized over two years.

The petitioner seeks joint custody with specified access. The petitioner acknowledges an obligation to pay child support but there is an issue with respect to his income and whether the interim order should be retroactive. The children are ages 3 and 2.HELD: 1) Section 3 of The Children's Law Act 1997 provides for a presumption of joint custody where parents of a child have cohabitated after the birth of the child. That is the situation here. There is nothing in the evidence to rebut that presumption on an interim basis. In making interim orders, the Court tries to disrupt the lives of the children as little as possible. The status quo in this case is represented by the verbal agreement between the parties entered into after their separation. That is the petitioner would have the children every third week during his week off from Saturday to Tuesday. This seems reasonable on an interim basis. This agreement did not address the fact that the petitioner shall be laid off for two months in the spring. It is reasonable that during this period his contact with the children should be increased. The petitioner has not seen the children for 10 months. He will have to be re-introduced to them. A phase in period is required. 2) The petitioner has worked for the same drilling company for about 6 years. His gross income in 2006 was $112,064.

The petitioner attests that $9,600 of his income is a 'living allowance' paid to cover expenses for his truck, fuel, vehicle maintenance and meals and should be deducted from his Line 150 income to arrive at his current income for child support purposes. This is a matter for the trial judge who will have the benefit of the 2006 tax return and notice of assessment and better evidence of the expenses and their purpose and make any retroactive adjustment deemed necessary.

4_2008skqb174.txt,"Accused pleaded guilty at opening of trial to one count of distributing child pornography in the form of written works. The accused was active on a pedophile website and posted 11 stories describing sexual activity between men and infants and pre-teen girls. HELD: Accused received 15 months imprisonment followed by 3 years of probation with addition orders including providing DNA samples and being added to the Sex Offender Registry. The Court accepted that the internet has led to the accelerated proliferation of child pornography, making it an increasing social problem. The social harm of such material is borne almost exclusively by infants and children, the most defenceless members of society. For this reason, denunciation and deterrence are the dominant sentencing principles. The defence submitted that the writings do not actually harm children in their making and, therefore, should not be subject to the same denunciation as pornographic images. The Court rejected this argument because it cannot be assumed that the writings do not stimulate the demand for images and since not all pedophiles are voyeurs only some will act on their desires and anything that stimulates this desire places children at risk in the real world. Aggravating factors in this case were 1) the fact that the accused extolled pedophilia and wrote hard core child pornography and encouraged others to the same. 2) The accused was a high profile contributor to the web site and he remains unrepentant Ã» he does not believe there is anything wrong with writing these stories and only stopped because the law requires it. A conditional sentence would not represent sufficient denunciation or deterrence. Mitigating factors in this case included a lack of criminal record, the guilty plea and the fact that the accused is looking after his elderly mother.","The defendant pled guilty at the opening of trial to distributing child pornography contrary to s. 163.1(3) of the Criminal Code. The defendant had been active on a pedophile website for a while and had written 11 stories. The court found that the defendant had no criminal record and was now serving a social purpose of looking after his ailing mother and ailing father. HELD: The defendant was sentenced to 15 months imprisonment to be followed by a term of probation of 3 years, as well as the additional orders made for his release. The Court found that a conditional sentence would not deter others who might be inclined to engage in the activity of distributing child porn. The sentence was appropriate for a young offender with a relatively high profile. The mitigating factors referred to by the defence were that the accused had no previous criminal record, had no prior criminal record or plea agreement, had been convicted of distributing the material, had a low profile and was not a person who would endanger the community if one were imposed. The sentencing guidelines were met. The accused was sentenced for possession of child pornography and was to spend 15 months in custody. The sentences were set out in the Criminal Law Review. The judge found that there was no evidence that the offences were committed by the defendant. The fact that the probation officer verified his short participation in the program and that he did not plead guilty, along with other material referred to in the Review, did not deter the offender. The probation officer found that he was not an appropriate candidate for programming. The Crown found that it was appropriate to make an order pursuant to s.(1) of s. 490.012(1) requiring the accused to comply with the Sex Offender Information Registration Act, 2004, for a period of 20 years, which is the mandatory time specified in s.(2) for a person convicted of distribution of childpornography. The order was made to allow the accused's submission of a 'haunting story' to be heard by others. The offence was committed against the accused and the accused was convicted of possession of the material. The offences were both serious and were of significant nature. The Criminal Code requires a high profile and a significant risk profile.","Mr. Houston was a high profile

It would be helpful if a more detailed analysis along the lines suggested in R. v. Laberge (1995), 165 A.R. 375 had been given in order to enhance meaningful appellate review. However, this Court is not satisfied the judge failed to properly consider this factor. The Court is satisfied that the limited framework presented by counsel led the judge to err by failing to observe the need for parity in sentence and as a result, the sentence imposed was not similar to sentences imposed on other offenders for similar offences committed in similar circumstances.","The Crown appealed a sentence of 26 months in pre-trial custody and 2 years probation imposed for the manslaughter of a seven-month-old child.

The respondent's acknowledgment of responsibility, her expressions of remorse, her abusive background which may have caused symptoms of PTSD, and her socioeconomic situation all contribute to the offence. 2)The sentencing judge failed to give proper weight to the gravity of the offence and the respondent's moral culpability in it and failed to properly consider this factor. 3)The respondent's dysfunctional upbringing or dysfunctional life was put forth by the Crown as an aggravating factor. The judge asked Crown counsel whether it could in fact be a mitigating factor. Counsel responded whether it was mitigating factor or not. 4)The court found the respondent had a high risk to re-offend and had compelling personal circumstances. 5)The sentence imposed did not adequately address the principles of denunciation and general deterrence. The court found that the respondent was in a position of trust and authority and did not seek immediate help when it was apparent the child was injured. 6)The Court found that a reasonable starting point for a custodial sentence for unlawful act manslaughter is seven years. The sentence imposed was based on the factors set out in R. v. Hathway. The Court also found that sentencing guidelines for adults who kill children do not require a detailed analysis of the factors considered in this case.","Disposition: Allowed On February 11, 2009, the sentencing judge awarded the respondent 26 months credit for 13 months in pre-trial custody and then imposed a sentence of two years less one day to be followed by two years probation.

4_2015skca111.txt,"Family – Child Support – Arrears – Appeal The appellant appealed from the decision of a Queen’s Bench judge ordering him to pay retroactive child support to the respondent in the amount of $21,645. The order indicated that the period in question would include support from January 2009 to August 2012 (see: 2014 SKQB 334). An original support order was issued by consent in 2006. It required that the appellant pay the respondent $1,220 per month in child support and that the parties would exchange their financial information yearly in order to adjust the amount of child support payable. In 2008, the appellant applied to vary the order because he had lost his position and his income was reduced to $1,500 per month. In his affidavit, he swore that his annual income would be $18,000. The application was allowed and the amount of support reduced to $769 per month based upon the judge setting the appellant’s income at $55,000 and directing him to provide his financial information to the respondent each year. One month later in 2009, the appellant regained his former employment position and began earning as much as he had in 2008 but he continued to pay $769 per month without informing the respondent of the change in his circumstances. In February 2011, the respondent served a notice to disclose. The parties met and made an oral agreement that the appellant would pay $950 per month based upon the appellant’s claim that he was still financially strapped and the respondent acquiesced because she was unwilling to engage in further court battles with him. The appellant’s lawyer provided the respondent’s lawyer with financial information that showed that the former was earning a substantially higher income. The respondent also indicated to the appellant that she would forgo about $7,200 in arrears. The terms of the agreement were submitted to the court, without the financial information or the respondent’s forbearance to sue, and a variation order was issued based upon them. In July 2012, the respondent applied to vary the 2008 order and the 2011 variation order claiming arrears from January 2009. Eventually the issue of retroactive child support went to trial. The trial judge found that the appellant had not given the respondent financial information as was required and his failure to inform her of the material change in his circumstances in 2009 constituted blameworthy conduct. The appellant’s income for the years 2009 through 2012 was assessed by the court and the amount of arrears established. The appellant argued that: 1) the trial judge did not have the jurisdiction to vary the 2011 variation order. He maintained that the 2011 order was final and could not be varied on an interim basis; 2) it was necessary to find a material change in circumstances before it could be varied; 3) the respondent had been advised of the change in circumstances; and 4) the trial judge had erred in failing to find unreasonable delay on the part of the respondent.  HELD: The appeal was dismissed. The court held with respect to each issue that: 1) a court can vary an interim or a final order on an interim basis for child support under the authority of ss. 15 and 17 of the Divorce Act. Although it might be necessary in some cases to determine whether an order is final or interim, it was not necessary to do so here because the nature of the terms of the orders in question and the circumstances surrounding the granting of the 2011 variation order. The trial judge had not erred in concluding that he had authority to vary it and to order the appellant to pay arrears before the agreement and compelling him to pay the Guideline amount for the period following it; 2) the terms of the 2011 order left it to a future court to finalize the amount of child support based upon the appellant’s income. Therefore the court retained the power to vary or rescind the order without searching for a change in circumstances; 3) the trial judge’s findings of fact on this point were supported by the evidence; and 4) the trial judge found that the respondent had not received disclosure and thus there had been no unreasonable delay.","The parties agreed to vary the 2011 Variation Order in the amount of $21,645 and costs in the amounts of $1,500. The parties had agreed to fix the 2011 order by varying it in 2012. The respondent applied to the Court of Queen's Bench in May 2011 to vary it by varying the 2011 Order. The court found that the subsequent orders were all variations of the 2006 Consent Child Support Order and each order was made subject to further variation from the court. The Court of Appeal held that the Court could not overturn a decision of a different court dealing with the same lis. Appeal dismissed. The issue on appeal was whether the Court had the jurisdiction to vary a final order on an interim basis for child support. The evidence on appeal suggested that the court drew a clear distinction between interim orders, which can be varied on an ongoing basis as a matter of jurisdiction, and final orders. The courts draw a clear difference between interim and final order. In the case of the respondent, the Court found that he had not been advised of changes to his circumstances. The appellant argued that the respondent erred by misapprehending the facts and failing to find unreasonable delay. The applicant argued that in the area of family support orders, the courts draw the clear distinction from interim orders which can only be varied as a subject matter and final Orders. The appeal court held that in this case the Court was entitled to make a determination on the basis of affidavit evidence. The decision of the Court in May 2012 was also appealed. Appeal denied. The issues on appeal are whether the court has the jurisdiction or not to vary this order. The trial judge drew a distinction between the interim and a final orders and the Court's decision in the case in question was not binding. The order in question is not binding on the respondent.","Appeal dismissed [1] This is an appeal from the decision of Turcotte J. on October 16, 2014, ordering Daniel Prescesky to pay retroactive child support to his former wife, Mandy Lantz, in the amount of $21,645 and costs in the amount of $1,500 (Prescesky v Prescesky, 2014 SKQB 334 (CanLII), 456 Sask R 306 [Prescesky]). Analysis [28] Mr. Prescesky submits that Turcotte J. erred: (i) by varying the 2011 Variation Order, which he submits was a final order issued by consent of the parties in accordance with their prior agreement; (ii) by varying the 2011 Variation Order without first finding a material change in circumstances; (iii) by misapprehending the facts when he found Mr. Prescesky did not advise Ms. Lantz of changes to his circumstances; and (iv) by misapprehending the facts by failing to find unreasonable delay. (a) Did Turcotte J. have the jurisdiction to vary the 2011 Variation Order? (b) Was it necessary to find a material change in circumstances before the 2011 Variation Order could be varied? A. Did Turcotte J. have the jurisdiction to vary the 2011 Variation Order? [35] Second, he argues that in the area of family support orders, the courts draw a clear distinction between interim orders, which can be varied on an interim basis as a matter of jurisdiction, and final orders. Whether the Court can vary an interim or a final order on an interim basis for child support is governed not by common law principles, but by the Divorce Act, RSC 1985, c 3 (2d Supp). [53] I will now turn to consider the nature of the orders in question and the authority that can be invoked to sustain their variation. [72] In short, I conclude that Turcotte J. did not err by concluding he had the authority to vary the 2011 Variation Order and to order Mr. Prescesky to pay arrears arsing before it and compelling him to pay the Guidelines amount for the period following it. B. Was it necessary to find a material change in circumstances before the 2011 Variation Order could be varied? By the terms of the 2011 Variation Order, the parties left to a future court the finalization of the amount of child support based on Mr. Prescesky’s income.  Faced with this state of affairs and these words, the Court of Queen’s Bench retained the power to vary or rescind the order without searching for a change in circumstances. [77] Turcotte J. also found that “there was no unreasonable delay on Mandy’s part in seeking a retroactive review of Daniel’s child support obligation” (para. 48).

The order indicated that the period in question would include support from January 2009 to August 2012 (see: 2014 SKQB 334). An original support order was issued by consent in 2006. It required that the appellant pay the respondent $1,220 per month in child support and that the parties would exchange their financial information yearly in order to adjust the amount of child support payable. In 2008, the appellant applied to vary the order because he had lost his position and his income was reduced to $1,500 per month. In his affidavit, he swore that his annual income would be $18,000. The application was allowed and the amount of support reduced to $769 per month based upon the judge setting the appellant’s income at $55,000 and directing him to provide his financial information to the respondent each year. One month later in 2009, the appellant regained his former employment position and began earning as much as he had in 2008 but he continued to pay $769 per month without informing the respondent of the change in his circumstances. In February 2011, the respondent served a notice to disclose. The parties met and made an oral agreement that the appellant would pay $950 per month based upon the appellant’s claim that he was still financially strapped and the respondent acquiesced because she was unwilling to engage in further court battles with him. The appellant’s lawyer provided the respondent’s lawyer with financial information that showed that the former was earning a substantially higher income. The respondent also indicated to the appellant that she would forgo about $7,200 in arrears. The terms of the agreement were submitted to the court, without the financial information or the respondent’s forbearance to sue, and a variation order was issued based upon them. In July 2012, the respondent applied to vary the 2008 order and the 2011 variation order claiming arrears from January 2009. Eventually the issue of retroactive child support went to trial. The trial judge found that the appellant had not given the respondent financial information as was required and his failure to inform her of the material change in his circumstances in 2009 constituted blameworthy conduct. The appellant’s income for the years 2009 through 2012 was assessed by the court and the amount of arrears established.

The applicant suffered soft tissue injuries to his cervical spine when his vehicle was struck from behind by an uninsured driver. He received a partial income replacement benefit from SGI on the basis he was not able to perform some but not all of his farm duties. HELD: 1)SGI was not entitled to terminate Sawkiw's benefits pursuant to s185(d), (e), (f) or (g). SGI's failure to make a suitable rehabilitation program available to Sawkiw prior to October 1/97 and its failure to reassess his level of income replacement benefits as at September 14 where significant factors contributing to his desperate circumstances. SGI was requiring Sawkiw to attend daily physiotherapy of 3 to 4 hours duration with approximately 2-1/2 hours of additional travel time. It is common knowledge that pain can be exhausting; that daily physiotherapy can be exhausting; that daily travel of 2-1/2 hours can be exhausting; that the physical demands of farming can be exhausting; and, that the mental demands of managing a farm and coordinating and organizing the work of others on a farm can be exhausting. It was far from clear how SGI expected Sawkiw to devote approximately 6 to7 hours per day to his treatment program and still have the mental and physical reserves to devote any time or energy to his farming oprations. He could only reasonably be expected to participate in daily physiotherapy if he was receiving a full, rather than a partial income replacement benefit. 2)The benefits were properly terminated pursuant to s129(1)(e) the first day of his full time employment in Alberta. However, from September 14/97 to the date of termination Sawkiw was entitled to be paid full income replacement benefit without adjustment for a partial return to work. Sawkiw was entitled to the difference and interest from the date such additional benefits should have been paid until the date of this judgment. 3)SGI was to arrange for an assessment by the rehabilitation centre forthwith. If it is found that as a result of the accident Sawkiw is not able to hold the employment he held at the time of the accident, SGI is encouraged to consider his condition as a relapse under s142(1)(a). Under the terms of this judgment the final income replacement benefit will be other than one made pursuant to s139 or 140. 4)Sawkiw was entitled to his solicitor and client costs respecting services rendered and disbursements incurred from the date of filing his notice of motion to the date this judgment is received. He was also entitled to his costs associated with preparing and filing his notice of motion set at $600 being the maximum amount payable under the Personal Injury Benefits Regulations.","The respondent Saskatchewan Government Insurance applied to the court pursuant to s. 197 of the Act for an order setting aside the termination of benefits. The respondent Saskatchewan GIS claimed that the benefits were terminated because the respondent was not able to perform some of his farm duties. The applicant argued that the termination was appropriate because the deceased was not receiving a full income replacement benefit and was now unable to perform his farm work. HELD: The application was set aside. The court found that SGI was not entitled to terminate the benefits pursuant to ss. 185(d), (e), (f) or (g) of the Personal Injury Benefits Regulations. The termination was made pursuant to the provisions of s. 185 of the act. The deceased was a farmer and received a partial income replacement benefits on the basis that he was not being able to do some farm duties and was currently unable to hold employment in Alberta. The Court found that the deceased's injuries were a contributing factor to his continued disability. The defendant was not required under s. 175 of theAct to keep SGI informed of his employment status prior to October 1 and his failure to reassess his level of income replacement assistance benefits as at September 24 were significant factors that contributed to the deceased`s desperate circumstances in October 1997 and resulting conduct in October and thereafter.","[1] David Sawkiw\'s (""Sawkiw"") income replacement

received a partial income replacement benefit from SGI on
the basis that he was not able to perform some but not all
of his farm duties.  As at September 24, 1997 Sawkiw could only
reasonably be expected to participate in daily physiotherapy

to make a suitable rehabilitation program available to
Sawkiw prior to October 1 and its failure to reassess his
level of income replacement benefits as at September 24
were significant factors that contributed to Sawkiw\'s
desperate circumstances in October, 1997 and resulting
conduct on October 1 and thereafter. The court therefore
finds that SGI was not entitled to terminate Sawkiw\'s
benefits pursuant to s. 185(d), (e), (f) or (g). Accordingly, pursuant to s. 198(3)(b), the court
finds that in accordance with s. 129(1)(e) Sawkiw\'s income
replacement benefits are properly terminated effective the
first day of his employment in Alberta. However, for reasons
previously stated, for the period September 24, 1997 to the
date of termination pursuant to s. 129(1)(e) the court finds
that Sawkiw was entitled to be paid a full income
replacement benefit without adjustment for a partial return
to work. SGI shall therefore pay to Sawkiw the difference,
if any, between the amount paid to Sawkiw for the period
September 24 to October 23, 1997 and the amount required to
be paid pursuant this judgment for the period September 24
to the date of Sawkiw\'s commencement of employment in
Alberta. Sawkiw shall also be entitled to interest on such
amount from the date such additional benefits should have
been paid until the date of this judgment. If
it is found that as a result of the accident, Sawkiw is

HELD: The plaintiff was barred from bringing this proceeding because she failed to appeal in time. 1)Section 111 of the Pension Act or s.111 of the Crown Liability and Proceedings Act cannot be read having regard to the authorities to amount to the proposition that having been denied a pension by the government for sexual assault the plaintiff is now barred from bring an action against the government claiming that she is now entitled to pension. 2)The Court held that the rule that recourse to alternative bodies is bar to court actions has been considered by the courts in various contexts and is applicable to the present instance. 3)The plaintiff had not exhausted the grievance procedure provided under the Pensions Act or any other Act and the court would not have jurisdiction as a result of s.18 of the Federal Courts Act. 4)The court found that the Crown must prove facts to bring the case within the ambit of the legislation. The court did not meet that onus.","The Crown, having denied her a pension cannot come forward now and say that she is barred in this action because she is now entitled to a pension when they have already decided otherwise.

The first breach of contract concerned a failure to apply the rotation of truckers described in the arrangement between the city and Truckers Association. The second breach alleged the defendants took too many hours on the total contract. Both matters were tried together. The defendants pleaded there was no privity of contract between the city and plaintiffs, therefore the plaintiffs could not enforce terms agreed to by the city and Triple P. HELD: Both actions were dismissed. 1)The case did not turn on the issue of privity. While the plaintiffs were not actual parties to the contract with the city, certain benefits were intended to pass through the general contract to members of the Truckers Association. 2)There was no contractual obligation in the 1997 agreement which required the defendant to adhere to any particular arrangement on the rotation of work. The contract between the defendants and city was not incorporated by specific or general reference.

HELD: The plaintiff has not strictly complied with the provisions of s. 3(2) of the Act, and the garnishee summons are a nullity.  1) In an application to set aside a pre-judgment garnishee, the court is not to consider potential defences to the action or the existence of triable issues as grounds for setting aside a garnishee summons. 2) The court examined whether or not the affidavit showed, with the required precision, the amount of the debt or liquidated demand. Although there is reference in the statement of claim to an agreement that interest would be paid at 2.0 % per month, compounded monthly, there is no mention of interest in the Operating Agreement. 3) Of more concern is the four-page invoice attached to the affidavit supposedly attached to confirm the amount of the debt owed by the defendant. The invoice is vague and is of no assistance to the court in clarifying the precise amount of the debt owing. Unlike the information provided in the affidavit of Kuznitsoff v.

Appeal dismissed; there was evidence before the trial judge on which he could conclude that it was just that the admissions be withdrawn; with respect to the oppression remedies and the employee's status as a complainant, the wording of the earlier consent order could be interpreted as not suspending his rights as a former shareholder; there was a temporal connection between the impugned acts and his ownership of the shares and he had a sufficient interest in the oppression remedies. The terms the judge imposed were within the broad discretion conferred by the Third Schedule of the Companies Act and there was no breach of natural justice by the imposition of them.","The appellants sought an order permitting them to withdraw the admissions and to add a claim for an “oppression remedy” to the defendant’s counterclaim for alleged misdeeds of the plaintiff. The defendant appealed the order permitting the admissions. HELD: Leave to appeal was granted but the appeal was dismissed. 1)In the circumstances of this case, new counsels need to defend according to counsel's assessment of the facts is a strong reason for concluding it would be unjust to hold the defendants to the admissions in the defence drawn by former counsel. 2)The defendant was only a shareholder from October 1985 to July 1986. There was no agreement or undertaking between the parties. There were real difficulties in characterizing the defendant as a former shareholder. 3)The defendants had retained new counsel who clearly had a different conception of their case. The Barristers’ Society had suspended the defendant in November 2004. 4)A reasonable interpretation of the words used in clause of the consent order was that Mr. Oickle's rights as an existing shareholder were suspended by the consent and not his rights as former shareholder, 5)The court found that the judge erred in permitting the defendant to amend his admissions. The judge did not err in applying the less restrictive test approved in Abacus. A reasonable interpretation was that which was given to them by the judge.","Held: Leave to appeal granted, but appeal dismissed, as per reasons for judgment of Hamilton, J.A.; Mr. Bunnell and the Company appeal the order permitting these alterations to the pleadings.

HELD: There is no remedy of exclusion of the Certificate of Analysis. Accordingly, the accused is guilty of care or control while over .08. The evidence does not prove impairment beyond a reasonable doubt.  1) It is clear from the evidence that the accused's vehicle was inoperable and immovable due to the damage from the accident and its location in the ditch. The defence raised the issue of whether a person can be 'in care or control of a motor vehicle' when there is no risk that the vehicle in question can be put in motion so that it can become dangerous to the public. The Court reviewed the cases. The first person to come upon the accident scene found the accused alone in the vehicle seated in the driver's seat. He saw no visible signs of anyone else at the scene. Upon approaching the vehicle, he observed the accused turn the ignition key to try and start the vehicle. There was no other evidence which established that the 'accused did not occupy that seat for the purpose of setting the vehicle in motion'. The accused has failed to rebut the presumption of care or control under s. 258(1)(a) of the Code and the Court finds that the accused was in 'care or control' of the motor vehicle. 2) Considering the case law and after objectively considering all the indicial of impairment known to the officer, together with the circumstances of the accident itself (which indicate driving error) there can be no doubt the officer had more than reasonable and probable grounds to form the requisite opinion pursuant to s. 254(2) of the Code to make a demand for samples of analysis.  3) The officer was sensitive to the immediate concern of the physical well-being of the accused. Though he may have formed his opinion in the ambulance, he wisely waited until medical personnel had made an initial assessment at the hospital before making any kind of demand. In the circumstances, the Court finds the officer made the demand at the first practical opportunity in relation to the entire investigation. 3) The officer, in coming to his conclusion to make a blood sample demand, considered a number of relevant factors, including time limits to obtain a breath sample, the severity and magnitude of the accident, the potential seriousness of the accused's head and neck injuries, the need for immediate emergency assessment and length of time it would take to treat the accused and keep him under observation. He believed the accused's condition was potentially serious and was completely justified in holding that belief. The evidence has proven the accused required immediate and emergent medical attention which made it obviously impractical to put the accused before a breathalyzer instrument within the time limit fixed by the Code.

All the requirements of s. 254(3) of the Code have been proven beyond a reasonable doubt. 4) The evidence discloses that the police officer made numerous efforts to ensure the accused actually spoke to a lawyer in private. After that, the accused made no further requests whatsoever to further speak to a lawyer. Following the principles set forth by the Saskatchewan Court of Appeal in R. v. Leedahl, 2002 SKCA 5, the evidence clearly establishes the accused was coherent and understood the right to counsel enunciated to him by the police officer.

The evidence does not prove impairment beyond a reasonable doubt.  1) It is clear from the evidence that the accused's vehicle was inoperable and immovable due to the damage from the accident and its location in the ditch. The defence raised the issue of whether a person can be 'in care or control of a motor vehicle' when there is no risk that the vehicle in question can be put in motion so that it can become dangerous to the public. The Court reviewed the cases. The first person to come upon the accident scene found the accused alone in the vehicle seated in the driver's seat. He saw no visible signs of anyone else at the scene. Upon approaching the vehicle, he observed the accused turn the ignition key to try and start the vehicle. There was no other evidence which established that the 'accused did not occupy that seat for the purpose of setting the vehicle in motion'. The accused has failed to rebut the presumption of care or control under s. 258(1)(a) of the Code and the Court finds that the accused was in 'care or control' of the motor vehicle. 2) Considering the case law and after objectively considering all the indicial of impairment known to the officer, together with the circumstances of the accident itself (which indicate driving error) there can be no doubt the officer had more than reasonable and probable grounds to form the requisite opinion pursuant to s. 254(2) of the Code to make a demand for samples of analysis.  3) The officer was sensitive to the immediate concern of the physical well-being of the accused. Though he may have formed his opinion in the ambulance, he wisely waited until medical personnel had made an initial assessment at the hospital before making any kind of demand. In the circumstances, the Court finds the officer made the demand at the first practical opportunity in relation to the entire investigation. 3) The officer, in coming to his conclusion to make a blood sample demand, considered a number of relevant factors, including time limits to obtain a breath sample, the severity and magnitude of the accident, the potential seriousness of the accused's head and neck injuries, the need for immediate emergency assessment and length of time it would take to treat the accused and keep him under observation. He believed the accused's condition was potentially serious and was completely justified in holding that belief. The evidence has proven the accused required immediate and emergent medical attention which made it obviously impractical to put the accused before a breathalyzer instrument within the time limit fixed by the Code. The officer had reasonable and probable grounds to believe that by reason of his physical condition, the accused may be incapable of providing a sample of his breath, or it would be impracticable to obtain a sample of his breath. All the requirements of s. 254(3) of the Code have been proven beyond a reasonable doubt. 4) The evidence discloses that the police officer made numerous efforts to ensure the accused actually spoke to a lawyer in private. After that, the accused made no further requests whatsoever to further speak to a lawyer. Following the principles set forth by the Saskatchewan Court of Appeal in R. v. Leedahl, 2002 SKCA 5, the evidence clearly establishes the accused was coherent and understood the right to counsel enunciated to him by the police officer. He in fact spoke to a lawyer and made no other requests. Further, there was no suggestion that the accused was incapable of understanding his right to counsel or that he was incapable or prevented from acting on his right. To the contrary, the evidence proves the exact opposite. The Court finds the accused has failed to demonstrate his s. 10(b) right to counsel was denied or infringed in any way.","The accused was charged with driving over.08 contrary to s. 255(1) and s. 253(a) of the Criminal Code.

The Crown called all its evidence on the first date and the matter was adjourned over two lengthy adjournments for the purpose of canvassing the possibility of calling an expert in relation to the neurological condition of the accused. Defence raised the possibility the accused may be incapable of providing a sample of his breath or it would be impracticable to put him before a breathalyzer instrument within the time limit fixed by the Code. HELD: The accused was found guilty of both counts. 1)The accused had not rebutted the presumption of care or control under s. 258(1)(a) as envisaged by the Supreme Court of Canada. The evidence established the accused required immediate and emergent medical attention which made it obviously impractical to put the accused before a Breathalyzer. All of the requirements of s. 254(3) had been proven beyond a reasonable doubt.  2)The court found the accused had failed to rebut the presumption that he had reasonable and probable grounds to believe that by reason of his physical condition, the accused was incapable of giving a breath sample, or that he was incapable or prevented from acting on his right. The totality of the evidence would lead any reasonable person to that conclusion. The court found that the accused's s. 10(b) right to counsel was denied or infringed in any way.  3)There was no remedy of exclusion of the Certificate of Analysis, Exhibit P1 in the proceedings.","[1] The accused stands charged as follows:

She asked the Court to continue conditions that prevented him from consuming marijuana less than 8 hours before driving, and required him to consider the boys' wishes regarding access and transportation. The father argued that all restrictions relating to the transport of the children should be removed. The father had MS, and a medical marijuana licence. His driving was evaluated yearly, and the report arising from the latest evaluation did not appear to address his marijuana use. An independent assessment of the children's wishes showed they enjoyed time with their father, but worried about his ability to drive under the influence of marijuana. The unrepresented mother sought costs. Conditions continued; variation granted. If he leaves the HRM, the father is to arrange for public or other transportation. Costs awarded to the mother in the amount of $800. In terms of the driving issue, it was not fair to place the entire burden of the transport issue on the children. The Court was not satisfied from the evidence that the father's marijuana use was benign, and there was also a concern about the symptoms of his MS, especially on long trips. While in the HRM, if the boys became concerned about driving with their father, they could take a bus home or call their mother. If outside of the HRM, it would be more difficult for them to get home. In terms of costs issue, the mother was the successful party. Although she was unrepresented, she did have to take considerable time off work. She was also inconvenienced because the father was late in filing documents, despite having been given clear time-lines by the Court.","The parties were to meet in person on April 3, 2008 to discuss the issues of access and maintenance. The parties had previously signed a variation application in which the applicant sought to have access with his children. The applicant alleged that the applicant refused to provide access and communication with the children. Both parties sought an immediate change to the Corollary Relief Judgment dated April 3/2007. The application alleged that applicant had refused to allow access with the three children and requested that the remaining provisions of the Varied Corollaries Relief Judgment continue in effect and that she receive a cost award. The applicants had previously requested that access be restricted to those that permitted it. The court found that the application was not supported by the evidence and that the court was not satisfied that the appellant's use of marijuana was benign and without potential risk to his children, nor was it in the best interests of the children to ignore these risks or to place the entire responsibility for monitoring their safety on their shoulders.","Ms. Crewe requested a change to the Varied Corollary Relief Judgment dated

I am not satisfied it is in the best interest of Matthew and Mitchell to ignore these risks or to place the entire responsibility for monitoring their safety on their young shoulders.

The complainant is a sex trade worker and was of the view that the accused was prepared to pay for sex. The accused stated that he did not know the complainant was a prostitute and thought she had 'picked him up'.

Upon arriving at the appellant's home, he refused to pay for sex and the complainant refused consensual sex, at which point the appellant forced himself upon her, forcibly restrained her, removed her clothing and touched her body in a sexual manner, choked her and struck her in the face. As she tried to escape, the appellant struck her three times in the back with a baseball bat. The appellant argues there were two problems with the jury charge: 1) that the trial judge should have addressed the jury further with respect to the various types of inconsistencies and contradictions in the complainant's testimony and explained their significance, and 2) the trial judge should have mentioned a number of additional inconsistencies. HELD: Appeal against conviction dismissed. The issues with the jury charge do not give rise to intervention by this Court. While there is a general obligation on the trial judge to instruct the jury by reviewing the evidence and addressing inconsistencies, how the obligation is fulfilled will vary from case to case. There is no absolute formula automatically giving rise to a new trial. Much depends on the context of the whole trial and such things as the nature of the inconsistency and whether it goes to the essence of an element of the offence. The trial judge's charge was entirely correct in the circumstances of this case. Appeal against sentence is allowed and a sentence of 2 years less 1 day is substituted. The sentence imposed by the trial judge was based on a consensus between the crown and defence counsels. Both were of the view that a sentence in the federal system was more appropriate since it would permit the appellant to access sex offender treatment. After sentencing, the appellant, who is an immigrant, was informed that with a sentence of 2 years, he would have no appeal against an order declaring him inadmissible to Canada. If a sentence of less than 2 years is imposed, he will be guaranteed the opportunity to appear personally or by counsel on his appeal of such an order. The jurisprudence supports the proposition that a sentence's unintended effect on immigration status can be a relevant factor on sentence appeal.","The accused was convicted of sexually assaulting the complainant contrary to s. 271 of the Criminal Code and also assaulting her using a weapon, to wit a baseball bat. He was sentenced to two years in a federal penitentiary plus two years probation. He appeals both conviction and sentence. HELD: The appeal against conviction is dismissed. 1) The jurisprudence supports the proposition that a sentence's unintended effect on immigration status can be a relevant factor on a sentence appeal.  2) The Court found that the loss of the appellant's immigration appeal rights is disproportionately severe collateral sanction, which was unforeseen by the appellant and his counsel at the sentencing hearing and apparently unintended by the sentencing judge. 3) The charge that followed two days later was entirely correct to the circumstances of this case. The trial judge stressed the reasonable doubt standard and he concluded his charge with the direction consistent with R. v. W.(D.).","Disposition: Conviction Appeal Dismissed (orally) Sentence Appeal Allowed (orally) [1] Kareem Almajidi was charged with sexually assaulting D.K. contrary to s. 271 of the Criminal Code and also assaulting her, using a weapon, to wit a baseball bat, contrary to s. 267(a) of the Code. He was tried by a jury, which convicted him. He was sentenced to two years in a federal penitentiary plus two years probation. He appeals both conviction and sentence. [10] Secondly, appellant\'s counsel argues that the trial judge should have mentioned these additional inconsistencies or discrepancies: [22] In my respectful view, the charge that followed two days later was entirely correct to the circumstances of this case. [26] For these reasons, the appeal against conviction is dismissed. Apparently, if a sentence of two years less a day is imposed, Mr. Almajidi will be guaranteed the opportunity of appearing personally or having legal counsel represent him on his appeal of such an order. The jurisprudence supports the proposition that a sentence\'s unintended effect on immigration status can be a relevant factor on a sentence appeal. [30] Thus, we would dismiss the appeal from conviction and allow the appeal from sentence. The sentence of two years is set aside, and a sentence of two years less a day imposed in its place.",0.4693333333333333,0.21794871794871792,"The accused was convicted of sexually assaulting the complainant contrary to s. 271 of the Criminal Code and also assaulting her using a weapon, to wit a baseball bat.

The Court found that the allegations were made against the mother of the boys, his ex-wife and child and family counsellor, who were both medical professionals, and that the statements were made with express malice which can be proven by extrinsic or intrinsic evidence. The court found that, on the face of the allegations, the mother had been negligent in the preparation of the reports and had been hired by the father to libel the plaintiffs and wrest custody from the father.","The issues to be decided are:

each of the four reports thus causing damage to their
reputation?


2.Did the co-defendants conspire together to libel the
plaintiffs and wrest custody from the father?


3.Was the co-defendant counsellor incompetent and unqualified

out of court to discredit R.G.H. and W.G.H. so that K.T. could
have the children live with her and restrict access to R.G.H.,

The co-defendants, the mother and counsellor, protested that they were under a duty to report the disclosures of abuse. At issue was whether the publication of four reports was libellous thus causing damage to the plaintiffs' reputations, whether they conspired to libel them in order to obtain custody, and whether the counsellor was incompetent and unqualified to assess and counsel the children and negligent in the preparation of the reports. HELD: Judgment was awarded against the defendants jointly and severally in the amount of $27,000. Aggravated damages of $1,000 was awarded against the mother and $15,000 was awarded against the counsellor and her company.  1)To prove that each defendant published written defamatory statements likely to injure their reputations, three presumptions must be made: the statements were published maliciously (malice in law); the statements were false; and the plaintiffs suffered damages. 2)Every publication of a defamatory statement is a new publication. It is no defence that the mother merely distributed the counsellor's reports. 3)Counsel conceded that the allegations in three of the reports, on their face, were defamatory.  4)The mother enjoyed qualified privilege prima facie because parental duty is so compelling. Two reports containing untrue and degrading allegations were in themselves intrinsic evidence of malice. The long history of the mother's attempts to discredit the plaintiffs was extrinsic evidence of impure motive or malice. The taping of the phone calls was considered to be just another trick to try and advance her cause. 5)The counsellor's reports tendered in court enjoyed absolute privilege but that privilege was lost when she published them to various social workers, the police and the doctors. This is true whether the reports were of an ordinary or expert witness. 6)Both criteria, making a report maliciously and without reasonable grounds, must be satisfied before an action will lie pursuant to s.12 of the Child and Family Services Act. Three reports were slanderous. 7)The conspiracy claim was dismissed. 8)The counsellor had extensive educational background but no clinical training in counselling or interviewing children and 45 sessions were excessive. 9)The counsellor owed a fiduciary duty to the children as their counsellor but owed no corresponding duty to their parents.

6_2000skqb355.txt,"FIAT. The applicants, charged separately, plead not guilty to cultivation and possession of marijuana and sought to have the evidence obtained pursuant to the authorizations for electronic surveillance and search warrant be excluded from trial and requested a stay of proceedings on all charges.  They argued the search warrant, which resulted in the seizure of 365 marijuana plants, should be set aside on the additional grounds police officers allowed two news media camera crews onto the premises to film during the course of the search thereby rendering the search unreasonable pursuant to s.8 of the Charter. The primary ground was that the police did not try any available investigative procedures before applying for a surveillance authorization. As the matter was not urgent s.186(1)(b) of the Criminal Code was not complied with. The Crown objected to the defences' reliance on portions of the preliminary inquiry. The Crown produced an edited copy of the affidavits in support of the electronic and video surveillance warrants wherein all dates and other information were deleted to protect the identity of a principal source of information. HELD: The application for a stay of proceedings was dismissed. The evidence obtained pursuant to the electronic surveillance and the video surveillance warrant were ruled inadmissible at trial. The search warrant respecting the residence was set aside. The seriousness of the charge combined with the real evidence of the 365 marijuana plants outweighed the breach of the Charter s.8 right to be secure from unreasonable search and seizure. The exclusion of the evidence obtained from the search of the premises would bring the administration of justice into disrepute. 1)The portions of the preliminary inquiry transcript were allowed by way of affidavit subject to the right of the Crown to call amplification evidence.  2)The affidavit in support of the authorizations were considered solely on the basis of the edited copies. 3)The affidavit did disclose a current offence. It was not obvious why the Crown edited out the dates. 4)The 1997 authorization was set aside. The search was unreasonable and in breach of s.8 of the Charter. The s.186(1)(b) pre-conditions for granting an authorization were not met. There was no information contained in the affidavit or the amplification evidence which could support an objective standard that other investigative procedures were unlikely to succeed. The impression given the issuing judge was false and misleading. The fact pattern was the reverse of that in Dosch. The information was limited to the existence of a marijuana grow operation on a rural acreage owned by Derksen with whom Begrand-Fast was alleged to be involved. Neither had a criminal record. The boilerplate paragraphs as to why other investigative procedures were unlikely to succeed had no factual basis.  5)The information submitted to establish reasonable and probable grounds was exclusively information obtained from the electronic surveillance authorization. A good faith argument was not available because the information submitted in support of the warrant was tainted by the conduct utilized to obtain the authorization. The evidence obtained was equally a product of a serious infringement of the applicant's s.8 Charter rights because once the tainted evidence was excised for the affidavit in support there was no evidence supporting the issuance of the warrant. The privacy interest was comparatively high. The nature of the constitutional breach was major. The means of obtaining the authorization was misleading because the reasons offered for not conducting a further investigation lacked a factual basis. 6)The residence search warrant was set aside. The affidavit provided no indication of the source of the informer's knowledge. The issuing justice was therefore unable to assess the reliability or the credibility of the information. The fact the source is credible does not mean the information provided is reliable. 7)The seriousness of the breach was not at the high end of the scale. There was an attempt to comply with the Criminal Code and two of the three requirements were met. While good faith was not found with respect to the information offered in support of the electronic authorization, there was nothing in the information presented with respect to the search warrant that lead to a conclusion of bad faith. On balance the administration of justice would not be brought into disrepute with the admissibility of this evidence.  8)The Criminal Code makes no provision to add the names of civilians to a search warrant. The reasoning in R. v. West applied and the search of the Derksen residence was conducted in an unreasonable manner contrary to s.8 of the Charter. A Collins analysis favoured the inclusion of the evidence including the plants. The police were attentive to privacy issues in supervising and restricting the television cameras. The officer set grounds rules that the residence could not be identified in any broadcast. The drug section was not the initiator of inviting the media along. It was coincidence that the corporal did so on a search where the warrant was subsequently held to be invalid. The two events did not amount to a course of conduct. 9)The improper seizure and retention of personal property of the accused was a collateral matter and did not affect the fairness of the trial.","FIAT: The applicants, who are charged with cultivating and possession of marihuana, were scheduled for separate trials this fall before a Judge and a Jury. The accused had brought a Charter motion in advance of jury selection to set aside two provisions of the authorization. The provisions of section 186 CCC 60 day authorization for electronic surveillance primarily directed at their residences and their cell phones. The Crown argued that the authorization for the electronic surveillance should be set aside and as information obtained from the electronic eavesdropping was utilized in obtaining the video surveillance warrant, both of these warrants should also be set off on the basis they are derivative of the electronic authorization which is alleged to be unlawful. HELD: The application for a stay of proceedings was granted. The court found that the provisions of s. 187 of the Code were not admissible. The application was dismissed. The Court held that the court was not obliged to grant leave to allow cross-examination of witnesses with respect to an authorization for surveillance. The order for the authorization to be set set aside was made in light of the fact that the applicant had a large marijuana grow operation and that the police had allowed two news media camera crews onto the premises to film during the search. The applicant sought to have the evidence obtained pursuant to the authorizations and warrant excluded from trial and that it was an appropriate case to direct a stay on all charges against both applicants. The applicants relied on the British Columbia Court of Appeal decision of R. v. West (1998), which held that there was a general rule that all evidence should not be admissible on an application to set-off the authorization, bearing in mind the Crown has the right to call evidence to expand, explain or add to the evidence elicited at the preliminary inquiry. The other objectives referred to in paras. 20 and 21 of the transcript were to have evidence obtained under the authorization and warrant exclude from trial. The applications for a stays of proceedings were to set off the search warrant on the grounds that the applicants had allowed the police to film at the applicant's residence. The last paragraph of the summary judgment judgment judgment was to set the search warrants aside on the ground that they are a derivative of an electronic authorization that is alleged be unlawful and the court found the accused had no criminal record. The paragraphs were to be left to the exercise of the trial judge. The following paragraphs were edited to make them more palatable to the applicant. The paragraph on the third paragraph was to be used as an example of how to use the third paragraphs.","As is the practice in this jurisdiction, defence counsel have brought a Charter motion in advance of jury selection to set aside: (1) A section 186 CCC 60 day authorization for electronic surveillance on each accused dated January 30, 1997 primarily directed at their residences and their cell phones. (2) A section 487.01(4) 9 day video surveillance authorization dated March 19, 1997 for the residence of the applicant Derksen authorizing the observance of the applicant Begrand-Fast. (3) A search warrant to search the residence of the applicant Derksen dated April 1, 1997 which resulted in the seizure of 365 marihuana plants and led to the present charges. The applicants seek to have the evidence obtained pursuant to the authorizations and warrant excluded from trial, and state it is also an appropriate case to direct a stay of proceedings on all charges against both applicants. As a result, the boilerplate paragraphs offered on why other investigative procedures were unlikely to succeed had or have no factual basis. In the end result, the applicant’s have satisfied the burden of proof on the balance of probabilities that the pre-conditions for the granting of an authorization set out in s. 186(1)(b) were not met. As a result the authorization dated January 30, 1997 is set aside. [28] The interceptions which occurred pursuant to the authorization of January 30, 1997 constituted a search and seizure within the meaning of s. 8 of the Charter, and as the search was not authorized by law the search was unreasonable and in breach of that section (Vide: R. v. Garofoli, supra, per Sopinka J. at p. 187). The video surveillance warrant therefore must be set aside. A good faith argument is not available because the information submitted in support of the warrant was tainted by the conduct utilized to obtain the electronic surveillance authorization. The evidence obtained is equally a product of a serious infringement of the applicant’s s. 8 Charter rights because once the tainted evidence was excised from the affidavit in support there was no evidence supporting the issuance of the warrant. The means of obtaining the authorization was misleading because the reasons offered for not conducting a further investigation lacked a factual basis. I conclude it is more likely than not the administration of justice would be brought into disrepute. [44] The evidence obtained pursuant to the electronic surveillance authorization and the video surveillance warrant is ruled inadmissible at trial. One associate is a, who has also been in marihuana cultivation for years. [54] The absence of compellable detail of the alleged offence and the absence of the source of the informer’s knowledge means the information supplied for the Derksen search warrant did not provide a basis for the issuing justice of the peace to conclude reasonable and probable grounds existed for the issuance of the warrant, and the warrant must be set aside. [57] I do not consider the seriousness of the breach in this case to be at the high end of the scale. While good faith was not found with respect to the information offered in support of the electronic authorization, there is nothing in the information presented with respect to the search warrant that leads to a conclusion of bad faith in applying for the search warrant. As a result, on balance I conclude the administration of justice would not be brought into disrepute with the admissibility of this evidence. [67] In the end result, the seriousness of the charge combined with the real evidence of the marihuana plants obtained, which is crucial to any successful prosecution of Mr. Derksen, outweighs the breach of his s. 8 Charter rights to be secure from unreasonable search and seizure. I conclude it is more likely than not that exclusion of the evidence obtained from the search of his premises would bring the administration of justice into disrepute. With respect to the improper seizure and retention of personal property of the accused, this is a collateral matter and does not affect the fairness of the trial. The application for a stay of proceedings is dismissed.",0.22415291051259773,0.20417287630402384,"FIAT. The applicants, charged separately, plead not guilty to cultivation and possession of marijuana and sought to have the evidence obtained pursuant to the authorizations for electronic surveillance and search warrant be excluded from trial and requested a stay of proceedings on all charges.  They argued the search warrant, which resulted in the seizure of 365 marijuana plants, should be set aside on the additional grounds police officers allowed two news media camera crews onto the premises to film during the course of the search thereby rendering the search unreasonable pursuant to s.8 of the Charter. The primary ground was that the police did not try any available investigative procedures before applying for a surveillance authorization. As the matter was not urgent s.186(1)(b) of the Criminal Code was not complied with. The Crown objected to the defences' reliance on portions of the preliminary inquiry. The Crown produced an edited copy of the affidavits in support of the electronic and video surveillance warrants wherein all dates and other information were deleted to protect the identity of a principal source of information. HELD: The application for a stay of proceedings was dismissed. The evidence obtained pursuant to the electronic surveillance and the video surveillance warrant were ruled inadmissible at trial. The search warrant respecting the residence was set aside. The seriousness of the charge combined with the real evidence of the 365 marijuana plants outweighed the breach of the Charter s.8 right to be secure from unreasonable search and seizure. The exclusion of the evidence obtained from the search of the premises would bring the administration of justice into disrepute. 1)The portions of the preliminary inquiry transcript were allowed by way of affidavit subject to the right of the Crown to call amplification evidence.  2)The affidavit in support of the authorizations were considered solely on the basis of the edited copies. 3)The affidavit did disclose a current offence. It was not obvious why the Crown edited out the dates. 4)The 1997 authorization was set aside. The search was unreasonable and in breach of s.8 of the Charter. The s.186(1)(b) pre-conditions for granting an authorization were not met. There was no information contained in the affidavit or the amplification evidence which could support an objective standard that other investigative procedures were unlikely to succeed. The impression given the issuing judge was false and misleading. The fact pattern was the reverse of that in Dosch. The information was limited to the existence of a marijuana grow operation on a rural acreage owned by Derksen with whom Begrand-Fast was alleged to be involved. Neither had a criminal record. The boilerplate paragraphs as to why other investigative procedures were unlikely to succeed had no factual basis.  5)The information submitted to establish reasonable and probable grounds was exclusively information obtained from the electronic surveillance authorization. A good faith argument was not available because the information submitted in support of the warrant was tainted by the conduct utilized to obtain the authorization. The evidence obtained was equally a product of a serious infringement of the applicant's s.8 Charter rights because once the tainted evidence was excised for the affidavit in support there was no evidence supporting the issuance of the warrant. The privacy interest was comparatively high. The nature of the constitutional breach was major. The means of obtaining the authorization was misleading because the reasons offered for not conducting a further investigation lacked a factual basis. 6)The residence search warrant was set aside. The affidavit provided no indication of the source of the informer's knowledge. The issuing justice was therefore unable to assess the reliability or the credibility of the information. The fact the source is credible does not mean the information provided is reliable. 7)The seriousness of the breach was not at the high end of the scale. There was an attempt to comply with the Criminal Code and two of the three requirements were met. While good faith was not found with respect to the information offered in support of the electronic authorization, there was nothing in the information presented with respect to the search warrant that lead to a conclusion of bad faith. On balance the administration of justice would not be brought into disrepute with the admissibility of this evidence.  8)The Criminal Code makes no provision to add the names of civilians to a search warrant. The reasoning in R. v. West applied and the search of the Derksen residence was conducted in an unreasonable manner contrary to s.8 of the Charter. A Collins analysis favoured the inclusion of the evidence including the plants. The police were attentive to privacy issues in supervising and restricting the television cameras. The officer set grounds rules that the residence could not be identified in any broadcast. The drug section was not the initiator of inviting the media along. It was coincidence that the corporal did so on a search where the warrant was subsequently held to be invalid. The two events did not amount to a course of conduct. 9)The improper seizure and retention of personal property of the accused was a collateral matter and did not affect the fairness of the trial.","FIAT: As is the practice in this jurisdiction, defence counsel brought a Charter motion in advance of jury selection to set aside two items of evidence.

The exclusion of the evidence obtained from the search of the premises would bring the administration of justice into disrepute. 1)The portions of the preliminary inquiry transcript were allowed by way of affidavit subject to the right of the Crown to call amplification evidence.  2)The affidavit in support of the authorizations were considered solely on the basis of the edited copies. 3)The affidavit did disclose a current offence. It was not obvious why the Crown edited out the dates. 4)The 1997 authorization was set aside. The search was unreasonable and in breach of s.8 of the Charter. The s.186(1)(b) pre-conditions for granting an authorization were not met. There was no information contained in the affidavit or the amplification evidence which could support an objective standard that other investigative procedures were unlikely to succeed. The impression given the issuing judge was false and misleading. The fact pattern was the reverse of that in Dosch. The information was limited to the existence of a marijuana grow operation on a rural acreage owned by Derksen with whom Begrand-Fast was alleged to be involved. Neither had a criminal record. The boilerplate paragraphs as to why other investigative procedures were unlikely to succeed had no factual basis.  5)The information submitted to establish reasonable and probable grounds was exclusively information obtained from the electronic surveillance authorization. A good faith argument was not available because the information submitted in support of the warrant was tainted by the conduct utilized to obtain the authorization. The evidence obtained was equally a product of a serious infringement of the applicant's s.8 Charter rights because once the tainted evidence was excised for the affidavit in support there was no evidence supporting the issuance of the warrant. The privacy interest was comparatively high. The nature of the constitutional breach was major. The means of obtaining the authorization was misleading because the reasons offered for not conducting a further investigation lacked a factual basis. 6)The residence search warrant was set aside. The affidavit provided no indication of the source of the informer's knowledge. The issuing justice was therefore unable to assess the reliability or the credibility of the information. The fact the source is credible does not mean the information provided is reliable. 7)The seriousness of the breach was not at the high end of the scale. There was an attempt to comply with the Criminal Code and two of the three requirements were met. While good faith was not found with respect to the information offered in support of the electronic authorization, there was nothing in the information presented with respect to the search warrant that lead to a conclusion of bad faith. On balance the administration of justice would not be brought into disrepute with the admissibility of this evidence.  8)The Criminal Code makes no provision to add the names of civilians to a search warrant. The reasoning in R. v. West applied and the search of the Derksen residence was conducted in an unreasonable manner contrary to s.8 of the Charter. A Collins analysis favoured the inclusion of the evidence including the plants. The police were attentive to privacy issues in supervising and restricting the television cameras. The officer set grounds rules that the residence could not be identified in any broadcast. The drug section was not the initiator of inviting the media along. It was coincidence that the corporal did so on a search where the warrant was subsequently held to be invalid. The two events did not amount to a course of conduct. 9)The improper seizure and retention of personal property of the accused was a collateral matter and did not affect the fairness of the trial.","FIAT: As is the practice in this jurisdiction, defence counsel brought a Charter motion in advance of jury selection to set aside: (1) a section 186 CCC 60 day authorization for electronic surveillance on each accused dated January 30, 1997 primarily directed at their residences and their cell phones; (2) a 9 day video surveillance authorization dated March 19, 1997 authorizing the observance of the applicant Begrand-Fast; and (3) a search warrant to search the applicant Derksen authorizing the entry of 365 marihuana plants. HELD: The application for a stay of proceedings was granted and the evidence obtained pursuant to the authorizations and warrant was excluded from trial. The court held that evidence tendered at this hearing is part of the trial evidence and as such should be tendered viva voce, and in any event evidence given at the preliminary inquiry should not be used as trial evidence in the absence of any of the exceptions justifying admission of preliminary inquiry evidence.","As is the practice in this jurisdiction, defence counsel have brought a Charter motion in advance of jury selection to set aside: (1) A section 186 CCC 60 day authorization for electronic surveillance on each accused dated January 30, 1997 primarily directed at their residences and their cell phones. (2) A section 487.01(4) 9 day video surveillance authorization dated March 19, 1997 for the residence of the applicant Derksen authorizing the observance of the applicant Begrand-Fast. (3) A search warrant to search the residence of the applicant Derksen dated April 1, 1997 which resulted in the seizure of 365 marihuana plants and led to the present charges. The applicants seek to have the evidence obtained pursuant to the authorizations and warrant excluded from trial, and state it is also an appropriate case to direct a stay of proceedings on all charges against both applicants. As a result, the boilerplate paragraphs offered on why other investigative procedures were unlikely to succeed had or have no factual basis. In the end result, the applicant’s have satisfied the burden of proof on the balance of probabilities that the pre-conditions for the granting of an authorization set out in s. 186(1)(b) were not met. As a result the authorization dated January 30, 1997 is set aside. [28] The interceptions which occurred pursuant to the authorization of January 30, 1997 constituted a search and seizure within the meaning of s. 8 of the Charter, and as the search was not authorized by law the search was unreasonable and in breach of that section (Vide: R. v. Garofoli, supra, per Sopinka J. at p. 187). The video surveillance warrant therefore must be set aside. A good faith argument is not available because the information submitted in support of the warrant was tainted by the conduct utilized to obtain the electronic surveillance authorization. The evidence obtained is equally a product of a serious infringement of the applicant’s s. 8 Charter rights because once the tainted evidence was excised from the affidavit in support there was no evidence supporting the issuance of the warrant. The means of obtaining the authorization was misleading because the reasons offered for not conducting a further investigation lacked a factual basis. I conclude it is more likely than not the administration of justice would be brought into disrepute. [44] The evidence obtained pursuant to the electronic surveillance authorization and the video surveillance warrant is ruled inadmissible at trial. One associate is a, who has also been in marihuana cultivation for years. [54] The absence of compellable detail of the alleged offence and the absence of the source of the informer’s knowledge means the information supplied for the Derksen search warrant did not provide a basis for the issuing justice of the peace to conclude reasonable and probable grounds existed for the issuance of the warrant, and the warrant must be set aside. [57] I do not consider the seriousness of the breach in this case to be at the high end of the scale. While good faith was not found with respect to the information offered in support of the electronic authorization, there is nothing in the information presented with respect to the search warrant that leads to a conclusion of bad faith in applying for the search warrant. As a result, on balance I conclude the administration of justice would not be brought into disrepute with the admissibility of this evidence. [67] In the end result, the seriousness of the charge combined with the real evidence of the marihuana plants obtained, which is crucial to any successful prosecution of Mr. Derksen, outweighs the breach of his s. 8 Charter rights to be secure from unreasonable search and seizure. I conclude it is more likely than not that exclusion of the evidence obtained from the search of his premises would bring the administration of justice into disrepute. With respect to the improper seizure and retention of personal property of the accused, this is a collateral matter and does not affect the fairness of the trial. The application for a stay of proceedings is dismissed.",0.2491186839012926,0.09021113243761995,"FIAT: As is the practice in this jurisdiction, defence counsel brought a Charter motion in advance of jury selection to set aside two items of evidence. A section 186 CCC 60 day authorization for electronic surveillance on each accused dated January 30, 1997 primarily directed at their residences and their cell phones. HELD: 1) A section 487.01(4) 9 day video surveillance authorization dated March 19, 1997 for the residence of the applicant Derksen authorizing the observance of the accused Begrand-Fast. 2) A search warrant to search the applicant's residence dated April 1, 1997 which resulted in the seizure of 365 marihuana plants and led to the present charges. 3) Summary judgment in R. v. Dawson (1998), 123 C.C. (3d) 385 ruled that a preliminary inquiry judge does have the right to grant leave to allow cross-examination of witnesses with respect to an authorization for surveillance using the same criteria set out by Sopinka J. (1990), 1990 CanLII 52 (SCC), 60 C.A.C.(3d), 161 (S.C.) at p. 198. 4) The Crown sought to have the evidence obtained pursuant to the authorizations and warrant excluded from trial, and state it is also an appropriate case to direct a stay of proceedings on all charges against both applicants. 5) The application for a 60 day electronic surveillance authorization granted in support of the authorization in the Dosch case was granted in 1997. The Crown relied on the British Columbia Court of Appeal decision of R v. West (1998). 6) In general terms it is the position of the applicants that the authorization of electronic surveillance should be set aside, and as information obtained from the electronic surveillance was utilized in obtaining the video surveillance warrant and the subsequent search warrant both of these warrants were derivative of the electronic authorization which is alleged to be unlawful.",0.1528127623845508

I mentioned during the opening of this appeal that members of the panel had followed the usual practice of carefully reviewing the trial record and written arguments before this hearing.[2] We are all of the view that there is no basis to interfere with the decision of Mr. Justice Smith. As his extensive reasons for decision disclose he addressed the matter thoroughly. [3] This was a difficult case in which the trial judge was required to carefully address the competing claims for custody, but mindful of the 'best interests of the child'. Throughout the trial and in his reasons the learned trial judge focussed on this predominant issue. And in our view he addressed it as required by law. [4] We cannot say that the learned trial judge erred in any material respect when weighing and considering the evidence. Since the parties were unable to resolve the issues to their mutual satisfaction, it fell to the trial judge to make a 'hard choice'. He had the distinct advantage, that we do not have, of seeing and hearing the parties and being able to form an impression of them. [5] We dismiss this appeal with costs on double Column 5. [6] We cannot part from this appeal without noting the acrimonious history of litigation concerning custody and access. The welfare of [B.E.] would be better served by a spirit of compromise. The time, energy and expenses incurred in protracted litigation could be put to better use in advancing the welfare of this young child.","The respondent appealed. HELD: The appeal was dismissed.

6_2005nsca65.txt,"Following the close of the Crown's case on a trial of several weapons related offences, the defence moved for a directed verdict on the basis that there was no evidence that the offences occurred on the date alleged in the Information. The Crown sought to amend the Information to change the date of the offences. Without ruling on the motion to amend, the trial judge granted the motion for a directed verdict. The Crown appealed. Appeal allowed; acquittals set aside; new trial ordered. The directed verdict should not have been granted as, in this case, the date of the offences was not an essential element of the offences. If the directed verdict was not based on the discrepancy with the date, than the appeal would have to be allowed on the basis that the trial judge gave insufficient reasons which prejudiced the Crown's right of appeal.","The Crown appeals from acquittals entered by Judge Sherar of the Provincial Court on five charges relating to the possession and storage of prohibited weapons. The Information alleged that the accused was a resident of the home where the firearms were found, that he was subject to an order prohibiting possession of firearms and that he had stolen two sawed off shotguns. The accused argued that the trial judge erred in allowing the motion for directed verdict even in absence of an amendment and that the date of the offence was not the only insufficiency.

The petitioner and respondent have joint custody of the child. They agreed to an order of joint custody with the child primarily residing with the petitioner. The respondent opposes the move.

Based on the loss of Harley as an active co-parent coupled with Charlene's vague and uncertain plans for the child's care in Edmonton, what is an appropriate access schedule for the respondent to have with the applicant. The Court has not decided on the best interests of the applicant or the child, but the court has determined that the best interest of the respondent is that the child be allowed to move to Edmonton with the assistance of the court. The applicant has no vehicle or driver's licence so relies on the Saskatoon Transit Service for her transportation. The application judge's misapprehension of the existing parenting arrangement has significant consequences for the applicant and the child in the circumstances. The issues are as follows: 1)Is it in the best Interest of the appellant to relocate from Saskatoon to Edmonton? 2)Is the child to move with the appellant? 3)Is there an appropriate relationship with the access parent? 4)The court has not determined the best relationship with respect to the child or the parenting arrangement. The best interests are the child and the parenting relationship is the best one. The relationship is only relevant in the exceptional case where it impacts on that parent's ability to meet the child’s needs. The most precise test would risk sacrificing the child if it was in the childs best interests to expediency and certainty. The more precise test is to find out what is in the interests of a parent when the child is moving to Edmonton, and what is the ideal access schedule. The evidence is that there is a significant bond between the respondent and the applicant that would be lost if the child were allowed to relocate to Edmonton and the court is concerned about the vagueness, uncertainty, and speculative nature of the proposed move. The fact that the respondent has a significant family in Saskatoon and has taken a year off from further studies and is working part-time, which would result in a significant distance from the applicant’ s parents. The parties have filed their respective income information and will make the requisite child support order based on the evidence.","Charlene wishes to move with Keeler from Saskatoon to Edmonton and Harley is opposed to such a move.

6_2007nssc119.txt,"Two teenaged children were placed in the care of the father, who resided in Alberta, under the joint supervision of the Nova Scotia and Alberta agencies. Unknown to the court, the father's common law partner had an extensive child protection history. There were significant problems in the father's home, resulting in the older child removing herself from her father's care and going to live with an adult relative who also had a child protection history and the younger child disappearing for a time until the mother, who lived in Nova Scotia, finally tracked him down. The mother now sought the return of both children. The Nova Scotia agency sought to have its involvement terminated, arguing that both children were now old enough to self-protect. Although the younger child wished to return to the mother, the older child threatened to run away if removed from her current living situation. Children removed from the supervised care of the father and placed in the temporary care of the Nova Scotia agency with access to the mother and services to be provided to the mother and the children; the agency misled both the mother and the court by failing to disclose crucial information about the father's common law partner and the circumstances of the children once they were placed with the father and this failure was both inexplicable and inexcusable; costs are the appropriate remedy against the agency. Although the mother had completed some counseling, there was a substantial risk that both children would suffer physical harm if returned to her care due to her inability to supervise and protect them adequately. The mother continued to require professional intervention.","The court reviewed the files of the respondents' children. The court found that the Agency failed to disclose relevant information to the court and to the Court. The Court ordered an out of province courtesy Supervision Order from Cape Breton-Victoria. The children were placed in the supervised care of the Agency's parent, who was no longer in the Agency’s care. The Agency requested that the children be placed in a home with the partner, who had recently moved to Nova Scotia. The parties also requested that a supervised placement be made for the children, who were now in the adult care of their father, who now lived with his sister. The agency also requested an order dismissing the Nova Scotia proceedings. The child protection concerns were more of concern for small children, and the Agency did not approve of the children’ placement with the common law partner. The mother had been placed with the child’d sister, who lived with the father. The father had been in the agency’ s home for three years and had moved to Alberta. The sister had been living with the mother for three months. The parents had moved from Nova Scotia to Nova Scotia and the children had been separated from their father. When the father moved to the new home, the sister became increasingly frustrated and the father had made arrangements for her to live with him. The two children had moved in with the other sister. When they moved to Edmonton, the Agency had no contact with the sister and the sister had refused to allow the sister to live in the home with her. The siblings had been involved in a rocky common law relationship between 1985 and 1995. The relationship deteriorated over time and the mother became increasingly isolated from the children. She became increasingly concerned that the father was planning to enter residential treatment for substance abuse and the siblings were not accepting services. The Minister of Children and Family Services requested an investigation by the Agency. The Children’S Aid Society of Cape Bretea had been contacted by the Minister of Child and Family Affairs and the Minister had requested an inquiry by the RCMP. The RCMP had advised the Agency that the child had been moved to a new home and that the agency was working with the children to find a suitable home for the child. The applicant had also requested a home assessment. The information concerning the children was not disclosed to the Agency until May 2005. The Department of Children‘s Services had received a letter from the Agency in February 2006. The letter stated that the mother had moved into the new residence with the three children.","[1] The matter before me for determination concerns the disposition review involving the respondents’ children, K.B. born [in 1990] and C.B. born [in 1993].

Trecroce, supra, on the basis that the accused suffered from delusions so pervasive and irrational that he was unable to reason on higher cognitive levels, because of his lack of abstraction, and because of being 'locked in his delusional system.' 4) The limitation of cognitive capacity tests in Canada is a very low threshold for fitness. The test is not intended to displace the presumption of innocence to which he remains entitled. The real question to be determined in this case is whether the learned trial judge erred in holding that, although the appellant can communicate with his own defence, he is unable to exercise analytical reasoning in making a choice to accept the advice of counsel or in coming to a decision that best serves his own interests. 5) Given the respondent’s limited capacity, it is not necessary that he be capable of recounting the facts of the alleged crimes and that he has sufficient mental fitness to participate in the proceedings in a meaningful way. 6) The test of “limited cognitive capacity” for determining fitness is not a test to be applied in keeping with the policy objectives of the Criminal Code and, in particular, with the right of the accused to make full answer and defence to the allegations with which he is charged.","Disposition: Appeal allowed Smith J.A.

He is 22 years old and suffers from fetal alcohol spectrum disorder, attention deficit disorder and substance abuse. He was diagnosed as mildly mentally retarded and is considered incapable of handling the responsibilities that would enable him to live independently and will always need a protected living environment and sheltered employment. He was found unfit to stand trial on some previous property offences and is still under the supervision of the Provincial Review Board. The trial judge was satisfied that the accused met the first two criteria for fitness to stand trial Ã» he understood the nature of the charges against him and the possible consequences of being found guilty and he understood the difference between a guilty and not guilty plea. The focus of the decision was whether the accused had the capacity to communicate with counsel. The judge found that the accused would not be able to provide instruction to counsel during the trial process due in part to the fact that he is very distractable and could not sufficiently follow court proceedings to instruct counsel.

The trial judge applied too stringent a test on concluding that the accused was unfit to stand trial and when the proper test is applied, it is apparent that the accused has the capacity to instruct counsel within the meaning of the Code. The trial judge's concern about the accused's distractable nature does not accord with the limited cognitive capacity test. The Courts have applied a test of 'limited cognitive capacity' for determining fitness. This test requires that, with respect to communicating to counsel, the accused is only required to be capable of recounting the fact of the alleged crimes. Limited cognitive capacity does not require analytic ability or the need for the accused to appreciate his own best interests.

The Crown submits that the trial judge misapprehended the evidence, misstated the evidence and applied the wrong legal test for fitness, apply the wrong burden of proof and made a finding that was unreasonable and not supported by the evidence. HELD: Appeal allowed. 1) The limited cognitive capacity test is correct in Canadian criminal law. It requires only that an accused be capable of recounting the facts of the alleged crimes and that he is able to appreciate his own best interests. 2) The test of 'limited cognitive capacity' for determining fitness is a very low threshold for fitness in keeping with the policy objectives of the Criminal Code and, in particular, with the right of the accused to make a full answer and defence to the allegations with which he is charged. It is not necessary that the accused be able to reason on higher cognitive levels, because of his lack of abstraction, and because of being 'locked in his delusional system.' 3) There are strong interests, both public and personal, in an accused being fit to proceed to trial. A person who is found not guilty by reason of a mental disorder is presumed to be fit to be tried. However, a person who suffers from a severe mental disorder (e.g. schizophrenia, attention deficit disorder, or ADD) may be excluded from the trial. 4) The respondent has not been convicted in relation to any of the allegations. The real question to be determined in this case is whether the learned trial judge erred in holding that, although the appellant can communicate with counsel in a manner that would be in his best interests, he would be unable to exercise analytical reasoning in coming to a decision that best serves his own interests. 5) There is a strong interest in ensuring that persons suffering from a mental disability are able to follow and understand the nature and functions of the persons involved in them. The trial judge was correct in distinguishing R. v. Trecroce, supra, on the basis that he understood the nature of the offences and the possible consequences of them. He was also correct in concluding that the appellant could not make rational decisions beneficial to him. 6) The limitation of the capacity test strikes an effective balance between the objectives of fitness rules and the constitutional right of an accused to choose his own defence and to have trial within a reasonable time.

[41] The Crown has satisfied the court that this offence is an offence to which s. 109 of the Criminal Code applies and therefore a mandatory prohibition order shall issue prohibiting S.C. from possessing any firearm, cross-bow, prohibited weapon, restricted weapon, prohibited device, ammunition, prohibited ammunition and explosive substance during the period of 10 years after his release from prison. [42] A further order shall issue pursuant to s. 487.051(2) of the Criminal Code authorizing and ordering you to provide sufficient samples of your bodily substances so that a DNA analysis may be conducted. The court further orders, pursuant to s. 487.012 of the Criminal Code, that S.C. comply with the Sex Offender Information Registration Act, S.C. 2004, c. 10, the length of such order to continue for 20 years. An order will therefore issue pursuant to s. 161(1)(b) prohibiting S.C. from seeking, obtaining or continuing any employment, whether or not the employment is remunerated, or becoming or being a volunteer in a capacity, that involves being in a position of trust or authority towards persons under the age of 14 years.",0.30570902394106814,0.26849315068493146,"The accused was found guilty of a charge of sexual interference contrary to s. 151(1) of the Criminal Code. The accused had been in a residential school for three and one-half years and had been previously convicted of sexual assault. He had been living with his step-grandmother for 10 years. The court ordered that he be placed on probation for 10 year and ordered to provide sufficient samples of his bodily substances so that a DNA analysis could be conducted. The Court also ordered that the accused comply with the Sex Offender Information Registration Act and a Sex Offenders Registration Act. HELD: The Court found that the sentence imposed was for a term of 9 months to be served in a correctional institute. The length of the sentence was determined to be years less than the current term of imprisonment. The Crown requested an order be made pursuant to s718.01 of the Code prohibiting the accused from engaging in certain employment involving positions of trust or authority towards persons under the age of 14 years and prohibiting him from attending certain places as provided for by s. 161(1)(b) of Canada.

6_2009skqb394.txt,"The plaintiff bought a house. She used the services of Cecilia Mui, a realtor associated with the defendant 100% Realty Associates Ltd. operating as Re/max Saskatoon. The house was purchased from the defendants Edward and Verl Karpinski. The vendors' realtor was the defendant, Mario Jacobucci, owner of the defendant Trevi Holdings Ltd. The house did not meet the plaintiff's expectations. She now sues the defendants seeking recovery of damages for alleged latent defects. She claims Ms. Mui fell below the standard of care required of a realtor representing a purchaser. She claims Ms. Mui was negligent in misrepresenting certain facts and breached the fiduciary duty expected of her. The plaintiff claims the Karpinskis misrepresented facts to her, negligently and fraudulently. The plaintiff claims that Mr. Jacobucci and his company are liable to her in damages, both in negligence and as parties to the misrepresentations made by the vendors. Special and general damages are claimed as are aggravated damages and punitive damages. The trial took place over 22 days, spanning several years and included testimony from 14 witnesses. Two main issues are raised. The first is the liability of each of the defendants. The second issue is quantum of damages. The credibility of the parties is at the forefront of the determination of the issues. HELD: The vendors are liable to the plaintiff for breach of contract. Each of the defendants is a tortfeasor, each having breached an obligation or duty owed to the plaintiff, whether through negligence or misrepresentation. Their wrongful acts and omissions all contributed to the same damage. In that respect their liability is concurrent. The liability of the vendors and Mr. Jacobucci is joint, and that of Ms. Mui is several. As concurrent torfeasors, the fault for the damage shall be apportioned equally among the four of them.  1) Credibility is not a science, see R. v. Gagnon, 2006 SCC 17. It is not always possible to articulate with precision the complex intermingling of impressions that emerge after watching and listening to witnesses and attempting to reconcile the various versions of events. The principles and tools to be used in assessing credibility are summarized in Novak Estate (Re), 2008 NSSC 283. 2) Certain of the evidence of the Karpinskis and Ms. Mui is so unreliable that the whole of their evidence is cast with doubt. 3) The opinions and conclusions of Mr. Loraas and Mr. Epp are accepted by the court. They are professionals with no interest in the outcome of the action. Their evidence was largely unchallenged. The Court finds that the pine shakes were rotten, sealant had been applied to the shakes on at least two occasions and prior to the plaintiff offering to buy the property, the shakes were not properly installed allowing water to seep into the house, the skylight leaked and caulking had been applied to stop the leaking before the plaintiff offered to buy the house, there was improper and inadequate venting which resulted in moisture damage to the interior of the house and mold in the attic, the moisture damage in the house included damage to drywall and paint blisters. Nail pops throughout the house were largely the result of the house being moved. No inspection was done after the house was moved. 4) The Court finds the Karpinskis did not speak truthfully or completely when they answered the questions in the Property Condition Disclosure Statement (PCDS). The Court does not accept that the vendors were not aware of water and moisture damage arising from the improperly installed shingles, the missing ridge caps, the leaking skylight or the lack of venting. The sealant on the roof was sufficiently old to predate the plaintiff's purchase of the house. The vendors repaired the sink holes and moisture pockets and effectively concealed the problems. It should have been disclosed. Although the vendors denied knowing of the structural damage to their house, they knew the house had been cut in half and moved 300 kilometers and had sustained damage. The structural problems were concealed by the vendors through repairs to the dry wall, reinforcement at stress points, and repainting and patching of wall paper. The fact that the house had been cut in half and moved should have been disclosed on the PCDS. 5) It is not only current defects or ongoing problems that need to be disclosed on a PCDS. A prospective purchaser does not look to the PCDS only to ascertain that the roof is not leaking on the day it was signed, see Kaufmann v. Gibson, [2007] O.J. No. 2711 (Ont. S.C.) (QL). The Karpinskis are liable to the plaintiff for breach of contract for failing to disclose the existence of structural defects, damage due to water and roof leakage. The terms of the PCDS formed part of the agreement between the parties and the deliberate withholding of this information amounted to a false representation as to the condition of the home. With respect to damage arising from these defects, the doctrine of caveat emptor does not apply. 6) The requirements for negligent misrepresentation have been established by the plaintiff. The failure to disclose, or silence as to a known defect, amounts to an act of concealment of a material fact and has the same effect as an express misrepresentation and is sufficient to attract liability, Thomas v. Blackwell, 1999 SKQB 168. 7) The false representations knowingly made by the vendors and their silence as to material facts were fraudulent. 8) Ms. Mui was negligent and her conduct and advice to the plaintiff fell below the standard of care expected of a realtor acting for the purchaser of a rural property in 1999. She did not conduct any preliminary background checks with the Rural Municipality, which would include determining if proper permits had been obtained, prior to the plaintiff's offer to purchase. Ms. Mui did nothing more than merely mention a home inspection to the plaintiff on one occasion. At no time did she recommend a home inspection even after she knew the house had been moved and before the condition regarding a satisfactory PCDS was removed. Another reason to strongly recommend a home inspection would be in circumstances where the realtor knew that a rural municipality did not require building inspections and Ms. Mui knew this to be the case. The plaintiff relied on the representation of Ms. Mui to her detriment. Had Ms. Mui disclosed all material facts to the plaintiff and explained and recommended a home inspection, the Court is satisfied that the outcome for the plaintiff would have been different. Knowing the house had been moved and had not been inspected the plaintiff would have most likely reconsidered her decision to purchase. 9) The Court is satisfied that Mr. Jacabucci is liable to the plaintiff for negligent misrepresentation. He represented that the home was of 'quality construction'. This was incorrect. Mr. Jacobucci was also complicit in, and party to, the negligent misrepresentations made by the vendors in the PCDS. He knew the house had been moved and sustained damage. He also knew the skylight leaked. The plaintiff relied on these misrepresentations and damages resulted.  10) The costs incurred by the plaintiff to repair the house total $17,613. She is awarded $15,000 as compensation for personal time and effort that she expended in repairing the home. There is no evidence that the distress the plaintiff experienced constituted a physical injury, or a recognized psychiatric illness and she cannot be compensated for mental distress, whether under tort or breach of contract. She is awarded $10,000 for aggravated damages. Her claim for punitive damages is dismissed. Her claim for solicitor and client costs is dismissed.

She hired the services of a realtor associated with the defendant, 100% Realty Associates Ltd. After a lengthy search, the plaintiff purchased the home in 1999. She claimed that the defendants fell below the standard of care required of a professional realtor representing the purchaser of a residential property. She also claimed damages for alleged latent defects in the house. The realtor, Cecilia Mui, was hired to look at the property. The plaintiff was unable to obtain a building permit because of the extensive renovations. She sued the defendants for damages for latent defects. The court found that the realtor and her husband were negligent in misrepresenting certain facts and breached the fiduciary duty expected of the plaintiff. The Court found that both parties were liable to the plaintiff in damages for the alleged latent problems.","She now sues the defendants seeking recovery of damages for alleged latent defects in the house. She says that Ms. Mui and RE/MAX Saskatoon fell below the standard of care required of a realtor representing the purchaser of a residential property. Mr. and Mrs. Karpinski, according to Ms. Schira, similarly misrepresented facts to her, negligently and fraudulently, both in information given to her which induced her, in part, to purchase the home, and in answers that they gave in a Property Condition Disclosure Statement (PCDS) which formed a condition of the contract for sale. 106) With the above in mind, I have determined that certain of the evidence of each of Mr. Karpinski, Mrs. Karpinski and Ms. Mui is so unreliable that the whole of their evidence is cast with doubt. I have, accordingly, accepted the observations of Mr. Loraas and the opinions of Mr. Epp. 123) In considering the liability of each of the defendants I have, as previously noted, accepted the conclusions and opinions of Mr. Loraas and Mr. Epp. In particular, I find:
(i) The pine shakes were rotting and many were cracked to such an extent that water could permeate the underlying joints and decking. 130) In this case, I have concluded that Mr. and Mrs. Karpinski did not speak “truthfully and completely” when answering all the questions in the PCDS. However, given their lack of veracity on key issues, I do not accept that they were unaware of other water and moisture damage, whether arising from the improperly installed shingles, the missing ridge caps, the leaking skylight or inadequate venting that was occurring elsewhere in the interior of the house. Accordingly I find Mr. and Mrs. Karpinski liable to Ms. Schira for breach of contract for failing to disclose in questions B, F and G of the PCDS the existence of structural defects, damage due to water, and roof leakage. The terms of the PCDS formed part of the agreement between the Karpinskis and Ms. Schira, and the deliberate withholding of this information amounted to a false representation as to the condition of the home. For reasons already set out, I would find that the false representations knowingly made by Mr. and Mrs. Karpinski, and their silence as to material facts, were fraudulent. I have concluded that Ms. Mui was negligent and that her conduct and advice to Ms. Schira fell below the standard of care expected of a realtor acting for the purchaser of a rural property in 1999. Further, had Ms. Mui fulfilled her obligation first to disclose all material facts to Ms. Schira, and second, to explain and, in these circumstances, recommend a home inspection, I am satisfied on a balance of probabilities that the outcome for Ms. Schira would have been different. 148) I am satisfied however that Mr. Jacobucci is liable to Ms. Schira for negligent misrepresentation. I award Ms. Schira $15,000 as compensation for the personal time and effort that she expended in repairing the house.

To assist her, she engaged the services of the defendant, Cecilia Mui, realtor associated with the defendant 100% Realty Associates Ltd. After a lengthy search house was purchased the following year. It was owned by the defendants, Edward and Verl Karpinski. Their realtor was negligent in misrepresenting certain facts and breached the fiduciary duty expected of her. The plaintiff sued the defendants seeking recovery of damages for alleged latent defects in the house. She alleged the defendants fell below the standard of care required of a realtor representing the purchaser of a residential property. She also claimed aggravated damages against all defendants and punitive damages against the husband and wife, asserting that their acts and omissions exacerbated her distress. HELD: The Court held that the plaintiff was entitled to recover the costs of the repairs.","She now sues the defendants seeking recovery of damages for alleged latent defects in the house. She says that Ms. Mui and RE/MAX Saskatoon fell below the standard of care required of a realtor representing the purchaser of a residential property. Mr. and Mrs. Karpinski, according to Ms. Schira, similarly misrepresented facts to her, negligently and fraudulently, both in information given to her which induced her, in part, to purchase the home, and in answers that they gave in a Property Condition Disclosure Statement (PCDS) which formed a condition of the contract for sale. 106) With the above in mind, I have determined that certain of the evidence of each of Mr. Karpinski, Mrs. Karpinski and Ms. Mui is so unreliable that the whole of their evidence is cast with doubt. I have, accordingly, accepted the observations of Mr. Loraas and the opinions of Mr. Epp. 123) In considering the liability of each of the defendants I have, as previously noted, accepted the conclusions and opinions of Mr. Loraas and Mr. Epp. In particular, I find:
(i) The pine shakes were rotting and many were cracked to such an extent that water could permeate the underlying joints and decking. 130) In this case, I have concluded that Mr. and Mrs. Karpinski did not speak “truthfully and completely” when answering all the questions in the PCDS. However, given their lack of veracity on key issues, I do not accept that they were unaware of other water and moisture damage, whether arising from the improperly installed shingles, the missing ridge caps, the leaking skylight or inadequate venting that was occurring elsewhere in the interior of the house. Accordingly I find Mr. and Mrs. Karpinski liable to Ms. Schira for breach of contract for failing to disclose in questions B, F and G of the PCDS the existence of structural defects, damage due to water, and roof leakage. The terms of the PCDS formed part of the agreement between the Karpinskis and Ms. Schira, and the deliberate withholding of this information amounted to a false representation as to the condition of the home. For reasons already set out, I would find that the false representations knowingly made by Mr. and Mrs. Karpinski, and their silence as to material facts, were fraudulent. I have concluded that Ms. Mui was negligent and that her conduct and advice to Ms. Schira fell below the standard of care expected of a realtor acting for the purchaser of a rural property in 1999. Further, had Ms. Mui fulfilled her obligation first to disclose all material facts to Ms. Schira, and second, to explain and, in these circumstances, recommend a home inspection, I am satisfied on a balance of probabilities that the outcome for Ms. Schira would have been different. 148) I am satisfied however that Mr. Jacobucci is liable to Ms. Schira for negligent misrepresentation. I award Ms. Schira $15,000 as compensation for the personal time and effort that she expended in repairing the house. However, there is no evidence that the distress that she experienced constituted a physical injury, or a recognized psychiatric illness. 166) There will be an award for aggravated damages, with respect to all defendants, in the amount of $10,000. 169) This aspect of Ms. Schira’s claim for damages is accordingly dismissed.

She used the services of Cecilia Mui, a realtor associated with the defendant 100% Realty Associates Ltd. operating as Re/max Saskatoon. The house was purchased from the defendants Edward and Verl Karpinski. The vendors' realtor was the defendant, Mario Jacobucci, owner of the defendant Trevi Holdings Ltd. The house did not meet the plaintiff's expectations. She now sues the defendants seeking recovery of damages for alleged latent defects. She claims Ms. Mui fell below the standard of care required of a realtor representing a purchaser. She claims Ms. Mui was negligent in misrepresenting certain facts and breached the fiduciary duty expected of her. The plaintiff claims the Karpinskis misrepresented facts to her, negligently and fraudulently. The plaintiff claims that Mr. Jacobucci and his company are liable to her in damages, both in negligence and as parties to the misrepresentations made by the vendors. Special and general damages are claimed as are aggravated damages and punitive damages. The trial took place over 22 days, spanning several years and included testimony from 14 witnesses. Two main issues are raised. The first is the liability of each of the defendants. The second issue is quantum of damages. The credibility of the parties is at the forefront of the determination of the issues. HELD: The vendors are liable to the plaintiff for breach of contract. Each of the defendants is a tortfeasor, each having breached an obligation or duty owed to the plaintiff, whether through negligence or misrepresentation. Their wrongful acts and omissions all contributed to the same damage. In that respect their liability is concurrent. The liability of the vendors and Mr. Jacobucci is joint, and that of Ms. Mui is several. As concurrent torfeasors, the fault for the damage shall be apportioned equally among the four of them.  1) Credibility is not a science, see R. v. Gagnon, 2006 SCC 17. It is not always possible to articulate with precision the complex intermingling of impressions that emerge after watching and listening to witnesses and attempting to reconcile the various versions of events. The principles and tools to be used in assessing credibility are summarized in Novak Estate (Re), 2008 NSSC 283. 2) Certain of the evidence of the Karpinskis and Ms. Mui is so unreliable that the whole of their evidence is cast with doubt. 3) The opinions and conclusions of Mr. Loraas and Mr. Epp are accepted by the court. They are professionals with no interest in the outcome of the action. Their evidence was largely unchallenged. The Court finds that the pine shakes were rotten, sealant had been applied to the shakes on at least two occasions and prior to the plaintiff offering to buy the property, the shakes were not properly installed allowing water to seep into the house, the skylight leaked and caulking had been applied to stop the leaking before the plaintiff offered to buy the house, there was improper and inadequate venting which resulted in moisture damage to the interior of the house and mold in the attic, the moisture damage in the house included damage to drywall and paint blisters. Nail pops throughout the house were largely the result of the house being moved. No inspection was done after the house was moved. 4) The Court finds the Karpinskis did not speak truthfully or completely when they answered the questions in the Property Condition Disclosure Statement (PCDS). The Court does not accept that the vendors were not aware of water and moisture damage arising from the improperly installed shingles, the missing ridge caps, the leaking skylight or the lack of venting. The sealant on the roof was sufficiently old to predate the plaintiff's purchase of the house. The vendors repaired the sink holes and moisture pockets and effectively concealed the problems. It should have been disclosed. Although the vendors denied knowing of the structural damage to their house, they knew the house had been cut in half and moved 300 kilometers and had sustained damage. The structural problems were concealed by the vendors through repairs to the dry wall, reinforcement at stress points, and repainting and patching of wall paper. The fact that the house had been cut in half and moved should have been disclosed on the PCDS. 5) It is not only current defects or ongoing problems that need to be disclosed on a PCDS. A prospective purchaser does not look to the PCDS only to ascertain that the roof is not leaking on the day it was signed, see Kaufmann v. Gibson, [2007] O.J. No. 2711 (Ont. S.C.) (QL). The Karpinskis are liable to the plaintiff for breach of contract for failing to disclose the existence of structural defects, damage due to water and roof leakage. The terms of the PCDS formed part of the agreement between the parties and the deliberate withholding of this information amounted to a false representation as to the condition of the home. With respect to damage arising from these defects, the doctrine of caveat emptor does not apply. 6) The requirements for negligent misrepresentation have been established by the plaintiff. The failure to disclose, or silence as to a known defect, amounts to an act of concealment of a material fact and has the same effect as an express misrepresentation and is sufficient to attract liability, Thomas v. Blackwell, 1999 SKQB 168. 7) The false representations knowingly made by the vendors and their silence as to material facts were fraudulent. 8) Ms. Mui was negligent and her conduct and advice to the plaintiff fell below the standard of care expected of a realtor acting for the purchaser of a rural property in 1999. She did not conduct any preliminary background checks with the Rural Municipality, which would include determining if proper permits had been obtained, prior to the plaintiff's offer to purchase. Ms. Mui did nothing more than merely mention a home inspection to the plaintiff on one occasion. At no time did she recommend a home inspection even after she knew the house had been moved and before the condition regarding a satisfactory PCDS was removed. Another reason to strongly recommend a home inspection would be in circumstances where the realtor knew that a rural municipality did not require building inspections and Ms. Mui knew this to be the case. The plaintiff relied on the representation of Ms. Mui to her detriment. Had Ms. Mui disclosed all material facts to the plaintiff and explained and recommended a home inspection, the Court is satisfied that the outcome for the plaintiff would have been different. Knowing the house had been moved and had not been inspected the plaintiff would have most likely reconsidered her decision to purchase. 9) The Court is satisfied that Mr. Jacabucci is liable to the plaintiff for negligent misrepresentation. He represented that the home was of 'quality construction'. This was incorrect. Mr. Jacobucci was also complicit in, and party to, the negligent misrepresentations made by the vendors in the PCDS. He knew the house had been moved and sustained damage. He also knew the skylight leaked. The plaintiff relied on these misrepresentations and damages resulted.  10) The costs incurred by the plaintiff to repair the house total $17,613. She is awarded $15,000 as compensation for personal time and effort that she expended in repairing the home. There is no evidence that the distress the plaintiff experienced constituted a physical injury, or a recognized psychiatric illness and she cannot be compensated for mental distress, whether under tort or breach of contract. She is awarded $10,000 for aggravated damages. Her claim for punitive damages is dismissed. Her claim for solicitor and client costs is dismissed.

The latter was not opposed. There was also an issue regarding an affidavit filed by the respondent, which referenced but did not attach the applicant's defence. The respondent argued it was unnecessary to attach a document already filed with the court. Change of venue granted in part: the applications will continue to be heard in Halifax, but the trial will be held in Windsor as requested. Neither party has a connection to Halifax. The respondent operates from Stewiacke and the dispute arose in Hants County. The attachment order is terminated, with costs of $1,000 to the applicant. An attachment order is an intrusive pre-trial remedy and will hinder the corporate applicant's attempts to resume/expand operations. Here there is no conduct to justify maintaining the order. The mere allegation of a connection between the individual and corporate defendants is insufficient to cause the court to pierce the corporate veil. The respondent has failed to establish any of the relevant grounds governing attachment orders. The Rules require facts, not allegations or suspicions. The affidavit in question was flawed. It should have attached the defence in order to properly incorporate the references to it.","The plaintiff moved for an order terminating an attachment order against it pursuant to Rule 44.10. The plaintiff alleged that the defendant had interfered with the plaintiff's timber harvesting contract and sought a change of the place of proceeding. The defendant argued that the attachment order was an intrusive pre-trial remedy and that its existence would hinder any attempt by the plaintiff to resume or expand its operations. The applicant sought costs. The court found that the affidavit of the plaintiff did not properly incorporate the contents of the statement of claim. The mere allegation of a connection between the individual and corporate defendants was not sufficient reason to dispose of the corporate veil. The affidavit of a corporation that is not registered under the Corporations Registration Act did not establish any of the grounds for the attachment. The only grounds for termination were that the plaintiff had not established any of them under Rule 44 and that the plaintiffs had not shown any principled basis to do so. The fact that the defendants had not made sufficient efforts to bring the claim to final determination was not enough grounds to terminate the attachment and the plaintiff was not acting in any way that necessitated security for the plaintiff. The Court awarded costs to the applicant of $1,000 payable in any event in the cause.","[1] C & R Sterling Farm, one of the defendants in the main proceeding, moves for an order terminating an attachment order against it, pursuant to Rule 44.10.

Brackley, 1999 CanLII 715 (SCC), [1999] 1 S.C.R. 420, 169 D.L.R.(4th) 577, the Court considers the economic disparity between the respondent and the petitioner's incomes that is $79,320.00 versus $56,103.00, is sufficiently disparate and upon which an interim award of non-compensatory spousa support is appropriate. 2) The respondent's gross income in the year 2013, to his pay period ending December 14, 2013, was $95,275.73. This latter sum included $28,553.68 of overtime income.

This is not a case where evidence has been adduced showing a history of income and the interference in that income capacity due to the injuries. There is no evidence of Shawn\'s projected income from the family business and I appreciate the difficulties in adducing such evidence. I am satisfied that by reason of his hip injury his employment opportunities are less than they were before the accident and in that sense he has suffered a loss of a wider employment horizon. He has suffered a reduction in his capital asset and in the breadth of his employment opportunities and he is entitled to be compensated therefore. I consider the only appropriate way to compensate him is to award a lump sum for this loss which is separate and apart from the non‑pecuniary damage.

MacRae, an employee of the Province of Nova Scotia. His report and evidence is that Shawn suffered a posterior dislocation of his right hip, a compound injury involving his right knee with a disruption of the medial collateral ligament and a fracture of his third right metacarpal in the right hand. This is not a case where evidence has been adduced showing a history of income and the interference in that income capacity due to the injuries. There is no evidence of Shawn\'s projected income from the family business and I appreciate the difficulties in adducing such evidence. I am satisfied that by reason of his hip injury his employment opportunities are less than they were before the accident and in that sense he has suffered a loss of a wider employment horizon. He has suffered a reduction in his capital asset and in the breadth of his employment opportunities and he is entitled to be compensated therefore. I consider the only appropriate way to compensate him is to award a lump sum for this loss which is separate and apart from the non‑pecuniary damage.

Two health care institutions, one residential lodge and one hospital, each of whose employees were represented by a different union, were to be integrated into one new institution, the Centre. The Health Centre applied to the Board to determine if it represented the majority of the employees. The Labour Relations board ordered that the vote should be held.

7_2010nsca95.txt,"The first defendant was the lessee and driver of a motor vehicle that was involved in a motor vehicle accident with the plaintiff. The second defendant was the lessor of the vehicle. The plaintiff brought an action against both the lessor and lessee, arguing that the second defendant was liable, both as the owner of the vehicle under the Motor Vehicle Act and pursuant to common law vicarious liability, for the lessee's negligence. The second defendant successfully applied for summary judgment, with the court finding that the lessor was not liable under the Motor Vehicle Act as the lease was not a 'rental contract' as defined in s. 62 of the Act and the lessor was not an 'owner' as defined in s. 2(ak) and the current state of the law did not suggest that a claim of vicarious liability had a real chance of success between a lessor and lessee. Both the plaintiff and the first defendant appealed. Appeal dismissed; the reverse onus provision in s. 248 does not apply in this case; the argument that the lease was not a conditional sales agreement but rather a rental agreement had no real chance of success and the fact that a vehicle is subject to a lease does not change the fact that there is no vicarious liability at common law between the owner and the driver of a vehicle.","The appellants appealed a decision granting summary judgment to the respondent, Chrysler, granting summary judgement on the basis that it was not vicariously liable for the negligence of Giffin. The Chambers judge concluded that there was not a real chance of success on the arguments advanced by Giffin respecting Chrysler's alleged liability by operation of the Motor Vehicle Act. HELD: Appeal dismissed. 1)The issue is unambiguously determined by the precedents. The court found that s. 248 has no application on the facts of this case. 2)The reverse onus provision does not apply. The appellants were involved in a motor vehicle accident and Gilbert sued the respondent for compensation in respect of injuries sustained in the accident. The respondent appealed. The issue before the Chambers judge was whether the appellants established that their claim for vicarious liability against Chrysler had a real prospect of success. The lease clearly falls into the 'lease with right of purchase' exception to the definition of 'owner.' The lease contains the characteristics noted in s. 2(ak) and can realistically be depicted as a rental contract as defined in s62. The plaintiff had an option to purchase the vehicle at the expiry of the lease for the same amount. 3)The court found no real chance for success on either the argument that the lease between the respondent and Giffin was actually a rental deal pursuant to s. 62 of the Act, nor the claim that Chysler is an owner pursuant to the Motor Vehicles Act. 4)The Court found that there is no real prospect for success based on the argument made on the evidence. The argument that Giffin and Chrysler were in the business of renting motor vehicles without drivers, who rents vehicle without driver, otherwise than as a bona fide transaction involving the sale of the motor vehicle, permitting the renter to operate the vehicle upon the highways, had a very real chance to succeed. 5)The lease falls into a 'lease' with rightof purchase' exemption to the meaning of 'ownership'.

7_2011nspc27.txt,"The female driver, the accused and two other men were in a vehicle that was stopped on suspicion of being involved in a robbery. A gun and many of the stolen items were found in the vehicle and all the occupants were charged with a number of offences, including robbery. The accused denied being in the area where the robbery occurred but alleged that they had stopped and picked up the two other men. While at the police station, he pulled a ring that had been reported stolen out of his pants and placed it on his finger. At his trial, one of the other men testified that he had pled guilty to the robbery; the driver testified that she had driven directly from her home to where the vehicle was stopped by the police, without stopping; and the complainant testified that he had been lured to the driver's house, where he was ambushed by her and three men, robbed and threatened. Although his descriptions matched the two other males in the vehicle, he positively stated that the accused was not the third person. Accused found not guilty on all charges; the Crown had not proven that he was involved in the robbery or that he should have known there was a gun or stolen property in the car. Although the circumstances in which the accused was taken into custody were more than suspicious, the fact that the complainant had clearly seen the robbers but had made a positive non-identification created an inconsistency that raised a reasonable doubt.","The accused was charged with robbery and possession of a stolen firearm. The accused was found in a car with three other people in it. The police stopped the accused and found the accused in the back seat of the car loaded. The court found that the accused had not been in Sackville at all. He had nothing to do with any robbery. The fact that the police had stopped the car when it was stopped by the police suggested that the person who had been picked up in the car was the person in the vehicle who had earlier admitted to the robbery. HELD: The accused is found in the accused's car with the gun and the stolen property in his possession. The description of the accused is consistent with the description of one of the three men in the Car. The Court found that, in the circumstances, the accused clearly saw the people who robbed him. The evidence from the Crown witness who testified at the police station that he was picked up by the accused when the others were picked up at some building, somewhere in Fairview, was not consistent with his description. The Crown witness was not asked to identify the accused. The defence lawyer was not called to testify. The only person who was able to identify him was the Crown's witness. The witness was also not called. The circumstantial evidence was not strong enough to resolve the narrative inconsistency. The victim clearly saw his assailants when the police stopped it in high risk take down and their identities would be pretty quickly determined. The descriptions of the other two men who were in the police car matched the description given to the accused by the Crown. The trial judge was not required to provide an identification to the court. The inconsistencies in the narrative were not resolved by assuming that the victim was either mistaken or not telling the whole truth. The judge was able, however, to reconcile the inconsistencies in his evidence with the circumstantials. The first inference was that the Crown was not able to establish that the defendant was involved in the robbery because he was not familiar with the area. The second inference was not supported by the circumstantsial evidence. The officer was not entitled to make an inference that the court was not aware of the circumstances surrounding the robbery and that the only person he could have identified was the accused himself. The third inference was also supported by circumstantially circumstantical evidence.","[1] On December 13, 2010 the police stopped a car driven by Candace MacDonald.

7_2012skqb510.txt,"The defendant was charged with unlawfully harvesting forest products contrary to s. 79(1)(a) of The Forest Resources Management Act, unlawfully possessing forest products without a licence contrary to s. 79(1)(c) and unlawfully trafficking in forest products contrary to s. 79(1)(f) of the Act. He was acquitted of the first two charges and convicted of the third. He appealed his conviction. He was fined $1,000 with a 40% surcharge. The Crown appealed the sentence. The appellant argued that since he was acquitted of the related charges, it followed that he should not have been convicted of trafficking. The charges had arisen as a result of a lengthy undercover investigation into the activities of the appellant. He was known to be harvesting fire kill in the Nesbitt Forest, which was Crown land. He stored wood on his property and on that of a relative. If the appellant was using it himself, he did not require a permit. The undercover conservation officer purchased fire wood from the appellant, who told the officer that the wood was from Crown land in an answer to officer's question whether it was cut on private land. The appellant did not testify at his trial nor did his relative and so the evidence of the conservation officer was uncontradicted. The evidence presented on his behalf was from individuals who had purchased wood from the defendant. The trial judge held that the charges against the appellant were strict liability offences and once the Crown had demonstrated beyond a reasonable doubt that the prohibited acts had been committed, the appellant had to establish on the balance of probabilities that he had been duly diligent and took all reasonable care to avoid offending. With respect to the first two charges, the trial judge held that he was not satisfied that during the period described in the indictment that the Crown had proven the actus reus of the offences but that it had on the third count, based on the appellant's own words to the officer. The appellant argued on appeal that his words could have been taken to mean that he was describing where he harvested wood for his own use and therefore his statement was not an admission that he sold wood to the officer or anyone else from Crown lands. HELD: The Court held that the trial judge erred in his reasoning and conclusion that appellant was guilty of trafficking because he had not been duly diligent. It is only if the actus reus was proven beyond a reasonable doubt that the considerations of whether due diligence had been proven would arise. The conviction could not be maintained because the qualifying actus reus was not proven. However, the other aspect of the evidence, which was not expressly considered by the trial judge and which would sustain a conviction, was if evidence established trafficking via another modality. Since s. 2(dd) of the Act defines 'traffic' to mean 'to offer for sale, barter, deal, solicit or tradeÃ ' and s. 79(1) states that it is an offence to traffic in forest products from Crown land without a licence, then the offence is complete by offering the product for sale without a licence. The appellant led no evidence to establish he had either the required permit to harvest forest products from Crown lands or a licence or any other form of authorization to deal in forest products. Thus, the evidence established beyond a reasonable doubt that the appellant was guilty of trafficking in forest products contrary to s. 79(1)(f) of the Act. The conviction was upheld. Regarding sentencing, the Court held that it was important to deter other offenders. The trial judge's sentence of a fine equivalent to the levy avoided (the provincial charge per cord of wood) was inappropriately low. The Court set the appropriate fine at $5,000 plus a victim fund surcharge of 40% as required by s. 3 of The Victims of Crime Regulations. If the fine was not paid within 60 days, the appellant would serve a term of imprisonment of 90 days.","The defendant appealed his conviction on a charge of unlawfully harvesting forest products and unlawfully possessing forest products. He argued the Crown had proven beyond a reasonable doubt that the wood he sold to an undercover officer was wood harvested from Crown lands. The Crown appealed the sentence imposed on the conviction of unlawfully trafficking in forest products, arguing the fine was unreasonable or insufficiently low and that the evidence established that the accused had unlawfully harvested wood from Crown land. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. 1)The evidence of the conservation officers was uncontradicted. 2)The Crown appealed. 3)The Court of Queen's Bench found that a fine of $1,000 with a 40% surcharge was an unreasonably low penalty for the offence the evidence establishes. 4)The acquittals on the charges of unlawfully harvested and unlawfully possessed forest products have not been appealed. 5)The trial judge must show great deference in reviewing the decisions of trial judges, interfering to vary sentence only if the sentence is clearly unreasonable or demonstrably unfit.","[1] This case involves an appeal by the defendant from his conviction and by the Crown as regards the sentence imposed on Wayne Gitzel on a charge of unlawfully trafficking in forest products contrary to s. 79(1)(f) of The Forest Resources Management Act, S.S. 1996, c. F-19.1. [3] For its part, the Crown has appealed the sentence imposed taking the position that a fine of $1,000 with a 40% surcharge was an unreasonably low penalty for the offence the evidence established. [4] The charges against Wayne Gitzel are that between November 27, 2007 and December 22, 2009, at or near the communities of Holbein and Shellbrook in the Province of Saskatchewan he:

i) unlawfully harvested forest products contrary to s. 79(1)(a) of The Forest Resources Management Act;
ii) unlawfully possessed forest products without a licence contrary to s. 79(1)(c) of The Forest Resources Management Act; and
iii) unlawfully trafficked in forest products contrary to s. 79(1)(f) of The Forest Resources Management Act. [16] The trial judge held that, after considering all of the evidence, he was not satisfied that during the period in the indictment, the Crown had proven beyond a reasonable doubt the actus reus on Count No. 1 of unlawfully harvesting forest products, nor Count No. 2 of unlawfully possessing forest products without a licence. He found that the Crown had proven, beyond a reasonable doubt, the actus reus on Count No. 3 of unlawfully trafficking in forest products, but he held that given the defendant’s own words to the undercover operator, he was not satisfied, on the balance of probabilities, the defendant was duly diligent to ensure that the wood he sold to the undercover operator and the previous sales (presumably referring to the previous 150 truckloads and the 58 truckloads he told Clarke he sold in 2008 and 2009) was wood coming from private lands. With all due respect to the learned trial judge, I find this conclusion and reasoning to be in error. The defendant led no evidence to establish he had either the required permit to harvest forest products from Crown lands or a licence or any form of authorization to deal in forest products. Thus, the evidence establishes beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant was guilty of trafficking in forest products contrary to s. 79(1)(f) of the Act as charged. Therefore, the conviction stands. Accordingly, a fine equivalent to a levy avoided would be inappropriately low since the fine could not in those circumstances act as a deterrent to either the defendant or other offenders. [41] Factoring in that the defendant was in the offence he committed intending to avoid a charge or levy of $1,500, recognizing the deal that he was making did not conclude and thus he did not actually generate revenue from the proposed transaction and considering the need for a significant deterrent to the defendant and other offenders who are committing this offence on a commercial scale, I have concluded that in the circumstances of this case an appropriate fine is $5,000.

With respect to the first two charges, the trial judge held that he was not satisfied that during the period described in the indictment that the Crown had proven the actus reus of the offences but that it had on the third count, based on the appellant's own words to the officer. The appellant argued on appeal that his words could have been taken to mean that he was describing where he harvested wood for his own use and therefore his statement was not an admission that he sold wood to the officer or anyone else from Crown lands. HELD: The Court held that the trial judge erred in his reasoning and conclusion that appellant was guilty of trafficking because he had not been duly diligent. It is only if the actus reus was proven beyond a reasonable doubt that the considerations of whether due diligence had been proven would arise. The conviction could not be maintained because the qualifying actus reus was not proven. However, the other aspect of the evidence, which was not expressly considered by the trial judge and which would sustain a conviction, was if evidence established trafficking via another modality. Since s. 2(dd) of the Act defines 'traffic' to mean 'to offer for sale, barter, deal, solicit or tradeÃ ' and s. 79(1) states that it is an offence to traffic in forest products from Crown land without a licence, then the offence is complete by offering the product for sale without a licence. The appellant led no evidence to establish he had either the required permit to harvest forest products from Crown lands or a licence or any other form of authorization to deal in forest products. Thus, the evidence established beyond a reasonable doubt that the appellant was guilty of trafficking in forest products contrary to s. 79(1)(f) of the Act. The conviction was upheld. Regarding sentencing, the Court held that it was important to deter other offenders. The trial judge's sentence of a fine equivalent to the levy avoided (the provincial charge per cord of wood) was inappropriately low. The Court set the appropriate fine at $5,000 plus a victim fund surcharge of 40% as required by s. 3 of The Victims of Crime Regulations. If the fine was not paid within 60 days, the appellant would serve a term of imprisonment of 90 days.","The defendant appealed his conviction on a charge of unlawfully harvesting forest products contrary to s. 79(1)(f) of the Forest Resources Management Act. The Crown appealed the sentence imposed on the defendant for unlawfully trafficking in forest products. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. 1)The trial judge found that the Crown had proven beyond a reasonable doubt the actus reus on Count No. 1 of unlawfully harvested forest products, and that a fine of $1,000 with a 40% surcharge was an unreasonably low penalty for the offence the evidence established. 2)The defendant was entitled to harvest dead wood from Crown lands for his personal heating needs. 3)The evidence of the conservation officers was uncontradicted.","[1] This case involves an appeal by the defendant from his conviction and by the Crown as regards the sentence imposed on Wayne Gitzel on a charge of unlawfully trafficking in forest products contrary to s. 79(1)(f) of The Forest Resources Management Act, S.S. 1996, c. F-19.1. [3] For its part, the Crown has appealed the sentence imposed taking the position that a fine of $1,000 with a 40% surcharge was an unreasonably low penalty for the offence the evidence established. [4] The charges against Wayne Gitzel are that between November 27, 2007 and December 22, 2009, at or near the communities of Holbein and Shellbrook in the Province of Saskatchewan he:

i) unlawfully harvested forest products contrary to s. 79(1)(a) of The Forest Resources Management Act;
ii) unlawfully possessed forest products without a licence contrary to s. 79(1)(c) of The Forest Resources Management Act; and
iii) unlawfully trafficked in forest products contrary to s. 79(1)(f) of The Forest Resources Management Act. [16] The trial judge held that, after considering all of the evidence, he was not satisfied that during the period in the indictment, the Crown had proven beyond a reasonable doubt the actus reus on Count No. 1 of unlawfully harvesting forest products, nor Count No. 2 of unlawfully possessing forest products without a licence. He found that the Crown had proven, beyond a reasonable doubt, the actus reus on Count No. 3 of unlawfully trafficking in forest products, but he held that given the defendant’s own words to the undercover operator, he was not satisfied, on the balance of probabilities, the defendant was duly diligent to ensure that the wood he sold to the undercover operator and the previous sales (presumably referring to the previous 150 truckloads and the 58 truckloads he told Clarke he sold in 2008 and 2009) was wood coming from private lands. With all due respect to the learned trial judge, I find this conclusion and reasoning to be in error. The defendant led no evidence to establish he had either the required permit to harvest forest products from Crown lands or a licence or any form of authorization to deal in forest products. Thus, the evidence establishes beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant was guilty of trafficking in forest products contrary to s. 79(1)(f) of the Act as charged. Therefore, the conviction stands.

[41] Factoring in that the defendant was in the offence he committed intending to avoid a charge or levy of $1,500, recognizing the deal that he was making did not conclude and thus he did not actually generate revenue from the proposed transaction and considering the need for a significant deterrent to the defendant and other offenders who are committing this offence on a commercial scale, I have concluded that in the circumstances of this case an appropriate fine is $5,000.

He was acquitted of the first two charges and convicted of the third. He appealed his conviction. He was fined $1,000 with a 40% surcharge. The Crown appealed the sentence. The appellant argued that since he was acquitted of the related charges, it followed that he should not have been convicted of trafficking. The charges had arisen as a result of a lengthy undercover investigation into the activities of the appellant. He was known to be harvesting fire kill in the Nesbitt Forest, which was Crown land. He stored wood on his property and on that of a relative. If the appellant was using it himself, he did not require a permit. The undercover conservation officer purchased fire wood from the appellant, who told the officer that the wood was from Crown land in an answer to officer's question whether it was cut on private land.

7_2015skqb352.txt,"Family Law – Custody and Access – Best Interests of ChildFamily Law – Custody and Access – Interim – VariationFamily Law – DivorceFamily Law – Evidence – AffidavitThe parties were in a high-conflict situation and brought five interim applications with various requests. They had three children, the youngest being born five days before a previous application. At the initial application the respondent mother was living in the family home and the petitioner was living at the family cottage and expected to move into the new home when it was ready. The petitioner did move into the home, which was a few blocks from the family home. The youngest child was almost a year old and the petitioner was having increased parenting time with him. The parties agreed to have a custody and access report prepared. The issues were: 1) divorce; 2) registration of the middle child in Montessori school. The respondent opposed the child attending the school because he was not yet potty trained. The petitioner advised that the school was okay with the child not being potty trained; 3) to take the child to a speech therapist. The parties ended up resolving the issue before chambers; 4) varying the existing parenting arrangements.  There was an interim order from January 2015 made shortly after the third child was born. The respondent had since hired a full-time nanny. The respondent did not necessarily oppose the petitioner spending more time with the youngest child, but she wanted to be the one to control the developing of that time. The petitioner wanted the child Wednesday afternoon to evening and Sunday from 11:00 am to 4:00 pm. He also wanted increased time with the two older children so that he could get them to their necessary activities and so that they could continue to develop their bond with him; 5) arrears of child and spousal support; 6) the respondent’s request to return the 2005 vehicle. The vehicle had been at the parties’ farm and was damaged beyond repair without insurance. The petitioner then towed the vehicle to the respondent’s home; 7) objections to one of the petitioner’s affidavits; and 8) costs. HELD: The issues were decided as follows: 1) the divorce was granted because the parties had been separated in excess of a year and no satisfactory reasons were argued for not allowing it; 2) the court held that it would be appropriate for the child to be enrolled in the Montessori school. The cost of the program was ordered to be paid by the petitioner. The parties were to agree on the child’s transportation to the school and if they could not agree the petitioner would transport him; 3) the court kept the issue under its jurisdiction so that either party could bring the matter back upon two days’ notice; 4) the pre-trial conference was months away and the court did not find it appropriate to have the matter of increased parenting time proceed to a pre-trial conference, as a stand-alone issue. The court found that it was in the best interests of all the children to have further time with the petitioner as he requested. The court also dealt with transportation for the hockey and the middle child’s skating; 5) counsel agreed that the issue of arrears due under the support provisions would await further discussion at the pre-trial conference with either party having leave to bring the matter back on two days’ notice; 6) the matter was adjourned sine die on two days’ notice; 7) the complaints were not generally well-founded; and 8) the petitioner was entitled to costs of $1,000 in any event of the cause. The respondent was entitled to costs of $200 in any event of the cause. The court declined to send the matter to the high-conflict mediation program.",HELD: The Court granted the application. The Court held that it did not have a reason for the denial of the divorce. The court found no reason for it to vary the existing parenting arrangements. The child was now one year old and the respondent was the primary parent with the children. The parties had been separated for over a year. The respondent had made payments to the petitioner and the petitioner had been unable to transport the child. The issue was resolved prior to the matter coming to chambers. The fact it continued to be argued in chambers is perhaps more reflection of the lack of communication between the parties than any real issue surrounding this part of the child’s life. The order was made to allow the parties to proceed with the parenting arrangements and to allow them to decide on the parenting roles. The father was to pay for the child to attend the program. The mother was to advise the petitioner as to the child and the child was to be responsible for getting the child there. The petitioner was to have the child registered in the Montessori program.,"The parts of the various applications are as follows:
1. Application for Divorce – brought by the petitioner;
2. To register the child, Jude Babich, in a Montessori School – brought by the petitioner;
3. To take the child, Jude Babich, to a speech therapist – brought by the petitioner;
4. To vary the existing parenting arrangements set forth in the decision of Megaw J. dated January 20, 2015 – brought by the petitioner;
5. To set the arrears of child and spousal support – brought by the respondent;
6. To return the 2005 Volkswagen Beetle vehicle – brought by the respondent;
7. Objections to the petitioner’s affidavit of September 28, 2015 – brought by the respondent;
8. Objections to the petitioner’s affidavit of October 16, 2015 – brought by the respondent. [24] In the circumstances before me, I can see no reason for the denial of the divorce at this stage. Accordingly, the judgment for divorce is granted. 2. To register the child, Jude Babich, in a Montessori School – brought by the petitioner. On the basis of the evidence before me, it is therefore appropriate Jude now be enrolled in the Montessori program. [31] Accordingly, I order Jude may be registered in the Montessori program by the petitioner and begin attending as soon as the program is able to accommodate such attendance. The cost of that program shall be paid, at this stage, by the petitioner. 3. To take the child, Jude Babich, to a speech therapist – brought by the petitioner. 4. To vary the existing parenting arrangements set forth in the decision of Megaw J. dated January 20, 2015 – brought by the petitioner. [51] As a result of the foregoing, it is not appropriate to have the matter of increasing parenting time proceed to a pre-trial conference, as a stand-alone issue, even an expedited pre-trial conference. The petitioner seeks to have his parenting time set rather than at the whim of the respondent. 5. To set the arrears of child and spousal support – brought by the respondent. [63] As a result of this agreement, the issue of arrears of support and enforcement of any arrears from the date of the order to today’s date is to await the conclusion of the pre-trial conference. Accordingly, this issue will be adjourned sine die. Either party shall have leave to have it returned before me upon providing two days notice. I do not find the complaints to be generally well founded and rule on each concern as follows: [70] In the circumstances, I direct the petitioner shall be entitled to costs in the fixed amount of $1,000.00 with respect to all of the matters brought before the court.

They had three children, the youngest being born five days before a previous application. At the initial application the respondent mother was living in the family home and the petitioner was living at the family cottage and expected to move into the new home when it was ready. The petitioner did move into the home, which was a few blocks from the family home. The youngest child was almost a year old and the petitioner was having increased parenting time with him. The parties agreed to have a custody and access report prepared. The issues were: 1) divorce; 2) registration of the middle child in Montessori school.

The petitioner advised that the school was okay with the child not being potty trained; 3) to take the child to a speech therapist.

7_2018skqb90.txt,"Civil Procedure – Queen’s Bench Rules, Rule 6-75 The applicant insurance company sought an order for interpleader pursuant to Queen’s Bench rule 6-75 regarding premium surpluses it held in the amount of $3,550,800 that were generated between 1990, when it issued a group life insurance policy to the respondent, Agricultural Credit Corporation (Ag Credit), and 2015, when Ag Credit terminated the policy. The applicant requested that the monies be paid into court and that directions be provided as to how the determination of ownership would be decided. Ag Credit took the position that the funds paid as premiums were Crown funds and thus any surpluses were the property of the Crown and properly payable to Ag Credit as its agent. It argued that the interpleader order was unnecessary. The purpose of the group life insurance was to ensure that outstanding loans made by Ag Credit to borrowers were paid in the event of the borrowers’ deaths.

8_2015skqb144.txt,"The court concluded that the respondent was not a credible, trustworthy, or reliable witness for many reasons. The petitioner, on the other hand, was found to be a truthful and reliable witness. The court was also impressed with the petitioner’s witnesses because they were close family members, long-time friends, and her live-in partner. By contrast, the respondent’s witnesses were friends seen from time to time, neighbours, and his mother. The court found the respondent’s mother to be evasive and guarded at times. To determine custody the court reviewed the factors set out in s. 8 of The Children’s Law Act, 1997. The petitioner was found to be the primary parent of the child since his birth. The court was left with a degree of uncertainty as to the day-to-day activities of the child when he was with the respondent. The quality of the child’s relationship with the petitioner was found to substantially exceed that of the respondent’s relationship with the child. The court accepted that the child said disturbing things upon his return to the petitioner from the respondent. The child’s need for a stable, reassuring, and positive home were found to be met in the petitioner’s home. The court indicated that decreasing the respondent’s time with the child may ameliorate the adverse effect on the child’s emotional needs. The child was also found to be afforded more social fulfillment in the petitioner’s care. The petitioner also had more constructive plans for the child’s future. The respondent’s negativity towards the petitioner was found to negatively impact his ability to parent. The court concluded that it was in the child’s best interests to primarily reside with the petitioner. The petitioner was granted sole custody of the child so as to minimize further conflict between the parties. The respondent was given unsupervised access every other weekend. The court added $5,000 to the petitioner’s line 150 income for the personal component of her vehicle expense deduction. After determining the respondent’s income the court found that the s. 3 Guideline child support due by the respondent to the petitioner was $676 per month and that he should be responsible for 37 percent of the s. 7 expenses. The petitioner did not request child support but instead asked the court to consider it in the distribution of property. The respondent discharged the onus of establishing a common-law relationship of two or more years. The respondent’s pension value available for division was found to be $11,663.97.  The court did not find an extraordinary circumstance to warrant an unequal division of the family home. The value of the home was $360,000. The court used the date of application to determine the amount owing on the home. The petitioner also had rental properties and was given an exemption of $90,641.43 for those properties. After taking into consideration all of the property and exemptions, the respondent failed to prove that he was entitled to any distribution under The Family Property Act. The petitioner did not claim an equalization payment. Costs were awarded to the petitioner and the respondent was restricted from bringing a further court application until those costs were paid.","HELD: The Court ordered interim shared custody of the parties. The parties had been together for four years. The petitioner had previously filed an Answer and Counter-Petition in 2012 contesting the respondent’s claims for sole custody, specified and supervised parenting time, and costs. The respondent had previously been granted interim shared parenting time. The Court found that the parties had not spoken since the parties separated. The court ordered the parties to proceed to an expedited pre-trial conference. The judge ordered the parents to have Z. on a shared week-on-week basis. The mother had moved out of the home and was now living with the petitioner. The father had been receiving Worker’S Compensation benefits and top-up from SaskTel. The wife had moved in with the husband. The husband had been living with his mother for several months. The two parties had reconciled in December 2012. The child had been in the mother’ s house for a few days. The relationship had been going on for some time. HELD: 1)The Court found the parties were not in a relationship. The children had been separated for four months. 2)The parties had a provisional agreement that the child would be in the interim care of the mother. The parents would have access to the mother when the trial could be held. 3)The court found that there was no evidence that the father had physically harmed the child. The evidence did not support the petitioner’d claim. The fact that the mother had physically restrained the child from the father was not sufficient evidence to justify the claim. 4)The evidence did support the parties’ contention that the respondent had physically assaulted the child and that the petitioner had been unable to contact the father. The agreement was not binding on the parties as the child was not a party animal. The only evidence that could be found was that the husband had physically abused the child for several days prior to the birth of the child, and that he had physically threatened the petitioner and her mother.","I will now go through the factors set out in s. 8 of the Act. I find that despite what Mr. S. states, she was the primary parent of Z. since birth and continues to be so. Indeed I learned more (although not much) from his mother’s evidence as to the day-to-day activities. I am left with a degree of uncertainty. I accept that the child expresses these words. The child is in need of a stable, reassuring and positive home. I find that it is best provided in the mother’s home. I am concerned that Z.’s emotional needs have been adversely affected by the conduct of Mr. S. A lessening of Mr. S.’s time with Z. may ameliorate this. [145] Accordingly I am persuaded that Z. is afforded far more social fulfillment when in his mother’s care. I find that this adversely reflects upon Mr. S.’s ability to parent. [165] Therefore after carefully considering all of the above, I am of the view the following orders are in the child’s best interests, and I so order: (a) The petitioner, M.D.J., shall have sole custody of the child Z., born in June 2010, with his primary residence to be with the said petitioner. (b) The respondent, C.W.S., shall have alternate weekend access with the said child from Friday at 6:00 p.m. to Sunday at 6:00 p.m. to be extended to Monday at 6:00 p.m. in the event Monday is a school holiday. Therefore I accept the respondent’s argument and will add back into her income $5,000, which I consider to be fair. [170] I am satisfied that Z.’s s. 7 expenses for health, dental, activities and pre-school are about $5,061.35 per year (see P-28, tab 19 in P-8). I do not find the evidence supports an “extraordinary circumstance” as per s. 22(1)(a) of The Family Property Act (see Phillips v Phillips, 2010 SKCA 117 (CanLII), 362 Sask R 124). [186] Accordingly I accept that the exempt amount of the rental properties is $90,641.43 (i.e. $506,000 - $415,358.57). The result is that the respondent (petitioner by counter-petition) has failed to prove that he is entitled to any distribution under The Family Property Act, and I dismiss his counter-petition in this regard. (1) Ms. J. shall have sole custody of Z., with Z.’s primary residence to be with Ms. J. and Mr. S. to receive parenting time as set out above; (4) Mr. S.’s claim for spousal support is dismissed; (5) Mr. S.’s claim under The Family Property Act is dismissed without any distribution to either party;",0.0857843137254902,0.13747228381374724,"The court concluded that the respondent was not a credible, trustworthy, or reliable witness for many reasons.

The petitioner, on the other hand, was found to be a truthful and reliable witness. The court was also impressed with the petitioner’s witnesses because they were close family members, long-time friends, and her live-in partner. By contrast, the respondent’s witnesses were friends seen from time to time, neighbours, and his mother. The court found the respondent’s mother to be evasive and guarded at times. To determine custody the court reviewed the factors set out in s. 8 of The Children’s Law Act, 1997. The petitioner was found to be the primary parent of the child since his birth. The court was left with a degree of uncertainty as to the day-to-day activities of the child when he was with the respondent. The quality of the child’s relationship with the petitioner was found to substantially exceed that of the respondent’s relationship with the child. The court accepted that the child said disturbing things upon his return to the petitioner from the respondent. The child’s need for a stable, reassuring, and positive home were found to be met in the petitioner’s home. The court indicated that decreasing the respondent’s time with the child may ameliorate the adverse effect on the child’s emotional needs. The child was also found to be afforded more social fulfillment in the petitioner’s care. The petitioner also had more constructive plans for the child’s future. The respondent’s negativity towards the petitioner was found to negatively impact his ability to parent. The court concluded that it was in the child’s best interests to primarily reside with the petitioner. The petitioner was granted sole custody of the child so as to minimize further conflict between the parties. The respondent was given unsupervised access every other weekend. The court added $5,000 to the petitioner’s line 150 income for the personal component of her vehicle expense deduction. After determining the respondent’s income the court found that the s. 3 Guideline child support due by the respondent to the petitioner was $676 per month and that he should be responsible for 37 percent of the s. 7 expenses. The petitioner did not request child support but instead asked the court to consider it in the distribution of property. The respondent discharged the onus of establishing a common-law relationship of two or more years. The respondent’s pension value available for division was found to be $11,663.97.  The court did not find an extraordinary circumstance to warrant an unequal division of the family home. The value of the home was $360,000. The court used the date of application to determine the amount owing on the home. The petitioner also had rental properties and was given an exemption of $90,641.43 for those properties. After taking into consideration all of the property and exemptions, the respondent failed to prove that he was entitled to any distribution under The Family Property Act. The petitioner did not claim an equalization payment. Costs were awarded to the petitioner and the respondent was restricted from bringing a further court application until those costs were paid.","HELD: The Court ordered interim shared custody of the parties. The parties had been in a relationship for three years. The petitioner brought an action against the respondent for sole custody, specified and supervised parenting time, and costs. The respondent counter-petitioned, claiming division of property under The Children’s Law Act, 1997, C-8.2 [Act], joint custody of Z., specified parenting time for the respondent, restraining order against the petitioner and costs; the petitioner argued that the parties had not spoken since the separation and that they should have separated. The court ordered the parties to proceed to an expedited pre-trial conference and ordered the parents to have Z. on a shared week-on/week-off basis until trial could be held.","I will now go through the factors set out in s. 8 of the Act. I find that despite what Mr. S. states, she was the primary parent of Z. since birth and continues to be so. Indeed I learned more (although not much) from his mother’s evidence as to the day-to-day activities. I am left with a degree of uncertainty. I accept that the child expresses these words. The child is in need of a stable, reassuring and positive home. I find that it is best provided in the mother’s home. I am concerned that Z.’s emotional needs have been adversely affected by the conduct of Mr. S. A lessening of Mr. S.’s time with Z. may ameliorate this.

(b) The respondent, C.W.S., shall have alternate weekend access with the said child from Friday at 6:00 p.m. to Sunday at 6:00 p.m. to be extended to Monday at 6:00 p.m. in the event Monday is a school holiday.

The absence of reference to any other circumstances in which appeal would not be permitted was intentional. The decision of the arbitration panel constituted to determine the commercial contractual disputes between HAL, Secur Tek and SecuraTek was not inadvertent, but intentional.

It does not permit appeals on questions of law, which is something that the parties intentionally “contracted out” of it. 4)The provisions of the agreement between the parties (the IDSL, the SCA and ESMA) exclude the right of an appeal on a questions of fact, pursuant to s. 45(2) of the Act. It is trite law that parties who have commercial contractual relationship can, by agreement, abrogate appellate review of the arbitrator’s decision. While it is clear that there were some cases which require the parties to appeal an arbitrators’ decision, with leave, on a limited application, this supports treating contractual interpretation as a question of mixed fact and law. 5)It is clear from the wording of the arbitration agreements that the agreements in place between HAL, Securtek, and the ESMA contain an implied condition that permits them to appeal a decision made on a case-by-case basis, notwithstanding the absence of such provision in the agreements. The court can imply terms that are in the nature of things that go without saying.

The court found that a term permitting an appeal from an arbitrator’s decision on an error of law did not fall into the category of the obvious and was not the same as an implied term, such as that of good workmanship in contracts for repair. The contractual language used by the parties was clear that they intended to resolve disputes by final and binding arbitration.

The arbitration panel was constituted to resolve a commercial contractual dispute between HAL and SecurTek. HELD: The application was dismissed. 1)A term permitting an appeal from the arbitrators' decision on an error of law simply does not fall into the category of the obvious, or something that goes without saying, in the factual matrix of this case. Such an implied term is not akin, for instance, to the implied term of good faith in contractual negotiation, or the term of reasonable notice of termination in contracts of employment.

The agreements contained an implied condition that permits the parties to appeal arbitrators’ decisions, with leave, on the basis of errors in law.

It is not clear that there are some cases in which term must be implied in order to ensure that the intention of the parties is not defeated, or that the parties explicitly 'contracted out' of any rights of appeal. 4)HAL argues that the agreements signed with HAL contain a 'final and binding' clause that permits them to appeal an arbitrator’s decision on a question of law. It also argues that their contracts contain a clause relating to the minimum sales target (MIDSL). 5)The parties referred to one, and only one, specific instance in which an appeal would be permissible. In that case, the arbitration panel found that the agreement between the parties and the respondent did not impose an obligation on them to purchase a set number of licences from HAL. The respondent took the position that if it failed to comply with the MIDSL, it simply lost the rights to exclusive distribution, rather than being obligated to pay HAL for 25 licences regardless of how many were sold. It alleged that the respondent failed to meet its sales obligations and demanded payment of the shortfall. 5)With respect to the position advanced by HAL, a term permitting appeal from an arbitrators","[1] This is an application by Home Automated Living, Inc.

HELD: 1)The assessment was set aside and the matter was remitted to the assessor to be dealt with according to the manual. Both issues were dealt with in Cadillac Fairview v.

The s. 7 expenses claimed by the petitioner include dental work of $112.90 for Kristen, orthodontic work for Brina and costs associated with Brina's post-secondary education. It is uncontroverted that Brina has disabilities that necessitate certain tools such as a computer for her to be successful in her post-secondary training. HELD: 1) The respondent accepts responsibility for his proportionate share of the girls' dental and orthodontic expenses and there shall be an order accordingly. 2) The September 2004 consent order provided that computer repairs and equipment were included in Brina's s. 7 expenses. Accordingly the costs relating to the computer are legitimate s. 7 costs. 2) The crisis prevention class was a reasonable expense incurred on Brina's part and will assist her with her future plans. 3) The Zeller's supplies would normally be covered under the Table support and that expense is disallowed. 4) Brina's s. 7 post-secondary expenses are $7,123.72 and include tuition, crisis prevention class and books, required university books, bus pass, black cartridge for the printer, Shaw internet, Microsoft licence, computer repairs and updated virus protection.","FIAT: The petitioner applies to have arrears fixed with regard to s. expenses related to her daughter's post-secondary education and in addition requests that the amount to be fixed for ongoing s. 7 expenses.

As the mother had facilitated the father's access to the child and he had not demonstrated the same willingness and that the most important relationship in the child's life was with his sister, who resides with the mother, the trial judge found that it was in the child's best interest to foster that relationship and grant custody to the mother.

The father’s seeming inability to facilitate access to his mother and his sister was of considerable concern. 3)The child was essentially abandoned by both parents.

The evidence before her was not much supplemented by materials submitted by the mother. 5)The trial judge found that although the child could be bonded or attached to either of his parents in any meaningful way, the child would not be able to be permanently attached to them.

HELD: The Court found that the procedure proposed by the Court was appropriate and reasonable. It would differ in that the Crown commenced the trial the same way, calling its witnesses in a trial proper, and then the accused applied to the Court for leave in the case of the accused applying to the trial judge for leave. The Court reviewed the authorities which were filed by the Crown. The court found that in Provincial Court trials, it is better to leave judges the discretion to determine matters such as sufficiency of notice and the extent of the offer of proof. It also found that there will be instances where the defence, through no fault of its own, cannot provide a detailed summary of the evidence that it anticipates it will call in the application, and must assert entitlement at the earliest possible point of the trial. The admissibility of that evidence can be reserved by the court pending the determination of the Charter issue on its merits, and the application of s.24 remedy, if any.HELD: 1)The Court held that it would be unfair to the accused if it was left to defence counsel to decide what procedure should be followed, but at least, counsel should give timely notice to the Crown of the charter issue, and at trial, counsel for the accused should be able to state with reasonable particularity the grounds upon which the application for exclusion is made. 2)It was not appropriate to leave the court discretion to decide whether to allow defence counsel cross-examination or to require leave to cross-examine the defence counsel. 3)There will be occasions where the court will be reluctant to foreclose an inquiry into an alleged violation. There will be circumstances where no less severe order will prevent unfairness and maintain the integrity of the process.  4)The court found no justification for the proposed procedure.","1.

Kutynec, the court made the following determinations: 1) whatever procedures are used should not unnecessarily interfere with the inherent jurisdiction of the trial judge to control the conduct of the trial; 2) instead of creating procedures for Charter applications in provincial court, it is better to leave judges the discretion to determine matters such as sufficiency of notice and the extent of the offer of proof; 3) counsel should give timely notice to the Crown of the Charter issue, and at trial, the accused should be able to state with reasonable particularity the grounds upon which the application is made; 4) objections to admissibility of evidence must be made before or when the evidence is proffered; 5) the onus is on the accused to demonstrate on a balance of probabilities that he or she is entitled to a Charter remedy; 6) the trial judge should insist defence counsel state his or her position on possible Charter issues, either before or at the outset of the trial; 7) failing timely notice, a trial judge is entitled to refuse an application to assert a Charter remedy; 8) fairness may require the accused be given some latitude to explore potential Charter issues which he or she had no opportunity to develop prior to trial; and 9) the trial judge must control the proceedings to ensure this legitimate exploration does not become a fishing expedition.

This may require a judge to refuse to hear a motion where insufficient notice has been given, even when the motion involves an application to exclude evidence under s. 24 of the Charter. In R. v. Habhab, the court was asked to consider a procedure which involved entering into voir dire at the start of the trial and the Crown proceeding to lead their evidence at the outset regarding the Charter application and substantive issue. The court dismissed this proposal and stated that the case law implies it is the accused's obligation to lead the evidence on the voir dire. The court was not able to justify the proposed procedure.

The admissibility of evidence can be reserved by the court pending judgment on the Charter and any s. 24 remedy. An advantage of having the Crown evidence on record at the outset is it removes uncertainty as to the nature of the testimony as it relates to the Charter application.

It was obvious that counsel for the accused would not sit back and hope that something will emerge from the Crown’s case to create a Charter argument or assist in one counsel is already prepared to make.

b_2002skpc50.txt,"An application for a DNA warrant on the basis s.487.05 (the general warrant provision) of the Criminal Code with respect to DNA warrants does not refer to a form. The applicant suggested a tape recording would avoid the potential problems in bringing the application before a Provincial Court Judge. HELD: These concerns were raised in the January 21 decision concerning potential prejudicial or negative effects, which outweigh any requirement to swear the Information before a judge. An oath taken before a commissioner or notary is as valid as it is before a provincial court judge and avoids all the possible problems that relate to personal attendance. The intention is to make protocol work as flexible as possible, not impeding the police in their legitimate role, while making sure the court maintains its independence. Form 5.01 is specifically set out in the Code. Section 487.1 does not have a form, but even if it did and used the same words 'taken before me', that would elevate form over substance in a significant way.","The accused applied for a DNA warrant. The accused swore the Information to Obtain before a Provincial Court Judge. The Provincial Court judge had previously sworn the Information before a Commissioner of Oaths. The applicant had raised concerns about potential prejudicial or negative effects of a personal attendance before the judge. Dismissing the application, that the officer had to appear before the Provincial Court to swear the Information. The officer had not followed the proper procedure in dealing with this application. The court was of the view that the better practice is to put as much as possible in the Information as possible. The application if the sworn Information is delivered or faxed in secure way to the judge and then the judge can immediately deal with it and not have to have the officer come and appear at all and swear it.","I understand -- and I did when I made the order -- that s.487.05 of the Code with respect to DNA warrants does have reference to a form and Form 5.01 which is related to that, and that’s specifically set out in the Code. I’m of the view, especially because s. 487.1, which is the general warrant provision, doesn’t have a form, but even if it did have a form and it used the same words, “taken before me”, that to require that the Information be sworn before the Provincial Court Judge elevates form over substance in a significant way, particularly in the context of the concerns that I raised in that decision about the potential prejudicial or negative effects of a personal attendance before the judge. It’s my view that those potential negative effects or results outweigh any supposed requirement to swear the Information before the judge.

Pursuant to the Corollary Relief judgment, the husband was currently paying the wife $4,350 per month as spousal support. The wife now wished to increase the monthly support to a figure which would more closely resemble that assessed pursuant to the Spousal Support Advisory Guidelines, along with a substantial lump sum to compensate her for the underpayment of spousal support for the past two years. She also sought removal of a clause which provided for the discontinuation of support if the husband's professional income dropped below $80,000. The parties had been married for approximately thirty years and had one child, who was now independent. Application dismissed; the parties' current circumstances did not constitute a significant departure from the range of reasonable outcomes anticipated by the parties when the Agreement was signed. Both parties' income had increased since the divorce and the wife was not deeply in debt, as she alleged; there was no pressure exerted and no oppression during the course of negotiations; the Spousal Support Advisory Guidelines are not law and allow for exceptions to the general formulas provided, one such exception being the assumption of debt by one of the parties (the husband in this case); the spousal support figure recognized the husband's reasonable expectation of retirement and the fact that he was experiencing health problems; it was completely foreseeable at the time that the Agreement was signed that, given the wife's age, she might experience difficulty in finding employment in her narrow field; the subsequent increased value of one of the husband's properties was not a reason to vary the spousal support provisions of the Agreement.","The parties were married for over 29 years prior to their separation and had a daughter.

HELD: The agreement was valid and the applicant was bound by it. 1)The parties had been married for 29 years and had been engaged for 29 of those years. Although the parties had separated for over two years prior, the agreement was signed in good health and the parties' agreement with respect to spousals was not unconscionable. 2)The Agreement was signed with respect respect to the terms and conditions of the Agreement. The Agreement was not intended to be a complete and complete agreement. The agreement included the terms for spousa and the terms on which the parties agreed. 3)The agreement was not in substantial compliance with the objectives of the Divorce Act. The court found that there had been no change in the situation of either party since it signed. The husband had made modest mortgage payments and the wife was left essentially debt free while the respondent was assuming debts in excess of $300,000. The rental income more than covered the mortgage payment. 4)The respondent did nothing to take advantage or deference to the applicant's vulnerability. The amount of spousas payable by the respondent and the amount of the respondent were to be paid by the applicant in the amount set out in the Corolla Relief Judgment was $1,000,000 and the respondent had made no effort to reduce the amount owing to the wife. 5)The court found no evidence of coersion or coersion. The agreements were not intended for this Court to substitute what it might have ordered had the parties proceeded to trial. Although both parties were engaged in a long and successful marriage, the husband was in his late fifties when he received his doctorate and had spent time in the matriculation home.

At the same time as their divorce was granted a Corollary Relief Judgment was also granted which incorporated the terms of an agreement signed by the parties dated January 30, 2003.

Pursuant to the Corollary Relief judgment, the husband was currently paying the wife $4,350 per month as spousal support. The wife now wished to increase the monthly support to a figure which would more closely resemble that assessed pursuant to the Spousal Support Advisory Guidelines, along with a substantial lump sum to compensate her for the underpayment of spousal support for the past two years. She also sought removal of a clause which provided for the discontinuation of support if the husband's professional income dropped below $80,000. The parties had been married for approximately thirty years and had one child, who was now independent. Application dismissed; the parties' current circumstances did not constitute a significant departure from the range of reasonable outcomes anticipated by the parties when the Agreement was signed. Both parties' income had increased since the divorce and the wife was not deeply in debt, as she alleged; there was no pressure exerted and no oppression during the course of negotiations; the Spousal Support Advisory Guidelines are not law and allow for exceptions to the general formulas provided, one such exception being the assumption of debt by one of the parties (the husband in this case); the spousal support figure recognized the husband's reasonable expectation of retirement and the fact that he was experiencing health problems; it was completely foreseeable at the time that the Agreement was signed that, given the wife's age, she might experience difficulty in finding employment in her narrow field; the subsequent increased value of one of the husband's properties was not a reason to vary the spousal support provisions of the Agreement.","The applicant applied to vary the spousal support provisions of the Corollary Relief Judgment dated February 20th, 2003.

The court found that there was no pressure exerted upon the applicant and no oppression during the course of the negotiations or the signing of the Agreement and that the respondent did not take advantage of any vulnerability of the applicant as contemplated by the Supreme Court in Miglin (supra). 1)Although the parties lived in the same household for over 30 years, there had not been a significant change in circumstances since the parties’ separation. 2)The parties had a reasonable expectation of retirement. 3)The Agreement was sound when signed and met the requirements, objectives and spirit of all applicable legislation and legal principles. 4)It was not necessary for the court to determine the agreement was unconscionable. Rather, the court is to look at all of the evidence and determine whether one party took advantage of the vulnerability of another party in the negotiations. 5)The agreement was based on a common understanding of the economic and social consequences of separation and was not intended to be an exhaustive list and each case must be decided on its own facts.","[1] The Applicant, Marie-Louise Stening-Riding, has applied to vary the spousal support provisions of the parties’ Corollary Relief Judgment dated February 20th, 2003.

b_2011skpc30.txt,"The accused was charged with impaired care and control of a motor vehicle and care and control of a motor vehicle while his blood alcohol level exceeded .08. The accused was found in the driver's side of a vehicle with his legs near the pedals. His body was slumped over into the passenger side. The vehicle had collided with a power pole and sustained significant damage. The engine was running when the police arrived. There was no one else in the vehicle. The accused was transported to hospital where the doctor suspected he had a brain bleed and recommended the police obtain a blood warrant. The officer who swore the Information to Obtain the warrant indicated that the interior of the vehicle smelled strongly of beverage alcohol and the accused smelled of beverage alcohol. The Justice of the Peace did not sign the Information to Obtain. The issues before the Court were whether there had been a breach of the accused's s. 8 right to be free from unreasonable search and seizure and whether the Crown had proven beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused was in care and control of the motor vehicle. HELD: The blood warrant was found to be invalid, meaning that the blood samples were obtained as part of a warrantless search in breach of s. 8. The Information to Obtain the blood warrant did not depose that the officer believed the accused was the driver of the vehicle which had crashed into the power pole or that the accused was in care and control of the motor vehicle. The officer should have included information about the accused's position in the vehicle and that the accused was unconscious. Without this information, the Information to Obtain did not contain reasonable grounds to believe that the accused had committed an offence under s. 253 of the Criminal Code. However, the blood sample evidence was admitted after a s. 24(2) analysis. The Court held that the officer was acting in good faith and that he honestly held the belief that the accused was drinking and driving when he swore the Information to Obtain. The impact on the accused was technical in nature and did not seriously undermine the accused's rights. The Court held that the truth seeking function of the trial process would be better served by admission of the Certificate of Analysis. The Court found that the accused was in care and control of the motor vehicle at the time of the collision. There was no evidence that anyone else was in the vehicle and the position of the accused when discovered suggested he had been driving the vehicle. The accused was found guilty of driving while his blood alcohol level exceeded .08. The Court held that his blood alcohol level was between 236 mgs% and 283 mgs%.","HELD: The Court held that the information to obtain blood samples was not sufficient grounds to warrant a search. The Court found that the warrant to search for blood was invalid and that the Certificate of Analyst and the report from the analyst were not sufficient reasons to warrant the warrant. The officer who swore the information was not fatal to the warrant and the warrant was invalid. The court held that it was a breach of the accused's s. 8 rights under s. 7 of the Charter respecting the violation of the officer's s8 rights. The Certificate of Analysis was not necessary to warrant an application to search the blood of an accused. The information was obtained by the officer who testified during the voir dire and was not part of the warrant application. The certificate of analyst was not required to provide his reasonable grounds for belief. The evidence was not obtained by mistake. The warrant to be searched was invalid because the information contained in the information did not constitute reasonable grounds to the belief that the accused had committed an offence under s253. The Warrant to Search for Blood was invalid as the Certificate was not provided by the police officer. The affidavit was not prepared by the accused to be amplified on the evidence. The accused did not depose that he believed that the driver of any motor vehicle, let alone the driver, was the sole occupant of the vehicle, was unconscious with his feet located in the driver's leg/foot area of the car and his body slumped across the passenger's seat. The Crown did not provide sufficient detail in the Information to Obtain to permit the Justice of the Peace to determine that reasonable grounds existed for the warrant issue. The Information to Otain was a technical error and was therefore not fatal. The Order to Search For Blood was issued pursuant to s. 24(2) of the charter respecting the breach of s.8 rights of the person. The order to search was made pursuant to R. v. Garofoli (1993). The Court reviewed the whole of the material presented and determined that the certificate of analysis and the analyst dated April 2010, should be admitted into evidence at trial. The application to be taken under s24(2 of the Code was dismissed. The Act to Obtained was amended to include the Certificate and the Report dated April 2011. The provisions of the Act to Obey and the Charter were not amended.

1. While his ability to operate a motor vehicle was impaired by alcohol or drug operate a motor vehicle contrary to sections 255(1) and 253(1)(a) of the Criminal Code. I found that it did not and as a result there was a breach of the accused’s rights under s. 8 of the Charter to be free from unreasonable search and seizure. I then conducted an analysis pursuant to s. 24(2) of the Charter respecting the violation of the accused’s s. 8 rights. I determined that the Certificate of Analyst and the report from the analyst dated April 20, 2010, should be admitted into evidence at trial. He did not depose that he believed that Mr. Francis was the driver of any motor vehicle, let alone the driver of the Tempo motor vehicle which was registered in his name and which crashed into a light standard around 1:19 a.m. on January 10, 2009. [35] I am of the view that the information which Constable Strueby deposed in the Information to Obtain, when reviewed as a whole, did not constitute reasonable grounds for the belief that the accused had committed an offence under s. 253. Accordingly, I hold that the Warrant to Search for Blood was invalid. [53] While I have found that the blood warrant was invalid and that the seizure of blood samples from Mr. Francis breached his s. 8 right to be secure against unreasonable search or seizure, I am of the view that Constable Strueby was nonetheless acting in good faith when he obtained blood samples from Mr. Francis. While I have found the Information to Obtain in support of the blood warrant deficient, I am confident that Constable Strueby honestly held the belief that Mr. Francis was drinking and driving and was acting in good faith throughout the early morning of January 10, 2009. [56] With respect to this avenue of inquiry, I am of the view that the breach of Mr. Francis’ s. 8 Charter right was done in good faith and did not seriously undermine the interests protected by the accused. [70] The issue at trial is whether the Crown has proven beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused, Curtis Francis was the driver of the Tempo motor vehicle or alternatively was in care and control of the motor vehicle. [71] I am of the view that the Crown has proved beyond a reasonable doubt that Curtis Francis was the driver of the Tempo vehicle which collided with the power pole on 6th Avenue at 1:19 a.m. on January 10, 2009. However, when their evidence is examined as a whole I am sure that Mr. Francis was driving his Tempo vehicle when it collided with the power pole.

The court held that it was a breach of the accused's s. 8 rights under s. 7 of the Charter respecting the violation of the officer's s8 rights.

The information was obtained by the officer who testified during the voir dire and was not part of the warrant application.

Much of it is expressly disputed by the respondent or to the extent allegations are acknowledged by the petitioner to have some factual basis, that evidence relates to significantly dated matters. The problems with the petitioner's evidence of addiction are multiple and include: 1) It is not credible or reasonable to conclude that the respondent has an addiction to pornography or masturbation that makes it impossible for him to put the children to bed. The respondent's anger management issues have made it untenable for them to continue their relationship with him. The evidence from the petitioner herself supports this conclusion. It is also not reasonable to infer that he is the only person who can reasonably be considered a parent of a child who is prone to anxiety, depression, anger management, anxiety, and other problems. The petitioner is not entitled to have her opinion evidence rebutted by the Court of Appeal. She is not a psychologist or psychiatrist and has demonstrated no qualifications to make a diagnosis of the respondent's so-called addictions. She has no evidence that she has ever seen him masturbate in the presence of her children. She does not have any evidence that he has ever masturbated under a blanket while sitting on the couch watching sports or movies with the girls. The Court has no reason to believe that this is an appropriate way to deal with the risk involved with unsupervised access.  2) There is no evidence to support the petitioner’s allegations of sexual abuse or that there was any improper behaviour on the part of either parent. The facts do not support the conclusion that the child is at a risk to harm. 3) The evidence that the petitioner has given factual evidence is not supported by the evidence. It was opinion evidence that was not given and to which I cannot reasonably give weight. 4) The court must err on the side of caution, whether or not proper evidentiary foundation has been established, is not accepted.","[1] The petitioner’s application seeks orders granting her exclusive possession of the family home, primary residence of the children and supervised access only for the respondent father.

The court also found that the respondent responded positively and appropriately to the petitioner’s concerns regarding masturbation and pornography. The respondent indicated that he had not watched pornography since December 2014 and that software on his cell phone and computer provide assurances that he had not watched pornography to the petitioner. The petitioner did not dispute that evidence. The court could not reasonably give weight to the petitioner’s opinion evidence regarding the respondent’s alleged addictions. The court listed numerous problems with the petitioner’s evidence of addiction. The court was unable to conclude that there was a risk of harm to the children caused by the respondent. With respect to the petitioner’s allegation of the respondent’s anger management problem, most of the incidents were dated. The respondent had since taken anger management counselling, accepted that he suffers from ADD, and began taking medication for ADD. The court held that it was in the best interests of the children to continue to reside in the family home and that it would not be in their best interests for one parent to be classified as or be the primary parent. It was also in the children’s best interests that their parenting be shared on an equal basis. A nesting arrangement was found to be in the best interests of the children. The court ordered that the parties would have joint custody of the children and each party had exclusive possession of the family home when they were enjoying their assigned periods of parenting. The parents would alternate weeks living in the family home with the children.","FIAT: The petitioner’s application seeks orders granting her exclusive possession of the family home, primary residence of the children and supervised access only for the respondent father. HELD: The application is dismissed. 1) After considering all of the evidence, it is unable to conclude there is a risk of harm.  2) The court cannot rely on opinion evidence that the petitioner is not entitled to give and to which I cannot reasonably give weight. The evidence before the court is that the respondent has anger management problems that make him and his daughters fearful of him and addictions to pornography and masturbation that make it impossible for them to continue to reside in the same home. 3) The respondent has not provided factual evidence as background to his opinion. Much of it is expressly disputed by the petitioner or to the extent allegations are acknowledged by the respondent to have some factual basis, that evidence relates to significantly dated matters. 4) The Court must err on the side of caution, whether or not proper evidentiary foundation has been established, that the present situation is one of the most serious allegations that can be made against a parent, because there are risks the children need to be protected from. 5) The evidence is that there is an artificial set of circumstances that, other things being equal, would militate against the fostering of a proper post-separation relationship between parent and child. The court should not simply abdicate its responsibility to assess and determine the risk involved with unsupervised access. 6) There is no evidence the petitioner has rebutted the presumption that increased contact between the respondent and the children would in fact be to her benefit.","[1] The petitioner’s application seeks orders granting her exclusive possession of the family home, primary residence of the children and supervised access only for the respondent father.

He had been unable to obtain financing to buy out her share. The father, unrepresented by counsel, sought to have selected portions of 14 hours of taped telephone conversations with the children and wife admitted into evidence.

The mother was awarded interim custody of the three children in 1997. The father was ordered to pay child support of $405 per month but had made only one voluntary payment of $100. He agreed to abandon his appeal of the order for sale of the matrimonial home. He had been unable to obtain financing to buy out her share. The father, unrepresented by counsel, sought to have selected portions of 14 hours of taped telephone conversations with the children and wife admitted into evidence. He insisted the tapes were of central importance to his case; that they discredited the conclusions of the custody and access report and demonstrated abuse was occurring in the mother's home. HELD: 1)Sole custody was awarded to the mother. The father was to have access Friday from 5:00 p.m. until Tuesday at 9:00 every second weekend. 2)The tapes were admitted in their totality, unedited. The two lines of cases respecting the admission of audiotapes in a custody hearing were reviewed. The tapes had the opposite effect to the father's intent. The father 'alternatively interrogated the children about their mother; prompted them to make unfavourable comments about her; magnified every incident of childish squabbling into a crisis; magnified the children's distress over the marital breakdown, encouraged the children to run to his home at every opportunity; and generally undermined the mother's parental authority at every available turn.' The petitioner's depression had been ascribed to environmental stresses rather than innate. The father acknowledged that his drinking had lessened but not discontinued as he suggested in the custody and access report. 3)The property was to be sold. The father was responsible for mortgage payments from July 1998 until the date of sale as he had stopped making mortgage payments after the previous order while continuing to reside in the home. A corresponding adjustment in the net sale proceeds was to be made in the wife's favour. Child maintenance was to be satisfied from the father's share of the sale proceeds. 4)The mother's employment pension was to be divided equally and one half rolled into an RRSP designated by the father. RRSP's were to be divided equally. Furniture, furnishings and personal effects in their possession would be retained by each party. Hunting clothes or supplies and one half of the family photographs were to be returned to the father. The loan from the respondent's mother was statute-barred. No repayments had been made in 10 years. The debt for the half ton acquired after separation was the father's sole responsibility. 5)The prior order of $405 for child support remained in effect. The father made no income disclosure until trial and evidence of his 1991 income was unsatisfactory. Rental income was deemed to his 1998 income. No order was made for day care costs due to inadequate proof. The parties could seek a review if more comprehensive evidence were produced. 6)Judgment for divorce would be made final on the expiration of 31 days.","Although custody was the most conspicuous issue in this proceeding, there were questions of child support and division of matrimonial property that required resolution before the parties could put an end to their acrimonious marital breakdown. The father was unrepresented at trial. After listening to the tapes in their entirety, I am of the view they have the opposite effect. They speak volumes about the father's character and motivations while shedding little light on the mother's. HELD: The Court allowed the tapes to be admitted here in their totality, but on the condition they went in unedited. The Court was of the opinion that the tapes had the contrary effect as they discredited the conclusions of the custody and access report and demonstrated the abuse that was occurring in the mother’s home. The tapes were inadmissible unless their authenticity is established, they are shown to be true and unaltered record and the voices have been properly identified. They are subject to the standard test governing admissibility of evidence in that they must be relevant and probative.","[1] Although custody was the most conspicuous issue in this proceeding, there are questions of child support and division of matrimonial property that require resolution before the parties can put an end to their acrimonious marital breakdown.

[18] After listening to the tapes in their entirety, I am of the view they have the opposite effect. I am of a view that sole custody must be awarded to the mother. [31] The petitioner will have sole custody of the three children. [32] On the matrimonial property issues, the order of Noble J. should now be implemented and the property sold. As the respondent stopped making the mortgagee payments after that order, but has continued to reside in the matrimonial home, I am of the view he should bear responsibility for the mortgage payments from July 1, 1998 until the date of sale and there will be a corresponding adjustment of the net sale proceeds in the wife’s favour. As well, the arrears of child maintenance as calculated by the Maintenance Enforcement Office to the date of sale should be satisfied from the respondent’s share of the sale proceeds. [33] Pursuant to the provisions of The Public Employees Pension Plan Act, S.S. 1996, c. P-36.2, the petitioner’s employment pension as at October 28, 1997 will be divided equally and one-half rolled over into an RRSP designated by the respondent.

c_2012nspc18.txt,"The accused was charged with numerous weapons-related offences, including possession and trafficking. The police had intercepted numerous ambiguous calls between the accused and others and had interpreted the coded language used as involving discussions about firearms. The defence had been unsuccessful in arguing that the inferences drawn were mere hunches and the conversations could not support a reasonable inference that the subjects under discussion were firearms. A search at his parents' residence had resulted in the seizure of several firearms but none were found in the accused's actual possession. One of the issues was whether the accused had constructive or joint possession of the firearms seized from his parents. Accused found guilty on all the weapons' possession charges and some of the trafficking charges, but not guilty of careless storage of a firearm. It was clear that the accused had much more than a passive or quiescent knowledge of the guns seized from his parents' home and there were a number of indicators that he had a measure of control over them, such as his telling his father on occasion to get rid of them, his being notified immediately when one of the firearms went missing, the way he pressed his parents to explain how that could happen and his ability on other occasions to tell his father where in the home a particular firearm was located. However, despite his knowledge of the location of some of the firearms at certain times, the court was unable to find that the accused had stored the firearms in the manner they were found when the search warrant was executed. The evidence also established that he was stashing guns at locations other than his residence and he possessed those guns for the purpose of transferring them to others. The only reasonable inference to be drawn from the intercepts was that the speakers were talking about guns and the communications revealed the commercial nature of the accused's activities. Given that the accused had asserted a privacy interest with respect to an application to exclude the evidence arising from the police search of the cell phone seized from him, he could not now deny that the phone was his.",HELD: The Court found that the accused was guilty of possession of a prohibited firearm and that the evidence supporting the accused's claim was circumstantial. The Court held that the Crown had not proven the accused guilty of the firearms possession charges. The accused was charged with trafficking firearms. The evidence supporting his claim was that the firearms were not the accused’s. The court found that evidence supporting this claim was not available at the time of the trial. The Crown had provided notice of its intention to seek this amendment at the start of the defence’ s trial.,"Also as a result of the Part VI authorized intercepts, on April 29, 2009, Kyle Cater was charged with trafficking firearms. They are: the unlawful storage of a sawed off Cooey 84 shotgun, a Lakefield Mark II rifle, and an AA Arms Model AP 9 handgun, and ammunition, in a careless manner (contrary to Criminal Code section 86(1) x 3), unlawful possession of the sawed off Cooey 84 shotgun, the Lakefield Mark II rifle and the AA Arms Model AP 9 handgun (contrary to Criminal Code section 88(1) x 3), unlawful possession of a loaded prohibited weapon – the AA Arms Model AP 9 handgun, and unlawful possession of a loaded prohibited firearm – the sawed off Cooey 84 shotgun (contrary to Criminal Code section 95(1) x 2), unlawful possession of the sawed off Cooey and the AP 9 handgun, knowing that possession is unauthorized (contrary to Criminal Code section 92(1) x 2), and unlawful possession of two over capacity magazines, a prohibited device (contrary to Criminal Code section 92(2)). [9] On February 24 at the close of the Crown’s case against Kyle, I granted an amendment to Count #8 of the January 15, 2009 Information to allege, pursuant to section 95(1) of the Criminal Code, unlawful possession by Kyle Cater of an unloaded prohibited firearm - the AA Arms Model AP 9 handgun together with readily accessible ammunition that was capable of being discharged in the firearm. [43] I am unable to accept that Kyle Cater can assert a privacy interest in order to obtain the protection of section 8 of the Charter and then, when that application goes badly and the evidence is admitted, turn around and claim to be a stranger to the item in which the privacy interest resided. [101] I have concluded that the only reasonable inference to be drawn from the intercepts is that the speakers are talking about guns. He obviously also tried to exercise a measure of control, telling his father to get rid of what was there, to no avail. [168] The “Tracey” calls on December 7 and the January 15 calls indicate that Kyle had much more than merely a passive or quiescent knowledge of the firearms and ammunition at 80 Cavendish. [171] There are a number of indicators of Kyle Cater having a measure of control over the firearms at 80 Cavendish. Accordingly I find him guilty of Counts 4, 5 and 6 of the Information sworn January 15, 2009, unlawful possession of the sawed off Cooey shotgun, the Mark II Lakefield rifle, and the AA Arms AP 9 handgun, contrary to section 88(1) of the Criminal Code. I also find him guilty of Count 7, unlawful possession of a loaded prohibited firearm, a sawed off Cooey shotgun, contrary to section 95(1) of the Criminal Code, and of the amended Count 8, unlawful possession of an unloaded prohibited firearm, the AA Arms AP 9 handgun together with readily accessible ammunition capable of being discharged in the firearm, contrary to section 95(1) of the Criminal Code. [179] I further find Kyle Cater guilty of Counts 9 and 10 of unlawfully possessing the Cooey and the AP 9 knowing their possession was unauthorized, contrary to section 92(1) of the Criminal Code. And I find him guilty of Count 11, unlawfully possessing a prohibited device, two over-capacity magazines, contrary to section 92(2) of the Criminal Code. I am acquitting him of those charges. However I am not able to find beyond a reasonable doubt that Kyle had stored the three firearms in the manner they were found on January 15. I infer this from Intercept 7, a conversation on December 2, 2008 with D.M. and from the evidence that establishes Kyle was stashing his guns at locations other than where he was living. I find that the purpose of Kyle’s possession was offering to transfer it, that is, his purpose conforms to the Criminal Code definition of “transfer.” It was a firearms trafficking purpose. [207] My conclusions on the firearms trafficking charges can be summarized as follows: I find the Crown has proven beyond a reasonable doubt that Kyle Cater is guilty of Counts 3 and 4, relating to the .410 gauge shotgun; Counts 5 and 6, relating to the Derringer; Counts 7 and 8, relating to the .308 calibre rifle; and guilty of possession of the .45 calibre handgun for the purpose of offering to transfer it. [208] I acquit Kyle Cater of Counts 9, 10, 11 and 12 on the firearms trafficking Information. I find Kyle to be guilty of the possession of the .45 calibre firearm on December 28, 2008, a finding I am making in relation to Count 1 of the Information, not as specifically charged under Count 9 of the Information as I find that on or about December 7, 2008, Kyle Cater did not have possession of the .45 calibre handgun he was discussing at that time with I.E.",0.05561497326203209,0.12446351931330471,"The accused was charged with numerous weapons-related offences, including possession and trafficking.

It was clear that the accused had much more than a passive or quiescent knowledge of the guns seized from his parents' home and there were a number of indicators that he had a measure of control over them, such as his telling his father on occasion to get rid of them, his being notified immediately when one of the firearms went missing, the way he pressed his parents to explain how that could happen and his ability on other occasions to tell his father where in the home a particular firearm was located. However, despite his knowledge of the location of some of the firearms at certain times, the court was unable to find that the accused had stored the firearms in the manner they were found when the search warrant was executed. The evidence also established that he was stashing guns at locations other than his residence and he possessed those guns for the purpose of transferring them to others. The only reasonable inference to be drawn from the intercepts was that the speakers were talking about guns and the communications revealed the commercial nature of the accused's activities. Given that the accused had asserted a privacy interest with respect to an application to exclude the evidence arising from the police search of the cell phone seized from him, he could not now deny that the phone was his.",HELD: The Court found that the accused was guilty of both charges. The accused was not a party to the operation of Operation Intrude. The evidence presented at trial did not support the accused’s claim that the Crown had a reasonable doubt as to his criminal liability on the firearms possession charges.,"Also as a result of the Part VI authorized intercepts, on April 29, 2009, Kyle Cater was charged with trafficking firearms. They are: the unlawful storage of a sawed off Cooey 84 shotgun, a Lakefield Mark II rifle, and an AA Arms Model AP 9 handgun, and ammunition, in a careless manner (contrary to Criminal Code section 86(1) x 3), unlawful possession of the sawed off Cooey 84 shotgun, the Lakefield Mark II rifle and the AA Arms Model AP 9 handgun (contrary to Criminal Code section 88(1) x 3), unlawful possession of a loaded prohibited weapon – the AA Arms Model AP 9 handgun, and unlawful possession of a loaded prohibited firearm – the sawed off Cooey 84 shotgun (contrary to Criminal Code section 95(1) x 2), unlawful possession of the sawed off Cooey and the AP 9 handgun, knowing that possession is unauthorized (contrary to Criminal Code section 92(1) x 2), and unlawful possession of two over capacity magazines, a prohibited device (contrary to Criminal Code section 92(2)). [9] On February 24 at the close of the Crown’s case against Kyle, I granted an amendment to Count #8 of the January 15, 2009 Information to allege, pursuant to section 95(1) of the Criminal Code, unlawful possession by Kyle Cater of an unloaded prohibited firearm - the AA Arms Model AP 9 handgun together with readily accessible ammunition that was capable of being discharged in the firearm. [43] I am unable to accept that Kyle Cater can assert a privacy interest in order to obtain the protection of section 8 of the Charter and then, when that application goes badly and the evidence is admitted, turn around and claim to be a stranger to the item in which the privacy interest resided. [101] I have concluded that the only reasonable inference to be drawn from the intercepts is that the speakers are talking about guns. He obviously also tried to exercise a measure of control, telling his father to get rid of what was there, to no avail. [168] The “Tracey” calls on December 7 and the January 15 calls indicate that Kyle had much more than merely a passive or quiescent knowledge of the firearms and ammunition at 80 Cavendish. [171] There are a number of indicators of Kyle Cater having a measure of control over the firearms at 80 Cavendish. Accordingly I find him guilty of Counts 4, 5 and 6 of the Information sworn January 15, 2009, unlawful possession of the sawed off Cooey shotgun, the Mark II Lakefield rifle, and the AA Arms AP 9 handgun, contrary to section 88(1) of the Criminal Code. I also find him guilty of Count 7, unlawful possession of a loaded prohibited firearm, a sawed off Cooey shotgun, contrary to section 95(1) of the Criminal Code, and of the amended Count 8, unlawful possession of an unloaded prohibited firearm, the AA Arms AP 9 handgun together with readily accessible ammunition capable of being discharged in the firearm, contrary to section 95(1) of the Criminal Code. [179] I further find Kyle Cater guilty of Counts 9 and 10 of unlawfully possessing the Cooey and the AP 9 knowing their possession was unauthorized, contrary to section 92(1) of the Criminal Code. And I find him guilty of Count 11, unlawfully possessing a prohibited device, two over-capacity magazines, contrary to section 92(2) of the Criminal Code. I am acquitting him of those charges. However I am not able to find beyond a reasonable doubt that Kyle had stored the three firearms in the manner they were found on January 15. I infer this from Intercept 7, a conversation on December 2, 2008 with D.M. and from the evidence that establishes Kyle was stashing his guns at locations other than where he was living. I find that the purpose of Kyle’s possession was offering to transfer it, that is, his purpose conforms to the Criminal Code definition of “transfer.” It was a firearms trafficking purpose. [207] My conclusions on the firearms trafficking charges can be summarized as follows: I find the Crown has proven beyond a reasonable doubt that Kyle Cater is guilty of Counts 3 and 4, relating to the .410 gauge shotgun; Counts 5 and 6, relating to the Derringer; Counts 7 and 8, relating to the .308 calibre rifle; and guilty of possession of the .45 calibre handgun for the purpose of offering to transfer it. [208] I acquit Kyle Cater of Counts 9, 10, 11 and 12 on the firearms trafficking Information. I find Kyle to be guilty of the possession of the .45 calibre firearm on December 28, 2008, a finding I am making in relation to Count 1 of the Information, not as specifically charged under Count 9 of the Information as I find that on or about December 7, 2008, Kyle Cater did not have possession of the .45 calibre handgun he was discussing at that time with I.E.",0.02480270574971815,0.07177033492822966,"The accused was charged with numerous weapons-related offences, including possession and trafficking.

When he applied for another position, the offer was reduced to 30 days. The defendant refused to give him another job. He then applied for and was awarded a position in the company's regional office. He claimed to have no recollection of the meeting with the American manager. He also claimed that he was given a letter from the American executive suggesting that he could leave the company on three months notice and that he would be transferred to a new office in Halifax. He alleged that this letter did not refer to termination of his employment by the defendant but rather suggested that the company would give 30 days notice of its intention. The court held that to terminate without reasonable notice requires the use of very clear words. This means clear words are required to abrogate the implied term of reasonable notice of dismissal of employment.",0.1415525114155251

This is an appeal from a decision of Mr. Justice Edwards arising out of an interpleader application by the Shubenacadie Band Council to determine which of several parties was entitled to be paid a sum of money owing by the Shubenacadie Band under a construction contract entered into by the Shubenacadie Band with the respondent Paul Kenneth Francis for the construction of residential homes on the Shubenacadie Reserve. Mr. Francis is an Indian, a member of the Eskasoni Band, and resides on the Eskasoni Reserve in Cape Breton. Section 89(1) states:

""89. (1) Subject to this Act, the real and personal property of an Indian or a band situated on a reserve is not subject to charge, pledge, mortgage, attachment, levy, seizure, distress or execution in favour or at the instance of any person other than an Indian or a band."" The learned trial judge concluded that the sum of $101,636.33 owing by the Shubenacadie Band to Mr. Francis and held at the Council office in the form of a bank draft payable to the Band in trust was the property of an Indian on a reserve. He further held, applying a liberal interpretation of the Indian Act that assignments of book debts, both general and specific, were included within the wording of s. 89(1) of the Act. On the appeal L. Martin (1984) Inc. asserts that Justice Edwards misinterpreted s. 89(1) of the Act and that it is entitled to $70,000 of this fund by reason of a letter of direction from Francis to his solicitor instructing his solicitor to pay to Martin funds which were due to Mr. Francis from the Shubenacadie Band to the maximum amount of $70,000. I am, however, of the opinion that the Eskasoni Band is entitled to the fund by reason of having obtained the first general assignment of book debts from Francis and having registered it prior to Francis making further assignments notwithstanding that the holders of the subsequent assignments or directions to pay (which the parties agreed were assignments in the Agreed Statement of Facts) gave notice of the assignments they held to the debtor, the Shubenacadie Band, prior to the Eskasoni Band giving notice to the Shubenacadie Band of its prior registered general assignment of book debts.

d_2003skpc56.txt,"The accused was charged with driving while her ability to do so was impaired contrary to s. 253(a) and s. 255(1) of the Criminal Code and driving while over .08 contrary to s. 253(b) and s.255(1) of the Criminal Code. At the conclusion of the trial, the defence brought a motion to exclude the certificate of analysis as the demand flowed from an invalid approved screening device demand. HELD: The defence application to exclude the certificate of analysis based on a breach of s. 8 and s. 9 of the Charter was granted. There being no evidence upon which to convict in regard to the .08 charge, it was dismissed.  1) The Court found a distinction between 'had consumed alcohol' and 'has alcohol in the person's body'. The Court found the words 'had consumed alcohol' to be insufficient for the Court to conclude that the officer had a reasonable suspicion there was alcohol in the accused's body at the time of the demand. 2) There was no objective basis upon which a reasonable suspicion of alcohol in the body could be made. The evidence of alcohol on the breath was not reliable in the circumstances of this case. The admission of having had her last drink was possibly made after the demand and could not be relied on to formulate the required reasonable suspicion. The evidence of bloodshot eyes, empty beer bottles in a plastic bag with three persons in the car and the smell of alcohol coming from the vehicle could not alone support a reasonable conclusion of reasonable suspicion of alcohol in the body of the motorist.","The accused was charged with impaired driving and operating a motor vehicle contrary to s. 253(a) and s. 255(1) of the Criminal Code. The accused was also charged with operating a stolen vehicle contrary s. 254(2) of The Charter. HELD: The accused's application to exclude the Certificate of Analysis was dismissed. 1)The evidence of speeding, bloodshot eyes, empty beer bottles in a plastic bag with three persons in the car and smell of alcohol coming from the vehicle was insufficient to justify the demand. 2)The defence application to include the Certificate was granted pursuant to s24(2). 3)The words 'had consumed alcohol' were insufficient for the court to conclude that the officer had a reasonable suspicion that the accused had alcohol in his body. 4)The Court was persuaded that the words 'consumed alcohol' did not constitute insufficient evidence to conclude the officer's reasonable suspicion of alcohol in the body. 5)The court found that the defence application was not supported by the evidence of speed, blood, empty bottles in plastic bag, empty beers bottles in the plastic bag and smell alcohol coming out the vehicle. 6)The accused's admission that she had consumed alcohol was not sufficient to justify a demand for a breath sample which was not made pursuant to the Charter. 7)The issue of whether the words had consumed was not raised. 8)The Crown conceded that if such Charter breaches were found, the appropriate remedy would be to exclude a Certificate ofalyses based upon a breach of ss8 and 9 of the Charter pursuant to ss24(1). 8)On reflection, and having given careful consideration to the cases cited, I am persuaded the words ""had consumed"" are indeed insufficient for conviction to conclude. The words 'alcohol' are indeed sufficient for the Court to conclude on the evidence that the police officer had reasonable suspicion there was alcohol in her body at the time of the ASD demand.","Background [1] The accused stands charged that on or about the 16th day of July 2001, at Manitou Beach, in the Province of Saskatchewan, did ...
""while her ability to drive a motor vehicle was impaired by alcohol or a drug, operate a motor vehicle contrary to section 253(a) and section 255(1) of the Criminal Code
And
having consumed alcohol in such quantity that the concentration thereof in her blood exceeded eighty milligrams of alcohol in one hundred millilitres of blood, operate a motor vehicle contrary to section 253(b) and 255(1) of the Criminal Code."" [3] At the conclusion of the Crown's case, the defence brought a motion to exclude the Certificate of Analyses, such evidence flowing from an invalid approved screening device demand, which infringed the accused's s.8 and s.9 Charter rights. Upon reflection, and having given careful consideration to the cases cited, I am persuaded that the words ""had consumed alcohol"" are indeed insufficient for the court to conclude that the officer had a reasonable suspicion there was alcohol in her body at the time of the ASD demand. [29] Although this determination is unnecessary given my conclusion on the previous point raised, on the evidence before me I would clearly find there was no objective basis upon which a reasonable suspicion of alcohol in the body could be made. [31] This then leaves only the evidence of speeding, bloodshot eyes, empty beer bottles in a plastic bag with three persons in the car, and smell of alcohol coming from the vehicle. Objectively, these grounds alone cannot support a conclusion of reasonable suspicion of alcohol in the body of the motorist. [32] For all of the foregoing reasons, the defence application to exclude the Certificate of Analyses based upon a breach of ss. 8 and 9 of the Charter is granted, pursuant to s. 24(2).

The evidence of alcohol on the breath was not reliable in the circumstances of this case. The admission of having had her last drink was possibly made after the demand and could not be relied on to formulate the required reasonable suspicion. The evidence of bloodshot eyes, empty beer bottles in a plastic bag with three persons in the car and the smell of alcohol coming from the vehicle could not alone support a reasonable conclusion of reasonable suspicion of alcohol in the body of the motorist.","The accused was charged with impaired driving and operating a motor vehicle contrary to s. 253(a) and s. 255(1) of the Criminal Code.

He required extensive rehabilitation and would not regain his pre-accident physical and intellectual capacity. The mother successfully applied for a reinstatement of child support which had been discontinued by consent, pre-accident, when the son was residing with the father. The son, now 23 years old, was upgrading his high school marks at the time of the hearing and hoped to be admitted to a community college program. The father appealed. Appeal dismissed; the judge's decision to award support was not premised upon a finding that, pre-accident, the son had made a clear decision to pursue a further course of study but on the fact that the son intended to pursue his education and had not withdrawn from parental charge at the time of the accident. There was no evidence to support the allegation that the usual Guideline amount was 'inappropriate' in this case; the Act prohibited the consideration of public income assistance when fixing child support; given the uncertainty about the son's future, this was not an appropriate case for a time-limited order.","This was an appeal from an order made pursuant to the Maintenance and Custody Act requiring the appellant father to pay maintenance for his son.

On the basis of the outlined circumstances, I find that James, at the time he attained the age of 19 years, had not withdrawn and was unable to withdraw from the charge of his parents, since it was his intention at that time, and still is his intention, to further his education at a post-secondary educational institution.

d_2006nsca124.txt,"The accused successfully challenged the sufficiency of the grounds to issue a search warrant that was used to search her residence. Although the Information to Obtain was based on information from an anonymous, unproven source, the source's information was corroborated by independent information as to the accused's employment and residence. The only corroboration of the presence of a crime (a suspected marijuana grow operation) was from a FLIR test. The court found that the evidence did not rise above the level of suspicion, albeit strong suspicion. Corroboration of the employment and residence of the accused did not provide particular support for the informant's credibility; neither were results of the FLIR test and the presence of covered windows sufficient corroboration. The Crown appealed. Appeal allowed; new trial ordered. Although the trial judge articulated the proper test and began by analyzing whether the warrant could have been issued, the issue was later mistakenly transformed into whether he, himself, would have issued it. By weighing the probative evidence, the trial judge effectively substituted his views for those of the issuing justice and wrongly required the issuing justice to draw proper inferences as opposed to reasonable inferences.","The Crown appealed the decision of the Provincial Court Judge quashing a search warrant issued by the RCMP. The judge found that the warrant could have been issued had it been properly quashed, that the evidence obtained by the search was wrongly excluded and that the judge applied the proper test. The appeal was allowed and a new trial ordered. HELD: The appeal is allowed and the trial ordered as well as the reasons for the decision. 1)The judge was to consider whether the warrant was valid, the search could have occurred, the evidence was properly excluded and the judge properly applied the test. 2)The court substituted his view of the evidence for that of the issuing JP. The court found that in a review of the warrant, the judge had properly considered whether he would have issued it. 3)The Court found that a reasonable and probable ground for issuing a search was found. The Court substituted its view of what the issuing judge could have done. 4)The evidence obtained as a result of the search did not prove that there was a violation of the accused's rights under s. 11 of the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act. The evidence obtained was wrongly included. 5)The judicial standard of review was an objective one. The warrant was issued and the search would have been lawful. The officer who reviewed the warrant had a duty to consider the evidence of the person who had provided the tipster with the relevant information. The judicial standard was not appropriate. The issue was whether reasonable and reasonable grounds could have issued a search based on the information obtained from the tip. The Judge substituted his opinion of the issue for that held by the issuing Judge. 6)The appeal was granted and a fresh trial ordered on the grounds that the Judge had applied the appropriate standard of reviewing. The Appeal Court found the following: 1)There was no evidence of a violation by the police of the right to search. The search was lawful and there was no allegation that it was otherwise unreasonable. The decision of a judge to quash a search is a matter of fact. The trial judge was required to consider all of the factors that could be considered in a decision such as the factors set out in R. v. Garofoli for the review of an information to obtain search. In this case, the officer who examined the respondent's house by police with the Forward Looking Infrared (FLIR) imaging device was not satisfied with the information provided by the respondent. The result of that review was not a finding of a reasonable or probable ground.","Held: The appeal is allowed and a new trial is ordered, as per reasons for judgment of MacDonald, C.J.N.S.; Cromwell and Fichaud, JJ.A. concurring.

The landlord's reasons were neither unreasonable nor arbitrary, given the reality of the market and his past experiences with a winter vacancy. There may be other situations where consent could reasonably be withheld. The tenancy is declared to have been renewed for another year (with the understanding the landlord will allow the tenant to terminate at any point after May 31). Both parties acted in good faith and, while it might seem unfair to lock the tenant into a lease he believed had converted to month-to-month, the court must make the order the officer should have made in the first place.","This is an appeal by the Landlord from an order of the Director dated August 31, 2009. That order effectively permitted the tenant to convert what had been a year to year lease into a month to month tenancy. It also denied the tenant's request that the tenancy be deemed to have terminated because the landlord refused to renew for another year. HELD: The appeal was allowed and the tenancy was declared to have been converted from a year-to-year lease to a month-to‑month tenancy. The Landlord refused to consent, giving his reasons why he believed it was not in his interest to have the lease change from a one year to a year lease. The Residential Tenancies Officer stated in his reasons that based upon his reading of the Act, the landlord may not deny the tenant’s request to the lease be changed from a new year to month to a new lease effective September 1. He accordingly declared the tenancy had not been terminated, as the tenant contended.","[2] This is an appeal by the Landlord from an order of the Director dated August 31, 2009.

It places the Landlord in the centre of a consenting process and allows the Landlord to exercise some judgment, with the constraint that it not be arbitrary or unreasonable. [13] The reasons of the Landlord here are that, in his experience, this particular flat is much more difficult to lease out at any time of the year other than September 1, which has become almost a standard moving day in south end Halifax, in part because that is the start day for most student apartments. [17] In the result, I allow the appeal and declare that the tenancy has not been converted into a month to month tenancy, because the Landlord refused his consent in a timely manner, for reasons that were neither arbitrary or unreasonable.

Four months before it was set to automatically renew, he notified the landlord he wished to convert to a month-to-month tenancy. The landlord refused, saying vacancies were hard to fill at any time other than September 1st. The three bedroom rental was in an area with a large university student population and was targeted at individuals sharing not families. It was a high-end rental, and would not necessarily appeal to students. The landlord provided evidence that the last time it was on the market in winter, it was vacant for several months. After a Residential Tenancies Board hearing, an officer declared the tenant successful.

HELD: The appeal was allowed and the tenancy was declared to have been converted from a year-to-year lease to a month-to‑month tenancy. The Landlord refused to consent, giving his reasons why he believed it was not in his interest to have a monthly tenancy. This was a case where the withholding of consent by landlord had to be connected to the personality of the intended sublessee or with his probable user of the property: Houlder Bros. Co. Ltd. v. Gibbs, [1925] Ch. 575 (C.A.) This view of the law has fallen into disfavour and the modern approach is for court to put itself into the position of the landlord and, having regard to the surrounding circumstances, the commercial realities of the marketplace and the economic impact of the sublease on the landlord, determine whether a reasonable landlord would consent to the conversion of year to month to year tenancy. In this case, the landlord wants the lease to terminate on August 31/2010 but to alleviate hardship he has unconditionally undertaken to accept an early termination on any date from May/2010 until August/2010. The tenant asks that an earlier date be set, given that he has acted in good faith and had no way of knowing that his effort to convert the tenancy into month a month would be thwarted by the landlord. The landlord has been directed not to withhold consent in an arbitrary or unreasonable manner. This case raises an interesting and perhaps important issue under residential tenancy law and in particular what it means when a landlord has been ordered to withhold a month from a tenancy. An arbitrary decision would be one that is random or based on purely personal whim. An unreasonable one would have no credible rationale behind it.","[2] This is an appeal by the Landlord from an order of the Director dated August 31, 2009.

The accused had been released from prison on a promise to appear in court on a charge of sexual assault. He had been injured and was unable to walk. He was remanded in custody pending posting of bail. The surety visited the accused at the prison and agreed to be surety. The sentence for failure to appear was set aside. The court found that the accused had no concept of his obligations under the recognizance and mistakenly believed that his responsibilities or liability ended with his first appearance in Court following his release. The judge found that because the surety had no idea of his obligation under the condition that he continue to reside at his residence when required to do so, he should have had an opportunity to read the recognizer before signing it. The defendant had no interest in returning to Nova Scotia and had no intention of returning to the province. The fact that he had a disability and was not able to drive made it clear that forfeiture should not be ordered against him.","Hall, J.

The accused applied under s.20(4) of s.19(4)(a) to an order declaring that her interest in the Lincoln was not affected by any forfeiture order. HELD: The accused was found not guilty on both counts. The court applied pursuant pursuant to ss.20 and 19(4(a) of ss.19 (the ""Act"") for an application for relief from forfeiture. The charges against the accused were dismissed.  1) The court must first consider the gravity of an offence, the personal characteristics of the offender and the nature and extent of the interest. 2) The Court must consider whether there is any evidence that she consented to the purchase of the vehicle. 3) It is not necessary to address the Charter submissions with respect to s19(3), however, because Crown counsel consented. 4) The societal purpose of the Act, and the provisions related to the forfeiture of property, was alluded to by Whitman J.A. in R. v.

Liability and degree of personal injury were in issue. The claim proceeded under the simplified procedure under Part Forty of the Queen's Bench Rules. HELD: The claim was dismissed with costs. 1)The defendant had a duty of care to the plaintiff as owner and occupier. The courts have most often based the duty of care on the invitor/invitee standard. Maxay v. Ramsay Drugs proposed four-part inquiry to determine whether or not an occupier has breached its duty of care. 2)The plaintiff established on a balance of probabilities that she slipped because of water on the floor. The evidence did not support an inference that her footwear caused the slip or was a contributing factor. 3)An adverse inference was not drawn from the defendant's failure to adduce evidence confirming its employee had in fact cleaned the floor. The employee was no longer employed by the defendant. Neither party was able to locate him. 4)Some of her injuries were, in part, the aggravation of pre-existing conditions. The most significant injury was sprain to her left ankle, which had not been resolved primarily because the plaintiff declined to accept available treatment and failed to follow medical advice.

The defendant placed in issue whether it was liable to the plaintiff for the injuries she sustained in the slip and fall and whether it would be liable to its employees for the damage caused. The plaintiff was wearing running shoes without laces at the time of the incident. The defendants claimed that the plaintiff slipped on a puddle of water on the floor of the store and fell heavily to the ground. The plaintiffs claim dismissed with costs. The court reviewed the history of the Superstore and determined that the defendant met the legal standard of care imposed upon it in the circumstances and was not liable for the injury suffered. The evidence of the employees who had worked in the store prior to the accident was inconsistent with the standard set out in the Mollenhauer and Leibel cases. The Court also reviewed the defendant employees' affidavits and the sweep log. The affidavits of the two assistant managers employed at the store confirmed the cleaning regimen in place. The judge concluded that the defendants met the standard of caring imposed upon them in the situation and was therefore not liable. The claim was dismissed with the costs of the plaintiff's claim. The Defendant met the statutory standard of maintenance imposed upon the plaintiff and was held liable for injuries suffered by the plaintiff. The pre-existing conditions were aggravating factors. The Defendants did not contest the presence of water in the vicinity of where the plaintiff fell although it did not concede that it was the water which caused the plaintiff to slip. There have been many cases that have found slippery substance such as water on a floor of grocery store to constitute an unusual danger. The injuries were at least in part aggravation of pre- existing conditions.,"[1] The plaintiff seeks damages for personal injuries sustained when she slipped and fell while grocery shopping in the defendant's Superstore in Regina on March 28, 2000. The defendant places in issue:

(a) Whether it is liable to the plaintiff for the injuries she sustained in this slip and fall accident; and

(b) The degree of personal injury sustained by the plaintiff as a result of the accident. The plaintiff's affidavit asserted that on March 28, 2000 she was shopping in the produce department of the defendant's Superstore located at 1621 Albert Street in Regina when at approximately 3:45 p.m. she suddenly slipped on a puddle of water on the floor and fell heavily to the ground, injuring her lower back, right knee and left ankle. Suffice it to say that some of the injuries the plaintiff claimed occurred as a result of her slip and fall on March 28, 2000, appear to have been at least in part the aggravation of pre-existing conditions. A ""sweep log"" was kept for each department and entries of these cleaning activities were made and initialled by the employees performing the work. CONCLUSION [11] The defendant, as owner and occupier of the Superstore, had a duty of care to the plaintiff. On the basis of all of the evidence, I am satisfied that the plaintiff has met the burden of establishing on a balance of probabilities that she slipped because of water on the floor of the store.

HELD: The claim was dismissed with costs. 1)The defendant had a duty of care to the plaintiff as owner and occupier. The courts have most often based the duty of care on the invitor/invitee standard. Maxay v. Ramsay Drugs proposed four-part inquiry to determine whether or not an occupier has breached its duty of care. 2)The plaintiff established on a balance of probabilities that she slipped because of water on the floor. The evidence did not support an inference that her footwear caused the slip or was a contributing factor. 3)An adverse inference was not drawn from the defendant's failure to adduce evidence confirming its employee had in fact cleaned the floor. The employee was no longer employed by the defendant. Neither party was able to locate him. 4)Some of her injuries were, in part, the aggravation of pre-existing conditions. The most significant injury was sprain to her left ankle, which had not been resolved primarily because the plaintiff declined to accept available treatment and failed to follow medical advice. The inconsistencies in her affidavit and the physician notes or medical reports respecting her injuries and treatment were not relevant to this decision. 5)A 'sweep log' was kept for each department and employees made regular inspections of the sales floor area in every department. The plaintiff slipped and fell about an hour after the last sweeping. A regular program of maintenance was conducted in the area. The overall policies and practices of regular maintenance and responsibility of each employee were substantially the same if not identical to those considered in the Mollenhauer and Libel group of cases. The defendant met the legal standard of care imposed in the circumstances and was not liable for the plaintiff's injuries. To find otherwise would be to impose a standard that is inconsistent with that previously imposed by this court in almost identical circumstances.","The plaintiff sought damages for personal injuries sustained when she slipped and fell while grocery shopping in the defendant's Superstore. The defendant placed in issue whether it was liable to the plaintiff for the injuries she sustained in the slip and fall and the degree of personal injury sustained by the plaintiff as a result of the accident.

Some of the injuries were at least in part the aggravation of pre-existing conditions. 3)There have been many cases that have found slippery substance such as water or produce on a floor of grocery store to constitute an unusual danger. The defendants have most often based the duty of care upon the invitor/invitee standard. 4)The evidence was consistent with the decisions of the British Columbia Supreme Court in Bludau-Kugler v. Vancouver Community College (1998), 1998 CanLII 6709 (Q.B.) and Mollenhauer and Leibel group of cases. 5)Statutes filed by the defendant and affidavits of two assistant managers were inconsistent with the physician notes and medical reports filed in evidence and with information elicited during cross-examination. The plaintiff did not know the water was there but did know that water and other substances could be in the produce department and also knew that reasonable steps must be taken to prevent damage from the 'unusual danger'.","[1] The plaintiff seeks damages for personal injuries sustained when she slipped and fell while grocery shopping in the defendant's Superstore in Regina on March 28, 2000. The defendant places in issue:

(a) Whether it is liable to the plaintiff for the injuries she sustained in this slip and fall accident; and

(b) The degree of personal injury sustained by the plaintiff as a result of the accident. The plaintiff's affidavit asserted that on March 28, 2000 she was shopping in the produce department of the defendant's Superstore located at 1621 Albert Street in Regina when at approximately 3:45 p.m. she suddenly slipped on a puddle of water on the floor and fell heavily to the ground, injuring her lower back, right knee and left ankle. Suffice it to say that some of the injuries the plaintiff claimed occurred as a result of her slip and fall on March 28, 2000, appear to have been at least in part the aggravation of pre-existing conditions. A ""sweep log"" was kept for each department and entries of these cleaning activities were made and initialled by the employees performing the work. CONCLUSION [11] The defendant, as owner and occupier of the Superstore, had a duty of care to the plaintiff. On the basis of all of the evidence, I am satisfied that the plaintiff has met the burden of establishing on a balance of probabilities that she slipped because of water on the floor of the store. The evidence does not support an inference that the plaintiff's footwear caused or was a contributing factor to the slip and fall. A regular program of maintenance had been conducted by the defendant in that area of the store.

The evidence also suggested that the complainant had been sexually assaulted by the defendant when she worked in the justice of the peace's office. The court found that the evidence suggested that, as long as the complainant was aware that the alleged assault was taking place, the accused continued to pursue it.

e_2006skqb508.txt,"The Crown appeals the decision of the Provincial Court judge that found the respondent's rights under s. 10(b) of the Charter has been violated and in excluding the certificate of analysis, acquitted the respondent. The Crown argues that the trial judge misapplied the reasoning of the Supreme Court in R. v. Prosper in his analysis of the circumstances surrounding the police officer's demand for the respondent to provide his breath sample. The issue on this appeal is whether Prosper requires the police in the Saskatchewan jurisdiction, where faced with a detainee that has changed his mind and declined legal advice, to inform that detainee that he has a right to a reasonable opportunity to contact a lawyer and that the police have an obligation not to require the detainee to participate in any incriminating process until the detainee has had a reasonable opportunity to contact a lawyer. HELD: 1) Prosper addresses the issue of the police's obligation in jurisdictions where free, preliminary legal advice is unavailable. Oppositely, Saskatchewan has Brydges duty counsel available to detainees and no such obligation exists. Having reviewed the law as stated in Prosper, the Court concluded that the trial judge erred in finding that this case was analogous to the facts in Prosper, and in finding that the police officer had an obligation to provide a 'Prosper warning' to the respondent once the respondent had changed his mind and declined legal advice. 2) The police in Saskatchewan are required to provide any detainee with information so that detainee may access that legal advice. Once the police are confronted with detainee who changes his mind and declines legal advice, this waiver must be clear and unequivocal. 3) The evidence falls far short of proving that the respondent was frustrated, impatient probably, but not frustrated. The exchange lasted about minutes. The evidence shows a detainee who chose to neither wait for the telephone line to be available nor to telephone a private lawyer.","The Crown appeals the decision of the learned Provincial Court judge that found the respondent's rights under s. 10(b) of the Charter of Rights and Freedoms had been violated and, in excluding the certificate of analyses, acquitted the respondent. HELD: The appeal is dismissed. The evidence shows a detainee who chose to neither wait for the telephone line to be available nor to telephone a private lawyer. The trial judge clearly failed to address the fact that the detainee had changed his mind about seeking legal advice. The fact that he chose to wait for it to be unavailable and to telephone the private lawyer is a factor to be considered. The respondent's right to freedom of counsel is not violated. The accused's right under s9(b)(ii) is not to be tried in a jurisdiction where free, preliminary legal advice is available only to those eligible for legal aid. The Court of Appeal has reviewed the evidence and found that the respondent had not shown that he had a clear and unequivocal waiver. The court also found that, in situations where a detainee has asserted his right to counsel and been duly diligent in exercising it, the judge could not have reasonably concluded that the accused was frustrated. The appellant chose to call a private attorney rather than wait for his telephone line and the telephone to be accessible. The appeal court found that this was a situation where the detainee could not afford to retain private counsel and that the burden of establishing that the appellant gave an unequivocal waver was on the Crown. The Crown appealed. The issue on appeal is whether governments must provide Brydges duty counsel. Hearsay: The trial court found the trial judge erred in his application of Prosper to the case before him, not only because of the conclusion he reached on the evidence but on the interpretation of Prosper with respect to the issue at hand. The holding-off requirement was found to be in breach of the respondent’s s. 9(b). The trial judges found a breach of s. 11(b), and the trial court concluded that a detainee’ s. 8(b)) rights under the Charter were not violated by the respondent because he chose not to call the private counsel. The failure to provide an unequiv unequivocal warning was a factor in the appellant’ll to not contact a private counsel until he had had a reasonable opportunity to contact.

What precipitated the respondent's review in July 2006 was Meghan's departure from his home where she began to live independently with the prospect of attending college. What further propelled the continued action on the respondent's part was the publicity attendant with the Supreme Court of Canada's release of its judgment in July 2006. There is no reasonable excuse as to why the respondent did not seek a variation earlier, other than concluding that the respondent accepted $380 per month as reasonable in the circumstances that prevailed from July 2003 to July 2006. 3) There is no evidence of blameworthy conduct on the petitioner's part. There was no agreement or obligation to disclose tax returns. No written request was made pursuant to s. 25 of the Guidelines. No verbal request was made by the respondent which might fall within the definition of 'effective notice'. The increase in the petitioner's level of income over the years 2002 to 2005 is not so dramatic as to constitute blameworthy conduct that privileges the petitioner's own interests over her children's right to an appropriate amount of support. In 2002, the petitioner earned $32,800 and, by 2005, she earned $43,310. An increase of these proportions would not lead the Court to conclude that the petitioner was not contributing to her children's support in a satisfactory manner.

e_2008nssc216.txt,"The applicant school teacher asked to be discharged from $20k in student loan debts under s.178(1.1) of the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act. He had filed consumer proposal in 2001, which he completed successfully in 2006. He earned $50,874 (gross) per annum; was at the top of his pay scale; had two young children; and his wife worked half-time position at Aliant, earning $16,272 year. There were daycare costs when the wife worked, and the applicant's transportation costs were high (but reasonable). The wife had significant debts and no remaining credit; she paid around $1,000 month to service her cards. The applicant did not have any credit either. Their home had little, if any, equity. The AG agreed the applicant had acted in good faith, but contested whether he was (and would continue to be) unable to pay the debt. Application allowed. Permitting the applicant's family a reasonably frugal lifestyle, which the court found they had, would mean he could not pay off the loan. Using the Superintendent's standards, there might be a small surplus in the family budget, but it would take many years for the applicant to significantly reduce his liability. If the application were refused, he would have to consider bankruptcy.","The applicant sought an order under s. 178(1.1) of the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act that Subsection 178(2.1)(g) does not apply to his outstanding student loan debt. HELD: The application was denied. 1)The applicant had been in financial difficulty to such an extent that he would be unable to pay his liabilities under the loan. The Attorney General did not question his good faith in past dealings with his loans. 2)The respondent had a reasonably frugal family lifestyle which was what he had, but would not permit him to pay the liabilities for the loan, which was not his responsibility. 3)The Attorney General of Canada did not have the resources to discharge the liability now, nor in the next several years.","Subject: Application to be discharged from liability for student loans under Subsection 178(1.l) of the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act. Summary: A school teacher owed approximately $20,000 in student loans. Issue: The Attorney General did not question his good faith in past dealings with his loans. [1] The Applicant, William Blair Herve, asks for an order under Subsection 178(1.1) of the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act, R.S.C. 1985, c. B-3, (BIA) that Subsection 178(1)(g) does not apply to his outstanding student loan debt.

The attachment was text file with lot of extra characters, including messages that read 'good job, but am going to kill you' and 'I am so horny.' Although the professor had not taken the content of the attachment as threat, he had sent it on to university officials as he had been requested to alert them to any odd or unusual behaviour by the student. The student later advised the professor that he had typed the messages because he thought someone was monitoring what he was typing and he was trying to get reaction out of them. He also testified that he had not intended to send that particular attachment to the professor. Appeal allowed; conviction quashed. The trial judge erred in permitting inadmissible evidence to be adduced from the university administration to the effect that the accused had a psychiatric illness and, in failing to intervene when the Crown assumed that the student had put his character in issue and cross-examined him as to alleged prior acts of misconduct and other extraneous matters, the cumulative effect of which was fatal to the trial judge's findings of credibility. The case against the student was entirely circumstantial and it was equally open to infer that the words had been typed in the file to get a reaction from people that the student, rationally or otherwise, believed to be monitoring his keystrokes and did not constitute a threat to cause death to the professor.","The appellant was a student at St. Francis Xavier University when he sent an email to his computer science professor with an attachment. Although the professor did not take the content of the attachment as a threat, he sent it to university officials as he had been requested to alert them to any odd or unusual behaviour by the appellant. The police were contacted and a charge was laid against the appellant of uttering a threat to the professor to cause his death contrary to s264.1(1)(a) of the Criminal Code. The appellant did not have a lawyer when he stood his trial on May 14, 2008 in Provincial Court. The trial judge rejected the appellant's testimony as not being credible, as not having an explanation by the accused, and that the evidence given by the Crown was rife with hearsay and very prejudicial to the appellant, who had been advised by the police that the accused intended to kill the professor. The Crown argued that the message was intended to intimidate and be taken seriously. The evidence was rife in hearsay, very prejudicicial to his credibility. The court found that the Crown had not erred in calling the appellant as a witness. The accused was found guilty of utterning a threat and was sentenced immediately following the conclusion of his trial to an 18 month suspended sentence and placed on probation with conditions. The defence argued that it was impossible to think that anyone threatening death or serious bodily harm in a manner that was meant to be taken serious would not intend to do so. The appeal court rejected the accused's testimony that he thought someone was monitoring what he was typing and that he did not run it as he did de-bugged it. The Court of Appeal held that the trial judge had not entered into a formal or informal voir dire to determine if the accused had any relevant evidence to give. The Appeal Court held that it would be inappropriate to call a witness who was not counsel at trial to specifically address the appellant’s argument that the verdict was unreasonable. The only reasonable inference that one can draw is that the appellant thought someone had monitored what he wrote and that it wasn’t his status as a student. The inference that the court drew from the evidence was that the words were meant to get reaction from the reader of the e-mail. The fact that the e.mail was sent to the accused was not a factor in the decision to call the witness.","[1] The appellant was a student at St. Francis Xavier University in Antigonish, Nova Scotia.

Although the professor did not take the content of the attachment as a threat, he sent it to university officials as he had been requested to alert them to any odd or unusual behaviour by the appellant. The police were contacted and a charge was laid against the appellant of uttering a threat to the professor to cause his death contrary to s.264.1(1)(a) of the Criminal Code. The appellant did not have a lawyer when he stood his trial on May 14, 2008 in Provincial Court. He was found guilty and was sentenced immediately following the conclusion of his trial to an 18 month suspended sentence and placed on probation with conditions. Counsel was retained and an appeal commenced from conviction and sentence, alleging improper admission of evidence, unfair and prejudicial cross-examination of the appellant and a failure to give due consideration to a conditional discharge. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. The court found that the evidence was part of the “narrative” and that the Crown had no legitimate reason to call a witness. The Crown had not established that the appellant intended to harm the professor or that the words in the email were meant to intimidate or be taken seriously. The trial judge did not enter a formal or informal voir dire to determine if the appellant had any relevant evidence to give.",0.22011385199240988
e_2009skca40.txt,"This is an appeal from a judgment in which the trial judge held that the sale of farm land by the then 79 year old appellant was valid and that her solicitor in the transaction was not negligent. The appellant widow agreed to sell four quarters of farmland, including residence and some grain bins on the land, to the respondents by lease option agreement. The total price was $120,000. The terms were favourable to the purchasers, the monies being paid over years with most deferred until the final year. There was no interest. However, the appellant was permitted to reside in the house for her lifetime if she paid the utilities and the property taxes. The trial judge noted that the appellant resided on the land for years and there was no complaint made until the appellant's daughter, from whom the contract had been concealed by joint agreement between the appellant and the purchasers, found out what had happened. The sole issue on appeal was the applicable standard of review in H.L. v. Canada (Attorney General) [2005] 1 S.C.R. 401. HELD: Appeal dismissed. 1) There is no doubt that the central facts as found by the trial judge regarding the contract, the competence of the appellant and the relationship with and the conduct of the purchasers was supported by probative evidence. It is impossible for an appeal court to interfere with those findings, even if the Court had wished to. 2) With regard to the allegation of negligence against appellant's lawyer, contrary to what the appellant suggest, an independent meeting is not absolutely necessary for the solicitor to ensure comprehension of the contract. It is of course desirable, but the critical matter is for the solicitor to satisfy himself that the client comprehends the transaction. The trial judge found that the appellant understood all aspects of the contract. The matter of the timing of the private meeting between the appellant and her lawyer is not relevant, given that the appellant after the meeting continued to be prepared to enter into and perform the contract. If she had manifested some unease after she signed the agreement and then met with her lawyer but before the delivery of the contract to the purchasers, other issues and no doubt other evidence would have been considered in determining when the contract became effective in the circumstances.

The jury was advised that the trial judge had advised the jury that, if they concluded the photographs were of Mr. Horkoff, they should also conclude that he was driving the vehicle. 3)The appellant was not persuaded that the judge's comments were unreasonable.

He was sentenced to a total of 35 months in prison. [10] Mr. Horkoff grounds his argument on a number of concerns. They can be summarized as follows: (a) Constable Badger’s eye witness identification evidence cannot support a conviction, (b) the trial judge made inappropriate comments about whether, if it was Mr. Holoboff driving the Tempo, he could have outrun Constable Badger at the end of the car chase, (c) an adverse inference should have been drawn from the Crown’s failure to call the officer who was in the police car with Constable Badger, (d) the trial judge’s treatment of the photographs of Mr. Horkoff misled the jury about what had to be proven in order to establish that Mr. Horkoff was driving the Tempo, (e) the jury was improperly led to place particular reliance on an assessment of Mr. Holoboff’s credibility made by an R.C.M.P. officer who questioned him about possible involvement in the grow-op.

In convicting the accused, the trial judge rejected the evidence of third officer who testified that the only sign of impairment he noted on scene was that the appellant had alcohol on his breath.

[6] There are three issues on this appeal which I will discuss in the order they were raised by counsel in argument: 3. Does the conviction for impaired operation of a motor vehicle constitute an unsafe verdict? 3. Does the conviction for impaired operation of a motor vehicle constitute an unsafe verdict?

The first complainant suffered severe first and second degree burns to his face and to his shoulders as well as numerous puncture wounds and lacerations but was not critically injured. The accused was charged with aggravated assault on the first complainant and common assault on the second complainant. None of the inmates testified at trial other than the accused. The accused testified that he felt he was being shunned in the Block and had received threats from the first complainant and others in the complainant's group who were brandishing shanks earlier that day. The defence argued that the Crown failed to prove that the injuries caused to the first complainant fell within the definition of 'wound, maim, disfigure or endanger life'; and that the acts done to the first and second complainants were in self-defence as contemplated by s. 34 of the Criminal Code. HELD: The accused was convicted of both counts. 1) In relation to the accused's defence of self-defence pursuant to s. 34(2) pertaining to the first complainant, the Court found the accused did not believe that he was being assaulted within the meaning of the law and, even if he did hold this belief, such a belief was not reasonable in the circumstances. Further, the Court did not accept, on a subjective or objective basis, that the accused reasonably believed that the first complainant had the present ability to carry out the threat, notwithstanding that the physical aspect of the assault need not be imminent or immediate. Lastly, the Court found that the accused did not believe that he had no other option. The accused admitted that he had other options but chose not to avail himself of them. 2) The Court found it did not need to assess the application of s. 37 of the Code in relation to the common assault charge. Rather, the Court found s. 27 of the Code applicable and determined that the second complainant was legally justified to use as much force as was reasonably necessary to prevent the commission of an offence which would be arrestable without warrant.

The court found that, in all of the circumstances, the accused inflicted injuries to the victim that fit within the category of an aggravated assault, and also constitute grievous bodily harm. The Crown applied the test of'self-defences' under s. 21(1)(b) of s.22(1) of The Criminal Code, which established that the offences were committed in self defence. The test of identity was not the end of the analysis. The trial judge found that there was no issue as to identity. The only issue was how the accused would define self-defense under s34(2). The accused's action against the victim was done in a self- defence.","[1] The accused, Frederick Junior Knife (the “accused” or “Knife”), is charged with one count of aggravated assault and one count of common assault relating to a violent incident that took place in the maximum security unit of the Saskatchewan Penitentiary at approximately 8:30 p.m. on September 1, 2008.

The representative plaintiff and other investors purchased 'cells' in gold exploration prospect owned and promoted by Royal Crown Gold Reserve Inc. based on that defendant's representation that the purchase price was deductible from the purchaser's earned income for income tax purposes and the tax opinions provided by McMillan. McMillan's opinion letters were posted on Royal Crown's website. The representative plaintiff purchased the cells and then filed tax returns claiming deduction, which was disallowed by the Canada Revenue Agency. The representative plaintiff commenced this action claiming that he and others suffered financial losses due to McMillan's negligence. McMillan applied to strike the statement of claim on the grounds that it was devoid of merit pursuant to Queen's Bench Rule 173(c) and opposed the certification of the action on the basis that the relationship between them and the representative plaintiff was insufficient to found a recognized duty of care between a lawyer and a non-client.

McMillan should have been aware of the use made by the mining industry of opinion letters and taken steps to prevent their opinion being used inappropriately for the purpose of inducing potential investors to invest with their client. The Court also found that the Chambers judge did not err in certifying the claim of negligence as a common issue that predominated over other issues affecting individual members of a class. McMillan's argument that the factual base pled by the representative plaintiff did not establish a common issue to meet the requirements of s. 6(1)(c) of The Class Actions Act failed because, in this case, the class members suffered real losses allegedly as a result of McMillan's negligence. These facts coupled with the case law stating that a lawyer may owe a duty of care to a non-client and the plaintiff's affiant's evidence, established a common issue that met the requirements of the Act.","The proposed appellants sought an order pursuant to Queen's Bench Rule 173(c) striking the within action on the basis that the relationship between them and the representative plaintiff was insufficient to found a recognized duty of care between a lawyer and non-client.

The representative plaintiff and other investors purchased 'cells' in gold exploration prospect owned and promoted by Royal Crown Gold Reserve Inc. based on that defendant's representation that the purchase price was deductible from the purchaser's earned income for income tax purposes and the tax opinions provided by McMillan. McMillan's opinion letters were posted on Royal Crown's website. The representative plaintiff purchased the cells and then filed tax returns claiming deduction, which was disallowed by the Canada Revenue Agency. The representative plaintiff commenced this action claiming that he and others suffered financial losses due to McMillan's negligence. McMillan applied to strike the statement of claim on the grounds that it was devoid of merit pursuant to Queen's Bench Rule 173(c) and opposed the certification of the action on the basis that the relationship between them and the representative plaintiff was insufficient to found a recognized duty of care between a lawyer and a non-client.

e_2013skqb264.txt,"The parties had three children during their marriage. After the marriage ended in 1988, the husband respondent, medical specialist, moved from Moose Jaw to Ontario where his annual income was about $175,000. The children stayed with the petitioner wife in Moose Jaw. She was not able to work as registered nurse until she upgraded her education, which she slowly did as she could afford it. She and the children lived on very little income and relied upon social assistance because the respondent often did not pay child support. The parties were regularly in court. In 1994, the respondent left his position in Ontario and moved to Milwaukee, believing his prospects were better in the U.S. However, he lost his position in Milwaukee and opened his own clinic. His income dropped to as little as $15,000 in 2001. In this application, the respondent applied to vary two support orders, one made in 1998 and the other issued in 2001. He sought to expunge the arrears in respect of each and a declaration that the three children are no longer children of the marriage. His reason for seeking to have the arrears expunged was because he, now 72, wanted to retire in the next couple of years. The petitioner, 63, deeply in debt and on long-term disability, was still caring for one of their children because he suffers from schizophrenia. HELD: The Court held that two of the children had ceased to be children of the marriage as of 2002 and 2008 respectively. With respect to the third child, the Court found that as a result of the serious and long-term mental health problems suffered by him, he remained a child of the marriage. The Court then found that the respondent's arrears in respect of the 1998 child support order were $7,000. Based upon the respondent's imputed income of $109,000 per year established by the Court in its 2001 order, and the dates upon which the two children ceased to be so under the Divorce Act, the Court calculated the amount of child support owed by the respondent at $186,300. The Court rejected the respondent's argument that he could not afford to pay the arrears because his expenses left him with an income surplus of only $13,000. The Court discounted most of the claimed expenses and found that the respondent had $58,000 at his disposal and therefore had the ability to pay his arrears. The Court found that the respondent had chosen to minimize his earning capacity by staying in the U.S. in private practice and thus the respondent could not assert that the Court should use his actual income rather than his imputed income to vary the amount of child support he was ordered to pay in 2001. The undue hardship that the petitioner had suffered for 25 years constituted the most compelling reason for the Court to refuse to reduce or expunge the respondent's arrears. The application was dismissed and the respondent ordered to pay arrears and to pay child support in the amount of $927.","FIAT: The respondent sought to vary two orders issued in 1998 and 2001. He wants to expunge the arrears in respect of each and also seeks a declaration that their three children are no longer children of the marriage. HELD: 1) The arrear of child support arreared was $183,746. The petitioner was 63 years old and living with her mother. The respondent had not been paying child support for some time. He was putting money away for his retirement expenses. The wife was 63 and the child support was $186,738. 2) The respondent was trying to obtain a support order for his impending retirement. He had not paid child support in years. He did not have the ability to pay the arraars because he could have taken employment that paid him at least $110,000 a year. He knew that he was expected to maximize his earning capacity but simply chose not to. 3) The court found that the respondent did not meet the threshold for entitlement to child support. The court ordered that the arrow be reduced to $183.746 as the respondent had failed to meet his obligations under the 2001 order. The arrow was calculated using the income of the wife. 4) The Court found that it could not find that the petitioner did not not have a financial capacity to pay child support, which was $185,742. 5) The applicant had not proven that he could not pay child care expenses. 6) The petitioner had not demonstrated that she could not work as a registered nurse. She had no independent verification to support his claims of illness or how his medical condition might affect his ability to work or earn an income. The Court ordered that he pay $1,683 in monthly child support and $176,737 for child support expenses. 7) The amount of child care arreages owed by the parties was $32,865. The amount owed by both parties was the amount owed under the 2002 order. 8) The parties had been married for 25 years. The parties lived together for many years. They had three children. The husband had recently retired from his job in the United States. He now lived in a modest retirement community. The children lived with the petitioner for several years. 9) The husband was working in the city and had a long term disability. He paid child care costs of $1.5 million in 2001. The father had not received any support for the children for the past 12 years.","3) The respondent seeks to vary two orders, one that was issued in 1998 and the other that was issued in 2001.

The Court did not accept that assertion. 7) The applicant did not demonstrate that she had any financial means to calculate the amount of child support owed by the respondent. It was unnecessary to speculate as to the amount owing by the petitioner. 8) There were no special circumstances that would justify expunging child support obligations. 9) It is not unreasonable to assume that the child remains a child of the relationship until order of the Court or agreement of the parties.  10) The evidence from the petitioner was that she was unable to work as a nurse until she upgraded her education. The petitioner was able to work part-time and earn less than she otherwise would have. 11) There is no special circumstance that would require the respondent to pay more child support than he did.","3) The respondent seeks to vary two orders, one that was issued in 1998 and the other that was issued in 2001. He wants to expunge the arrears in respect of each and also seeks a declaration that their three children are no longer children of the marriage. I do not accept that assertion. Thabani suffers from a serious psychotic illness and has lived with the petitioner continuously. 22) In summary, I find that Mandela ceased to be a child of the marriage on June 30, 2002 and Bogani ceased being a child of the marriage on June 30, 2008 (June 30 being the approximate date of the end of the school year). Thabani continues to be a child of the marriage. 26) The arrears under the 1998 order are $7,008 and the arrears under the 2001 order are $176,738 ($186,300 - $9,562). 33) Considering the above, I cannot find that the respondent does not have the ability to pay the arrears, which I have calculated to be $183,746. 1.

After the marriage ended in 1988, the husband respondent, medical specialist, moved from Moose Jaw to Ontario where his annual income was about $175,000. The children stayed with the petitioner wife in Moose Jaw. She was not able to work as registered nurse until she upgraded her education, which she slowly did as she could afford it. She and the children lived on very little income and relied upon social assistance because the respondent often did not pay child support. The parties were regularly in court. In 1994, the respondent left his position in Ontario and moved to Milwaukee, believing his prospects were better in the U.S. However, he lost his position in Milwaukee and opened his own clinic. His income dropped to as little as $15,000 in 2001. In this application, the respondent applied to vary two support orders, one made in 1998 and the other issued in 2001. He sought to expunge the arrears in respect of each and a declaration that the three children are no longer children of the marriage. His reason for seeking to have the arrears expunged was because he, now 72, wanted to retire in the next couple of years. The petitioner, 63, deeply in debt and on long-term disability, was still caring for one of their children because he suffers from schizophrenia. HELD: The Court held that two of the children had ceased to be children of the marriage as of 2002 and 2008 respectively. With respect to the third child, the Court found that as a result of the serious and long-term mental health problems suffered by him, he remained a child of the marriage. The Court then found that the respondent's arrears in respect of the 1998 child support order were $7,000. Based upon the respondent's imputed income of $109,000 per year established by the Court in its 2001 order, and the dates upon which the two children ceased to be so under the Divorce Act, the Court calculated the amount of child support owed by the respondent at $186,300. The Court rejected the respondent's argument that he could not afford to pay the arrears because his expenses left him with an income surplus of only $13,000. The Court discounted most of the claimed expenses and found that the respondent had $58,000 at his disposal and therefore had the ability to pay his arrears. The Court found that the respondent had chosen to minimize his earning capacity by staying in the U.S. in private practice and thus the respondent could not assert that the Court should use his actual income rather than his imputed income to vary the amount of child support he was ordered to pay in 2001. The undue hardship that the petitioner had suffered for 25 years constituted the most compelling reason for the Court to refuse to reduce or expunge the respondent's arrears. The application was dismissed and the respondent ordered to pay arrears and to pay child support in the amount of $927.","FIAT: The respondent sought to vary two orders issued in 1998 and 2001.
