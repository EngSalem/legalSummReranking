"This was an appeal from a decision in Hall, L.J.S.C. reducing the appellant's support from $2,000 to $1200 per month. HELD: The appeal was allowed. 1)While there had been a radical change in the wife's circumstances, there was no link between the change in circumstances and the marriage. The appellant was encouraged to take responsibility for her own affairs and to continue her efforts to find employment. 2)The trial judge did not refer to the significant evidence of the respondent's accountant which indicated that his projected annual income for the respondent was $32,000. It was impossible to imagine under the circumstances that a substantial reduction in the husband's income could occur. 3)There was truly finality to the financial relationship between the parties. The principles enunciated in Pelech were not applied only to payors of periodic support for an indefinite period. Where the circumstances disclosed an intention that finality was intended, the principles should apply in their full vigour. 4)The appellant had established that substantial variations in the income of the husband self-employed business man could occur within 18 months of the agreement being executed. The trial judge failed to refer to this significant evidence in his reasons. 5)The appeal should be allowed in all cases where the Court could intervene and set aside the judgment and order of Hall.","This was an appeal from a decision varying the appellant's maintenance downwards. The parties had a traditional marriage, with the wife remaining at home and caring for their three children. Upon separation, they entered into a settlement agreement whereby maintenance was set al. $2000 monthly while the appellant remained in the matrimonial home. The agreement stipulated that the settlement was a full and final settlement on all corollary matters between the parties. The respondent subsequently remarried, underwent some difficult financial times and made the application which was the subject of this appeal. The appellant contended the terms of the agreement were final. Per Jones, J.A. and Chipman, J.A. (concurring for separate reasons), allowing the appeal and setting aside the lower court order, that while courts have ultimate jurisdiction in the matter of support, settlement agreements must be respected. There is no difference between an agreement which provides for long term maintenance and one that does not contain such a provision. The effect is to permanently settle the issue in both cases. To review the agreement, particularly after the lapse of a substantial period of time, could lead to grave injustices to one or both parties. Per Hallett, J.A., (dissenting), dismissing the appeal, that a settlement agreement which provides for periodic support payments indefinitely is very different than one which contains provisions for termination of support after a specified period. The causal connection test established in Pelech v. Pelech (1987), 38 D.L.R. (4th) 641, should not apply to payors of periodic support for an indefinite period. Such agreements do not have the degree of finality that was effected by the settlement agreement under consideration in the Pelech decision."
"FIAT. A lawyer who improperly revealed information from two of his divorce clients with respect to the charges against Stienwand et al. and her client improperly revealed the information to the investigating officer and the Crown quite properly disclosed the statements which had been conveyed to the officer. HELD: The information already disclosed is to some extent hearsay and is only marginally relevant. It is not necessary to reveal the name of the solicitor and, therefore, unless the Crown intends to call the informant solicitor as a witness, his name is not to be disclosed.","See also 108 Sask. R. 87; [1993] T.W.L. QB93357 QB93p186; and [1993] T.W.L. CA93115, CA93p60. The Court of Appeal had ordered the Crown to produce an itemized inventory of the information in its possession to enable the Queen's Bench to review the information the Crown should disclose to the defence. This fiat concerned several documents. The Crown had already disclosed the contents of each of these documents and the only matter remaining in issue was the name of the lawyer who released the information. This arose as a result of the action of a Regina lawyer who had improperly revealed information from two of his divorce clients with respect to the charges against LaPorte et al. The Crown quite properly disclosed these statements which had been conveyed to the investigating officer. HELD: It was not necessary to reveal the name of the solicitor and, therefore, unless the Crown intended to call the informant solicitor as a witness, his name was not to be disclosed."
"The appellant, while in the course of her employment was struck by a tile which fell from the ceiling of a warehouse owned by the respondent. The appellant commenced the action against the respondent for damages with the consent of the Workers' Compensation Board. The chambers application was made to determine whether the action was barred by s. 18 of the Act, there was an agreed statement of facts and the appellant was awarded compensation. She appealed. Dismissing the appeal, that the ban is against actions of 'an employer' not 'his employer'.","The respondent owned a warehouse and leased it to the appellant's employer. During the course of her employment, a ceiling tile fell and struck the appellant. Both the respondent and the appellant's employer were employers under the Workers' Compensation Act. The appellant received benefits under the act. She commenced the action against the respondent with the consent of the Workers' Compensation Board. The trial judge held the action barred pursuant to the act. Dismissing the appeal, that s. 18 of the Act bars actions against any employer to which Part I of the Act applies. It is not necessary that the employer be the appellant's employer."
"The plaintiff, Phoenix, applied for the dismissal of the action pursuant to Rule 20.09 of the Civil Procedure Rules. The plaintiff had been deprived of its interest in a fishing vessel, Sealife III, and the contribution to overhead and profit margin that it would have made to the plaintiff's seafood plant by its landings. The defendant argued that the weight of the fish received at the plant was not relevant and was therefore not relevant. Application to dismiss the action dismissed; the plaintiff had failed to provide the defendant with the information requested. The court found that the defendant had used the scales in its calculation of the value of the sealife III landings and, in some cases, had intentionally misled the plaintiff by failing to disclose them.","The defendants applied at the opening of the trial for dismissal alleging the plaintiffs had been misleading and had deliberately failed to disclose important information. Dismissing the application, that while the plaintiffs had failed to comply with Civil Procedure Rule 20.07, dismissal of the action was not warranted. The plaintiff was held liable for solicitor-client costs associated with the application and discoveries."
"The Crown appealed against a sentence imposed upon the respondent, a young offender, as a result of his having committed two armed robberies. HELD: Appeal allowed. 1)The sentence was not a fit sentence having been imposed on the young offender for the seriousness of the offenses, the need for deterrence and the need to uphold public confidence in the administration of justice. 2)The sentencing judge also sentenced the respondent to a term of secure custody for escaping from the Youth Court, a term consisting of the time he had spent on remand awaiting disposition of the armed robbery charges. 3)The sentences were to be served concurrently with the remainder of the 2 year term of closed custody.","A young offender was sentenced to 1 year closed custody on each of 2 armed robberies, the sentences to be consecutive to each other, but both being concurrent to the remainder of a sentence of 2 years closed custody which was already being served with respect to previous unrelated convictions when the accused escaped and committed the robberies. 18 months of the previous sentence remained to be served with the result that the total time in custody would only be increased by 6 months as a result of the 2 robbery convictions. The Crown appealed. HELD: Appeal allowed. The sentence neither reflected the seriousness of the offences nor provided adequate deterrence. The 2 new sentences totalling 2 years were made consecutive to the remaining term of 18 months as well as to each other."
"Saskatchewan: Two parents sought custody of the child on the grounds that he or she was best able to meet her needs. The central issue was what custody arrangement would be in Sophie's best interests. Each parent presented volumes of evidence respecting the shortcomings of the other, all with the view of discrediting the other's ability to act as a custodial parent. HELD: 1)The issues arose in the context of a divorce action. 2)Each parent was a capable caregiver. 3)The child had a special needs that required an upgrade in her development. 4)Because of his employment disability, he remains available to provide full-time care for the child and exhibits a very strong desire to do so. 5)Each party was granted joint custody with the child living with each parent during alternative weeks. 6)The court found that the child had the best interests of the marriage according to the principles outlined in McKee v. McKee. 7)The fact that each parent demonstrated better parenting skills than the other combined with the fact that their child was developing naturally and at a significantly early stage of her development required that additional assistance be provided to her. 8)The parenting pattern established by the Buckwold Centre was consistent with that of a parent who was trained in the field of child development. 9)The principles outlined by McKee were applied to the issue of custody. Both petitions were heard in 1995 and resulted in a decree nisi of divorce and an order granting custody to the applicant. The custody order was appealed.","A decree nisi and an order granting custody to the mother was made in 1995. Upon appeal the Court of Appeal directed a new trial. Changes in circumstances included the fact that the child was developmentally delayed and required a special program. A pediatrician testified that inconsistency in parenting approaches would further delay the child's development. HELD: Custody was awarded to the father. 1)Each parent was a capable caregiver. However, the father was available to provide full-time care due to an employment disability and exhibited a strong desire to do so. The past physical abuse of his former spouse was not considered relevant as it did not affect his ability to parent the child. 2)The mother was to have weekly access on two non-consecutive days for eight hours and two hours on a third day. The child was to sleep in the same bed every night."
"The applicant sought the appointment of the property guardian pursuant to s. 19 of The Dependent Adults Act. The applicant was a 76 year old gentleman born in 1920 and residing in the Biggar area of Saskatchewan. In 1994 he moved to Estevan, where he established a relationship with a Mrs. Essex. In 1996 he brought an application by way of a Notice of Motion to have the land registered in his name. This application was adjourned pending the resolution of the within application. HELD: The application was granted. The land was vested directly in the applicant's name. The court ordered that the land be vested in the name of the petitioner and that all other reasonable expenses be reimbursed. 1)The petitioner met the criteria set forth in s. 18 for the appointed property guardian. He was capable of managing his affairs and the balance was placed in the hands of the public trustee to appropriatelyadminister in his longer term best interests. 2)The court found that the petitioner was entitled to manage his property unless he was not competent to do so. 3)As there were no facts in dispute in the matter, the court was prepared to grant the vesting order. 4)The land was to be given to the petitioner as portion of the costs of the proceedings. 5)In the event that the respondent chooses to sell the land he will be compensated in the amount of $7,000 which have been expended in dealing with the issue of the registration of the land. 6)Costs were to be divided equally among the parties.","The applicant sought to be appointed as property guardian for his uncle pursuant to s19 of the Dependent Adults Act. The proposed dependent adult resisted the application and attributed his previous difficulty managing his affairs to a severe drinking problem but indicated that he had not been drinking for six years. The uncle had never been declared incompetent to manage his affairs. He voluntarily transferred the land left to him by his father and had allowed the trust arrangement to continue since 1951. Over the years, the land was transferred from the original trustees to various other family members and was presently registered in the name of the applicant nephew. There was no dispute that the uncle was the beneficial owner.HELD: The land was vested directly in the name of Selwyn Hand. The conditional stay in place pending the resolution of this application for the appointment of a property guardian was lifted. 1)The proposed dependent adult was capable of managing a significant portion of his business affairs and matters relating to his estate and property. However he required significant independent assistance in the management of the land held for his benefit. His suggestions and proposal to sell the land and travel were reasonable and financially modest. 2)The criteria set forth in s18 for the appointment of a property guardian was met and the Public Trustee was appointed to administer the balance of the proceeds from the land sale remaining after the uncle pursued his financial commitments and his dreams.  3)Costs in the amount of $7,000 were to be paid to the applicant in the event the uncle chose to sell his land. 4)Any proposed sale would be subject to the approval of the Court upon application of Hand. One half of the proceeds were to be provided directly to Hand to be dealt with as he chooses and the remaining half were to be administered by the Public Trustee in his longer term best interests according to the normal powers and procedures of that office."
"A cardiologist appeals an order made against him by the Joint Medical Professional Review Committee that he repay $207,821.03 in medical fees he received from the Medical Care Insurance Branch. The appeal is brought under s.49.21(1) of the Saskatchewan Medical Care insurance Act. HELD: 1)The Committee was mandated under the Act to determine whether the cardiologist's pattern of medical practice was acceptable to it considering that his billings to medicare were out of line with the billings by the other cardiologists in the province. 2)There was a reasonable apprehension of bias raised by the Committee's involvement in the hearing conducted by the Director and the Committee in preference to the uncontroverted expert evidence. 3)The Court was restricted to considering only the record of the proceedings of the Committee.  4)It is trite law that the rules of natural justice impose the duty to act fairly and to provide procedural fairness. 5)There were numerous errors of law, including that the Committee failed to provide adequate reasons for its decisions, namely by improperly placing the burden of proof on the doctor, by failing to take into account all relevant factors (i.e. Ignoring the statisticalanalysis presented on the part of the doctor that was more reliable than thestatistical analysis presented by MCIB); and by using and relying on the knowledge of the members of the committee as opposed to the uncontroverted experts.","Administrative Law - Judicial Review - Bias/Institutional BiasAdministrative Law - Medical Care Insurance - Medical Fees - Repayment - AppealProfessions and Occupations - Physicians and Surgeons - Cardiologist - Medical Fees_____ A cardiologist appealed an order made against him by the Joint Medical Professional Review Committee for repayment of  $207,821.03 in medical fees he received over a fifteen month period from the Medical Care Insurance Branch (MCIB). Alleged errors of law included improperly placing the burden of proof on the doctor; failing to take into account all relevant factors including the doctor's statistical analysis; considering it beyond his mandate to provide cost effective services in keeping patients out of the hospital; by using and relying on the knowledge of the Committee in preference to the expert evidence; the orders made concerning various medical services were not reasonably supported by the evidence. The numerous grounds of appeal also included breach of the rules of natural justice by reason of a lack of institutional independence. The application under Part 52 of the Rules of Court for a judicial review was brought to determine whether there was a reasonable apprehension of bias raised by the statutory roles of the Committee and Director or lack of institutional impartiality of the Committee or its lack of independence from the Director or MCIB. _____ HELD: The judicial review application was dismissed. The appeal was allowed and the repayment orders were set aside except for the orders respecting surcharges. 1)Natural justice issues: A reasonable apprehension of bias or institutional bias were not proven. The Committee provided adequate written reasons for its decision. The chairman refuted the allegations that the Committee heard and relied on evidence outside the presence the appellant about which he was not advised. Neither the Director nor the Committee acted in a prosecutorial fashion. Examples included the adjournment granted when the appellant failed to attend and the concession to his request that no cardiologist be placed on the Committee. 2)Errors of law issues: The statistical evidence could be considered by the Committee as a prima facie case. It was then open for it to call on the doctor to rebut the presumed departure from an acceptable pattern of medical practice. This did not shift the overall burden of proof to the doctor nor did it require him to prove his pattern of medical practice was acceptable to the Committee. The Committee did not err in law in misconstruing its mandate or by ignoring the statistical analysis presented by the appellant whose definition of the mandate was much narrower than envisaged by the legislation. It was not agreed that the Committee is not bound to follow the rules of evidence and the proceedings were of an investigative nature. The phrase 'balance of probabilities' means 'more likely than not'. To hold otherwise would make nonsense of administrative law and would violate the rules of natural justice. The distinction between the pattern of the doctor's billings and the pattern of his medical practice was more a matter of semantics than substance. If economics were the only consideration the review process would be a useless exercise and the statistical comparative evidence would be conclusive of the issue. There was no credible evidence that the members of  the Committee misused their expertise and relied on it rather than determining the issues from the evidence presented. 3)The appellant established that for the most part the decision of the Committee was not reasonably supported by but was contrary to the evidence. The MCIB statistics were flawed as a reliable comparison tool and the appellant's adjusted statistics were more reliable even if based on estimates rather than substantiated data. The appellant's medical practice was unique in three respects. He did not have hospital privileges and  had staff and diagnostic equipment equivalent to a cardiac care unit in the hospital; he ordered more diagnostic tests and did more follow up than other cardiologists and had extended office hours. 4)The decision of the Committee was varied to quash all repayment orders except for $14,239.76. The appellant admitted that many of the surcharges had been billed because of his erroneous interpretation of the tariff.  5)Leave was granted to bring the issue of costs back for determination if necessary."
"The plaintiff's residence, mobile home and contents were insured with the defendant who denied liability alleging that he intentionally started the fire or caused it to be started. HELD: The defendant was found to have met the onus referred to in the Grover Holding case and established that the fire was deliberately set. While there was no direct evidence to establish that the defendant set the fire himself, in the circumstances, the court drew the inference that it did or in the alternative, someone else had caused the fire.","The plaintiff's residence, a mobile home, was totally destroyed by fire in 1996. The insure denied liability on the policy alleging the plaintiff deliberately started the fire or caused it to be started. HELD: The plaintiff's claim was dismissed. 1)When the evidence of the three independant witnesses was considered, the defendant insurer met the onus referred to Grover Holdings and established that the fire was deliberately set. While there was no direct evidence to establish the plaintiff set the fire himself, the inference was drawn that he did or, in the alternative, caused someone else to do so.  2)Had the plaintiff been in the mobile home he should have been suffering to some degree from carbon monoxide poisoning, he should have been coughing, his hair should have been singed, he would have had soot on his face and his clothes would have smelled of smoke. 3)The plaintiff did not call evidence to rebut the fire investigator's opinion that a significant quantity of fire accelerant had been used nor was his brother called to confirm his testimony that he attempted to re-enter the mobile home after arranging for the fire department to be called."
"The parties were parties to a collective agreement signed in 1994 that established employee salaries for the period 1994 to 1996. The agreement provided for lump sum pay to its members as a result of a wage freeze. The union sued the employer for negligent misrepresentation. The employer applied to strike the employer's statement of claim on the ground that the union's claims were within the exclusive jurisdiction of an arbitrator. When the employer applied, the Chambers judge dismissed the application. The respondent appealed. Appeal allowed; the decision of the Chamber judge dismissing the application to strike out the employer was not made lightly; the court had a broad discretion to determine whether a matter should be arbitrable under the collective agreement; the arbitrator's power was limited to determining whether a claim was arbitrably made.","The appellant employer and the respondent union are parties to a collective agreement with effect from January 1, 1994 to December 31, 1996. The collective agreement established employee salaries for that period, with annual adjustments on January 1st of each year. Shortly before the agreement was signed, the Public Sector Compensation Act was passed, which rolled back and froze public sector salaries. In a letter to the union, the employer confirmed the wage increases provided for in the agreement would be paid to the employees as a lump sum following the expiration of the legislated wage freeze. After the expiration of the wage freeze, however, the employer refused to pay the lump sum on the grounds that it would contravene the Act. The union sued the employer in the Supreme Court, claiming the lump sum or, in the alternative, damages for negligent misrepresentation. The employer applied to strike the Statement of Claim on the grounds that the union's claims were within the exclusive jurisdiction of an arbitrator. The Chambers judge dismissed the application. The employer appealed. Allowing the appeal and staying the action pending submission to arbitration as provided for in the collective agreement, that the Chambers judge erred in allowing the action to continue. Where there is a doubt about the arbitrability of a dispute, that issue should generally be determined at arbitration. This reflects the central role of arbitration in collective bargaining labour relations, recognizes that arbitration is the forum best suited to conducting the necessary inquiry, and helps ensure that no one, absent sound reasons, will be left with rights but no effective remedy."
"FIAT. The plaintiff sought an interim mandatory injunction requiring the defendant to deliver all files, documents, records, plans, software or other TFPG related material respecting clients of the defendant. The defendant had entered into a Shareholder Advisor Agreement with the applicant whereby the respondent agreed he would sell and represent only the applicant's financial products and services which the applicant approved. In exchange for this the respondent received commissions from the applicant. It is alleged the respondent sold unapproved investments of competitor and as result he was terminated pursuant to the agreement. As well, the applicant claims the respondent continues to refuse to turn over its property and client files by carrying on the same business on his own. HELD: In order to succeed the applicant must also satisfy the Court (1) that the right to an interlocutory injunction is clear; (2) that there is a serious question to be tried and there is strong prima facie case; (3) that irreparable harm will result in the absence of the injunction; and (4) if there is doubt as to the possibility of an adequate remedy in damages, there must be a determination as to which party, on balance of convenience, is likely to suffer greater harm from the granting or refusal of injunctive relief.  In addition to numerous rights and obligations of the parties, the agreement agreed that any breach by him of any provisions may cause the company great and irreparable injury and damage which cannot be reasonably or adequately compensated in damages in any action in law, and the court, which has to make and enforce the order, can never relinquish ultimate control of it and responsibility for it.","FIAT. The former registered representative of TFPG was terminated for selling unapproved investments in breach of a Shareholder Advisor Agreement which permitted the sale of TFPG's financial products and services only. TFPG sought an interim mandatory injunction requiring the respondent to return all materials and files respecting TFPG's clients, to cease any contact with its clients, and to make no attempt to solicit any current or prospective client. HELD: The respondent was ordered to immediately cease all contact with TFPG clients whose account the respondent, or anyone associated with him, had administered with a view to soliciting or directing a client, affiliate or associate away from TFPG. The restriction would not prevent a client or prospective client from engaging in any business with the respondent nor was he prevented from advertising his services. 1)It was agreed that the respondent should return all of TFPG's files and materials with a right to make and keep a copy.  2)TFPG abandoned the relief sought respecting solicitation of any business of any nature similar to that of TFPG from any TFPG client or prospective client. 3)The agreement merely set out the terms both parties agreed to for valuable consideration. It was not unconscionable nor against public policy. The respondent had warranted that he had an opportunity to seek independent legal advice prior to signing the agreement. The applicant met the test for injunctive relief but the relief as set out in the draft order was too restrictive and denied others freedom of choice as to which party they wished to deal with. 4)A contractual right to injunctive relief is only one factor. The applicant must establish that the right to interlocutory injunction is clear; there is a serious question to be tried and a strong prima facie case; that irreparable harm will result; if there is a doubt as to whether there is an adequate remedy in damages there must be a determination, on a balance of convenience, which party is likely to suffer a greater harm."
"The accused was charged with sexual assault and touching of the complainant. The complainant was a close friend of the accused's. She recalled that the accused had always been in her bed when she was asleep, but she later recalled that he had moved over and touched her in the vaginal area, while she was still asleep. The accused denied touching her. HELD: The accused was found not guilty. On the total evidence, it was reasonable to conclude that the complainant would not be conscious of her immediate surroundings, and would be unable to identify any causative agent unless that medium or effect was still in progress when she became consciously and emotionally aware of her surroundings. The evidence was more impressionistic than probative of the facts alleged, and the complainant's testimony did not offer a reasonable valid connection between what she found to be happening when she awoke and her pre-waking bodily sensations. It was not persuaded that, on the information tried, that the Crown had proved beyond a reasonable doubt on the facts tried. Therefore the accused was not guilty as charged.","A 14 year old accused her friend's father of touching her breast while she was sleeping over at his residence with her friend. She also stated that just prior to this she was awakened by the feeling of someone touching her vagina. The accused was charged with sexual assault and sexual touching of the complainant., accused found not guilty; the complainant's testimony was internally inconsistent and her cross-examination revealed obvious errors which were never corrected to rehabilitate her credit. The evidence was more impressionistic than probative of the facts alleged and the accused's evidence raised reasonable doubts in the court's mind."
"An appeal from conviction on a theft charge where the value of what was alleged to have been stolen did not exceed $5,000 and the Crown may in accordance with s. 334 of the Criminal Code proceed on indictment or by summary conviction. The substantive distinction in the proceedings is limited to the range of sentencing upon conviction. HELD: The appeal was allowed and the sentence imposed was set aside. 1)The conviction was not supported by the evidence and could not be supported without application of the doctrine of recent possession.  2)There was conflicting evidence as to whether one person could lift the generator onto a truck without assistance or whether it was too heavy and awkward. This was not a critical issue. 3)The appellant argued on the appeal that in the absence of evidence to the contrary, it should be inferred that the accused acquiesced in or implicitly consented to the Crown proceeding by way of summary conviction by agreement. The appellant argued that the conviction should be vacated and sentence imposed in the Court of Appeal in preference to having the proceedings in the Provincial Court declared null.","An appeal from conviction and sentence for theft of an electricity generator valued at under $5,000 contrary to Criminal Code s.334(b). On the first appearance in October, 2001, the Crown advised it would proceed by summary conviction. The appellant pled not guilty. Defence argued that, in the absence of evidence to the contrary, it should be inferred that the accused acquiesced or implicitly consented to proceeding by way of summary conviction. Counsel agreed pursuant to s.786(2) to proceed by way of summary conviction and invited the court to treat the agreement as having been in place when the trial began. Both preferred the appeal to be heard in this Court or in the Court of Appeal. The appellant sought to have the conviction set aside on the grounds the verdict was unreasonable and not supported by the evidence; the trial judge failed to properly apply the doctrine of recent possession and did not provide adequate reasons for his decision. HELD: The conviction appeal was dismissed.  1)This Court had jurisdiction to entertain the appeal. The Provincial Court judge had jurisdiction as the trial proceedings did not violate s.786(2). 2)The trial judge did not misconstrue nor misapplied the doctrine of recent possession. The unexplained recent possession of stolen goods standing alone will permit, but not necessarily require, an inference that the possessor was the person who stole the goods. The elements of recent possession must be strictly proven if possession is the only evidence connecting the accused with the theft. Otherwise possession should be considered circumstantial evidence and weighed accordingly. There was no palpable and manifest or overriding error made by the trial judge in weighing the evidence.  3)Criminal Code s.687 appears to permit this Court to set aside the 9 month suspended sentence and to grant a conditional or absolute discharge. However, there was no transcript of the sentencing proceedings except for a few lines. If the transcript is not available, this Court may be reconvened to address the applicability of s.687 and whether it would be appropriate to vacate the sentence and embark on the sentencing process afresh."
"The appellant appealed the November 2004 decision of the Children and Family Services judge refusing to grant her the adoption she sought with respect to her four year old daughter. The appellant argued the chambers judge erred by failing to give adequate consideration to the factors he was required to consider in determining whether the proposed adoption was in the best interests of the child. She argued the loss of possible contact with and support from the father would be devastating to the child's relationship with her biological father. Appeal dismissed; the court was not to intervene with this judge's decision unless there is material error, serious misapprehension of the evidence, or an error of law.","The chambers judge refused to grant an adoption to a single mother of her own daughter as he determined that the child would not gain anything vis a vis the mother by such an adoption but would lose the potential for a relationship and support from her father. The evidence before the chambers judge was meagre but showed that the father had not seen the child for the past four years. The mother appealed., appeal dismissed; the chambers judge focused on the best interests of the child and did not fail to give appropriate consideration to the factors set out in the Act. He did not place too much emphasis on the child's loss of a potential relationship with and support from the father on the facts of this case."
"FIAT: The respondent moves for an order granting to her, (1) joint custody and primary care (residence) of the child with access to her former spouse with access also to her ex-husband; (2) interim child support in the sum of $700 per month retroactive to April 2006; (3) interim spousal support in $750 per month. The petitioner is bearing the full responsibility for family debt repayment in the interim. While I have already stated that debt repayment can be adjusted as a property issue, the reality remains that in order to pay creditors in a timely fashion, the petitioner has taken this responsibility largely onto his shoulders. Accordingly, it is ordered that the petitioner pay to the respondent interim spOUSAL support in a sum of approximately $700 (per month); 71% of special or extraordinary expenses as hereafter described; and 71% for special or ordinary expenses as well.HELD: 1) The evidence upon the issue of retroactivity is minimal and the positions are conflicting. Accordingly the petitioner is ordered to pay as support the child of $625 per month and 71 % of special and extraordinary expenses. The consequent reduction of family debt is a factor of this particular interim spielal support order and should not cause confusion when addressing any property issues in the future. 2) It is made no award as to costs.","FIAT: The issues on this application are with respect to extraordinary expenses and the quantum of spousal support. HELD: 1) The petitioner's income is $73,000 versus $29,000 for the respondent. The parties cannot agree if any of the expenses fall into s. 7 of the Guidelines as being extraordinary: $975 for child care, $500 for dance, $350 for school activities, and $1,140 for asthma medication. 2) The court does not believe that the 'reasonable coverage' definition contained in the May 1, 2006 amendment is new law. At best, it is a single test now enunciated in legislative form which should provide for more consistency and predictability as opposed to the many attempts to articulate a definition of extraordinary which is found in the case law. What items claimed are necessary to attain the child's best interests and yet are reasonable given the economic circumstances of the child and her parents? Which items might be reasonably covered by the sum of the parent's income plus child support? 2) The child care costs and asthma medication costs are of sufficient amount and peculiar to this child as to be extraordinary or not expected to be reasonably covered from the table amount of child support and the respondent's income.  3) With respect to spousal support, neither counsel referred to the spousal support guidelines and the formula for spouses with children which measures the difference between the individual net disposable incomes of each former spouse. These guidelines suggest that an award of between 40% to 46% of that difference in individual net disposable income be paid by the spouse with the higher INDI to the former spouse with the lower INDI. These guidelines create a rough ballpark of $900 to $1,100 per month in this particular case. However, the petitioner is bearing the full responsibility for family debt repayment in the interim. In order to pay creditors in a timely fashion, the petitioner has taken this responsibility onto his shoulders. In the circumstances, it is ordered that the petitioner pay to the respondent interim spousal support of $700. The consequent reduction of family debt is therefore a factor of this particular interim spousal support order and should not cause confusion when addressing any property issue in the future."
"FIAT: In October 2005, a referendum was held within the student body of the University of Saskatchewan to determine if the University OF Saskatchewan Student Union should join the Canadian Federation of Students and its related corporation, The Canadian Federation OF Students (CFS-S). The result favoured joining the federation. The applicant applies under The Non-Profit Corporations Act, 1995 seeking sundry relief, the net result of which would set aside the outcome of the referendum. HELD: 1) The applicant has no standing to bring an application under s. 135 of the Non-profit Corporation Act. The EB has been established as the administrative and policing body of The Canadian federation. It is discretionary and the court may add the CFS as a party to the application. 2) The EB was given the task of conducting elections and referenda as outlined in the Constitution and the Guidelines. 3) The Elections Board was given authority to ratify the referendum results. The Elections Department was given jurisdiction to deal with the issues of whether the applicant has standing under s 135 of The Non Profit Corporations act. 4) The respondent was dismissed from the application by CFS to cross-examine the applicant. In this jurisdiction such relief is discretionary. 5) The burden lies on the party seeking the right to cross examine to show the examination will assist in resolving the issue before the chambers judge. That bar was not cleared. 6) The substantive issues distill to whether the respondent has standing (whether the applicant had standing under ss. 225 of the Act, if so, whether the defendants responsible for the conduct of the election have shown that such irregularities did not affect the result.","FIAT: In October 2005, a referendum was held within the student body of the University of Saskatchewan to determine whether the University of Saskatchewan Students Union should join the Canadian Federation of Students and its related corporation, the Canadian Federation of Students-Services. The result favoured joining the federation. The applicant applies under The Non-Profit Corporations Act, 1995 seeking sundry relief, the net result of which would set aside the outcome of the referendum. HELD: 1) The test emanating from the Controverted elections cases are not applicable. In debates of this type, the preferred guidance is from the test articulated in Walton (Litigation Guardian of) v. Saskatchewan Hockey Association and the related cases dealing with non-profit organizations. In those cases, the Court does not ask itself whether the results have been skewed, but rather has the organization acted in good faith and generally in accord with the concepts of natural justice? This does not mean that there must be an exacting legal process or an application of the full 'panoply' of procedural natural justice issues. The question is has the organization acted in a fashion that meets the legitimate expectations of a fair-minded observer? 2) No reasonable observer could conclude that the USC approached the post-vote process in good faith or in a fashion that is in harmony with the broad rules of natural justice. When faced with a result (rendered by a procedure which it had specifically established for the referendum) which was not consistent with its wishes, the USC simply ignored its own rules and imposed its own preordained outcome. Accordingly, the Court concluded that the USC breached its obligation to act in good faith and conducted itself in a fashion inconsistent with natural justice. The applicant is entitled to a portion of the relief he seeks. The referendum held by the USSU on the issue of whether it should join the CFS is of no force or effect."
"The plaintiff agreed to sell its entire inventory of farm equipment at an unreserved auction. The guarantee was supplied by the defendant Ritchie Bros. Auctioneers. The auction was to be conducted by LeBlanc Auction Services. The plaintiff was first approached to become a potential customer. In the transitional period, the contractual negotiations between the plaintiff and the defendants generated two standard form agreements, a preliminary 'LeBlanc' contract dated December 2003 and a subsequent 'Ritchie Bros.' contract dated March 28 2004. Both parties refused to pay the plaintiff the guaranteed price. After the auction sale was concluded, the defendants declared its guarantee unenforceable under provisions of the Contract to Auction and charged the plaintiff a commission of 14% on the gross proceeds of sale. HELD: 1) While a number of issues require exploration in the present case, the preeminent question is whether the plaintiff, the owner of certain farm equipment consigned for sale at unreserved auctions, has indirectly allowed another individual to bid on its behalf, or for its own benefit. 2) The case has much to do with the unique nature of 'unreserved auctions', where goods are sold to the highest bidder and the owner is precluded from affecting sale prices either by the use of reserve bids or through involvement, directly or indirectly in the bidding process. 3) There are indications that the plaintiff did not feel inescapably bound to contract with the defendants at that point in time. While the defendants appeared to have achieved their major objectives, namely a guaranteed price for his equipment, and a sale in their competitor's backyard, all of them were apparently too busy to attend to details. 4) The plaintiff's alleged breaches were not central to the decision in the final analysis.","The primary issue is whether the plaintiff, the owner of certain farm equipment consigned for sale at unreserved auction, has indirectly allowed another individual to bid on its behalf, or for its own benefit. The plaintiff corporation agreed to sell its entire inventory of farm equipment at unreserved auction for a guaranteed return of $577,500. The guarantee was given by the defendant corporate auctioneers (Ritchie). The auction was to be conducted by the defendant corporate auctioneers (LeBlanc), a newly formed division of Ritchie. After the auction sale was concluded, the defendant refused to pay the plaintiff the guaranteed price. The defendant declared the guarantee unenforceable under provisions of the 'Contract to Auction' and ultimately charged the plaintiff a commission of 14% on the gross proceeds. The defendant alleges that the plaintiff indirectly allowed another individual to bid on its behalf or for its own benefit. HELD: 1) Clause 3.07 of the Contract to Auction prohibits an owner from bidding directly or indirectly, and from allowing any other person to bid on his behalf. The issue here is whether the plaintiff allowed a family member to bid for the plaintiff's benefit. A family member can be a bona fide purchaser as well as anyone else, but the nature of an unreserved auction dictate that such relationships be disclosed to the public. The essence of the problem and the underlying purpose behind clause 3.07 is to protect bona fide bidders, and to ensure that there be no surreptitious bidding by another for the owner's benefit. 2) The plaintiff allowed Mr. Caruk to bid at the sale for the plaintiff's benefit. It went beyond the passive act of allowing him to bid. It actively facilitated bidding. Mr. Caruk acknowledged he had no money to buy equipment. The plaintiff lent him up to $100,000 for that express purpose. It is immaterial that the loan came from Mr. Tkachuk personally rather than from the plaintiff company he controls and directs. The plaintiff corporation benefited. It has leased all its cattle to Mr. Caruk and the equipment will be of significant value to the fulfillment of that contract. 'For the benefit of the owner' does not have to mean for the exclusive benefit of the owner. 3) The undisclosed arrangement between Mr. Tkatchuk and Mr. Caruk gave the nephew a significant advantage at auction. That advantage was magnified by the fact that he possessed insider information. He knew his uncle had a guaranteed price from Ritchie's for the equipment, because that information had been imparted to him by his uncle. All one needs to add is that Mr. Tkachuk would have profited very significantly had his arrangement with the nephew gone undiscovered. He would have secured a guaranteed price, while procuring the commercial advantages of having his cattle lease fulfilled using equipment the nephew could not otherwise have afforded to purchase. 4) In an area such as this where bona fides are of fundamental importance, and particularly where an owner has the advantage of a guaranteed price from the auctioneer, a deliberate non-disclosure of material information can have an impact every bit as significant as a deliberate and obvious misrepresentation. The plaintiff should have disclosed the arrangement with Mr. Caruk to the defendants. In not doing so, and in allowing and enabling Mr. Caruk to bid at the auction, the plaintiff breached clause 3.07.  5) The provision for a 14% commission on the gross proceeds of sale as a consequence of breach of a fundamental term of the contract is not extravagant or unconscionable and, as the defendants pointed out, they did not elect to exercise their conjunctive right in clause 4.05 to additional amounts as liquidated damages. The concluding paragraph would have entitled them, in addition to all other rights and remedies, to re-sell the property acquired by Mr. Caruk and to retain an amount equal to 20% of the proceeds realized. The provision for a 14% commission on the gross proceeds of sale does not constitute a penalty. 6) The defendants' claim solicitor and client costs pursuant to clause 4.03 of the contract. The defendants are prima facie entitled to costs on a solicitor and client basis, but in the circumstances there are issues whether they should be restricted to one set of costs, and other issues relating to appropriate quantum. The issue of costs will be assessed by this Court pursuant to Rule 565, with the defendants serving and filing a draft bill in the form required for a solicitor and client bill, an affidavit of disbursements, and written argument. The plaintiff shall have 14 days to reply. 7) The plaintiff will have a judgment against the defendants in the amount of $1,316.64 representing the power washing bill wrongfully deducted from the auction sale proceeds payable to the plaintiff. In all other respects, the plaintiff's action is dismissed with costs."
"The court found that both parties contributed to the length of the trial, complexities of the issues and the attitude of the parties leading up to and during the trial. Both parties bore their own costs, which included disbursements and pre-judgment interest. The plaintiff was awarded $64,147.85 after trial. The defendant sought $10,000 in trial costs, $850 in previously awarded costs, and $5,092.57 in prejudgment interest for total of $26,630.81. It was important that courts support Rule 41A offers when assessing costs post trial. However, in this case, the plaintiff had no confidence that any offer made by either defendant, short of 100% vindication, would have resolved the case in advance of trial.","Despite the court's finding of no clear winner and that both parties had contributed to the circumstances that led to the trial, the plaintiff sought costs on the basis that the defendant had refused its offer to settle. Each party will bear their own costs; the court had no confidence that any offer made by either party, short of 100 per cent vindication, could have resolved the case in advance of trial."
"FIAT: The parties filed an application for an order varying child support. HELD: 1) The children remain children of the marriage within the meaning of the Divorce Act.  2) The parties agree that given the age of the children, and the change in the amount of support payable by the respondent, that there has been a change in circumstances sufficient to allow a review of the existing child support order. The order sought to be varied is based upon the respondent's 2007 income of $44,957 and the fact that he has not withdrawn from his charge. The respondent's application for variation requested that he be allowed to pay any maintenance payable for Keegan directly to the respondent. The parties agreed that this would be appropriate. 3) In the case of Bowman v. Bowman, 2005 SKQB (CanLII), 260 Sask. R. 312, the Manitoba Court of Appeal suggested a three-step process in dealing with support orders for children who have reached age of majority. Each case must be considered on its own facts. The guiding principle is reasonableness.  4) Although initially the parties were at odds concerning all three children, by the time of their latest submissions some consensus had been reached regarding two of them. Jill, now 26 years old and on her own, was no longer a child of the relationship. The child support payments made would be applied firstly towards the ongoing child support and then towards the arrears. 5) As success has been divided, there will be no order as to costs.","FIAT: The parties have three children, Jill born December 1981, Luke born May 1986 and Keegan born November 1989. The respondent states that he has paid child support pursuant to the court order of February 2000 but, when the children reached the age of majority, he reduced the amount of child support payable as the children became independent and moved out on their own. The petitioner takes issue with the respondent's unilateral reduction in child support and submits the children remained children within the meaning of the Divorce Act so long as they were attending university. The parties agree that given the age of the children there has been a change in circumstance sufficient to allow a review of the existing child support order. HELD: 1) The parties agree that Jill, age 26 is no longer a child of the marriage and that Luke, age 21 is not presently a child of the marriage but could once again become a child of the marriage if he attends university in the fall of 2008. The parties also agree Keegan is 18 and remains a child of the marriage by virtue of the fact that he is taking classes at the university. 2) While the respondent asks that he be allowed to pay child support directly to the children, there is nothing in the material filed which would indicate that the petitioner is not providing support to the child in an appropriate fashion. Further, the difficulties that would arise in respect to enforcement of the order if the child support payments were not made directly to the petitioner would mitigate against such a variation."
"The plaintiff, who was travelling west on Highway 306 near Grey, Saskatchewan, saw car driven by Margaret Henry approach from his right, stop at the stop sign, and then proceed forward toward the highway. He applied his brakes with such force that his truck entered a skid, left the highway, and struck the side of the car. The damages to both the truck and the car exceeded the $500 insurance deductible. The plaintiff brought this action against the car's owner, Vernon Henry, and defendant Margaret Henry for his $500.00 deductible and the Henry's counterclaim for the same. HELD: The plaintiff was awarded judgment against the parties, plus costs of two subpoenas. 1)Although Henry complied with the road rules of the road, a prudent driver in this situation would come to a stop further back from the highway to ensure that oncoming drivers would know that they had been seen and yielded to. 2)It must be concluded that either Henry had stopped, or was able to stop, before entering the plaintiff's right of way. Even if Schmidt concluded that Henry was going to proceed into his path, he had more appropriate alternatives than locking his brakes and turning to the right. There was no other traffic. He could have applied his brake, maintained control of his vehicle, and moved into the oncoming lane.","The parties were involved in an accident. The defendant stopped at a stop sign 39 feet from the intersection and rolled forward while yielding. The plaintiff locked his brakes and skidded into the defendant, attempting to avoid an accident. Damage to both vehicles exceeded the insurance deductibles and both parties claim damages against each other for the amount of the deductibles. HELD: The plaintiff will have judgment against the defendant in the amount of $50. The defendant will have judgment against the plaintiff in the amount of $450 plus costs. Fault for this accident was attributed 10% to the defendant and 90% to the plaintiff. The defendant had indeed yielded properly but could have been more prudent in insuring that other motorist were aware that she yielded. The plaintiff should have taken more appropriate measures to avoid the accident"
"The petitioner sought interim custody, or primary residence of the children, pursuant to s. 6 of The Children's Law Act, 1997. The respondent sought a declaration declining jurisdiction or an order of joint custody pursuant to the Act. The children had been resident in Saskatchewan for approximately 3 months, during which time they moved on two occasions. The petitioner gave no notice to the respondent of the intended move and he returned home without any warning or note. The house was in disarray and he feared that robbery had occurred and that his wife and children were injured or abducted. HELD: 1)The children were habitually resident here. They were not living with their mother with the implied consent or acquiescence of their father. The substantial evidence concerning their best interests was available in British Columbia. 2)The respondent delayed in bringing an application for custody due to his mistaken belief that the petitioner was considering reconciliation. Although he learned when he received her affidavit in support of her custody application that she never had any intention to return to the matrimonial home, the evidence leads to the conclusion that the father did not impliedly consent, nor acquiesce, to the children living with the mother in Regina.","The mother sought interim custody of their 3 and 5 year olds or primary residence of the children pursuant to s.6 of the Children's Law Act.  The father sought a declaration declining jurisdiction, or an order for joint custody. HELD: The children had a real and substantial connection with British Columbia and evidence of their best interests was available there. They were not habitually resident in Saskatchewan and had been here only 3 months. They were not living with their mother with the implied consent or acquiescence of their father. The uncontradicted evidence that the mother never had any intention to return to the matrimonial home was accepted. The Court would have declined to exercise jurisdiction in any event pursuant to s.16 since it was more appropriate for jurisdiction to be exercised in BC. The father was directed to forthwith file an undertaking to not disturb the status quo until court authorization has been obtained."
"The plaintiff was not a partner in Triple R. Triple R was engaged in consignment auto sales upon the business premises of Triple R, with Triple R's knowledge and consent. The sole financial benefit for this activity was to go to the plaintiff. The vehicle was driven almost 5,000 kilometres. The plaintiff is not interested in having the vehicle repaired, even if it is possible, in that he has obtained a different vehicle for his daughter. HELD: Pursuant to subparagraph 57(1)(b)(ii), the plaintiff is entitled to recover the purchase price of $1600 plus foreseeable damages. The costs incurred for repairs and inspection were foreseeable and are properly recoverable. 1)The law of contract clearly recognizes that there is a consignment contract between the consignor (Mr. Oborowsky) and the consignment dealer (Triple R). There is also a contract (the sales contract) between Mr. Dillabough (the vendor) and Mr. Finch (the purchaser). However, in the circumstances the plaintiff did reject the goods within a reasonable period of time. 2)The plaintiff did not establish the exceptions enumerated in the statutory warranty. The retail seller bears the burden of establishing the exceptions. The exception provision at the end of the definition of a'retail seller' leads to a wider array of possible remedies than a regular breach. If it had been the intention of the Legislature in passing this legislation to exclude consignees from the market, it would have listed them in the excluded group. 3)The court concluded that a consignee is a retail seller within the meaning of the Act and accordingly that Triple R is deemed to have given the plaintiff the warranties set out in the Act.","The plaintiff sought to recover the purchase price and repair and inspection costs of a used vehicle pursuant to the Consumer Protection Act s.57(1)(b). Mr. Russell sold the vehicle under consignment to the plaintiff for $1,600. The sales agreement indicated the vehicle was sold 'as is'. The purchaser returned the vehicle the next day because of a problem with the seat belt, a vibration or pulsation from the brakes and the 'check engine soon light' had come on. The plaintiff paid for the sensor replacement. Triple R absorbed the other costs of repair. The plaintiff's daughter continued to have problems with the car including with lower ball joints, exhaust system and motor mounts. At issue was whether or not a consignee is a 'retail seller' as defined in the Consumer Protection Act. HELD: The plaintiff was entitled to recover the $1,600 purchase price plus foreseeable damages which included costs of repairs and inspection totalling $242.35 and costs of $20 less a reduction of $1,542.35 for the 5,000 km it was driven. 1)A consignee is a retail seller within the meaning of the CPA and accordingly Triple R was deemed to have given the warranties set out in the CPA. If the legislature had intended that consignees were not to be considered retail sellers, it would have listed them in the excluded group. Persons may be considered retail sellers even though they have no contractual relationship to the purchaser in s.55. 2)While the plaintiff did not pay a large sum of money, he could still expect this vehicle to be safe to drive. It was not safe and accordingly was not of acceptable quality. The retail seller bears the burden of establishing the exceptions enumerated in the statutory warranty and failed to do so. The vehicle was unsafe from the outset and could not be considered suitable for the purpose of providing transportation. It was unnecessary to make a finding with respect to warranty s. 48(g) (durable for a reasonable period of time). 3)This auto was substantially unfit for all the usual purposes for which, to the knowledge of the retail seller, it was being bought and accordingly the breach was of a substantial character. 4)The plaintiff rejected the goods within a reasonable period. The commencement of the present action was treated as the rejection of the product. The bulk of delay was caused by the defendant's failure to pick up and look at the vehicle (and implication this would involve repair) as agreed."
"The appellant appeared for his trial in matrimonial matter after a peremptory adjournment. He refused to participate in the proceedings and the judge ordered that the trial proceed without him, although the judge did allow a friend to give evidence on his behalf. The appellant had been warned in writing that his health would be put into jeopardy by his attendance at trial. He filed two letters from two doctors outlining the medical conditions from which the appellant suffered. The medical opinions fell far short of justifying anything other than allowing someone else to represent the appellant, but the appellant had already demonstrated an inability to obtain the services of lawyer acceptable to him and the appellant declined to proceed with Mr. Hawke at his side. HELD: The appeal was dismissed.  1)No error was found in the decision of the trial judge. Although the condition of the appellant must be of concern, the evidence did not indicate any inability to instruct counsel or to represent himself in court.  2)The authorities cited by the appellant in his factum have no application to this case as they all deal with situations where a person did not appear at his trial. In this case, the appellant appeared but refused participate. For the same reason, Queen's Bench had no choice but to dismiss the appellant's claim for maintenance.","The appellant appeared for his trial in a family law matter. He refused to participate and left. The judge ordered that the trial continue without him. A judgment was rendered, dividing the matrimonial property and dismissing the appellant's claim for maintenance. The appellant now appeals on the ground that the trial should not have proceeded without him. HELD: The appeal is dismissed. 1) There is no error in the decision of the trial judge. The medical evidence did not indicate any inability to either instruct counsel or to represent him in Court. The trial judge had little choice but to do what she did. 2) The authorities cited by the appellant have no application to this case as they all deal with situations where someone did not appear at his trial. In this case, the appellant appeared but refused to participate. For the same reason, Queen's Bench Rule 271 has no application."
"FIAT: The parties are the parents of a child born April 10, 2003. They were married in Connecticut and the family home was in Laird, Saskatchewan. The respondent mother, an American citizen, continues to reside in Connecticut. The petitioner father brings an application under The International Child Abduction Act for an order directing the child to be returned to Connecticut. HELD: 1) The case law is at odds as to whether reference should be had to the domestic statute when addressing the issue of habitual residency under the Convention. 2) There is no question the petitioner did not consent to the respondent and Joshua's prolonged absence in Canada. When they did not return, the consent was implicitly withdrawn and at that point for the purposes of the Convention, circumstances should be examined to determine whether the child is habitually resident in the United States or Canada. 3) The petitioner has demonstrated he has right to custody and therefore meets the obligation under Article 12 of The Convention. As have concluded the child's habitual residence is in Connecticut, the relief under Articles 12, 13 or 20 are applicable. 4) The concern over chasing orders at the Supreme Court level was rendered academic by way of undertakings given by the father not to take physical custody of the child upon his return to the States until Court in that jurisdiction permitted. In any event, reconciliation was attempted.","FIAT: The parties are the parents of a son born April 10, 2003. They are married and the family home is in Connecticut. The respondent mother is a Canadian citizen and has returned to Canada and now resides in Laird, Saskatchewan. The petitioner is an American citizen and continues to reside in Connecticut and brings an application under The International Child Abduction Act for an order directing the child to be returned to Connecticut. HELD: The respondent is directed to return the child to the State of Connecticut by January 8, 2006.  1) The child was born in Canada. He and his mother joined his father in Connecticut one month later in May 2003. In February 2004 the child and his mother returned to Canada for a planned one-month visit. It is clear that the petitioner did not consent to the prolonged absence of the respondent and the child. In about November 2004 the respondent and the child returned to Connecticut and resumed living with the petitioner. Reconciliation was attempted. The respondent and child left in December 2004 and have not returned. The crystallizing moment was in March 2004 when the respondent did not return from her trip to Canada. For the purposes of the Convention, circumstances should be examined to determine habitual residence. At this point the parties had adopted traditional roles. The respondent was at home raising the child and the petitioner was attending his duties in the navy. Through their conduct the parties had evidenced a settled intention to make their home in Connecticut. The respondent chose to unilaterally remove the child from that home. 2) The petitioner had obtained an interim order in February 2005 directing the child to be returned to Connecticut. He also pursued his case in the Superior Court in Connecticut and on October 2005 obtained an order dissolving the marriage, directing the respondent to return the child to Connecticut and granted the petitioner sole custody. The respondent now asks that any order directing her and the child to return should be conditional on the petitioner varying the order he obtained in October 2005, vacating the award of sole custody to the petitioner and replacing it with something in the nature of joint custody. The conditional return order proposed by the respondent is inappropriate. Having determined that an order for return is warranted under the Convention, it does not lie with a Saskatchewan Court to impose a revised starting point for the process of determining custody in Connecticut. This Court's role concludes upon the determination the petitioner has made out a case for an order for return."
"The parties were involved in a dispute regarding the primary care of two children who were in the mother's care. The mother had recently been diagnosed with Bipolar Mood Disorder. The father, who was currently employed as a roofer, was unable to drive a motor vehicle, having accumulated myriad of driving infractions to add to his already lengthy criminal record. The children were at considerable risk if placed in the sole care of either parent due to their ongoing mental health problems. Their mother, who recently won an award at school, was in the day to day care of her maternal grandparents, who reside next door to the mother. The grandparents were called to the father's home after the children had gone missing for the night. They did not proceed with full investigation. HELD: The Court held that the current parenting pattern offered by the mother and her current partner was unacceptable and would continue to compromise the children's ability to care for them. Therefore, the Court ordered a Section 19 custody and access assessment. The Court also ordered the removal of the current application to vary in order to preserve the present arrangement vesting primary and day care and control of the children with the father. As the mother had been experiencing problems with her mental health, it was pertinent to note that the father is currently facing criminal charges for failing to provide primary care to the children. As well, the mother has a history of short term relationships with other men. The possibility of relapse is slight if the mother continues to comply with her treatment plan.","Although the mother initially had sole custody of the parties' two children, they were placed in the joint custody of both parents, with primary care and control with the father, when the mother was hospitalized due to mental health disturbances. When the children were not later returned to her care, the mother brought an application to vary the primary care arrangements, alleging that the children were not receiving suitable and appropriate parenting while in the father's care. The father, who lived close to the maternal grandparents and relied upon them extensively for the care of the children, questioned the mother's emotional and mental health and stability. The transfer of primary care of the children to the mother is conditional upon the fulfillment of several provisions and prohibitions, including the mother's disclosure to her mental health caregivers of any alcohol consumption and the recent harassing phone calls made by her; should the parents be unable or unwilling to cooperate with the court directives, the court will consider filing a report of neglect under the Children and Family Services Act; primary care and access will be reviewed by the court in six months time. The children were at considerable risk if placed in the primary care of either parent; the evidence showed that the father was unable to meet the children's needs on a daily basis; in addition to his questionable parenting judgment, his regular daily drug use in circumstances where the family lived in poverty and one child had an asthmatic medical condition showed that he placed a higher priority on his relationship with marijuana than his primary responsibility as protector of his children. Although the mother's parenting plan was well-conceived, the court questioned whether she could withstand the daily pressure of raising the children and noted her past habit of consuming alcohol while taking medication."
"The appellant appeals from a stay of execution of an order setting aside her petition for divorce. On an application by the respondent to set aside the divorce petition on the basis that Nova Scotia lacked jurisdiction, the judge determined that the appellant had not been ordinarily resident in Nova Scotia for at least 1 year prior to the filing of the petition. She is essentially asking for an interim order temporarily allowing the appeal. The application for a stay pending appeal is dismissed. Costs of the application will be in the cause. The stay is not one which lends itself to being stayed in accordance with Rule 62.10. Ignoring the Texas hearings and orders invites contempt proceedings even if the appeal of the Justice Wilson's order were allowed and whether or not a stay is granted. This is not a case where issuing a stay would prevent an injustice.","Two days after the wife commenced a divorce action in Nova Scotia, the husband commenced one in Texas. He successfully applied to have the wife's divorce petition set aside on the grounds that she had not been ordinarily resident in Nova Scotia for at least one year immediately prior to the commencement of the proceeding. The wife applied for a stay of execution pending her appeal of this decision. She argued irreparable harm to herself and the parties' child on the basis that if the stay was refused, she would be required to travel to take part in the Texas proceeding, leaving her law practice for an extended time and uprooting the child who was settled in school here. She also feared that she would be found in contempt for failing to obey the Texas custody orders and be imprisoned. Application for stay pending appeal dismissed; the irreparable harm claimed by the appellant was entirely speculative at this point as if the Texas court did grant custody to the father, under the Child Abduction Act, a Nova Scotia court would have jurisdiction to determine the child's habitual residence and whether the appellant was wrongfully detaining him here. Given that the Texas court would be free to continue its proceeding even if a stay was granted, until such time as the conflict of laws issue was resolved, it would be risky for the appellant not to participate in the process there. Furthermore, the order under appeal was not one that lent itself to being stayed under Rule 62.20."
"The parties brought a variation application under the Divorce Act in the amount of $3,550. The parties had been involved in a dispute regarding child support since before the divorce. The mother had recently graduated from an American university and the father, who was working for the United Nations, had stopped paying child support. The father asserted that all his conversations about post- graduation studies was carried on between himself and the mother without any input from the mother; the mother had no 'input into what university would attend' and the children were not suicidal as the father claimed. The daughter's academic record from Dalhousie University is filed with the court and it appears that she has completed all of her course work and taken part in one course. However, her application to vary spousal support is terminated prior to January 1, 2007. The Corollary Relief Judgment provides that the father shall pay $1,000 per month in child support to the mother until the mother is no longer a child of the marriage as defined by the Division Act. The amount of support payable to the father will be adjusted according to the formula set out in the Corollaries Relief Judgment for January 2007. In the interim, the mother will have to pay $2,958.00 per month based on her current income. This amount is adjusted to reflect the change in circumstances between the husband and the wife. The application to continue child support is dismissed.","The parties, divorced, had children, aged 23, 19, and 14 years, respectively. The wife applied to vary the Corollary Relief Judgment (CRJ) following the termination of spousal support. The termination had occurred pursuant to the terms of the CRJ which provided that support would terminate either twelve months after her graduation from the M.B.A. program in which she was enrolled, six months after she withdrew from the program, or when she found employment. The wife had graduated from the program later than expected and a further six months after her course work was completed. Both parties applied to vary child support. The oldest child had completed his first university degree and was currently attending law school. Pursuant to the father's employment, until the completion of their first degree, the children qualified for a program which reimbursed the father for 75 per cent of the child's educational expenses. The CRJ had provided that the father's responsibility to pay all of the oldest child's educational expenses was conditional upon compliance and eligibility for the education reimbursement policies. The middle child was attending university and lived in the wife's home over the summer months. Spousal support application denied; given the family history of an emphasis on education and the oldest child's career plans and apparent aptitudes, he remained a child of the marriage; the father is to pay $10,000 per year directly to the oldest child for the next two years. The father will pay 25 per cent of the core university costs which are not covered by the plan for the middle child as well as the difference in the Table amount of support for two children versus one child; the father shall pay the Table amount of support for one child to the wife for the youngest child as well as that child's expenses for private school; the wife will be responsible for any extra-curricular activities or tutoring outside the private school; the youngest child will be entitled to the same post-secondary benefits in the same fashion as the two older children; the CRJ is amended to provide that the two oldest children are in the joint care of their parents and will not include any other reference to custody or access; the husband is entitled to specified block access with the youngest child; if flight arrangements are made for this child and she does not fly (and there is no medical reason confirmed in writing by a doctor for that failure), the husband's block access shall be expanded for one week at the next access period and the cost of any penalty from the missed flight will be deducted dollar for dollar from the child support payable by the husband."
"The plaintiff obtained a number of open web steel joists from the respondent. The defendant claimed that the majority of the joists were found to have either one or more bent web members or were missing welds. The plaintiff sought reimbursement for the inspection and remediation of the mall. Awarding the defendant $7,000 for the first three months of the operation, that the defects were real and substantial danger to the occupants of the Mall and were mitigated by the repairs and remedial undertaken by the defendant.","Following the collapse of the roofs of two buildings in Newfoundland, both of which were constructed with open web steel joists fabricated by the same company, the Nova Scotia government wrote to owners of buildings containing these joists, including the plaintiff mall owner, recommending that the joists be inspected by a qualified professional engineer. An inspection of the mall roof revealed that 10.5 per cent of the joists inspected had at least one panel point with a broken or missing weld and the same remediation scheme as that implemented by the Province for the government's own buildings was recommended. The plaintiff, concerned with safety issues arising from the report, followed the consultant's recommendations and undertook remediation of the mall and then claimed against the defendant, which was the parent company of the corporate entity which had fabricated the joists. The defendant's expert took the position that although the actual repairs to the welding and webs of the open steel joists was necessary, the reinforcing of the joists undertaken in the remediation was not required in order to mitigate the danger. Judgment for the plaintiff; there were defects in the open web steel joists at the mall which constituted a real and substantial danger to the occupants; this danger was caused by the defendant's negligence and the remediation program carried out at the mall was necessary to alleviate the real and substantial danger. There were internal problems with the welds which could not be discovered by non-destructive inspection and the lack of proper welding procedures and quality control issues at the company prevented one from having confidence in any welds fabricated by them, at least based on external observations."
"The Mutual Fund Dealers Association (MFDA) seeks leave to intervene in the stated appeal. The appellant consents to the intervention while the respondents oppose the application. The central issue on the appeal is whether the appellant Investment Dealers association (IDA) has jurisdiction to discipline former representatives of one of its member firms for acts done by the representatives prior to their resignation or termination. There is a second issue by way of cross-appeal raised by one respondent in regard to matters of delay and abuse of process. HELD: The application for leave to intervention is allowed with strict conditions. The applicant must have served and filed its factum on or before March 6, 2007 and the respondent may file a reply if it chooses to do so on or shortly thereafter. The application to intervene is allowed in part with some strict conditions (see Hoffman v. Monsanto Canada Inc.). In order to accommodate this narrow timeframe, the applicant must serve and file its factums on or near March 6/2007. The parties may file and serve their material by fax in order to expedite matters. The court sees no prejudice to the respondent if the applicant's proposed arguments are presented to the court on the Appeal. The respondent's arguments should simply put the regulatory scheme in context and may assist the Court in its deliberations. The Court is prepared to allow the application for intervention with some very strict conditions.(R. v. Latimer, 1995), 138 Sask. R. 195 (C.A.), 88 W.A.C. 195, (Cd.A.).","The applicant seeks leave to intervene in this appeal. The application is made pursuant to Rule 17 of The Court of Appeal Rules. HELD: The application for intervention is allowed on condition that it meet the filing deadline, that its material not exceed 12 pages and that it may make oral argument only if requested to do so by the Court.  1) The intervenor is a non-profit corporation and its members are mutual fund dealers. Its stated purpose is to regulate the mutual fund distribution industry and its members contractually bind themselves to submit to regulation by the Association. It contends its purpose in bringing the application is to bring to the Court's attention 'some of the broader policy and contextual considerations that have informed the development of the Mutual Fund Dealers Association (MFDA) and the self-regulatory organizations (SROs) generally. 2) There is no prejudice to the respondent if the applicant's proposed arguments are presented to the Court on the appeal. The applicant's arguments should simply put the regulatory scheme in context and may assist the Court in its deliberations. The applicant's arguments are confined to a relatively narrow issue."
"The parties have three children, three of which are now with the respondent. The parties resided with their respective parents on alternate weeks. In 2004, the petitioner moved with the three children to Alberta. In 2005, the two youngest children returned to the respondent, but this arrangement continued to the present. The petitioner now sought to recover the cost of orthodontist fees, which are extraordinary and should be included in the child support payments. HELD: 1) The capital cost allowance was to be treated as income for the purposes of child support payable in the years 2004, 2005 and 2006. 2) The respondent was to forthwith pay to the petitioner as court costs the sum of $1,200. 3) It will be fair if the contributions are equal, taking into account that the incomes are presently comparable. It is fair and reasonable that an appropriate retroactive variation be effected. 4) The petitioner claimed for full day's wages in 2004. This ignores the fact that she would have been away from her employment for one-half the time in any event. In addition, she claimed for her gross wages. The monthly difference was $270. 5) Taking into account all of the circumstances, the nature of the farming operation, the type and vintage of the machinery, and the rate at which the allowance is being used up, it is reasonable that 40% of the allowance should be treatedas income for child support. The fees are ordinary, and not extraordinary expenses and would be encompassed in the basic support calculation. The same applies to certain activities provided to the child Mandey by the respondent when the parties separated.","The outstanding issue is child support, past and future. The dispute largely centered on what monies were owed from the past. Central to this was the determination of the respondent's income. HELD: 1) The respondent is a farmer. His income tax returns for the years 2004, 2005 and 2006 have been filed, but certain adjustments must be made. The purpose of the capital cost allowance is to provide money to purchase replacement equipment. However, not all of the money is needed and is not used for that purpose. It is that unused portion which should be allocated as part of the respondent's income. In this case, 40% of the allowance should be treated as income for the purpose of calculating child support. The personal portion of the utility costs should be included as part of his income, an appropriate percentage is 25%. An amount of the legal and accounting costs should be attributed to the respondent personally and added to his income, in 2004 $1,000 is added, in 2005 $5,000 is added and in 2006 $1,000 is added. The respondent has taken advantage of the optional inventory adjustment and that must be factored back into his income using the methodology set out in Tamke v. Tamke, 2001 SKQB 528. As the respondent's income has undergone serious fluctuation over the years, it is therefore appropriate that his income for calculating child support be based on the average of his income in the years 2004 and 2005. 2) The respondent will not have to pay half of the cost of Stacey joining a school trip to Europe. This is because Stacey paid half of the cost herself and because the respondent was asked to contribute at the time but refused. The petitioner knew the respondent had refused to contribute and, when she elected to pay the balance, she did so unilaterally. It would be inappropriate to compel the respondent to contribute now. 3) The school fees paid by the petitioner are not extraordinary and should be encompassed in the basis child support. The health costs in the form of orthodontic treatments are extraordinary and the parties shall contribute equally as their incomes are presently comparable. 3) On five occasions the respondent failed to attend at the agreed meeting spot with the result that the petitioner had to make the entire trip to deliver the children to the respondent so he could exercise access. She will be compensated for the actual lost wages and fuel costs that she incurred on the respondent's behalf, but not for costs she would have incurred in any event.  4) The respondent shall pay costs of $1,200."
"The accused was charged with impaired driving and driving over.08. The defence had admitted all of the essential elements of each charge; the only issue was whether or not the accused was the driver of the vehicle. HELD: 1) Based on the events of December 5, 2009, at Carrot River, the accused is guilty of impaired driving. The police were advised that there were a number of individuals who had left the bar that night, so they decided to drop in while on routine patrol. At no time did anyone other than the accused have access to the vehicle; she was the one who backed it out, and again pulled it in. The entire incident took mere seconds from the time the vehicle backed up and then pulled in. 2) The police officer was polite and forthright in their evidence both in examination-in-chief and in cross-examination. The officer was found to be somewhat evasive in cross examination. The difference between the demeanour he exhibited during his testimony and that of the accused in cross/examination caused me to have considerable concern. The fact that the police officer's keys were in the ignition when the police arrived at the vehicle and had been in the vehicle since the time they first observed the vehicle being started does not detract from his credibility. The evidence of the police officers was not unreliable nor was it left in a state of reasonable doubt.","The accused was charged with impaired driving and driving over. 08. The sole issue to be determined was whether the accused was the person operating the vehicle at the time of the stop. The police testified that they had walked through the bar before closing time and then returned to the bar at closing time. The evidence was that the accused had been seen playing drinking games in the bar. The police observed the people they had seen in the bar get into a truck and back up. The police activated their emergency equipment and approached the vehicle. The accused was sitting in the driver's seat when the police approached the vehicle. The defence suggested that another individual had been driving the truck when it backed up but had gone inside the bar to purchase off sale before the police approached the truck. HELD: The accused was convicted of both counts and a judicial stay was entered on the impaired driving count. The Court found that the evidence of the accused was unreliable as a result of her alcohol consumption on the offence date. The evidence of the person that the defence suggested was the driver was inconsistent and caused the Court concern about its reliability. The Court found that at the time the individuals got into the truck, the accused was behind the wheel and that she was the one who backed the vehicle up and pulled it forward. The keys were in the vehicle and it was running when the police came to the driver's door. The accused's blood alcohol content at the time of driving as shown by the Certificate of Analysis was 150 milligrams of alcohol in 100 millilitres of blood."
"The respondent was convicted of criminally negligent driving and was sentenced to 90 days on an intermittent basis, placed on probation for 2 years with conditions and required to perform 100 hours of community service. He caused bodily harm to another person when he drove his car at an excessive speed through a four-way stop intersection without stopping. He was disqualified from driving and disqualified from doing so by reason of an order pursuant to s. 259(1) of the Criminal Code. He had been disqualified from operating a motor vehicle for three years and was prohibited from driving for three. He pleaded guilty to dangerous driving and failed refusal of a breathalyzer demand. He received a sentence of six months probation. The Crown appealed the sentence. HELD: Appeal allowed. Punitive sentence of 6 months probation was to be served. There was no need to take the respondent out of the work force. The sentence was inadequate to deter him from further service. The court emphasized the need to stress general deterrence in an effort to protect the public against actions such as those committed by the respondent. Specific deterrence was emphasized. Somehow the respondent must be made to realize that he cannot mix drinking and driving. His prior record is anything but promising. Having carefully considered what the trial judge said, the court allowed the appeal.","Respondent male was convicted of criminal negligence in the operation of a motor vehicle - the offence occurred when he was disqualified from driving and he was intoxicated - six previous motor vehicle offences, 3 of which were criminal matters. 90 days intermittent, 2 years probation with conditions, 100 hours of community service and a 3 year prohibition from driving varied to 6 months plus the probation and driving prohibition having regard to the principles of deterrence  - the trial judge put too much emphasis on rehabilitation."
"The appellant was convicted after trial of assault with a weapon. He applied for leave to appeal against the sentence of 8 years imprisonment and sought the return of the accused's right to a jury trial. Dismissing the appeal, that the appellant's evidence as a witness was not sufficient to show that the accused would give relevant evidence to a decisive or potentially decisive issue. The court considered the circumstances of the offence, the previous record of the appellant and the remarks of the trial judge. It could not be said that the eight years imprisonment was not a fit sentence in this case.","The appellant appealed his conviction for sexual assault using a weapon and his sentence of eight years. The appellant contended that his counsel had failed to call the complainant's boyfriend as a witness even though he was in the courthouse under a defence subpoena. The appellant also raised on appeal the fact that he had lost his right to a jury trial. He had failed to appear at the jury trial scheduled and a bench warrant had been issued. The Crown had then applied for an order that the appellant was no longer entitled to a jury trial and the record showed that his counsel had agreed to forfeit the right to a jury trial. The appellant contended that his counsel and the Crown both advised him he had lost his right by failing to appear and that he was not told that he could avoid losing his right if he had a legitimate excuse for failing to appear. He put forth the excuse of having had no counsel at the time of the trial. Dismissing the appeal, (1) that there was nothing to show that the witness would have given relevant evidence bearing on a decisive issue in the trial and the appellant failed to meet the burden of showing that the evidence, if believed, could reasonably have been expected to affect the result of the trial when considered with all the other evidence; counsel's decision not to call the witness where the witness was hostile and counsel did not know what he would say was not inappropriate, and, the court noted, in the circumstances, seemed to have been the right decision; (2) the excuse of failing to appear because he did not have counsel was not a legitimate excuse within the meaning of s. 598(1)(a) of the Criminal Code; moreover, the appellant only raised this issue in his oral submissions and gave no notice to the Crown respecting this issue nor did he provide any supporting evidence by way of affidavit; it was seen by the Court as another unsupported and unjustified criticism of counsel and the Court concluded that the record showed that the appellant had agreed to forfeit his right to a jury trial; and (3) that an eight year sentence, although at the high end of the scale for sexual assault, was not manifestly excessive, having regard to deterrence, the circumstances of the offence, and the appellant's record which included three minor offences."
"The accused was arrested for impaired driving and given a breathalyser demand, which resulted in readings of 170 and 160 milligrams of alcohol in 100 millilitres of blood. The accused argued that the stop was an arbitrary arrest and thus a violation of his rights under s. 9 of the Charter. The trial judge found that the evidence obtained as a result of the police's observations of the accused was sufficient to rebut the presumption of s. 258 of the Criminal Code, and that the trial judge was not in error in law or in her finding of facts in her decision. Allowing the appeal, that the police officers involved were not acting arbitrarily or in a random fashion and had advanced a reasonable basis and had an articulable cause for stopping the vehicle.","The appellant was detained after leaving a suspected 'after hours' club which was under surveillance by police. He was charged with a breathalyzer offence, and was convicted. He appealed, arguing his s. 9 Charter rights had been violated. He also contended the evidence of the amount of alcohol he had consumed on the night in question constituted 'evidence to the contrary' which rebutted the presumption in s. 258 of the Criminal Code. Dismissing the appeal, that the police officers were not acting arbitrarily or in a random fashion when they detained the appellant, and had a reasonable basis for stopping his vehicle. The appellant's contention he consumed only two small bottles (1-1/2 ounces each) of rum, plus some cough syrup and mints, did not constitute evidence to the contrary to rebut the presumption of the breathalyzer offence. On Appeal."
"An application for an order pursuant to s. 135(4) of the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act granting the applicant's appeal of the trustee's decision to disallow her security interest. The ground on which this application is brought is that the applicant’s security interest was not registered defectively, according to the Personal Property Security ActRegulations. In the alternative, s.66(1) of The Personal Property security Act should be applied to remedy such defect. HELD: 1)To hold otherwise would result in an underserving windfall to unsecured creditors who have not been misled. 2)The financing statement of the applicant was validly registered. The applicant incurred risk by advancing credit and obtained a security interest and registered financing statement to protect its interest.  3)The trustee appeared late on the scene and has never incurred any risk. It never acted on the financing statement containing the error. The trustee has been misled, has not been prejudiced and has not acted to its detriment. 4)S65(1)'s of the personal property security act must be applied. To hold otherwisewould result in the loss of a windfall.","Saskatchewan Economic Development Corporation (SEDCO) made a business loan to Fladseth, but misspelled her name in its PPSA registration as Eladseth. It also properly registered against her trade name, 'Joan E. Craft Supplies'. After her assignment in bankruptcy, the trustee disallowed Sedco's security on the basis that its registration was defective. Sedco appealed this decision under section 135 of the Bankruptcy Act. ISSUES: 1)Did Sedco register its interest in accordance with the PPSA Regulations? 2)If not, can the registration be cured under section 66 of the PPSA? HELD: 1)The personal registration did not comply with the PPSA Regulations. The registration against the trade name was proper. 2)This is a matter where section 66 should be applied. To hold otherwise would result in an undeserving windfall to unsecured creditors who have not been mislead."
"This was an application by way of certiorari to quash the committal order of the Provincial Court Judge against the defendants. The Judge had previously placed the onus of committal on the shoulders of the accused to stand trial on the charge of trafficking in narcotic, contrary to s.491 of the Narcotic Control Act. All the accused were elected trial by judge and jury and Preliminary Inquiry was held during which the learned judge committed all accused to trial. The judge's decision to exclude the accused from the preliminary inquiry was therefore bound to be quashed. There was no loss of jurisdiction. The committals of the following accused were confirmed: John Parr, Albert Muise, Joseph Campbell, Kelly Campbell, and Lauchie Campbell. The court neglected the mandatory requirements of s.515(1)(c) of the Criminal Code, and their committal for trial should therefore be quashing.","This is an application by way of certiorari to quash the committal order of the preliminary inquiry judge. Quashing three of the 11 committals, that the judge failed to follow the literal formality of s. 541(1) of the Criminal Code. After specifically excluding the three from the reading of s. 541(1), the judge simply reminded them they had heard the reading on the previous day. The jurisdiction of the preliminary inquiry judge was also discussed."
"Appeal from 4520/86 J.C. Regina Reasons - March 13, 1995 HELD: The appeal was dismissed with costs to the respondent. There was nothing vitiating the exercise of the discretionary powers of the Court to dismiss for want of prosecution where there has been inordinate and inexcusable giving rise to prejudice, or overlooked or disregarded a material consideration, or acted unjudicially. That being so, there was no tenable basis for interference by us.","The Defendant applied to strike out the Plaintiff's action for want of prosecution. The application was successful. The Plaintiff appealed. HELD: Appeal dismissed. The Court was not persuaded that the Chambers Judge had either erred in principle in the exercise of the discretionary powers of the Court to dismiss for want of prosecution where there has been inordinate and inexcusable delay giving rise to prejudice, or overlooked or disregarded a material consideration, or acted unjudicially."
"This was an appeal from a decision in the Supreme Court allowing an application for certiorari to quash a decision of the Workers' Compensation Board and remitting the matter to the Board to determine the rate of compensation payable to the respondent. The respondent had worked for several years for M-I Drilling Fluids Canada, and experienced periods of layoff and re-off. In 1993, the same employer engaged the respondent in two separate ways: contract employment as a watchman at rate of $100 per week and part-time hourly employment totaling one day week until June 14, 1993. In 1994, the respondent was laid off from his full-time employment. He was awarded compensation for time lost while he was injured on the job. He appealed. Dismissing the appeal, that s. 37 of the Act limited the Board's jurisdiction. The Chambers judge held that the Hearing Officer had ignored the clear words of s.37 and had arbitrarily decided upon a different rate of pay. The Board had thus exceeded its jurisdiction. On appeal, the Chambers judge set aside the decision and ordered that the Board must determine the rates of compensation according to the best interests of the workers. This should not have been an issue for the Board.","The appellant Board granted the respondent temporary total disability benefits on a part-time basis. The respondent contended that it should be on a full-time basis, and applied to the Supreme Court in chambers for an order quashing the appellant's decision. The chambers judge found that the appellant had ignored the clear words of s.37 of the Workers' Compensation Act in reaching its decision, and thus had exceeded its jurisdiction; the decision was quashed and the matter remitted back to the Board. The appellant appealed. Allowing the appeal and setting aside the order to quash, that s.37 of the Act was not a section limiting the Board's jurisdiction and that, considering s.37 and s.53 of the Act, the decision of the Board was not patently erroneous."
"This was a Crown appeal against two sentences of two years less a day each, to be served concurrently. HELD: The sentences were increased to three years for an armed robbery conviction and one year concurrent for an unrelated armed robbery convictions. The court gave credit of 2 years for the 1 year he believed he had spent on Remand, and 2 years less 1 day concurrent for the other convictions. In addition, a firearms prohibition was made for life. The appellant was 32 years old and had 32 previous convictions including two armed robberies and seven other convictions relating to possession of weapons. He was on parole for an earlier armed robbery when this occurred. He had a common law wife, four children from previous unions, and an aged mother who is at least partially dependent on him. He should have been given the opportunity to recoup the money he had lost. The robbery was unpremeditated and should have met the three year minimum generally imposed for such offences.","The Crown appealed two sentences of two years less a day each, to be served concurrently for armed robbery. The 32 year old appellant had 32 previous convictions including two armed robberies and seven convictions relating to possession of weapons. HELD: The Crown appeal was allowed and the sentence for each offence was increased to three years imprisonment to be served concurrently. 1)The judge made an error in calculating the time on remand that should have been credited to the sentence. Only six months rather than the whole year should have been counted. 2)Given the appellant's record these offences demanded more than the three year minimum generally imposed."
"The appellants applied to adduce fresh evidence and to amend the statement of claim in the within action. The tests for the admission of fresh evidence were set out in R. v. Palmer, 1979 CanLII (SCC), [1980] S.C.R. 672; R. vs. Lensen, 1987 CanLii (Sask C.A.), [1987] SCC), 'Lensen', [1987][1988] SC.CR.672 and in the context of this case the interests of justice require that the rule of due diligence should not be strictly applied. HELD: The application to addduce new evidence and amend the statements of defence was denied. 2)The application to add fresh evidence was denied on appeal. The standard of review is that as articulated in Lensen v. Lenson, 1987 (SLC), [1987], [1987]; S.R.'R. 670; RDS&O 672) and in this case as articulated on Lensen (1987) S.A.R 672 were not persuaded in the circumstances of this matter that the trial judge either misapprehended or failed to take into account evidence which was before him in arriving at his conclusion concerning the causation of the fire. There was evidence which, if accepted would permit the trial judges to make the findings of fact that he did and to award the damages based on those findings.","The appellants applied to adduce fresh evidence and to amend the statement of claim. The appellant's solicitor at the time of the trial had called no expert evidence concerning either the proper construction of the chimney, which was alleged to be faultily constructed, or the cause of the fire. HELD: The appeal was dismissed with costs on double Column V, including costs of the motion to adduce fresh evidence. 1)The evidence was clearly available, clearly contemplated by the parties and for whatever reason not called. 2)The trial judge neither misapprehended nor failed to take into account evidence which was before him in arriving at his conclusion concerning the causation of the fire. There was evidence to permit the trial judge to make the findings of fact that he did and to award the damages based on those findings."
"The plaintiff sues his father's estate for damages forbreach of a farm lease and for the value of his farm labour. The estate counterclaims for a mortgage debt incurred by thefather on behalf of the plaintiff. HELD: 1)The lease was a valid lease and was repudiated by the plaintiff after he commenced his claim for damages. The plaintiff did not vigorously contest the lease nor failed to complete his obligations under it.  2)The plaintiff was only entitled to the net return he would have realized had he farmed the land in accordance with the lease in 1994 by the executors of the estate. The fact that the father, in the heat of an argument, arbitrarily and without justification repudiated the agreement does not estop him from suing the estate fordamages for his breach of the lease. 3)The issues raised by the claim and counterclaim are not typical 'estate' issues. Solicitor and client costs against the estate are accordingly not appropriate.","The plaintiff sued his father's estate for breach of a farm lease and for the value of his farm labour. The estate counterclaimed for a mortgage debt incurred by the father on behalf of the plaintiff. The plaintiff was not included in his father's Will as a beneficiary and the Will contained no reference to the mortgage debt. The father's statement of assets filed in his divorce and matrimonial property action did not disclose it as an asset. HELD: 1)The unsigned handwritten memorandum evidenced a binding agreement for lease between the plaintiff and his father. He affirmed the lease in his discussions with a daughter. 2)The plaintiff neither repudiated the lease nor failed to complete his obligations under it.  The fact that he did not vigorously contest the right of his brother to farm the land on behalf of the estate did not estop him from suing for damages for his father's breach of the lease.  Damages of $6,500 were awarded. 3)The plaintiff failed to establish a quantum meruit claim. He did not produce any documents to show he had been reimbursed for his labour on the farm in prior years. Other family members helped with the farming from time to time. He did nothing while his father was alive to demand or obtain payment. 4)Even if the mortgage was considered a debt in 1989 it was subsequently forgiven. It was significant that the plaintiff was not included as a beneficiary and the amount of the mortgage was similar to the bequests to the other children. 5)The plaintiff was awarded his costs against the estate on a party and party basis for that portion of his claim on which he was successful and for defending the counterclaim. Solicitor and client costs against the estate were not appropriate as the issues raised by the claim and counterclaim were not typical estate issues. Judgment issued against the two executors in their representative capacity."
"The two doctors, both practicing medicine together, filed in bankruptcy and in each case the major unsecured creditor was Revenue Canada. The trustee applied the said payments firstly in payment of its reasonable fees and then to distribute the balance from time to time to the bankrupt. The bankrupt received an absolute discharge. In the circumstances, the doctors were able to continue their medical practice in Wolseley and believed that, perhaps, that they had committed one or more of the sins outlined in s. 173(1)(a) of the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act and there was no reason why this income level could not be maintained. The doctors consented to judgment and sought a judgment in favour of the trustee in the amount of $45,000. The judge determined that as a condition of discharge the doctors should make combined payments of $1,250 per month for a total of $120,564, which is entirely the Revenue Canada claim. HELD: 1)The consent judgment option was most appropriate, both for the doctors and the community they serve.  2)The doctors were advised to apply for a judgment on the first day of each and every month commencing in April 1996 and continuing in May/June 1996. 3)The court ordered that the judgment be granted judicially, on the basis of Revenue Canada's Guideline of Payments (which the trustee took into account along with all other factors), and in the event of a declaration by the bankrupt that the amount owing to the trustee was insufficient to cover the costs of applying the judgment, the bankrupt would receive an absolutely unconditional discharge.","Two doctors filed in bankruptcy in 1995 and in each case the major unsecured creditor was Revenue Canada. Neither met the 50% threshold of ss.173(1)(a) of the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act and each likely committed one or more acts of bankruptcy under ss.(b) to (m). However there was no suggestion of dishonesty. The combined medical earnings in the four years prior to the bankruptcy averaged $18,000 per month and the after-tax family income averaged $10,200 per month. HELD: A consent judgment under ss.172(2)(c) was ordered such that if each doctor consented to the payment of $45,000 to be paid at a rate of $1,250.00 per month for 36 months without interest there would be an absolute discharge. 1)The payments proposed by Revenue Canada of $3,349.00 per month were unreasonably high in all the circumstances. 2)Their contributions to the community did not relieve either doctor from making reasonable payments to the trustee as a condition of their discharge from the bankruptcy."
"Cadillac Fairview, a unionized employer, applied for judicial review in the nature of a prohibition contending the provisions of the Code were superseded by the collective agreement and s25(1) of the Trade Union Act. The result was that the Board of Inquiry lacked jurisdiction to hear the complaint. The appellant appealed. Appeal Allowed; the issue is whether s. 25 of the Act prevents the complainants from having their allegations of sexual harassment decided under the Code; if so, whether the Board has exclusive jurisdiction to resolve the matter. The fact that the parties included an anti-discrimination clause in their collective agreement does not alter the fundamental nature of the dispute or have the effect of extending the scope of the arbitrator's jurisdiction. HELD: The appeal is allowed. 1) The policy driving such decisions is that the dispute resolution process, established by the various labour statutes, should not be duplicated or undermined by concurrent common law actions in the courts. This also conforms to the theory of deference that courts accord decisions of specialized tribunals. 2) Common law jurisdiction was ousted in favour of an arbitrator.  3) Although human rights legislation is not constitutional, it is of such a special nature that it cannot be contracted out of, altered, amended or repealed, except by clear legislative intent and pronouncement. To do otherwise would permit the denigration of the rights and obviate the protection of the right the statute seeks to protect. 4) The mere fact that a collective agreement includes an article or clause which complies with the Code or a provision which covenants not to discriminate on the basis of the grounds set out in the Code, does not in and of itself transform the nature OF the dispute from a human rights violation to a breach of the common agreement.","Two female employees filed complaints with the Saskatchewan Human Rights Commission alleging sexual harassment and discrimination contrary to the Saskatchewan Human Rights Code. The unionized employer applied for judicial review in the nature of prohibition contending the provisions of the Code were superseded by the collective agreement and s.25 of the Trade Union with the result that the Board of Inquiry lacked jurisdiction to hear the complaint. The chambers judge found the Act took precedence over the Code on the basis that the Act dealt specifically with the employment relationship and granted an order prohibiting the Board of Inquiry from hearing and determining the matter. Sub-questions to be determined included: what are the statutory schemes of the Trade Union Act and the Saskatchewan Human Rights Code; what has the Supreme of Canada decided about the exclusive jurisdiction of an arbitrator to resolve disputes in the context of labour law; the essential character of the dispute and ambit of the collective agreement; whether either the Code or the Act has exclusive jurisdiction to decide the dispute and if not, which statute takes priority or is paramount. HELD: The order of the Court of Queen's Bench was set aside and the matter was remitted to the Board of Inquiry appointed under the provisions of the Code. 1)The chambers judge correctly decided that the issue in this case is confined to a determination of the correct forum in which to bring the complaint of sexual harassment. 2)Human rights are fundamental, quasi-constitutional rights which embody fundamental values and public policy. Because human rights are not private rights, but public rights which constitute fundamental public policy, parties are not able to contract out of, alter, amend, or repeal or create exceptions to human rights provisions. To do otherwise would permit the denigration of the rights and obviate the protection of the rights the statute seeks to protect. 3)The mere fact that a collective agreement includes an article or clause which complies with the Code or a provision which covenants not to discriminate on the basis of the grounds set out in the Code, does not in and of itself transform the nature of the dispute from a human rights violation to a breach of the collective agreement. The ambit of the collective agreement does not affect the finding that the essential nature of the dispute is a human rights violation particularly when the public interest component and wide powers granted under the Code to redress a violation are taken into account. It is not in its essential character a complaint arising out of the employment relationship under the collective agreement.  4)The Commission was awarded its costs on double column V in this Court and on the appropriate Court of Queen's Bench tariff. No costs were requested by the intervenor.ADDENDUM: Paragraphs number 25 and 31 are substituted as follows: [25] This position was reinforced by Weber v. Ontario Hydro and New Brunswick v. O'Leary. The policy driving such decisions is that the dispute resolution process, established by the various labour statutes, should not be duplicated or undermined by concurrent common law actions in the courts. This also conforms to the theory of deference that courts accord decisions of specialized tribunals. For a complete discussion of the issue see Parr and Prince Albert District Health Board v. Saskatchewan Federation of Labour released concurrently with this judgment. The Ambit of the Collective Agreement [31] One must not lose sight of the fact that the terms of the collective agreement itself can play an important role in the determination of whether the jurisdiction of the court has been ousted in favour of an arbitrator. The fact that parties have included an anti-discrimination clause in the collective agreement does not alter the fundamental nature of the dispute or have the effect of extending the scope of the arbitrator's jurisdiction. It may play a role in determining whether the statutory tribunal would decide to hear the complaint, but it cannot affect the determination of the essential nature of the dispute or the question of jurisdiction. The essential issue is whether this complaint is a dispute between the parties with respect to the meaning, application or alleged violation of the collective agreement. To find that it is, with the result that the dispute must be arbitrated, would permit the parties to contract out of the Code, something they cannot do."
The appellant was found guilty of having sexually assaulted the complainant contrary to s. 272(c) of the Criminal Code. He appealed the conviction on the ground that the trial judge erroneously interpreted s. 276 of the Code to prevent proper cross-examination of the complainant in relation to a previous allegation she had made relating to this sexual assault. HELD: The appeal was allowed and a new trial ordered. 1)The trial judge failed to consider whether s. 277 of the code should be interpreted as having application beyond the incidence of consensual sex. The Court found that the appellant was not being questioned about her consensual sexual activities but rather about a previous complaint of a sexual assault which was understood to have been made about another man. It was understood the question put to the complainant did not give rise to the application of s. 275. The relevance of such a question pertaining to the existence of another complaint made by N.M. in respect of the same assault was obvious. It does not raise the issue of whether the complainant has 'engaged in sexual activity'. That question had a direct bearing on the credibility of this complainant. 2)The appellant had been denied the opportunity to make full answer and defence. The trial judge should have given the complainant seven days written notice.,"The appellant appeals his conviction of sexual assault causing bodily harm on the ground the trial judge erred in preventing cross-examination of the complainant. The trial judge prevented the cross-examination of the complainant in relation to a previous allegation she had made relating to this sexual assault. The offence is alleged to have taken place at home of the appellant's brother. The appellant was asked by his brother and sister-in-law to babysit their daughter. The allegation was that the appellant had entered her parent's bedroom where she was sleeping and sexually assaulted her. The appellant, who has no previous record, was convicted of the charge and sentenced to three years imprisonment. The appellant during cross-examination of the complainant attempted to question her regarding a previous allegation regarding the same sexual assault against another person. The trial judge did not permit this line of questioning as he held it pertained to her past sexual history. HELD: Appeal allowed. The failure of the trial judge to allow this cross-examination has prevented the appellant from having a fair trial as he has been denied the opportunity to make full answer and defence. It seems the question that should have been put to the trial judge on this occasion was whether this section was applicable to a situation involving non-consensual sex. The complainant was not being questioned about her consensual sexual activities but rather a previous complainant of a sexual assault. It is understood the intent was to indicate the complainant had implicated someone else as the assailant and after investigation the complaint had not been acted upon. That evidence could have placed in doubt the reliability of the complainant's identification of the person who assaulted her since the room was dark when the assault was alleged to have occurred. The relevance of such a question pertaining to the existence of another complaint made by the complainant in respect of the same assault is obvious. That question has a direct bearing on her credibility."
"The defendant was ordered to pay $794 per month as basic child support for two children. The provisional order also required him to pay an additional $75 per month representing 50% of the orthodontic and dental costs of the child. The total amount owing monthly was $794. The defendant had employer sponsored dental insurance and had filed a financial statement with the Court of Queen's Bench in Saskatchewan showing his annual income for Guideline purposes was $50,064 and he was required to obtain and maintain medical and dental insurance for the children.","A provisional order from the Alberta Court of Queen's Bench required the respondent to pay monthly support based on his income of $55,000 for the couple's two children. He was also required to pay half of the monthly dental expenses. Subsequently, the respondent filed a financial statement showing his income to be $50,064. HELD: The respondent's monthly child support payments are reduced according to the guidelines. The respondent is also required to maintain health and dental insurance for his children through his employer. The Court instructed the respondent on the procedure for submitting the children's health insurance claims. The provisional order was confirmed subject to these specified variations."
"FIAT. 598772 Saskatchewan Ltd. applied for relief pursuant to s. 81(1) of the Queen's Bench Act, 1998. That allows the Court to direct that a judgment will be paid by instalments and/or over a period of time where it is demonstrated that the judgment debtor requires such relief. HELD: The judgment was granted. The amount of the judgment recovered will be set aside and the remaining payments set out in the schedule will follow thereafter continuing with January 1, 2001. An officer of the applicant swore that the officers were prepared to infuse $100,000 into the company's treasury if need be to make up any shortfall from funds needed by the company to pay the instalmentments. In the absence of a formal commitment on their part to do so, the Court cannot take that into consideration. The rate of interest to be paid on the judgment commencing with a payment to be made within 7 days will be equivalent to pre-judgment interest and should continue until the judgment is satisfied in full.  The judgment will provide also for a 5-day grace period and will also provide that in the event any installment is missed after the passage of the grace period the respondent will be entitled to enforcement by way of execution, garnishment or any other means appropriate.","FIAT. The numbered company applied for relief pursuant to the Queen's Bench Act s.81(1) allowing the court to direct the judgment to be paid by installments. The creditor objected that the applicant had plenty of opportunity over the years to pay and drew attention to prior allegations of mismanagement or redirection of funds which should have been allocated to the payment of interest. HELD: The payment which should have been paid in November was to be paid within 7 days. The remaining payments set out in the schedule will commence January 2001 with the change in rate of interest from that provided under the Interest Act to one equivalent to pre-judgment interest. A 5 day grace period was allowed after which the respondent was allowed to proceed immediately with enforcement by execution, garnishment or any means it deems appropriate. The taxed cost of this application was added to the judgment and will be part of the balance to be paid on May 1, 2001. Counsel could apply for further directions."
"The Halifax Regional Municipality Act, effective as April 1, 1996, provided for the amalgamation of the municipal police forces into the Halifax Regional municipality. The plaintiffs were part of a Bargaining Unit represented by the Municipal Association of Police Personnel (MAPP). The issues raised by the plaintiffs were whether the Chief of Police predated the collective agreement, or there was conflict between the Police Act and another Act. MAPP and the defendants argued that the two-tier system for sergeant violated s. 35(1) of the Regulations made under the Act. They sought to have the matter dealt with at arbitration. Dismissing the action, that the collective agreements provided for a gradual increase in pay to members of the bargaining unit, and for certain officers to be promoted to the rank of Sergeant. This did not change the essential character of the dispute, which was that it was a dispute between individual employees who were not part of the collective bargaining unit and those who were. As the parties did not contemplate demotions except under proceedings taken under the police Act, and the plaintiffs would still say such an agreement constitutes a violation of the police act.","The plaintiffs were Sergeants in the Town of Bedford Police Department. Following amalgamation and before any collective agreement was concluded, the Chief of the amalgamated force issued a department order declaring that all persons in the position of the plaintiffs would be referred to as a level two Sergeant which created a two-tier structure within the Sergeant rank. The bargaining agent for the union declined to process a grievance on behalf of the plaintiffs and agreed with the two-tiered structure which was eventually incorporated into the collective agreement. After unsuccessfully complaining to the Nova Scotia Police Commission and the Halifax Regional Board of Police Commissioners, the plaintiffs commenced an action alleging that the creation of the two-tiered structure was a violation of the Police Act and adversely affected their employment rights. The intervenor union brought an application to strike the plaintiffs' proceeding on the basis that the court lacked jurisdiction to hear the matter. Application granted; proceeding stayed pending submission to arbitration or any other form of proceeding that is permitted under the statutory enactments applicable; if no application is made to lift the stay within two years, the action will stand dismissed. Where there is a threshold question of whether the dispute is arbitrable, that decision should initially be made, absent very limited exceptions, by an arbitrator and not by the court. It is irrelevant if the plaintiffs have now lost their rights to initiate the arbitration process."
"The appellants sought better particulars of general damages (Civil Procedure Rule 14.24) in an interlocutory order dismissing their application for further particulars of the general damage claim. The respondent had purchased the property in 1996 and used it for composting, the creation of topsoil and sand excavation. The appellants claimed the property misrepresented its boundaries and plans to extract sand or otherwise develop the property were negatively affected. The defendants in the Supreme Court action also demanded better particulars, alleging a breach of contract. The Chambers judge dismissed the appellants' application, dismissing the appeal with costs to the respondent of $1500 inclusive of disbursements. It was the respondent's position that particulars of damages need only be pleaded where the demand is liquidated. An expectation claim which depends upon variable factors (here, factors such as the state of the economy, the price of sand, the cost of excavation) need not be particularized in the pleadings. HELD: It was not persuaded that the absence of the particulars sought by appellants compromise their ability to file a defence to this action.  1)It was difficult to conceive of what additional information (the appellants need at this stage) the respondent had specified the type of damages that it sought. 2)The necessity for particulars must be evaluated taking into account the nature of the action and the timing of the demand in the context of the Civil Procedure Rules as whole. There are other Rules (for example Rules 18, 19 and 20) which can be utilized by the appellant to discover the underlying details of the damage claim proper.","The plaintiff company sued the defendants for negligent misrepresentation and breach of contract alleging that the defendants sold it a piece of land smaller than what it was represented to be. The plaintiff intended to excavate and sell sand from the land and claimed damages including loss of profits due to the smaller amount of sand available. Before filing a defence the appellants demanded particulars of the alleged lost profits. The plaintiff refused to provide particulars and the chambers judge dismissed the appellants' application for an order compelling particulars. ,appeal dismissed; the appellants had not challenged the sufficiency of the pleadings; no case was made out that the appellants required the particulars in order to file a proper defence to the action.  There were other rules available to the appellants which could be utilized to discover the underlying details of the damage claim."
"Appeal from Provincial Court The ultimate question in this appeal is whether the evidence adduced by the Crown - the defence called no evidence - was insufficient to such a degree that the trial judge's verdict of guilty ought to be found by this Courteither unreasonable or one that cannot be supported by the evidence. HELD: Appeal dismissed. 1)The trial judge was correct to find that the evidence did not yield up any reasonable inferences. 2)There was sufficient evidence for him to reach conclusion respecting the cause of the injuries beyond a reasonable doubt without resorting to medical opinion. On the question of identity, the question was readily resolved by examining the circumstances preceding the infliction of the injury, by looking at the photographs of the victim taken the following day by the witness(the counterman at the 7-Eleven), by looking through the Crown witnesses' testimony by the opinions of both the counterman and the police officer who saw the victim shortly after the injuries were inflicted and called the police, and by the opinion of the police inspector shortly after that. 3)The procedural point raised by the appellants was that there was insufficient evidence to conclude that the appellant's injuries resulted from any blows such as kicks or punches and as such were the result of an assault. 4)The Court dismissed the procedural argument without giving reasons.","At trial in Provincial Court, the accuseds called no evidence and were convicted. They appealed on the basis that the Crown's evidence was so insufficient that a verdict of guilty was unreasonable or was one which could not reasonably be supported on the evidence. HELD: Appeal dismissed. 1)No medical evidence was necessary to establish that the victim's injuries were caused by an assault, given the photographs admitted into evidence, the evidence of the police officer who was called to the scene of the assault and the evidence of the 7-11 clerk who was first approached by the victim for assistance. 2)Evidence of exclusive opportunity was unnecessary to sustain a conviction where there was other circumstantial evidence pointing to the identity of the accuseds. 3)Although a failure to permit an accused who calls no evidence to argue last in a jury trial might be a good ground of appeal, the failure to be permitted to argue last before a judge alone was merely a procedural error which could be cured under the curative provision contained in S.686(1)(b)(iv) of the Criminal Code."
"The deceased's family requested an independent review of the medical files of three individuals who had been treated by the Regional Hospital for the purpose of internal evaluation, education and improvement of hospital care and practices. The Regional Hospital refused to release the report. Several members of the family also sought to participate in the peer review process, alleging that they were being betrayed by the hospital. Awarding the appellants $10,000 for past and future performance, that the review should be conducted solely for the purposes of peer review. The rest of the money was earmarked for future performance improvement. The appellants sought to recover the $15,000 awarded to the hospital for general damages. Dismissing the appeal, that there was no evidence that the hospital or its doctors were aware of the nature of the peer reviews, nor did they have any expectation that they would be published. In fact, many of the physicians who were approached by the families said they expected the report to be confidential. Others indicated they would refuse to participate. In any event, the report was to be released to the families. As far as the physicians were concerned, they were to be responsible for the care, diagnosis and treatment of the deceased. They were also to ensure confidentiality of their participation in the process.","Following three patient suicides at the Cape Breton Regional Hospital, the hospital, in response to concerns and questions from family members, retained two psychiatrists to review the cases, the roles and responsibilities of individuals involved in the cases, patient records and hospital policies and practices. At the end of the review they were to provide a written report to the hospital's Chief Executive Officer. The hospital staff participating in the investigation and review were advised that their information would be treated as part of a 'peer review' and therefore confidential. Upon receipt of the report the hospital, as a result, refused to disclose the report to the families. An application pursuant to the Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy Act was made by an M.L.A., who sought for the disclosure of the report and for a review of the hospital's decision to not release the report. The hospital decided to release the full report. The appellant employees appealed the decision of the hospital, claiming that they had been assured confidentiality. Allowing the appeal, that the disclosure of personal information consisting of personal recommendations or evaluations, character references, or personal evaluations by the appellants and other hospital staff are presumed under s. 20(3)(g) of the Act to be an unreasonable invasion of a third party's personal privacy. Under s. 20(1) the hospital is required to refuse to disclose this information. It necessarily follows that recommendations in the report founded upon such information is also presumed to be an unreasonable invasion of privacy and is likewise not to be disclosed. The remainder of the report is disclose able."
"The accused was charged with driving while his blood alcohol level exceeded.08 contrary to s. 255(1) and s. 253(a) of the Criminal Code and for operating a motor vehicle when his blood level exceeded 80 milligrams of alcohol in 100 millilitres of blood. At trial the Crown tendered a certificate of analysis establishing that the accused was impaired by alcohol or drug, and an affidavit of service by Constable L. P. Weber was tendered in evidence establishing that a 'true copy of the certificate' had been served upon the accused. In argument questions were raised as to the sufficiency of the evidence in respect of the copy given to the accused which he had not yet seen. HELD: The accused was entitled to a new trial. 1)It would not be unreasonable to require that if there is to be a challenge under this subsection of the affidavit orof the copy supplied, it should be based upon a discovereddifference as between the copy and the original. 2)The refusal to admit the certificate became merely the prize in a procedural game which can only bring the justice system into disrepute.  3)The certificate was never withdrawn. It was a copy which had been prepared well in advance of the trial. The trial judge had further advanced the law to a point where even when notchallenged there is an obligation to provide supplemental evidence of comparison, etc. in order to buttress the evidenceof the affidavit.","The accused was acquitted on a charge of operating a motor vehicle while impaired by alcohol or drugs and while his blood alcohol level exceeded 80 milligrams of alcohol in 100 millilitres of blood when questions were raised as to the sufficiency of the evidence with respect to the copy of the certificate of analysis. HELD: 1)Section 258(7) has been judicially amended to mean 'true copy' which presumably, though not logically, means something more than 'copy'. It has grown to the point that an affidavit may be disregarded if the police do not provide supplemental evidence when challenged as to the manner in which they assured the accuracy of the copy. 2)The trial judge further advanced the law to a point where, even when not challenged, there is an obligation to provide supplemental evidence of comparison in order to buttress the evidence of the affidavit. This is an error of law. A challenge under s258(7) should be based upon a discovered difference as between the copy and the original. Otherwise the refusal to admit the certificate becomes merely a prize in a procedural game which can only bring the justice system into disrepute. 3)A new trial was ordered to determine whether the stop was justified."
"The appellant was convicted of breach of a recognizance made under the authority of s. 810.1 of the Criminal Code for the purpose of preventing further sexual offences against persons under the age of 14 years. The sentence was varied by reducing the term of probation to one year and by deleting the provisions concerning possession and consumption of alcohol, entry into premises where alcohol is sold and consumed, and submission to breath or blood testing. HELD: A period of probation is an appropriate penalty for his offence, the inclusion of the term which prohibits him from consuming alcohol is inappropriate since it had no relation to the original recognizzance, and does not have any other purpose. The term of the probation, three years, was out of proportion to the nature of the offence.","An appeal of a sentence for a breach of recognizance made under s.810.1 of the Criminal Code, the purpose of which is to prevent further sexual offences against persons under the age of 14 years. HELD: The sentence was varied by reducing the term of probation to 1 year and by deleting the provisions concerning possession and consumption of alcohol, entry into premises where alcohol is sold and consumed, and submission to breath or blood testing. A period of probation was appropriate but 3 years was out of proportion to the nature of the offence. The inclusion of a term prohibiting him from consuming alcohol was inappropriate since it had no relation to the purpose of the original recognizance."
"The parties were married for 14 years and separated in 1995. There have been a number of Interim Applications and Interim Orders. The parties entered into a Partial Agreement and Minutes of Settlement in March 2000 providing for joint care and custody of the children with their primary residence being with their mother and fixing her with the responsibility for their day to day care. The Agreement does not address the level of child support in accordance with the Federal Child Support Guidelines nor does it provide a limited capacity or practical retraining of the petitioner to facilitate employment. HELD: The divorce judgment will be issued forthwith.  1) The parties have never had any financial stability in part because they far too readily accessed credit based on future expectations of capacity that have never been realized and they would be wise to cease utilization of credit for short term relief. Doing so in the long run imperils the ability to provide properly for the children. 2) There is an exceptional situation that requires some adjustment with respect to the Agreement reached by the parties. All access costs as agreed to are entirely and solely the responsibility of the respondent. Access should be adjusted for inflation and the Corollary Relief Judgment should be issued as of that date. 3) The respondent's income was fixed at $6,875 U.S. per month and there were no arrears in the amount of $82,500 for the two children. There were no delays in the filing of the statement of claim. The respondent was entitled to a credit card for access and there would not be any jurisdiction remaining open for the court to make a limited realistic adjustment to their Agreement.","The parties were married for 14 years and separated in 1995, entering into a detailed Separation Agreement in 1998. The two children of the marriage are 16 and 8 years of age. There was a long history of relatively short terms of employment and several moves to take employment. The respondent had a grade 12 education and some university courses but no practical skills or training. For the past 3 years, the respondent had made no reasonable efforts for employment, developed no skills of a practical nature, and derived her income from child support payments and the Child Tax Credit and by incurring debt in excess of $20,000.00 The parties had entered bankruptcy during the course of the marriage and had no assets or savings or pension entitlement at the time of separation or acquired since. The petitioner now earned an annual salary of $115,500.00. The Agreement did not address the level of child support in accordance with the Federal Child Support Guidelines, nor did it provide for practical retaining by the Respondent to facilitate employment. This was an exceptional situation that required some adjustment to the Agreement reached by the parties. The court ordered the establishment of a retraining fund of $6,500.00 with direct payments to whatever institution the Respondent may choose. Limited spousal support was to terminate on the earlier of completion of the retraining allowance or transfer of the balance of the outstanding to the Respondent on September 1st, 2001. An adjustment was also made to account for arrears in child support and child support payments."
"The plaintiff was seriously injured in a motor vehicle accident in 1994, when he was rear-ended by two tractor trailers driven by the defendant. The issue of liability was severed when a civil jury assessed the plaintiff's damages at 57% of the damages. The plaintiff sought an interim payment of $250,000 as it was found that the accident was caused by the defendants' negligence. The defendant argued that because the plaintiff had not yet been diagnosed with any of the possible pre-existing medical conditions that might be present, and because his injuries were largely demonstrated by clinically objective medical evidence, his damages were likely to recover in the amount of $300,000. The only remaining issue was whether the interim payment should be made for the plaintiff. HELD: The plaintiff was entitled to various workers' compensation benefits as a result of the 1994 accident, primarily for temporary earnings replacement and medical aid costs.  1)The awards of the defendants were set aside and an order was made for interim payment.  2)The plaintiff's claim for loss of future earnings on behalf of the defendant was dismissed. The court was unable to form an opinion as to what damages are likely to be recovered by the plaintiff at a final assessment of damages and it was not appropriate to order an interim payments of damages.  3)The court reviewed the state of the medical evidence before it and found that $200,000 represents a just amount of interim payment that ought to be made to the plaintiff and an Order was made accordingly.","In a trial of liability only, jury found defendants to be entirely responsible for causing motor vehicle accident. Plaintiff was found contributorily negligent and liability was apportioned 57.5% to defendant and 42.5% to plaintiff. Plaintiff suffered significant injuries and plaintiff and spouse applied for interim payment of damages. Application allowed in part; plaintiff awarded $250,000.00 as interim payment; spouse's application denied. Once court is satisfied plaintiff has met threshold requirement of a judgment or admission of liability, it must strive with evidence before it to determine what damages are likely to be recovered by plaintiff and may then order interim payment if it thinks just, within limitation that it not exceed a reasonable proportion of the projected amount. The greater the certainty of the final outcome of liability and the greater the strength of the evidence supporting the damages claim, the higher the proportion of damages that will be advanced. There is nothing which precludes interim payment from being substantial amount in a proper case but court must be cautious to avoid any influence on eventual outcome of damage assessment. Although there had not yet been discovery of plaintiff's doctors or an independent medical exam obtained, the plaintiff's injuries were largely demonstrated by clinically objective medical evidence and there was no evidence of any pre-existing condition. In such circumstances, a substantial sum could be ordered. Neither pre-judgment interest nor costs are to be considered by the court in such an application. The evidence in support of the spouse's application was far too incomplete and had yet to be tested by defendants in discovery. Court could not form opinion on what damages spouse was likely to recover."
"FIAT. In January 2003, one of 29 nieces and nephews of the deceased sought proof of the will of the late, great-grandfather, who was 88 at the time of his death. He had given instructions for a new will in 1998 and then changed his mind. Two and one-half years prior to signing the will, he instructed a lawyer to draw a different will, which was never signed because of family pressure. That there might be some pressure to favour his family over charity is not surprising and his yielding to that pressure is consistent with family solidarity and could not be construed as undue influence. HELD: The issue was not to send the issue for trial unless evidence is brought forth which, if accepted, would tend to negative knowledge and approval or testamentary capacity. No issue of credibility has arisen. The motion was dismissed with costs.","The applicants brought a motion seeking proof of the Will in solemn form, questioning the testamentary capacity, due execution of the will and raising the issue of undue influence and coercion. HELD: The motion was dismissed with costs. The role of the Court is that of a gatekeeper. The Court will not send an issue to trial unless evidence is brought forth which, if accepted, would tend to negative knowledge and approval of testamentary capacity. No issue of credibility arose."
"The applicant brought an application to find that the respondent had abused a child pursuant to s. 62(a) or (b) of the Children and Family Services Act. The applicant had known the respondent for some time and had stayed over at his house alone with him. There were very serious allegations, the Court found. The evidence of the complainant's alleged sexual assault had more probability of truth than disbelief. The Court found that the accused had sexually assaulted a child within the meaning of the Act. Although the standard of proof is high (on a balance of probabilities) the Court adopted the position that was adopted in J.L. v. CAS of Halifax v. Attorney General of Nova Scotia (2d) 437. In determining whether or not the allegations of the Complainant are probable peripheral evidence, the court looked at whether the respondent committed the alleged offence and whether the allegations were impeached.","The Agency brought an application for a finding that the Respondent had abused a child, for the purposes of entering his name in the Child Abuse Register. The complainant described certain incidents that amounted to sexual assault when she was under the age of 16. The Respondent had previously been acquitted of charges based on the same allegations in criminal court. The Respondent has abused a child within the meaning of the Act. Although the standard of proof is on the balance of probabilities, it is elevated with the seriousness of the allegations and their implications. However, it is considerably less than proof beyond a reasonable doubt."

"The plaintiff was standing with other patrons near the entrance to a pub when the defendant punched him in the face and knocked him unconscious. The plaintiff applied for summary judgment and an assessment of damages pursuant to Rule 485. Liability was admitted and the plaintiff now applied for a summary judgment of damages in the amount of $5,000.00. HELD: The plaintiff was awarded general damages of $12,500.00, $1,911.70 plus costs and pre-judgment interest.  1) The court reviewed Queen's Bench Rule 153 (which requires a party to plead specifically any matter, fact or point of law which, if not specifically pleaded, might take the other party by surprise. 2) There were no special damages proven by the plaintiff and no aggravated damages can be awarded because the plaintiff did not expressly plead them in his statement of claim.  3) The plaintiff suffered significant pain and suffering for a number of months after the assault. Extensive dental treatment was required and further treatment will be required in the future. Excluding any component for aggravated damages, the court concluded a fair award for general damages is $12500.","The plaintiff claims damages for injuries sustained when he was punched in the face and knocked unconscious by the defendant.

He was sentenced to a fine of $1,500, placed on probation for 18 months and ordered to make restitution to the plaintiff for the cost of the dental work in the amount of $3,263.30. 2) The plaintiff suffered serious injuries and significant pain for a number of months after the assault. Extensive dental treatment was required and will be required at some point in the future. The plaintiff has minimal scarring. He is awarded general damages of $12,500. 3) The pleadings and the affidavit evidence do not support a substantial award for aggravated damages. However, the photographs graphically depict the extent to which his appearance was altered. Hurt feelings can reasonably be inferred from the fact that the plaintiff was rendered unconscious on the ground in a crowd of onlookers. These circumstances justify an award of aggravated damages in the sum of $2,000. 4) The plaintiff was awarded special damages in the amount of $1,911.70."
"FIAT: The applicant, a bankrupt, seeks from the Court an order pursuant to Rule 30(1) of the general rules under the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act under s. 187(11) of The Bankruptky and Insolincy Act extending the time for the bringing of this appeal. HELD: The application is dismissed. The registrar's interpretation is supported by the legislation and based upon the undisputed facts which he found, the interpretation is reasonable. There has been no reason demonstrated to set aside the adjudication of the registrar and the decision of the trustee in the private proposal. There have been no complaints regarding the judgment.","FIAT: The applicant applies for an order pursuant to Rule 30(1) of the general rules under the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act setting aside the decision of the registrar upholding the disallowance of the applicant's claim as a secured creditor in the proposal. HELD: In reviewing the registrar's judgment, it is clear that he succinctly and accurately set forth the facts of the matter and that to that end there has been no complaint regarding the judgment. The court considered the registrar's analysis in this matter and can find no fault with his reasoning. The registrar's interpretation is supported by the legislation and, based upon the undisputed facts which he found, the interpretation is reasonable. The application is dismissed."
"The applicant prepared a HomePak Application on behalf of the respondents. The Homeowners signed and he submitted to SGI the standard 'comprehensive perils' home coverage policy with Fine Arts Rider for the Swarovski collection with an estimated value of approximately $9,950. The respondents made a claim under their house insurance policy under which SGI denied coverage on the basis of the exclusion in the policy; the loss was due to an accidental breakage which did not constitute 'listed peril' as defined in the coverage policy. SGI issued a third party claim against the respondents, claiming that SGI was negligent or in breach of contract or contributory negligence pursuant to the Contributory Negligence Act for failing to issue a policy of insurance to the them. The trial judge found that S.GI contributed equally to the Homeowners' loss by 'their negligent acts' and was responsible to pay 50% of the judgment. The claim against SGI for negligence was dismissed. The court found that the trial judge correctly placed the duty of care on the intermediary, as the appellant had gathered the information from the Homeowner, reviewed the existing coverage and completed the application. The appellant did not ask to see the policy or receive it nor did he produce it to him. The evidence showed that the appellant and the respondents were talking at a cross purposes based upon their own understanding of the nature and extent of the Home Owners' existing insurance coverage. The issues were whether the appellant published the availability of this special coverage in any of the materials distributed to its agents, and whether the trial court concluded that SIA contributed equally in the loss suffered by the respondents by their negligent acts. HELD: The appeal was allowed. The verdict of contributory negligent negligence was not satisfied on the part of the trial judges. The appeal court found the trial defendant and his insurer, SGI, were liable in negligence on the same basis that the respondents and the insurer, the defendants, were responsible for the loss sustained by the Draders. The only general duty on the insurer was that of duty of protection under the Contributorie Negligencing Act. S.G. contributed equally for the losses caused by the Home owners by virtue of the SGI policy. The Court found that there was no duty on SGI to provide coverage beyond what is understood by, and applied for by the broker. SGE did not publish the availability coverage which it had extended to the respondents under the McCallum Hill SGI Policy. The fact that the respondent did not advise or advise","The respondent Homeowners sued the respondents Sebastian and the TWC alleging negligence or breach of contract for failing to obtain the coverage for insurance as instructed by the Homeowners. Sebastian and TWC issued a third party claim against the appellant SGI and claimed SGI was negligent or in breach of contract or contributory negligence pursuant to the Contributory Negligence Act for failing to issue a policy of insurance in accordance with the application submitted to SGI by Sebastian on behalf of the Homeowners. The trial judge concluded Sebastian and TWC were negligent and liable for the loss suffered by the Homeowners. Further, the trial judge concluded that the insurer, SGI, owed a duty of care to both Sebastian and TWC and the Homeowners to properly underwrite and deal with the application for insurance. The trial judge concluded SGI contributed equally to the Homeowners' loss by 'their negligent acts' and was responsible to pay 50% of the judgment. The negligence of Sebastian and TWC is not disputed in this appeal. The Homeowners have been paid the amount owed under the judgment and advised they have no interest in the matter and did not participate in the appeal. SGI appeals and submits the trial judge erred in determining that SGI: (a) owed a duty of care to the insureds, Homeowners, and to the broker when it received an application for insurance in 'all the circumstances'; and (b) breached its duty of care. HELD: That portion of the judgment finding that SGI is liable for 50% of the damages payable to the Homeowners is set aside and the Third Party Claim is dismissed. Accordingly, the appeal is allowed with costs to the Appellant. The trial judge correctly placed the duty of care on the intermediary, Sebastian. It is clear the insurer relies on the broker to apply for the coverage in accordance with his clients' (i.e., the insureds') wishes and needs. There was no other evidence before the Court to establish the standard of care, the basis for imposing a duty at law where none has previously existed, or the subsequent breach of that duty by the insurer, SGI, in connection to the application for insurance submitted by Sebastian. The Court concluded there was nothing in this transaction which warrants the creation of a duty of care owed by the insurer to a broker applying for insurance on behalf of his clients."
"The Ministry brings an application for a permanent order for the child, born April 19, 2010, pursuant to s. 37 of The Child and Family Services Act. The biological parents, M.S. and P.K., oppose the application and submit the child should be returned to the mother. HELD: 1) The child is in need of protection pursuant to ss. 37(1) and s. 11 of the Act.  2) The burden is on the Ministry to establish its case on the balance of probabilities being the civil burden of proof. 3) The children have been placed into the temporary custody of the Minister, and the parents wish to have the children returned to them, they must make efforts to improve or remove the conditions or circumstances in the home which have resulted in the children being taken from the parents. 4) Two former child protection workers have been granted status as persons of sufficient interest pursuant to sec. 23 of The Act. They were present throughout the course of this trial but declined the opportunity to take any active part in the proceedings.","The Ministry brought an application for a permanent order for the child pursuant to s. 37 of The Child and Family Services Act. The Minister apprehended the child at birth. The mother's three older children had been apprehended with two other older children placed with a person of sufficient interest and the third child was made a permanent ward of the Ministry. The Minister argued that given the extensive past history of the three older children, the Minister properly apprehended the infant and the permanency planning committee was of the opinion that there was no use putting off the inevitable permanent order for the child. The mother and the child's father had separated with the father supporting the mother having the child returned to her care and the father having access to the child. HELD: There was no basis for the initial apprehension as the child was not in need of protection. The child shall be returned to the mother who is a person who has a right of custody of the child pursuant to s. 36(3) of the Child and Family Services Act. This shall be done on a transitional basis as determined by the Ministry with the child to be completely returned to the mother within 30 days of this order. There was no evidence presented at trial regarding attempts by the Ministry to pursue any less intrusive alternatives and instead proceeded directly to the most severe position being a permanent order. The evidence did not justify the Ministry's position."
"FIAT: The issue is whether the children are to be relocated on an interim basis to live with the respondent in Melville, Saskatchewan. The parties commenced common law relationship in 2000. There are two children of the relationship, namely: Justin and Sean. The initial parenting arrangement was that the children resided with the mother in La Ronge, but in 2010 the mother relocated to Melville. The evidence discloses that the respondent sold her home in March 2013. The petitioner says that in April 2013 she asked the mother if she was planning to move. The mother says that she is planning to call the child and invite him to her home. HELD: 1) The parties were to be joint custodial parents of the two boys. The preservation of the status quo is in the best interests of the boys. Therefore, the boys are to reside in LaRonge or Air Ronge and attend school there while residing with the petitioner.  2) The non-primary care parent should not apply on interim basis for the children's primary residence and be entitled to access every second weekend. This arrangement was in place from January 2011 until April 2013 when the respondent unilaterally relocated the children from La Ronenge to Melvania. This co-parenting was a de facto co- parenting arrangement between the parties. There is no risk for the boys in the care of either the petitioner or the respondent.","The issue to be determined was whether the parties' children should remain in La Ronge or be relocated to live with the respondent in Melville on an interim basis. The parties were in a common law relationship and had two children, aged 9 and 12. After separation, the children resided with their mother, the respondent, in La Ronge and they had access with the petitioner on the weekends. In January 2011, the parties agreed to a weekly co-parenting arrangement. In April 2013 the petitioner was advised by the respondent that she and the children had moved to Melville. Up until that point the child had always resided in the La Ronge area and attended only one school. HELD: The Court found the co-parenting arrangement to be the de facto parenting arrangement and that there was no risk to the children with either parent. The Court ordered that the parties were joint custodians of the children and that preservation of the status quo was in their best interests. The Court ordered that the children primarily reside in La Ronge with the petitioner and attend school there. The Court also ordered specified access for the respondent."
"Three days after the parties separated, the petitioner filed an application for interim orders dealing with, but not limited to, the parenting of the children and the division of family property. The application was adjourned sine die to be brought back on 7 days' notice to the respondent. The parties have four children, all of whom have had their primary residence with the petitioner. The petitioner has also applied for an order eliminating the parenting arrangements that have evolved for the children in such a way that would change the primary residency of T and K, and severely restrict the respondent's parenting time with all four children. HELD: 1)The application was granted. An interim order was made. 2)The children's primary residence was with the respondent who had not brought a formal application to change the previous interim order. Given the short notice, the court had little opportunity to do so. It would be inconsistent with the purpose and intention of the foundational Queen's Bench Rules (Rule 1-3). 3)The petitioner was granted an order to enforce the interim order made under s. 23(1)(a) and (e) of The Children's Law Act. The order was intended to provide means by which claims can be justly resolved in or by court process in timely and cost effective way. 4)The respondent was prohibited from entering the said home until further order. The children were to have access to the petitioner for the last half of the Easter break. 5)The primary residence of the four children (the petitioner and the respondent) had been with T for the past two and one-half years. The respondent has engaged in parental alienation. The Court was of the opinion that the respondent was trying to influence the children to reside with the mother. 6)The Court was not prepared to grant an order either way.","Family Law – Custody and Access – InterimThe petitioner and the respondent had four children during the course of their marriage. They separated in 2010 and the petitioner applied for interim orders, including arrangements for the parenting of the children. The court made an interim order that the parties would have joint custody with the primary residence of the children to be with the petitioner. The respondent would have access at reasonable times and on every other weekend. The parties reconciled for two years but then separated again. In 2012 the petitioner applied for an order enforcing the 2010 interim custody order. At that application, the court found that both parents were capable of parenting, but in the short term it confirmed terms of the 2010 order. A number of pre-trial conferences were held without resolving matters, and during that time, the parenting arrangements changed substantially. The oldest child began residing with the respondent in December 2014. In December 2015, the second oldest child began residing with the respondent. They stayed with the petitioner on alternate weekends. The applicant then brought this application for an order pursuant to ss. 23(1)(a) and (e) of The Children’s Law Act and pursuant to the 2012 court order, confirming the original interim order that the four children of the marriage have their interim primary residence with her and that the respondent have specified parenting time on one day each week and alternating weekends. The petitioner alleged that the respondent was attempting to influence the two youngest children to reside with him. HELD: The court ordered that the status quo parenting arrangement should remain in place until trial. In this case, the status quo was not the arrangements as they had been in 2010 and in 2012. The court found that the arrangements had evolved since the 2010 order by agreement of the parties and the changes had not occurred because the respondent was attempting to alienate the children from the petitioner."
"The accused was charged with assault and threatening to use a weapon contrary to s. 267(a) of the Criminal Code. The evidence presented at trial supported the Crown's argument that the accused initiated the confrontation by walking up to him and, in very close quarters, as the accused himself testified, getting into his personal space. The defence called two security officers to give evidence. The first officer testified that he saw the accused running towards him and point a knife at him, which the accused had in his hand. He then chased the accused down a back alley, followed by an alleyway and threw the knife at the ground. The second officer testified he saw a knife in the accused's hand, which he recognized as a knife. The accused testified that the second officer chased after him, chased him down the alley, and then chased him to his vehicle. HELD: The accused was found guilty of assault and was sentenced to imprisonment for term not exceeding ten years.  1) When one considers the factors set out in s. 2 of the Code, the accused was the first person to enter the area of the confrontation and then follow the accused through a yard and throw the knife. 2) The nature of the force or threat that was presented by the size of the accused and the words used by the second security officer were not of a nature that would warrant, as reasonable, the action subsequently taken by the accused against the second person. The Court had no hesitation in finding and concluding that the defence does not succeed. The Crown has established that the offence charged occurred on the date and at the location alleged in the indictment and that the butcher knife entered as Exhibit P1 is clearly a weapon as defined by s.2 of the code. 3) The accused's actions in leaving the area and going back to his dufflebag to retrieve the knife and thereafter approaching the complainant and using the knife to slash the complainant's tire were completely out of proportion to any reasonable response to any threat that the complainant may have perceived was made by the defendant in the circumstances of this case.","Criminal Law – Assault with a WeaponCriminal Law – Defences – Self-defence The accused was charged with assault by threatening to use a weapon, a butcher knife, contrary to s. 267(a) of the Criminal Code. The accused was panhandling outside a store when he and one of two security officers had a verbal confrontation. The accused walked towards the security officer with a butcher knife. The security officer ran to his vehicle and the accused followed him and slashed a tire on the security officer’s vehicle. The attending officer was directed to a yard where he located the accused. A knife was also located in the yard. A videotape from the store was entered as an exhibit and played for the court. The accused was considerably smaller than either of the security officers. The accused testified that he was homeless and had a lot to drink the day of the incident. He indicated that he “blacked out” and was in front of two security officers when he came to. He said that he offered them a cigarette for being in their personal space and one of the men told him that he would punch him out. The accused indicated that he got the knife out of the bag just to show the men that he was bigger than them. He said that he did not intend to stab them. At one point the accused admitted following the security officer to his vehicle and at another point said he did not. The accused said he then tried to get away from the area but was prevented from doing so by a large black vehicle. The accused said he eventually stabbed the vehicle’s tire because it was blocking his way and he went into panic mode. The accused raised the issue of self-defence. HELD: There was no question that the Crown established the offence beyond a reasonable doubt. The court found that the accused initiated the confrontation by walking up to the security officer and getting very close to him. The court found that the Crown witness’s evidence was preferred over the accused’s where it differed, namely the slashing of the vehicle tires. The court accepted the accused’s submission that the security officer told the accused to get out of his face or he would knock him out or something to that effect. The court considered the factors set out in s. 34(2) and concluded that the force or threat faced by the accused due to the size of the security officers and the words used by one of them did not warrant the action taken by the accused. The court offered numerous reasons for the conclusion: the accused initiated the confrontation; the security guard did not touch or further go after the accused; no physical force was used against the accused; and there was no history between the accused and security officer. The accused’s actions were out of proportion to any reasonable response to any threat. The court held that the Crown established, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the facts and circumstances of the case did not give rise to the defence of self-defence. The accused was found guilty as charged."
"This was a matter of major concern in the construction industry. The applicant sought to have the matter disposed of. The Minister had issued a letter to the applicant in which he stated that there was an exception to the general rule that there were only two methods by which a union can obtain bargaining rights for the employees, i.e. certification and voluntary recognition. The respondent on appeal affirmed there was a third method, albeit under Part 2 of the Act. For the appellant, that the wording of the letter was either inaccurate or misdirected at a point of law; the Minister was neither bound by any agreement made on its behalf nor by voluntary recognition; the wording was neither certified nor voluntary. Allowing the application, that there is sufficient ground to grant an order of mandamus with certiorari in aid ordering the Minister to exercise his discretion under s. 107(4) of the Trade Union Act.","The applicant union sought an order of mandamus with certiorari in aid, ordering the defendant Minister to exercise his discretion to appoint an arbitrator to hear a grievance. The Minister had refused on the grounds the union was neither certified nor a party to a voluntary agreement. Granting the application, that the Minister had misdirected himself on a point of law. Quite apart from certification and voluntary recognition, the union could attain bargaining rights pursuant to Part II of the Trade Union Act, which allowed an employer in the construction industry to assign bargaining and negotiating rights to an 'accredited employers' association' such as the Construction Management Labour Bureau Ltd. The Court ordered the Minister to exercise his discretion under s.107(4) of the Act according to law as set out in Part II of the Act and confirmed by the Appeal Division in Boyd &amp; Garland."
"The plaintiff applied to strike the statement of defence of the corporate defendant after it was found that the designated officer of the corporation failed to appear at an examination for discovery on November 23, 1993. The plaintiff's solicitors had on several occasions telephoned the defendant's solicitor to schedule examinations for discovery and to obtain statements as to documents. None of the appointments were made. Late in the proceedings, the plaintiff's solicitor sent a letter to the defendants' solicitor suggesting a range of dates for the examinations. This letter indicated that the examinations would be unilaterally scheduled. HELD: The applications were dismissed. 1)The corporate defendant was not entitled to unilaterally set the dates. It was not established that the plaintiff could refuse to attend. 2)The non-attendances did not constitute'refusing or neglecting to attend' within the meaning of Rule 231. It could not be utilized respecting the particular non- attendances to strike their statements of defence.  3)On the basis of the conduct exhibited throughout the whole of these proceedings the plaintiff was guilty of contempt of court. The contempt proceedings were still before the court even though they were adjourned sine die at the time the defendants were permitted to file statements of defense. The current applications arose out of unsuccessful attempts by the defendants to examine the defendants respecting their statementsof defence. The defendants abused the discretion of the court to set aside the judgments obtained against them and to permit them to file defences. 4)The defendants were awarded costs of the applications in any event of the cause. The costs were fixed at $1,000 against the defendant and $500 against the individual defendant.","The plaintiff applied under Queen's Bench Rule 231 to strike the statements of defence of a corporate and individual defendant for failure to attend scheduled examinations despite service of an appointment and payment of conduct money to their solicitor. The defendants had previously been permitted to re-open judgments obtained against them and had filed defences. Prior to that they had consistently failed to attend examinations in aid of execution. Contempt proceedings had been commenced against them but were adjourned sine die at the time the defendants were permitted to defend. The defendants resisted the application on the basis that they were now non-residents and not compellable by an appointment, and that the designated officer of the defendant corporation was no longer an officer. This information had not been communicated to the plaintiff's solicitor who had acted in good faith on information given to him previously by the solicitors for the defendants. The examinations had been scheduled unilaterally because the defendants' solicitor consistently refused or neglected to return phone calls or correspondence from the plaintiff's solicitors. HELD: The judge refused to strike the defences holding that in the circumstances Queen's Bench Rule 231 did not apply. He also held that the defendants, considering their conduct throughout the whole course of the lawsuit, were in contempt and ordered them to attend without conduct money any examinations unilaterally scheduled by the plaintiff failing agreement between counsel as to dates. Costs were fixed at $1,500 in any event of the cause and were ordered to be paid within two weeks."
"FIAT. The accused was charged with two counts of sexual assault. He applied for remedy under s. 24(1) of the Charter and s. 650(3) of Criminal Code compelling the respondent to provide full and complete disclosure. The sole issue was whether the imposition of trust conditions on the disclosure of the victim statements would prevent the accused from exercising his right to make full answer and defence as guaranteed by s. 7 and 11 of the charter. HELD: 1)The Court of Appeal was satisfied that the respondent failed to provide fully and complete information to the accused, who was at risk of losing his right under s7, 11(a) and 11(d) of his Charter rights. 2)The accused was able to review and study the victim statement on his own and away from the office of counsel. His counsel was unable to give him copies of certain disclosure material. 3)The judge found that the Crown failed to meet the obligations of defence counsel under s8(d). The Court of appeal held that the trust conditions imposed by the Crown in this case were reasonable and strike a balance between the right to disclosure and the rights of alleged victims, it being recognized that the right is paramount. 4)The court was also satisfied that there was no breach of the accused's constitutional right to privacy.","FIAT The accused, who was charged with two counts of sexual assault involving complainants 15 and 13 years of age, applied for a remedy under ss.24(1) of the Charter of Rights compelling the respondent to provide full disclosure to him, without trust conditions or undertakings of any sort. HELD: The imposition of trust conditions on the disclosure of victim's statements and videotaped statements in cases of sexual assault does not prevent the accused from exercising his right to make full answer and defence as guaranteed by ss. 7 and 11 of the Charter. The obligation to disclose is not absolute. The Corwn's obligation to protect the privacy of the complainants is fulfuilled by providing the statements and videotapes to counsel for the accused on trust condition that counsel retain them in his possession. The information contained therein is available to the accused and retained experts for use in preparing his defence. Since the accused knows the sustance of the complaints and, therefore, the case he has to meet, there is no danger to the fairness of the trial by virtue of the trust condition attached to disclosure. The public interest is served and the integrity of the criminal justice system is maintained when complainants are assured that staements and videotapes will not be reproduced. Application dismissed."
"FIAT. The applicant applied for an order for a judicial sale following the service of a statement of claim on the respondents in which it sought foreclosure or alternative relief. In so doing, it asked that its solicitor, Mr. Hesje be appointed as selling officer to conduct the sale and report to the Court. HELD: It was not appropriate for the Court to appoint, as selling Officer, the solicitor for the applicant creditor. Grant Richards of Cuelenaere Kendall Katzman Watson & Hagen will serve in this role as opposed to Mr.Hesje.","The applicant applied for an order for judicial sale following the service of a statement of claim on the respondents in which it sought foreclosure or alternative relief.  In so doing, it asked that its solicitor, Mr. Hesje, be appointed as selling officer to conduct the sale and report to the Court. The court expressed its concern to Mr. Hesje during the course of his submissions as to the propriety of the applicant solicitor serving in such a dual function. He informed the court that some members of our Court have allowed this to be done, others have declined. In the court's respectful view, it is not appropriate for the Court to appoint, as selling officer, the solicitor for the applicant creditor. There are obvious difficulties with conflict of interest. Who does the selling officer serve: the Court, from which his or her authority originates; or the client? The matter is of sufficient importance that the court concluded it should reduce its thoughts to a fiat and direct that it be distributed to other members of the Court. To be fair, Mr. Hesje indicated he was perfectly willing to have another member of the Law Society unconnected to the proceedings appointed as selling officer. The court understood that Grant Richards of Cuelenaere Kendall Katzman Watson &amp; Hagen will serve in this role as opposed to Mr. Hesje."
"The applicants applied for an order setting aside the grant of Letters of Administration and granting Letters Probate with respect to a document purporting to be the last will and testament of the deceased. HELD: The application was dismissed. The court did not extend the discretion granted to the court to endorse a document as testamentary which did not comply with any of the formal requirements of the Act as to execution; in particular, a document which does not bear the signature of a deceased. The applicants were entitled to their costs on a solicitor and client basis payable from the estate assets. 1)Section 37 of the Wills Act provides that a holograph will, wholly in the handwriting of the testator, and signed by him or her, may be made without any further formality or any requirement as to the presence of or attestation or signature by a witness. Thus regretfully, it must be concluded that the documents presented as the last wills and testament do not meet the statutory requirements for a valid last will. 2)HELD: Applications to be dismissed. Under the circumstances the applicants will be entitled to costs payable by the estate.","The applicants asked for an order setting aside the grant of Letters of Administration and granting Letters Probate with respect to a document purporting to be the Will of the deceased. The document was a draft Will prepared by the deceased's solicitor, which was never signed. HELD: The application was dismissed, but the applicants were entitled to their costs on a solicitor and client basis, payable from the estate. Section 37 of The Wills Act permits the Court to order a document to be fully effective as a Will notwithstanding that it was not executed in compliance with all the formal requirements imposed by the Act.

"Each party applied for a variation of the 1999 child support order which provided for basic child support in the amount of $1,411 per month. The parties separated in 1997 and shortly thereafter Mr. Marzolf moved to Alberta. The 1999 judgment incorporates the terms of an Interspousal Contract. The plaintiff commenced negotiations in 2002 for a retroactive upward variation of child support. Negotiations proceeded slowly and the plaintiff eventually countered with an application for variation in March 2004. The court had discretion as to whether the Guideline amount or some other amount should be used to calculate child support on an income in excess of $150,000. HELD: 1) The parties agreed that much of their income since separation has included significant amounts of non-recurring income in the form of capital gains, stock options and severance pay. It is self-evident that the plaintiff has a substantially greater ability to provide financial support for the children than does the defendant. 2) Based on the Guidelines and an annual income of $248,000, the court ordered that support be the amount determined by applying the Guidelines as if she were a child under the age of majority. 3) The guideline calculations will apply only to one-half of her father's 2003 income. 4) The amount owing to the plaintiff is $2,600.","Each party has applied for a variation of the judgment granted by Gunn J. in April 1999. The judgment incorporates the terms of an Interspousal Contract dated April 1999 that provides for basic child support to be paid by the petitioner in the amount of $1,411 per month. The calculation of child support in the Interspousal Contract was based on the petitioner earning $110,000. The petitioner seeks to have child support reduced for Kimberly and discontinued for Ashley. The petitioner has unilaterally terminated support for Ashley on the basis that she is over 18 years of age and not in full time attendance at school. The respondent seeks an upward variation of ongoing child support for Kimberly on the basis that the petitioner's income is significantly higher than $110,000. She also seeks a retroactive variation of support paid for both girls. HELD: 1) The parties agree that much of the petitioner's income since the separation has included significant amounts of non-recurring income in the form of capital gains, stock options and severance pay. In accordance with s. 16 of the Guidelines, a payor's income for child support purposes is determined based on total income, adjusted in accordance with Schedule III, as shown on his or her income tax return. The petitioner has provided no compelling reason to exclude any of his non-recurring income. To the contrary, it is the fairest way of proceeding. The petitioner's income since separation discloses that non-recurring income can realistically be anticipated in the future, as it has constituted a significant portion of his income in four of the last five years. The fairest way of determining the appropriate level of child support is by calculating it based on his income during the previous year. 2) The petitioner's line 150 income on his 2003 income tax return was $199,922. This includes $114,454 of non-recurring capital gain income from the sale of shares in Poplar Hill Resources. It does not include the non-taxable portion of that capital gain in the same amount. Pursuant to Clause 6 of Schedule III referred to in s. 16 of the Guidelines, this non-taxable amount is to be included as an adjustment to income. This results in the petitioner's 2003 income for child support purposes being $314,376. However, in examining documents provided by the petitioner regarding his previous year's income, it is apparent that he incurred net capital losses in 2002 of $65,424. The Court imputed $150,000 of income to the petitioner for the year 2002 despite this net capital loss and his line 150 income being only $2,410. It is therefore reasonable that this capital loss be deducted from the non-taxable portion of the capital gain he realized in 2003. This results in only $49,030 of the non-taxable portion of the 2003 capital gain being added to income for total income of $248,952. Based on the Guidelines, child support of $1,928 would be payable for Kimberly.  3) During the same year that the petitioner was enjoying income in excess of $248,000, the respondent's income for herself and the two children was only $24,345. It is self-evident that the petitioner has a substantially greater ability to provide financial support for Kimberly than does the respondent. In the circumstances it is appropriate that one-half of the Guideline amount for the petitioner's income in excess of $150,000 be payable as child support. Effective January 1, 2004, the petitioner shall pay monthly child support for Kimberly of $1,557.  4) Ashley did not complete grade 12 until June 2003. In the normal course, she would have graduated in June 2002, but she was short some classes. The required classes were not available in September 2002 so she did not return to school until the new semester in January 2003. Although Ashley was not in full time attendance in school during the last six months of 2002, she had not yet completed her basic education and had every intention of doing so. She was not in a position to withdraw from her parent's support. Considering the disparity in the ability of each of her parent to contribute to her support, it is appropriate that support for Ashley be the amount determined by applying the Guidelines as if she were a child under the age of majority.  5) A written request by the respondent for the petitioner to provide copies of his income tax returns is not required because the parties incorporated a positive obligation to exchange tax returns in their Interspousal Contract. Consistent with the objectives of the Guidelines and implicit in the Interspousal Contract the parties must have understood that the petitioner's child support obligation could change if his income changed. 6) This is clearly a case where a retroactive variation is warranted. No variation can be considered for 1999, the year of the Interspousal Contract and the judgment. Given the various sources of the petitioner's income and the significant annual fluctuations in his income, it is appropriate to use his previous year's income as the basis for calculation of his child support payable in the subsequent year. The Court went on to calculate the petitioner's income and the child support payable for each year. 7) In 2002 the petitioner's line 150 income was only $2,410. Given the pattern of the petitioner's income in the three preceding years, along with the fact that he disposed of capital assets in 2003 that generated undisclosed cash flow, and, some 2 years later, he nevertheless retains significant net assets, the Court imputed additional income to the petitioner of $150,000 for child support purposes. 8) The respondent was awarded costs set at $2,600."
"The applicants applied for leave to terminate an order for permanent care and custody respecting their three children. The applicants had been fighting an old war, blaming the Agency for their past. They had taken parenting courses, marriage counselling and parenting counselling, and had placed the children in different adoptive homes because notices of proposed adoption had been given. Counsel for the applicants indicated that they intended to proceed with the application for leave rather than the application to terminate. They opposed the leave application on the basis that the applicants had allowed matters to escalate with the Agency and that they had supported the applicants' aggression against the agency in order to avoid an outburst with the children. HELD: The application was granted. The court found that the evidence presented by the applicants was not sufficient to justify granting leave to apply to terminate the order for the permanent care. The children were placed in one home for adoption, with ongoing, informal contact between the parents. The parents' parenting was abysmal and they did not demonstrate the ability to provide the children with the stability and consistency required to succeed at parenting. It was unlikely that the children would benefit from the Agency's services if they were returned to them. The father had completed anger management training and the mother had completed marriage counselling. Although other parenting services were available through Family Services, none had been successful in the areas of mental health, anger management and impulse control.","The parents applied for leave to apply to terminate a permanent care and custody order respecting their three children. Proposed Notices of Adoption were filed for two of the children after the parents' application was filed but before it was heard. The order had been made due to, inter alia, issues of poor hygiene and nutrition; lack of supervision; domestic disputes; physical risk to the children due to inappropriate discipline; the mother's explosive temper and mental health; the father's anger; lack of insight, desire or inability to improve by the parents; inability to control themselves during access or exercise access meaningfully and an all-consuming anger and preoccupation with the Agency. Since the order was made, the mother was diagnosed with and now receiving medication for bipolar and obsessive compulsive disorders. Application for leave granted; access not ordered at the present time; supplemental affidavits and viva voce evidence were considered given that the parents had only obtained counsel after the application was filed and the nature of the issue at stake; the application could not be arrested simply because the Agency had taken steps to have the children adopted after the application was filed. Some of the factors leading to the permanent care order were being addressed by the parents, although they had not been fully dealt with; the main achievements so far appeared to be an improvement in the parents' relationship, the courses of counselling and parenting instruction they had embarked upon, an expressed willingness by the mother to undertake psychotherapy, the mother's diagnosis and medication and the parents' changed attitude towards cooperation with the Agency; these are significant building blocks on which to anchor intense parental counselling"
"HELD: The accused was released from detention after a show cause hearing. There was a substantial likelihood that the accused would, if released from custody, commit a criminal offence. His conditions included that he not consume alcohol and non-prescription drugs, and that he would not enter any public premise which served alcoholic beverages or drugs. He was using an alias at the time of his arrest and was facing outstanding charges in Manitoba, and drug related charges in Alberta. He had not been ordered released from his detention. A review of the detention orders by the court found that they would ordinarily be cursory in cursory, but the delay in the hearing from Crown counsel and the inability to accommodate the accused's counsel for several months at a time makes it unlikely that the trial of the accused will take place within a year of the date when the accused were arrested.","The accused has been in custody since November 17, 2004. After show cause hearings, the court refused to release the accused from detention. The accused apply for a review of the detention orders. HELD: 1) A review of the detention orders would ordinarily be cursory and the applications dismissed. The reasons for the decisions to refuse to release the accused cannot seriously be questioned. 2) However, a factor that causes concern is that 6 months after their arrest, not only has a preliminary hearing not been conducted, no date for a preliminary hearing has been set. No preliminary hearing date will be set before May 2005. The preliminary hearing will take 2 to 3 weeks.  It seems unlikely that the trial of these individuals will take place within a year of the date of their arrest. 3) They are ordered released on terms and upon the filing of security in the amount of $1,000."
"Wacky's filed an appeal from a decision by the Adjudicator of the Small Claims Court. At issue was whether the defendant contractor had a contractual relationship with the plaintiff, and whether the plaintiff received compensation for the flooring. The evidence at trial was that some subcontractors were not paid by the defendant, and the plaintiff was not paid for flooring materials amounting to value of $18,601.55 that had been ordered from the defendant's store. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. The Court found that in almost all of the cases the defendant had a knowledge of the benefit, and he must have either requested it or acquiesced to its performance. The court found that there was no special relationship between the defendant and the applicant, and that the plaintiff had always received compensation from the applicant. The defendant was entitled to be paid what was due. The issue was, in the absence of a special relationship, which would not necessarily defeat a claim, the absence was not an inevitable guarantee of success.","The claimant flooring dealer had supplied and installed a large amount of flooring in the defendant's new home. Although the defendant had visited the claimant's store and selected the flooring, the actual purchase was made by the defendant's contractor who did not pay the claimant and had now declared bankruptcy. The adjudicator found that although the three criteria for an unjust enrichment claim had been met, there was no special relationship between the parties and thus, denied the claim. The claimant appealed. Appeal allowed; the absence of a special relationship will not automatically defeat a claim of unjust enrichment; the Small Claims Court has the equitable jurisdiction to determine unjust enrichment claims."
"The accused was charged with possession of cannabis marijuana and possession of cocaine for the purpose of trafficking. The accused was in the backseat of a vehicle when the officer approached him. The officer smelled marijuana coming from the accused's person. When the officer asked the accused where he had been, he was not under arrest. The arrest was found to be unlawful and the cannabis marijuana was excluded. The defence contested the voluntariness of a statement given by the accused to the police. HELD: The accused's statement had been proven to be free and voluntary. The Court of Appeal did not accept the Crown's argument that the officer's subjective belief that the accused was not in possession of marijuana was objectively reasonable. The court found that the police officer's stated reason for arrest was based upon reasonable and probable grounds rather than on an inference that more, un-smoked marijuana will be present. There was no section 10(b) violation prior to the officer giving his statement to the court. The facts were not in dispute. 1) The accused had not been detained prior to his arrest nor had he been given any written warning or direction by the officer. The police officer was not aware of the smell of marijuana in the vehicle. When he smelled it, he did not object to it. 2) The officer was aware of what burned marijuana smells like. The smell was part of a larger supporting context and forms a practically coherent and logically consistent basis for a reasonable conclusion that there was something amply present in the marijuana. The fact that the smell was fresh and fresh does not constitute a violation of the accused’s s. 8 and s. 9 Charter rights. There were no police duties to advise the accused of his rights at the time of the search. 3) There were three witnesses who gave evidence on the voir dire who testified that they had been in contact with the accused prior to their arrest and, therefore, had reasonable grounds to suspect that he was under the influence of marijuana.","The accused was arrested for possession of drugs and a weapon, and for breaching his probation. Police testified they saw him walking down the street at 10am and noticed a strong smell of marijuana. When approached, he was smoking a cigarette in front of the provincial courthouse. He said he had smoked marijuana on the street, but did not have any other drugs on him. After they spoke, he asked to leave, saying he was late for a court appointment. The police asked him to deal with this matter first, ran a CPIC check and discovered the accused was on probation and required to keep the peace and be of good behaviour. He was not cautioned/advised of his right to counsel until he was arrested on the basis of what the Crown claimed was a reasonable belief the accused possessed drugs. Police conducted a 'pat-down' search, and found drugs (marijuana and cocaine) and a weapon. The accused argued his Charter rights were violated (s. 8, 9 and 10(b)) and asked the court to exclude the evidence obtained in the search. He also argued his admission/statement was not voluntary and should be excluded on the basis that it was given in the context of a violation of his Charter rights. Motions to exclude the statement and evidence obtained in the search denied. The accused's s. 8 and 9 rights were not breached. While his s. 10(b) rights were violated when he asked to leave and the officers asked him to deal with this first (which amounted to detention), his admission/statement was made before the detention and was voluntary. Further, no evidence was obtained as a result of the breach since the search only took place after the arrest/cautioning. After reviewing the relevant jurisprudence, the court concluded: the Crown must prove the arresting officer subjectively believed they found an offence apparently being committed; that subjective belief must be objectively reasonable; police may rely on an inference in forming their belief (such as the inference that marijuana smokers typically carry a supply with them); and that inference must be objectively reasonable in light of the circumstances and facts of the case. Here, the officer's subjective belief that the accused was in possession of drugs was objectively reasonable. The court accepted her evidence that she had special training in identifying the smell of marijuana and distinguishing between a strong and faint smell of marijuana. The CPIC check showed he was on probation in relation to a drug charge. Since the officer had the authority to arrest under s. 495(1)(b) of the Criminal Code, the arrest was lawful. The search taking place incidental to the arrest was reasonable. In obiter, the court went on to say that, even if the accused's s. 8 and 9 Charter rights had been breached, an analysis under s. 24 would lead to a decision not to exclude the evidence: it was not conscriptive; the offence was serious; there was no bad faith on the part of police; and the accused could have lawfully been arrested for admitting to what was a breach of his probation."
"The defendant was found guilty of failing to ensure that a guardrail was installed at the perimeter or open side where a person was exposed to a hazard of falling contrary to s. 7(1) and 9(1)(b) of the Fall Protection and Scaffolding Regulations and in both cases, he thereby committed an offence contrary to the principles of proportionality and parity. The defendant was a supervisor on the job who designed and constructed the formwork. He was fined $8,050. In assessing the appropriate sentence, the court found that the defendant understood the requirements of the provisions of the Act and the fall protection and safety regulations and made efforts to comply with them. This was not a case of reckless disregard or deliberate indifference to the legislative safety measures. Both the failure of the defendant and his errors in judgment regarding the interpretation of the legislation relating to the top-rail contributed to the hazard of the person falling off the work platform.","The on-site supervisor was convicted of two offences under the Fall Protection and Scaffolding Regulations (failing to ensure a guardrail was installed at the perimeter of the work area and failing to ensure that an intermediate or 'mid' guardrail was installed) after a mason was killed when he fell from scaffolding on the job site. Prior to the mason beginning work for the day and the supervisor temporarily leaving the site, he had told another employee to install a 'mid' guardrail but no such rail was in place when the mason fell. The court found that having decided to use guardrails, the defendant was required to make certain that those guardrails were, in fact, constructed in the manner prescribed in the regulations and to supervise and inspect the scaffolding before work was undertaken, no matter the experience level of his crew. In regard to the first count, what the supervisor thought might be a substitute for part of a proper guardrail system did not comply with the regulations. The defendant will donate $2,000 to the Public Education Trust Fund and make 18 presentations at various venues over the next 18 months; he will appear in court on a specified date to provide a status report on his progress in this regard. This was not a case of reckless disregard or deliberate indifference to the legislated safety measures and the defendant's degree of moral blameworthiness was at the lower end of the continuum as he neither created nor negligently left in place a hidden hazard. Both the actions of another workman and the deceased's own actions had contributed to the fall."
"FIAT: Royal Bank of Canada applies by notice of application for a deficiency judgment pertaining to the non-purchase money portion of the outstanding indebtedness to the defendant, Doreen Pearl Partridge, pertaining to her non-Purch money portion pursuant to her mortgage. RBC also applies to have its lawyers' costs assessed on a solicitor-client basis. The issue is whether the pro rata distribution applies solely to the indebtedness of principal and accrued interest or applies to all costs under the mortgage. HELD: The issue here is whether such costs should be subject to the pro- rata calculation for the non‑purchase portion of a mortgage, that of the solicitor-general costs, non-taxable disbursements and the applicable GST and PST. 1) The plaintiff applies by way of notice of request for solicitor-gusts and condominium fees and property management charges.  2) The pro rat calculation of the non‐purchase fund money mortgage is 8% of the total outstanding mortgage amount. The pro-rata calculation of non-payment money mortgage, calculated as $11,355.63 against the outstanding balance of the Non-purch money money portion, ought to be added to the deficiency judgment, along with the prorated principal and interest due.  3) The respondent is entitled to a deficiency judgement for principal and interests owed under the Mortgage in the amount of $9,901.23. It is entitled in the amounts of $8,901 to be paid in accordance with the non PPP money portion. 4) The defendant is entitled by notice to have solicitor- and property-management costs assessed. The judgment for solicitor‑client costs is set at 2.79 per annum.","Statutes – Interpretation – Limitation of Civil Rights Act, Section 2The plaintiff bank applied by notice of application for a deficiency judgment against the defendant pertaining to the non-purchase money portion of the outstanding indebtedness to the plaintiff pursuant to her mortgage and to some other costs related to the mortgage. The original mortgage executed by the plaintiff was for $191,000 of which $176,000 was advanced to purchase her condominium and $15,000, eight per cent of the total, was advanced for other purchases. The property sold for $156,000 pursuant to a judicial sale. The sale proceeds were distributed to pay outstanding property taxes, commission, and the principal and interest due under the mortgage in the amount of $141,945 and the net sale proceeds were to be distributed pro rata. As at November 1, 2017, the principal and interest owing on the non-purchase money portion of the mortgage was $21,250. The plaintiff requested judgment for the deficiency in the amount of $9,900 with interest to the date of judgment. It claimed it was entitled to solicitor-client costs and other costs accrued by it under the mortgage. The issue was whether such costs should be subject to the pro rata calculation for the nonpurchase portion of the mortgage, that is, 8 percent of the total costs incurred.  HELD: The application was granted. The court found that the plaintiff was entitled to a deficiency judgment for principal and interest owed under the mortgage in the amount requested. It was also entitled to judgment against the mortgagee for eight percent of the solicitor-client costs, condominium fees and property management charges."
"The appellant appealed the sentence imposed by the trial judge after a trial where he was found guilty of assault contrary to s.267(1)(b) of the Code. He was fined $1200, with a surcharge of $120 and placed on probation for 12 months. The respondent's former spouse had advised him that because of the nature of their business and uncertainty surrounding the appellant's ability to enter the United States as a driver of one of their trucks, they had had to terminate his employment. HELD: It was not in the best interest of the appellant and not contrary to the public interest to order an absolute discharge. It was clear that the appellant may appeal the finding of guilt and make the request to substitute a conviction for the conviction and although such orders should be made sparingly, they should not be reserved exclusively for trivial or unintentional offences. The appellant is 38 years old and was employed by Westcan Bulk Transport for a number of years. He had been employed by the transporter of bulk cargo in the four western provinces and the western United States. He advised the employer that if the appellant were again able to cross the border and operate its equipment in the U.S., that his rehire status while not guaranteed would be 'pretty fair'.","38 year old truck driver with no previous criminal record was found guilty of assault contrary to ss.267(1)(b) of the Code.

A medical doctor has been reassessed and ordered to repay hospital billings already received as a result of services provided to patients. The Saskatchewan Medical Care Insurance Act provides that a physicianaggrieved by an order of the joint medical professional reviewcommittee may appeal to a judge of the Court of Queen's Bench. HELD: The Committee's decision was set aside on the merits. 1)There was insufficient evidence before the Committee to constitute proof that the doctor's delivery of medical services was unacceptable from a medical perspective. The Committee exceeded its jurisdiction by basing its decision on irrelevant considerations and thereby abused its discretion and further acted on inadequate materials. 2)The Committee did not have the discretion to enter into the investigation of the applicant. The committee did not abuse its jurisdiction. 3)The findings were not reasonably supported by the evidence and there was no basis for setting aside the decision on this basis.,"Dr. Huerto appealed a decision of a Joint Medical Professional Review Committee, pursuant to which he was ordered to repay approximately $384,000.00 to Saskatchewan Health. HELD: Appeal dismissed. 1)The legislation provides for an appeal to the Court of Queen's Bench and for no further appeal. Such an appeal can be taken on the following grounds: (a)the committee exceeded its jurisdiction; (b)it failed to observe the rules of natural justice; (c)it made an error of law; (d)its findings can not be reasonably supported by the evidence which it was entitled to consider. 2) The Court found no error of jurisdiction or failure to observe the rules of natural justice. 3)The Court found no palpable or overriding error in the facts as determined by the Committee based on the evidence."
"The appellant corporation appealed a jury award of $60,000 for mental distress in a wrongful dismissal action brought by the respondent. The appellant had no history of sales in the Atlantic provinces and it was expected that the appellant would provide her with a base salary of $40,000 plus commissions. The sales compensation plan was not changed prior to 1993. The respondent was awarded six months' notice. She was awarded the additional $10,000 due to mental distress as a result of conduct arising out of the dismissal. The trial judge concluded that mental suffering would not have been in the reasonable contemplation of the parties at the time the employment contract was entered into as flowing from the appellant's unjust dismissal. He also concluded that the respondent's conduct pre- and post-expectations of mental distress did not constitute sufficient damages to recover from the wrongful dismissal. Dismissing the appeal, that the jury's assessment of damages for mental suffering was inordinately and disproportionately high.","The respondent was hired as an account manager by the appellant. She did not reach her planned sales goals during her employment, and became depressed. She took six weeks off work on the advice of her doctor. When she returned from sick leave she was dismissed by the appellant, who had already decided to terminate her employment after concluding that she was not able to handle the job. She claimed damages for mental distress for the sudden and callous manner in which she had been dismissed. The jury awarded the respondent $20,000 in lieu of notice and $60,000 damages for mental distress. The appellant appealed the award for mental distress. Per Hallett, J.A., Roscoe, J.A., concurring, allowing the appeal, that the suddenness and callousness of a dismissal does not constitute conduct that gives rise to an actionable wrong separate and apart from the cause of action for the dismissal without notice. Per Freeman, J.A., dissenting, dismissing the appeal, that a degree of mental distress is always likely to accompany the termination of employment. However, when the employer's conduct aggravates the mental distress beyond the degree which can be remedied by agreement or reasonable notice, a right to further damages arises."
"The plaintiff brought an action for wrongful dismissal or, stating it more correctly, for damages for dismissal from her employment without adequate notice. The action was under the simplified procedure in Part Forty of Queen's Bench Rules. At trial, the affidavits-in-chief of the plaintiff's witnesses were marked as plaintiff exhibits and the witnesses were then called for cross-examination by the defendant, followed by redirect examination by plaintiff's counsel. At issue was whether equal latitude may be required in the defendant's cross-exam of the witnesses. HELD: The plaintiff was awarded judgment with costs. Fees were taxed on column 2. 1)The plaintiff had been employed for 23 years and had become the office manager, bookkeeper and, generally, the key office person. Her role included decision making, especially in matters relating to the accounts. 2)The conduct to which she refers may be viewed as constructive dismissal and was accepted as such by the plaintiff by letter on May 25, 1998. But her employment had already been terminated by notice of nearly a year. The defendant was entitled to the benefit of the services of its employee during the period of notice but acts of constructive dismissal entitle the employee to withdraw her services without reduction of the time of notice. 3)Saskatchewan s.45 and 46 of the Employment Insurance Act, S.C. 1996, refer to s.46 of the Act. The plaintiff remains entitled to notice to March 31, 1999 at her salary at her usual rate of $19.20 per month. 4)The cause of action is that at the end of the period the employment insurance benefits will remain unimpaired, the defendant can therefore make no deduction for any such insurance payments made to the plaintiff. If the plaintiff has any complaints about her relationship with the defendants during this time, she is to be deducted.","The plaintiff who had been employed by the defendant's predecessor for 23 years as office manager and bookkeeper until 1997, brought an action for damages against her new employers for dismissal without adequate notice. The plaintiff took stress leave and requested to be relieved of her duties as office manager in 1998. The action proceeded under the simplified procedure in Part Forty of the Queen's Bench Rules. HELD: 1)The conduct amounted to constructive dismissal entitling her to withdraw services without a reduction in the notice period. Although the defendant had numerous complaints the plaintiff was not dismissed for cause. Her termination of employment related only to her reduced position as bookkeeper which was for an indefinite period of time. Her employment had already been terminated by notice of nearly a year. She remained entitled to notice to March 31, 1999 at her salary at the time of termination and to medical expenses that would have been covered but without bonuses or extra payments for sick pay. 2)The defendant did not establish the plaintiff ought to have done more to mitigate her loss. There was no basis for punitive damages nor for an extension of the period of notice.  3)The net earnings between May 1998 and March 1999 were deducted after deducting $50 for the cost of qualifying for that employment. Amounts owing by the plaintiff to the defendant were to be deducted. 4)The plaintiff was entitled to interest in accordance with the Pre-judgment Interest Act. 5)The defendant could make no deduction for insurance benefit payments. Sections 45 and 46 of the Employment Insurance Act was drawn to their attention. 6)The plaintiff was awarded costs. Fees were to be taxed on column 2. 7)The plaintiff was to deliver a copy of the calculation of the judgment. Either could issue judgment with the other's consent as to form and content. An application for further directions could be made."
"The plaintiff sued for damages from the defendant alleging he was constructively wrongfully dismissed from his employment with the defendant. The plaintiff elected to have the determination of liability and the assessment of damages determined by a civil jury. The jury determined that the plaintiff was Constructively dismissed and awarded the plaintiff damages. In addition to the claim for damages for failure to give reasonable notice of termination, the plaintiff asserted a claim against the defendant for unpaid holiday pay that he alleged was owing to him at the date of his dismissal. HELD: The plaintiff was awarded his holiday pay in lieu of time off. The court reviewed the various alleged breaches of the LSA and concluded that the defendant had not suffered prejudice to the plaintiff's right to holiday pay. 1)The plaintiff was hired by the defendant in 1988 as the superintendent of the Woodlawn Regional Park. He was hired as superintendent in 1989. He worked 30 hours per week. In 1990, he was paid $8.00 per hour. He claimed the holiday pay should not be included in the calculation of holiday pay as it was a wage disguised for the purposes of avoiding paying income tax. 2)In the alternative, the defendant claims that the doctrine of estoppel or waiver should apply to prevent the plaintiff from claiming his entitlement to holidays. Even if the plaintiff is entitled to holidays or holiday pay for 10 years, he should only be entitled to recover back to April 1990 as he is limited by the Limitation of Actions Act which only allows recovery of money under a contract up to 6 years after the cause of action arises. 3)In this case the plaintiff clearly indicated that the $250.00 portion of the truck allowance was made to avoid paying tax. He also asserted that holiday pay was really wage, as he was a'manager' within the meaning of s.4(2) of the holidays. 4)Any holiday pay owing to the defendant will be calculated only on the table. The onus to rebut the presumption arising out of a requirement in the Labour Standards Act to meet his burden to establish his damage is squarely on the plaintiff. In this case it would be contrary to public policy for the plaintiff to appear to endorse the defendant's actions by calculating holiday pay on the basis of his wage and this portion of his truck allowance. In the alternative he would be substantially prejudiced if he was now allowed to assert that right.","A jury determined the plaintiff was constructively dismissed from his employment as park superintendent in 1997 and awarded damages for failure to give reasonable notice. The defendant claimed the contract of employment was all inclusive; that the plaintiff exaggerated the amount of time he spent on the job in winter; that the reduced winter hours were not in lieu of overtime pay as he was a manager within the meaning of s.4(2) of the LSA; the doctrine of estoppel or waiver applied as he never claimed a right to holiday pay for 10 years and the employer relied on his not doing so; if the plaintiff is entitled to holiday pay he should only recover back to April 1990 as he is limited by the Limitation of Actions Act; it should not be based on wages plus truck allowance as wages as defined in the LSA does not include allowances for costs. The claim for unpaid holiday pay claimed from April 1988 to October 1997, based on his wages plus one-half his truck expense allowance, was reserved pending a decision by the Court of Appeal as to whether the Court of Queen's Bench has jurisdiction to determine the issue of entitlement to holiday pay. HELD: The claim was dismissed with costs.  1)The Court of Appeal held in Kolodziejski v. Auto Electric Service that the Queens' Bench has jurisdiction to entertain a civil action for non-payment of holiday pay. 2)The plaintiff may rely on s.30(1) of the LSA to establish he is entitled to holidays and on s.33 to establish he entitled to pay in lieu of taking holidays. The onus then shifts to the defendant to prove it complied with some exception in the LSA. Section 75 prevents an employee from waiving his or her entitlement. Whether the plaintiff asserted his right to holiday pay or not, he remained entitled to his annual holidays in accordance with the LSA. 3)The plaintiff can claim for any holiday pay in lieu of time off that he can establish he was entitled to from April 1990 to his termination date. Section 3(1)(f)of the LAA states that a cause of action for recovery of money under a contract, express or implied, must be commenced within 6 years of the date on which the cause arose. 4)The plaintiff clearly indicated that a portion of the truck allowance was made to avoid paying tax. As such it would be contrary to public policy for the Court to appear to endorse the plaintiff's actions by calculating his holiday pay on the basis of his wage and this portion of his truck allowance.  5)The defendant's position that the contract included a component of holiday pay each month was inconsistent with its position that the plaintiff took these days off as holidays during the year. The contract of employment did not include a component of holiday pay in lieu of time off.  6)Failure by the defendant to keep records for the purpose of inspection by the minister does not result in a reverse onus. The onus remains on the plaintiff to establish what holidays he did not take. 7)The plaintiff admitted to taking time away from his duties for personal time and for city business as mayor. The plaintiff was not there in his capacity as superintendent. Section 31(1)(b) indicates that an employee shall be permitted to take holidays in one uninterrupted period. The defendant allowed the plaintiff to take days off in any manner he chose. It was inconsistent that the plaintiff's failure to comply with the notice requirement meant for the benefit of the employer could be used by an employee to disclaim that his days off were holidays. 8)The plaintiff was clearly a manager within the meaning of LSA. Even if he were not a manager, he failed to prove, on a balance of probabilities that he worked overtime hours in excess of the statutory minimum in order to qualify for overtime. Any days off taken by the plaintiff could not be considered taken in lieu of overtime. The days he was away were holidays as defined in s.30 of the LSA. 9)He did not establish he did 3 weeks holidays."
"The accused was charged with impaired driving and operating a motor vehicle while over.08 contrary to s. 255(1) and s. 253(a) of the Criminal Code and  having consumed alcohol in a concentration exceeding 80 milligrams in 100 millilitres (the blood alcohol content of the breath sample) contrary to ss.253(b) and 253(1). The accused was stopped by the RCMP at 1:40 a.m. and failed the roadside screening. The roadside screening was performed and the accused failed the test. The officer made a demand that the accused provide a breath sample, based on the smell of liquor coming from the accused. The accused did not comply and the officer read from his 'card' when making the demand. The card was found to be filled with the accused's telephone number, address and phone number. There was no mention of a lawyer at the detachment when the call was received. The defence argued that it was impossible to obtain comparable ampoules and there was no evidence that they were available. Dismissing the application, that the defence had an absolute right to production of the standard alcohol solution as requested by the Defence. The request for production was made in timely fashion, not for purposes of delay or with genuine desire to have the appropriate tests conducted. HELD: The application was dismissed. 1)It is in the nature of the Crown's case to require production of certain products to ensure compliance with the requirements set out in s. 249 of the Charter. It is only by having access to the accused that the Court can be assured an opportunity to make full answer and defence.  2)The accused's ability to operate a vehicle while under.08 was limited by the mere presence of a breathalyser. It was not an issue to determine until the Certificate of Analysis was filed and the pertinent evidence was heard. 3)The defence sought to attach a burden of proof to the offence of failing to produce a breathalyzer. The Court was not impressed with the defence's application and rejected it. There is no burden on the accused once the application has been made. It remains a burden to prove even if the accused had a reasonable and reasonable expectation of compliance. 4)There is no reason for the defence to demand production of these products once the entire evidence has been expunged. The demand for production must be considered in a context where the defence could reasonably expect to receive a sample at any time during the day and at night. 5)The Court found that the","The accused was charged with impaired driving (Criminal Code ss.255(1) and 253(a)) and with operating a motor vehicle while having a blood alcohol concentration exceeding .08 (Criminal Code ss.253(b) and 255(1)). Issues included whether the Court should enter a stay of proceedings and award costs, given the failure of the Crown to produce a standard alcohol solution (SAS); could mouth alcohol have invalidated the roadside screening test; did the arresting officer have reasonable and probable grounds to demand a breath sample; was the accused denied his right to counsel; was the breathalyzer test administered as soon as practicable; was there evidence to the contrary? HELD: The accused was found not guilty on count #2 (exceeding .08). Count #1 (impaired driving) was dismissed during the trial.  1)The court was cognizant of the burden of proof and had reviewed the decision of R. v. Lifchus concerning reasonable doubt. 2)The accused's testimony was rejected as not being credible. 3)The burden lies with the applicant on an application pursuant to ss.7 and 24(1) of the Charter in which the defence alleges the accused's right to make full answer and defence has been infringed. The question remained whether once the defence established it sought the SAS but it was not provided for whatever reason, had it discharged its burden or must it prove the failure to produce the SAS solution could have a meaningful outcome on the trial. 4)The accused's s.7 Charter right to make full answer and defence was infringed by the failure of the Crown to produce a sample of the SAS solution in this case. In light of the Bourget and Kalafut decisions, the Crown has had ample opportunity to establish a system for routinely saving the solution until after a case has been concluded. It would bring the administration of justice into disrepute were the Certificate of Analysis admitted into evidence. It was more appropriate to exclude the Certificate of Analysis than to grant a stay of proceedings.  5)Costs are rarely awarded in criminal proceedings. Given the evidence presented concerning the usefulness of testing a representative SAS ampule had it been produced, the court was not persuaded costs should be awarded. 6)There was no evidence that created a reasonable doubt as to the time that elapsed or that there may have been mouth alcohol which may have invalidated the roadside screening test. Both the subjective and objective tests were met. The arresting officer, who has no reason to believe an accused has consumed alcohol in the last 15 minutes, may administer the roadside screening test without delay, but to do so carries with it a certain risk that there may be subsequently evidence which will invalidate the results (affecting the objective element of the test). Further, the officer has no duty to routinely wait 15 minutes before administering the test nor to ask the accused whether or not alcohol has been consumed in the preceding 15 minutes. However, if there are circumstances which suggest the officer should have waited or inquired about alcohol consumption, this may affect the reasonableness of the officer's belief (the subjective test). 7)There was nothing in the evidence to support the submission that the speedometers need to be checked to support the officer's evidence. The officer was acting in the lawful execution of his duty in stopping the accused's vehicle. While doing so he detected an odour of alcohol on the accused's breath which gave rise to the demand for a roadside screening. 8)The informational component of the right to counsel was satisfied. There was no evidence the accused misunderstood his right nor that he was not given sufficient opportunity to contact counsel. He declined twice, giving a clear and unequivocal waiver. Absent special circumstance, the police cannot be expected to draw information out of the accused. 9)The samples were taken as soon as practicable. It was accepted that there was typically no one available at the detachment in the small community and was sufficient reason to not consider attending there given the proximity of the city. The officer tried the closest detachment but found no one there. It may have been more important to question the judgment of the officer to return to the Saskatoon detachment if the delay had been more significant. On the face of it, the delay of 27 minutes did not seem unreasonable. 10)The statutory presumption applied. There was no evidence to the contrary as the accused's evidence was rejected. The court reviewed R. v. Gibson and considered s.258(1)(c) and (d.1) of the Criminal Code."
"FIAT. The father applied to have the mother cited for contempt for denial of access. By fiat of October 4, 2002, Matheson J. transferred custody to the father and directed the mother to give viva voce evidence in response to the allegation of contempt. The specific grounds for the contempt were that the respondent deliberately denied access and intentionally refused to comply with the access provisions contained in paragraph 4(d) of the Judgment of the Honourable Mr. Justice J.R.O. Archambault granted on September 1, 2001 when she refused to turn the 11-year-old child over to his father. The mother was to complete the parent education program and file a certificate of completion within sixty days.

The father applied to have the mother cited for contempt for denial of access. Custody was transferred to the father by fiat October 4, 2002 and the mother was directed to give viva voce evidence. HELD: The application was dismissed. Discretion was exercised under Queen's Bench Act to direct the parents to complete the parent education program and file the certificate of completion within 60 days. Counsel were to explore the possibility of conducting exchanges through the supervised exchange program. Contempt must be proven beyond a reasonable doubt. Neither fine nor imprisonment should be ordered unless consistent with the best interests of the child.

"The father applied to vary the terms of the parties' 2001 Corollary Relief Judgment respecting parenting arrangements. The parties had entered into a Separation Agreement in 2000 which was incorporated into the Corollaries Relief Judgment in May 2001. The father had previously applied for sole custody of the children. He alleged the mother refused to implement his recommendations, resulting in the children suffering. The mother applied to have the children placed in the primary care and custody of their father. Application to vary custody ordered dismissed. The evidence disclosed that both parents were capable of caring for the children and that they were willing to put aside their personal hurt and anger so as to benefit these distressed children. However, the evidence did not support the assessment and recommendations made by the parties. Both parents were willing and able to work with the other to develop a more stable parenting regime. The only way to assist the children was by awarding primary care to one parent.","Pursuant to the Corollary Relief Judgment, the parents had been equally sharing the parenting time of their two children for four years. The father now applied for interim sole custody, alleging that the ongoing extreme conflict between the parties was adversely affecting the children. An assessment recommended that the children live with the father and have access with the mother. Father granted interim sole care, custody and control of the children. The serious concerns raised by the assessment satisfied the threshold requirement of a material change in circumstances; the urgency of the concerns required immediate action."
"HELD: The application was dismissed. The court found that even if the caveat was wrongfully removed by the Registrar of Land Titles and that the caveat be reinstated retroactively, it would defeat the fundamental principle of indefeasibility of title that has been continued in The Land Title Act, 2000. The respondents were entitled to costs. 1)Even if the caveats were wrongfully Removed by the Land Titling Registrar, the court ought not retroactively reinstate the caveat. To do so would defeat this fundamental principle, which has been the 'curtain principle' of the Torrens system. 2)It would simply not be appropriate to permit the applicants to attempt to access the assurance fund through the mechanism of a chambers application requesting declaratory relief. The process, if the applicants choose to pursue it, would be an action under Part XII of The Land Tittles Act,2000. 3)The principle of'indefeasible' of title was not materially altered by the passage of the 2000 Land Tittle Act. The principle was retained by the new legislation. The exception, reservations and interests that are implied pursuant to s. 18 to 20 of the Land Tiltles Act are registered against the title. The caveat automatically lapses at the expiration of 30 days from the mailing of the notice. Unless the caveator files a judge's order continuing the caveat, which could result in a retroactive reinstatement, the application is dismissed.","FIAT: A caveat registered to the applicant was removed as a result of the notice to lapse procedure. The caveat purported to be based upon a right to receive royalties from all gas, carbon and oil produced from the land. The applicant denied having ever received the notice to lapse. The applicant sought: 1) retroactive reinstatement of the caveat by order of the Court; and 2) an inquiry by the Court as to whether or not the caveat was removed improperly. The respondent companies that acquired an interest in the subject land subsequent to the caveat being removed opposed the application based, among other things, on the principle of indefeasibility of title, as did the Registrar of Land Titles. HELD: The application is dismissed with costs to the respondents. 1) Even if the caveat was removed improperly, the Court ought not to retroactively reinstate it, because to do so would defeat the fundamental principle of indefeasibility of title that has been continued in The Land Titles Act, 2000; and 2) it would not be appropriate to permit the applicants to attempt to access the assurance fund through the mechanism of a chambers application requesting declaratory relief.

"This was an application pursuant to s. 232(4)(c) of the Income Tax Act for the determination of whether the applicants had solicitor-client privilege in respect of 25 documents for which Revenue Canada had sought disclosure. The husband was granted privileged communications with and for the purposes of obtaining legal advice from the accountant. The wife and two adult sons were granted privileged access to the accountant for the purpose of requesting production of documents. The accountant's role in relation to the subsequent communication with the client was clearly as a representative of the client's legal advice, i.e. that he was providing legal advice to the client. HELD: The documents were privileged. 1) The accountant was acting as agent or representative for the client and not as a solicitor. 2) The lawyer's privilege extended to communications between the husband's accountant and the applicants' accountants. The parties were communicating in a confidential capacity on behalf of the applicant and on the instructions of the lawyer. 3) There was no litigation contemplated in this case.  4) The accounting firm's privileged communications were further extended to include documents prepared by the applicant's accountant as well as those prepared by its own members of the accounting firm. 5) The admission of privileged privilege by the accountant was a violation of the Act as it was privileged communications between an accountant and a client. The Act does not extend to such communications, except insofar as the privileged communications concerned concerned the accountant's involvement in the preparation of the documents for production.","An application pursuant to s232(4)(c) of the Income Tax Act for a determination of whether the applicants have solicitor-client privilege in respect of 25 documents for which Revenue Canada had sought disclosure. The applicants were husband and wife, their two sons and the companies in which they were principal shareholders and/or directors. The documents related to three separate occasions upon which the applicants sought the advice or assistance of a lawyer in relation to proposed transactions. The documents in issue were originally in the possession of their accounting firm. At issue was the extent to which solicitor-client privilege could be asserted in relation to communications with and documents prepared by third parties. HELD: 1)The privilege claimed in relation to all of the documents relating to the legal advice sought after January 1995 was upheld. 2)The claim was not upheld for copies of a letter setting out the proposal for the 1988 transaction. One letter appeared to be advice offered by the accountants to the applicants.  3)The applicants abandoned their claim for privilege with respect to handwritten notes summarizing share value and fair market value of assets which had been prepared by the accountants other than for the purpose of obtaining legal advice. The claim of privilege was abandoned for a declaration of gift and minutes of a director's meeting in 1991. 4)It has been clearly established in case law that even though a client may look to his/her accountant rather than a solicitor for advice in relation to the law of taxation, the applicants must show the documents were protected by solicitor-client privilege and not merely accountant-client privilege. 5)Although solicitor-client privilege is defined in s232(1)(e) of the ITA, the issue had to be resolved in light of the common law test for privilege. 6)Privilege may extend to accountant communications where the accountant is acting as agent or representative of the client for the purpose of seeking legal advice from a solicitor. Recent cases appear to diverge on the question of the circumstances necessary to found the requisite relationship of agency. 7)The accountants were clearly acting as agents for the applicants for the purpose of obtaining legal advice, as was found in Susan Hosiery. They were at all times acting in a confidential capacity on behalf of and on instructions of the applicants. 8)Solicitor-client privilege extended to items of accounting information obtained for the purpose of receiving legal advice. Notes prepared by the accountant and the interoffice communications summarizing discussions with the solicitor also fell within the scope of privilege."
"FIAT. The applicant commenced an application pursuant to s.19 of The Controverted Municipal Elections Act following the municipal election for mayor and counsellors. The Chambers judge granted the application within two weeks of the date of the fiat. HELD: Application dismissed. 1)The time limit for bringing this application was set at 6 weeks after the election. 2)The applicant hadmissed the limitation period for bringing the application. The application was brought within six weeks after an election. The fiat was granted forty-seven days later. That is beyond the time limit. 3)The court ruled that the time does not commence to run until that returning officer's recount is completed. Saskatchewan's legislation is similar. If the voting results in a tie, the returning officer directs a person to pull the name 'out of hat' from choice of candidates with an equal number of votes. This is provided by s.111 of the Local Government Election Act. The Local Government election Act states that the election is when the Returning Officer declared the results of a vote in accordance with s.109 of the Act. It is also the starting point for determining the limitation periods under the Controvert Municipal elections Act, but also the limitation time for seeking a judicial recount under 126 128 of the LGBE. The legislation is clear. The time limit does not exist until after the judicial recount is complete. Grostky J. completed his judicial recount in October of 1997 and a period of thirty-eight days had elapsed, which is within the time limits of s.18 of the legislation. The request for an application to bring this application must be brought 'within six weeks following an election."" Counsel for the respondents calculates the election to be October 22, 1997. The election was held some time after the fiat was issued. 4)The application was granted within 2 weeks. The court was not satisfied with the delay in bringing this matter. 5)Application dismissed. There was no jurisdiction to deal with the motion because the applicant had missed the limitation amount for bringing it. 6)The fiat was set aside and returned to the Chambers judge. The matter was remitted for further consideration.","The applicant commenced an application pursuant to s19 of the Controverted Municipal Elections Act following the municipal election for mayor and counsellors at the village of Sandy Bay.

"The accused entered a guilty plea to committing an assault causing bodily harm contrary to s. 267(b) of the Criminal Code. After the plea was entered, the Crown and the accused entered into a plea agreement that resolved all matters corollary to the s.267(b). The accused was sentenced to 18 months imprisonment, 18 months fine and one year probation respectively. The victim impact statement was published on behalf of the accused and was a first step towards rehabilitation. The accused minimized his responsibility for the assault in the pre-sentence report, and the court found that a fine plus a probation order with strict conditions could accomplish the objectives of sentencing.","The two accused entered a guilty plea to committing an assault causing bodily harm contrary to s. 267(b) of the Criminal Code. HELD: A fine plus a probation order with strict condition can accomplish the principles of sentencing. Each accused is fined $1,500 with a probation order for two years. Corrigendum received dated March 19, 2010 and added to fulltext."
"HELD: The accused was convicted of assault causing bodily harm contrary to s. 267(b) of the Criminal Code and of obstructing justice by dissuading or attempting to dissuade the complainant from testifying. He was sentenced to 10 years imprisonment. The court found that the accused had established a pattern of repetitive behaviour and that the Gladue factors must be considered in determining whether the accused should be declared a dangerous offender. The accused had been at large on his undertaking given to an officer in charge and was bound by an order that he would not communicate with the complainant, kicked her on the chest, head and face, and there was a reasonable possibility of eventual control of the risk in the community. The defence argued that the Crown was only required to prove the pattern of behaviour as defined by s. 753(a)(i) and that it was required to demonstrate either the behaviour described in R. v. Gladue (1999) or (ii) or the less restrictive sanction under the provisions of the 753.1 of the Code, which dealt with the threat of death or injury to other persons, and that if the Crown failed to prove that J.R.S. even qualifies as a long-term offender, the court imposed a sentence of 10 years.","The accused was convicted of common assault, break and enter and commit assault and assault causing bodily harm and his former common law spouse was the complainant in each instance. The accused also entered guilty pleas to three charges stemming from breaches of no-contact conditions with the same complainant plus two charges of obstruction of justice by attempting to dissuade the same complainant from giving evidence. The RCMP had to execute a Feeney warrant to locate the complainant in the accused basement. The Crown sought an order declaring the accused a dangerous offender. HELD: The accused was designated a dangerous offender and was sentenced to imprisonment in a penitentiary for an indeterminate period on the conviction pursuant to s. 267(b) of the Criminal Code and received time served on the remaining eight charges. The evidence is conclusive that the offence for which the accused was convicted was a serious personal injury offence. The evidence was conclusive that the accused constitutes a threat to other persons because of his pattern of repetitive behaviour and persistent aggressive behaviour. The accused's First Nation would provide support for the accused but its support system is presently non-existent. The Court rejected the expert opinions recommending a long term offender order as being appropriate."
"The accused was charged with driving faster than 60 kilometres per hour when passing highway workers or occupied highway equipment within a work zone. The accused was not charged as the driver of the vehicle but as its registered owner. Section 273 of The Traffic Safety Act makes the registered owner liable for the driver's misconduct when the vehicle is driven by anyone who has the owner's actual or implied consent to do so. Legislation amendments allow the Crown to prosecute contravention of s. 203(1) of the Act without calling any witnesses (The Traffic Safety Board conducted a Summary Offence Notice, the photograph, the SGI Motor Vehicle Division certified search and the RCMP certified search) but the accused did not appear to be the only witness for the defence. He testified that on September 5, 2013, he was driving and that he did not speed past any highway worker or highway equipment in the work zone, nor did he say that there were highway warning lights in operation, whether it is in motion or not, or that he recorded the vehicle's speed immediately after it passed the workers or equipment, or if he was passing highway equipment when the speed monitoring device recorded its speed.","Criminal Law – Strict LiabilityStatutes – Interpretation – Traffic Safety Act, Section 203(1)Traffic Safety Act – Motor Vehicle Offences – Passing Highway Workers or Equipment The accused was charged with an offence contrary to s. 203(1) of The Traffic Safety Act, driving over 60 km/h passing highway workers or occupied highway equipment within a work zone. The accused was charged as the owner of the vehicle, not necessarily the driver. The offence was the result of a speed monitoring camera and the Act allows the Crown to complete their case without calling any witnesses. The accused testified that he did not speed past any highway workers or equipment. He said that he was following a pilot vehicle when he passed the workers and equipment and only sped up after the pilot vehicle turned around when there were no more workers or equipment. The picture of the accused’s vehicle from the speed monitoring camera did not show any highway workers or equipment. HELD: The person who tested and deployed the speed monitoring camera provided affidavit evidence that the picture was taken within a marked construction area but it did not say that the accused was speeding as he was passing highway workers or occupied highway equipment. Section 203(1) specifies that there is only an offence for travelling at a speed greater than 60 km/h when passing highway workers or operating equipment. The accused was found not guilty."
"HELD: The plaintiff was awarded $419,964.69 plus interest as claimed in the Saskatchewan Provincial Sales Tax. The defendant cementing and reservoir stimulation service contractors paid $393,289.73 (the PST) on well cementing contracts it had with the third parties. The Government of Saskatchewan, pursuant to s.50(2) of The Revenue and Financial Services Act, is entitled to payment of PST from the third party contractors in undetermined amounts on the materials supplied to the plaintiff. The plaintiff claims that the Saskatchewan Government's claim against the plaintiff for refund of the PST is barred by s.55(4) of the Revenue and Finance Act and s.56 of the Pension and Health Tax Act. The claims against the defendant are without merit because the plaintiff was the final user and consumer of the materials provided pursuant to the contracts between the defendant contractors and Husky. The third party contractor denies the allegations contained in the plaintiff's Statement of Claim, that it is one of the cementing service contractors referred to in general terms and in more particular terms in the Defendant's Reply to the Demand for Particulars dated May 9, 2003 and the Minister's statement of defence dated September 9, 2002. HELD: Even if the Government was entitled to refund of PST the plaintiff is not liable under the Act to pay it, the parties properly levied and collected tax from the plaintiff on the sale of the tangible property. 1)Even if Husky was not liable to pay the PST, the 3rd party contractors responsible for the provision of cement and fracturing fluid to Husky were responsible to collect and remit the PST for the purposes of the legislation. 2)The plaintiff was not entitled to refunds of the sales tax it paid to the defendant during the claim period. 3)The defendants were not responsible to pay PST on materials they consumed in performance of their contracts with Husky but were liable to remit it to the Government for refund. 4)Sanjel, Trican and BJ Services did not raise three defences. Sanjel admitted the allegations of fact contained in paragraph 5 and that other documents outside the contracts set out additional terms and/or set out the intentions of the plaintiff and the Contractors in entering into the contracts. As such, their claims against them were without merit. 5)The court found that the claim against Husky is statute-barred.","Tax Law – Contract for Services – Payment of PST The plaintiff has the onus of proving it is not liable for the payment of PST on a balance of probabilities. Parties are entitled to structure their legal relationships as they see fit. The Court must determine whether the tax is payable based on the agreements as constructed between Husky and the third parties. There was no evidence that Saskatchewan Finance and the third party contractors entered into an agreement to alter the nature of the contracts so that Husky paid PST when it would not otherwise have been obligated to pay. The evidence established that Husky determined the way in which bids were submitted and the way Husky was invoiced. In each contract, Husky required that the bid include a price for service and price for materials. In each case, it was contemplated that PST was in addition to the price bid for the materials provided. The contracts between Husky and the third parties all contain provisions and terms that provide for the sale of materials to Husky. On the basis of the contracts, there was a sale of tangible property under the PST Act. Husky was the user or consumer of the cement. The third parties were providing materials and services to assist in the construction of the oil well. Husky has failed to establish that the contracts were supply and install contracts. Husky was the ultimate user and consumer of the tangible personal property. Husky is not entitled to rely on mistake of law. Husky has failed to establish on a balance of probabilities that it is entitled to a refund of the PST it paid on well cementing contracts between itself and third parties. The claim is dismissed."
"This was an action to determine the quantum of general damages as a result of a motor vehicle accident which occurred between the plaintiff and the defendant. The plaintiff suffered myofascial or chronic pain, mainly relating to his left hip. The pain was mild to moderate to moderate, and he did not experience any personal injuries. The court awarded general damages in the amount of $25,000.00. The award of interest was based upon an award for chronic pain syndrome as suffered by the plaintiff as of this date and not four and a half years ago.","The plaintiff claimed damages for injuries suffered as a result of his car being hit from behind. He had continued pain in the neck, shoulder, back and hip four and one half years after the accident. Throughout this period, the plaintiff missed only three days and then three weeks of work. The medical evidence conflicted as to whether the injuries were the cause of the continued pain. Awarding $25,000 valued at date of judgment with an adjusted interest rate. The court found the injury was mild and not the cause of the continued pain. The plaintiff was found to have chronic pain syndrome."
"Appeal from Queen's Bench issue of leave to appeal a decision of the landlord's rentalsman with respect to the abatement of a rental. The issues in this case began long before the notice of termination of tenancy (which ultimately prompted this Court's involvement) and stem from a number of complaints made by both the tenants and the landlord. The landlord began leasing his premises to the tenants in August 1994. The deputy rentalsman then directed the landlord to remove a stove, replace a refrigerator and make appropriate repairs to floor tiles, fence and gate. The Deputy rentalsman made two contradictory statements. The first statement said the landlord was justified in serving the notice to terminate; the second statement said that the differences between the landlord and tenant did not arisesolely from the tenants' reasonable complaints. The Court's function was limited to determining whether the rentalsman had the power to abate rent under s. 47(4) and whether this Court could also rely on that aspect of the therentalsman's decisions which reflect an exercise ofretion.","The landlord applied for possession of residential premises after his tenants refused to vacate in response to a written notice to vacate. The deputy rentalsman ordered that the landlord should have possession, but also ordered that the last two months rent would abate in order to assist the tenants with their moving costs. The landlord appealed the abatement of rent and a chambers judge reversed the deputy rentalsman. The tenants sought and were granted leave to appeal the chambers judge and this appeal resulted. HELD: Appeal allowed. 1)The chambers judge could only reverse the deputy rentalsman if he exceeded his jurisdiction or erred in law. 2)The deputy rentalsman had jurisdiction to order an abatement of rent pursuant to S.47(4) of the Act. 3)The jurisdiction is a discretionary one. The court will therefore show some deference to a decision of the rentalsman involving this jurisdiction. In this case the deputy rentalsman made no reversible error."
"The accused, a 23 year old aboriginal, pled guilty to two counts of robbery with threats of violence contrary to s.348(1)(b) and 334(2) of the Criminal Code: he was sentenced to 9 months time served, plus 2 years less 1 day conditional, including 3 months on electronic monitoring, plus two years probation with a ten year firearms prohibition on each charge to be served concurrently. The Crown sought leave appeal the sentence imposed on the respondent after a sentencing circle. HELD: The appeal was allowed. The sentence imposed was set aside and a sentence of four years imprisonment from this date on each count concurrently was granted. 1)The sentencing circle was inappropriate in these circumstances given the level of violence, the respondent's high risk to reoffend, his consistent ignoring of or refusing to follow court orders and the fact a penitentiary term was called for. 2)The accused was 23 years old aboriginal who had a prior record consisting of 42 criminal convictions including eight violent or weapons related offences. He has violated various forms of community release orders including bail and probation orders some 16 times. He had grade 3 education and does not have significant employment history. In pre-sentence report he was considered high at risk to offend. The accused was on drugs at the time of the offences and the main player was the co-accused.","The Crown sought leave to appeal a conditional sentence of 9 months of time served plus 2 years less 1 day, including 3 months on electronic monitoring, and 2 years probation with a 10 year firearm prohibition on each charge to be served concurrently. The sentence was imposed for robbery with threats of violence contrary to s.348(1)(b) and s.334(2) of the Criminal Code which were committed in March 2000 while the accused was on probation. The appellant and co-accused were convicted of breaking and entering a private residence. The accused took $25 from the premises and held the 68 year old victim while the co-accused went to look for a knife after threatening to cut off his fingers. The following day the two accused used threats of violence while robbing a pharmacy and a witness testified the accused yelled to the co-accused to kill the victims. The co-accused who was convicted of assault received 7 years in prison for the robbery concurrent with 5 years for the B &amp; E. The 23 year old aboriginal who had a Grade 3 education had a prior record of 42 criminal convictions including eight violent or weapons related offences. HELD: Leave was granted. The appeal was allowed. The sentence of 4 years in prison on each charge to be served concurrently took into account time served on remand and electronic monitoring. The sentence was demonstrably unfit and fell outside the range of sentences previously imposed. The sentencing judge relied solely on the principle of rehabilitation, essentially ignoring the other sentencing principles including the level of gravity, the principle of deterrence, the need to denounce such acts, the sentence imposed on the co-accused, and the need to protect the public. A sentencing circle was inappropriate given the level of violence, his risk to re-offend, his consistent ignoring or refusal to follow court orders, and the fact that a penitentiary term was called for in such circumstances. He had violated various forms of community release orders including bail and probation 16 times. He had a history of drug and alcohol abuse and had not attended treatment."
"The appellants appealed the decision of the Queen's Bench judge who found, as a matter of fact, that the bank deposits and the proceeds of the RRIF did not pass under the will but were given to the appellant for the benefit of his relatives and, in fact, to be given to his sisters. The residuary beneficiaries brought an action against the appellant claiming that the funds were a part of the residue of the estate and sought a judgment to that effect as well as a judgment for the appellant's relatives and great-grandchildren. The appellant sought relief under s. 57 of The Trustee Act for the same purpose. HELD: Appeal dismissed. 1) The trial judge did not err in law in failing to consider the effect of s. 75 of The Queen’s Bench Act, which gives the court discretion to relieve trustees of liability in whole or in part, for technical breaches of trust where a trustee acted honestly, reasonably, and where it is fair to excuse the breach of trust. The circumstances did not justify, on any equitable basis, compelling the innocent respondents to bear the loss to them occasioned by the trustee's imprudence.  2) The appellant knew from the outset that the respondents disagreed with the position taken by him and intended to take proceedings against him. The disagreements were such that they could not even agree upon the funeral of the grandmother. 3) The evidence of the beneficiary (the appellant, in his factum) was conflicting. There was conflicting evidence about whether or not the appellant intended to give the funds to the granddaughters. The evidence as to the intended beneficiaries (the RRIF beneficiaries) was that they were joint names just in case something happened to them.  4) The standard of review in respect of such an issue is palpable and overriding error. The judge made no such error.","The deceased made a Will appointing her only son, the appellant, as executor. In her Will, she left her home to her son, and divided the rest and residue between her two daughters, the respondents. The deceased transferred title to her house to the names of herself and the appellant jointly. She also transferred some bank deposits totalling approximately $57,000 into the joint names of herself and the appellant and designated him as the person entitled to receive payments under a RRIF totalling approximately $29,000. After her death, the appellant took the position that the bank deposits and the proceeds of the RRIF did not pass under the Will but were given to him for the benefit of the deceased's grandchildren and himself. He paid out about $45,000 to the grandchildren and himself, but nothing to his sisters, the residuary beneficiaries under the Will. The sisters brought action against him, claiming the funds were part of the residue of the estate and obtained a judgment to that effect against him. He appeals against that judgment. HELD: Appeal dismissed with costs.  1) Section 75 of The Queen's Bench Act does not apply to this case. 2) The trial judge carefully reviewed the evidence and the law respecting the presumption of advancement and the presumption of resulting trust. The judge did not mention the possibility of and express trust in favour of the grandchildren. She must have considered whether an express trust existed because that was exactly what the appellant's evidence suggested and exactly what the trial judge rejected in her findings of fact. Since the funds in question were not given to the appellant as a gift, and were not given to him in trust for the grandchildren, they must of necessity revert to the estate. In the case of the bank deposits, the funds would revert to the estate on the basis of a resulting trust. In the case of the RRIF, the funds would revert to the estate on a different basis. Since there was no gift to the appellant, and no trust in favour of the grandchildren, the monies must revert to the estate. 3) While the appellant characterized this issue as being one of mixed law and fact, it was essentially one of fact alone, the issue was what the deceased intended when she transferred the bank deposits and designated the payee of the RRIF. The standard of review in respect of such an issue is palpable and overriding error. The judge made no such error.  4) The appellant asked for relief pursuant to s. 57 of The Trustee Act in respect of the money paid by him to the grandchildren. The appellant says he paid the monies to the grandchildren in the honest belief that he was carrying out the wishes of the deceased. The appellant knew from the outset that his sisters disagreed with his position and intended to take proceedings against him. The appellant's actions in distributing the funds without at least getting directions from the Court were imprudent for a trustee. The circumstances do not justify, on any equitable basis, compelling the innocent respondents to bear the loss to them occasioned by the trustee's imprudence"
"Fulltext of judgment follows: [1] It will not be necessary for us to hear from the respondent. The appellant has failed to persuade us that Mr. Justice Koch erred in any material respect. In other words, we see no tenable basis for interfering with his decision. [2] The debtor clearly committed an act of bankruptcy under ss.42(1)(e) of the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act as result of the sheriff's return of nulla bona to the respondent's writ of execution against the debtor. That left Justice Koch to consider whether to dismiss the petition pursuant to s.43(7) or to stay proceedings pursuant to ss. 43(11). HELD: Appeal dismissed orally. 1) The Court cannot say that the appellant erred. The Act contains a discretionary power to remain proceedings. That serves to narrow the basis for intervention on appeal. [3] Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed, with costs on appeal to the respondents to be taxed in the usual way. [4] As for the first issue, the debtor did not satisfy Justice Koch that he was able to pay his debts or that there existed other sufficient cause to dismiss. Based on the evidence adduced by the debtor, there is no basis to conclude that the Court should have been satisfied of these matters.","Fulltext of judgment follows:[1] It will not be necessary for us to hear from the respondent.

"The respondent asked to be discharged from bankruptcy. She argued that the horses were her personal property and that they should be kept in compensation for expenses incurred while she was in bankruptcy. HELD: The respondent was entitled to an absolute discharge. She paid surplus income of $325 per month for the basic bankruptcy period and another $300 for horses. She also requested bank statements for 12 months prior to bankruptcy. 1)It is well established law that any cause of action arising from bodily injury, mental suffering, or injury to reputation or the proceeds thereof is personal and does not vest in the trustee. 2)The respondent first bought the horses as pets for her children. They became part of her household in 2003 when she suffered from Post Traumatic Stress Disorder, Major Depression Disorder, and Borderline Personality Organization. These illnesses entitle her to a pension from the Department of Veterans Affairs. 3)She had little time to make arrangements. She had to act quickly under very stressful circumstances. She was required to deal with immediately finding a new home for her family. 4)There were a number of issues that should have been addressed in the discharge order. The respondent's evidence at the hearing was that she did not provide the Trustee with the VIN number on the 2007 Cobalt vehicle and with the information required to complete the income tax returns. The Trustee was not asked to determine the value of the three horses. The applicant indicated that the horse trailer was valued at $400 and that she paid $500 for rent. 5)There was no evidence before the court as to how much surplus income the respondent should have in common with the horses. It was important that the respondent be able to stabilize her family finances as soon as possible because there was no longer any equity in the home which would justify her paying a lesser amount for the horses than she should have paid for them.","The Trustee opposed the bankrupt's application for a discharge on various grounds. The bankrupt supported four children and had been discharged from the military due to illness arising from her active service. The bankrupt will be entitled to an absolute discharge once certain conditions are met, including the payment of one month's rent, the value of the horses and surplus income for nine months to the Trustee. The bankrupt's disability pension from Veterans' Affairs was not included in the calculation of surplus income as the public policy reason behind the exemption for proceeds received due to personal injury and a soldier's danger pay applied to this disability pension. The Trustee had no claim to the insurance proceeds received by the bankrupt following the loss of her home by fire as it was a modest sum used to replace lost personal exempt assets; the three horses were found to be owned by the bankrupt as opposed to her children, for whom she had purchased them as pets and were included in the value of her estate; the court exercised its discretion in determining the amount of surplus income, noting that the administration of the estate had been unusually hostile and it was important that the bankrupt be able to stabilize her family finances."
"The plaintiff union represents approximately 11,000 health care workers employed by the four defendant regional health authorities. The current collective bargaining agreement (CBA) covers the period April 1, 2008 to March 31, 2012. The formal CBA was not signed until October 2010. The plaintiffs seek a mandatory interlocutory injunction requiring the defendants to make the retroactive adjustment payments before the end of this year. They also seek an order requiring the parties to proceed with expedited arbitration. HELD: The motions to strike are dismissed. It is not appropriate for the court to grant an injunction requiring defendants tomake the required retroactive assessment payments before January 2011. Neither do I see any reasonable prospect of a solution to the problem by making payments on a 'best approximation of entitlement'. That is not a viable solution. In the long run the results of such a solution are likely to be troublesome and chaotic. The court is without jurisdiction to determine the issue pleaded based on the CBA and the Weber principle.  1)It is of concern that the court was not adequately framed in the pleadings and in the evidence before it to meet the applicable test. 2)The court has not been able to assess the degree to which mandatory chronological relief will be beyond the defendants' ability to comply with and fulfil. There may well be irreparable harm to individual employees who may incur costs. In general terms the losses which, individual employees may incur should easily be covered by damages. In practical terms the imposition of a deadline less than 2 weeks from now cannot conceivably be met. The essential character of the issue raised concerns the terms and conditions of employment which in accordance with the CEA were beyond the jurisdiction of the court. The terms and condition of employment in accordancewith the CAA are beyond the court's jurisdiction. 3)The plaintiffs concede that the Court is without the jurisdiction to decide the issue. They contend that the statement of claim, while it does not assert a viable cause of action, can nevertheless serve as a platform to the present application for interlocutorutory relief. 4)The claim now before the court is not necessarily nullity. Although it can otherwise appropriately be struck pursuant to Rules 99 and 173 it can nevertheless subsist if only to provide a platform of pleading to support an application for Interlocutory relief.(","Employees were entitled to wage adjustments under the collective bargaining agreement. The plaintiff union brought an application for an interlocutory injunction requiring the defendant to pay employees who were retiring in 2010 their wage adjustments in the current calendar year. This was an issue because it would affect pensions and retirement dates. In the alternative, the union argued the employer should pay the entitlements before the year end on a 'best approximation' basis or be required to proceed to an expedited arbitration. The defendant brought a motion to strike or dismiss the plaintiff's motion under Queen's Bench Rules 99 and 173 on the basis that the issues raised were terms and conditions of the employment contract and outside the jurisdiction of the Court according to the terms of the collective bargaining agreement. HELD: The defendant's application was dismissed because the Court has residual discretionary jurisdiction to grant relief not available under a statutory arbitration scheme. The plaintiff's application for an injunction was also dismissed. While there may be a serious issue to be tried, the pleadings do not set forth a strong prima facie case. While there might be some irreparable harm to some employees, in general terms the losses can be dealt with through damages. It would be impossible for the defendant to meet a deadline two weeks away because of the complexity of the calculations. It is not appropriate to grant an injunction requiring the defendant to make payment before the end of 2010 and it is not reasonable to make payments based on best approximation. The Court has no jurisdiction to force arbitration on the parties."
"HELD: The accused was found not guilty on both charges. The court excluded evidence of what followed pursuant to s. 24(2) of the Charter. The defence objected to the exclusion of the evidence of whether the police had sufficient information to detain the accused. The primary defence was that the police officer who detained the accused did not inform him of the reason for his detention and did not advise him that he could consult counsel. The exclusion of evidence of the fob and keys further weakens the circumstantial case against the accused to the extent that the Crown has failed to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused was the operator of the motor vehicle. As the defence argued, the breaches were numerous and point to ignorance on the part of the police as to the distinction between their powers upon arrest and investigative detention.","The accused's neighbour disliked the accused and alleged that the accused drove his vehicle into hers. The police arrested the accused and found a fob that operated the locks on the doors of the vehicle and the engine hood of the accused's vehicle was warm. The accused was charged with hit and run and impaired driving. HELD: The Court found the accused not guilty of both charges. The Court found that the police breaches of the accused's Charter rights were numerous. The approximate 11 minutes of investigative detention was not an infringement of his rights but the combination of the officers' failing to inform the accused of the reason for his arrest and not giving his rights to counsel without delay, coupled with the illegal search and seizure of the fob and keys were in total breaches serious enough to bring the administration of justice into disrepute. The Court excluded the evidence of the fob and keys which further weakened the circumstantial case against the accused to the extent that the Crown failed to prove the accused was the operator of the motor vehicle."
"HELD: The application was dismissed. Based on the wording of the Act and the context of the relevant provisions, the Board's interpretation that the Board cannot rely on a blanket prohibition to deny reimbursement for medical marijuana is reasonable. Even if Policy Statement is ultra vires, it does not decide this matter. The Board's decision to deny reimbursements was within the range of possible, acceptable outcomes. 1) The Board found that it had the power to create POL 10/2011 as an exercise of the exclusive jurisdiction granted to it under s. 22(1) of The Act. There was no evidence before the Board that it based its decision on the basis that medical marijuana was not proven, necessary or required. On the face of its reasons, the board denied reimbursement specifically because medical marihuana is potentially unsafe and unproven. The respondent argues that the board's decision was based on medical research and is of no improper purpose. 2) There is no evidence the Board erred in determining medical marijuana should not be reimbursed. It is reasonable that the benefits and safety of medical marijuana have not been established to the point that it is necessary or 'necessary' under the Act. A determination that the medical aid is not necessary or necessary is not unreasonable but this is not the case here. 3) The applicant took the position the Board denied reimbursement for medication that had worked for him for 10 years and that had been recommended by an expert doctor. The use of the word'shall' in s. 106(1)(a) requires the Board to provide medical aid to injured employees. In the end result, the application is dismissed.","HELD: The application was dismissed. With respect to the issues, the Court found: 1) that the board had not relied upon the clause in the Policy Statement but on the evidence before it. It was not necessary to decide then whether the Policy Statement was ultra vires; 2) that the board’s interpretation that the Act granted discretion to the board to refuse to reimburse a specific medical treatment was reasonable; 3) that the board’s conclusion was reasonable. The scientific studies did not definitively stated that medical marijuana was effective. In some situations where a patient’s only recourse would to be to use a non-clinically approved drug whose safety and efficacy was still questioned, a determination that the medical aid was not necessary or required might be unreasonable, but not in this case where the applicant declined to try Sativex; and 4) that there was no evidence that the board based its decision on irrelevant considerations such as the potential political ramifications of paying for medical marijuana."
"The parties disagreed on the standard of review to be applied to the arbitrator's interpretation of s. 51 of the Act. The University's position was that the president's personal recommendation to the Board was not required, and the Board's power to follow the president’s recommendation did not fall within the scope of the Agreement. The Arbitrator exceeded his jurisdiction, made an unreasonable decision, or committed an otherwise reviewable error of law by misinterpreting sections of the University Act and in particular s. 52. 2. The interpretation of the s.51 by the arbitrators was not correctness or reasonableness. Both parties relied on the Rucker decision, which held that the President’d recommendation to appoint a probationary assistant professor was not mandatory, and that the Board had not been obliged to follow their president”s recommendation. HELD: The dispute was decided on the basis of Rucker’ s. 45 decision and the interpretation of ss. 51 and 51. 2 of the Saskatchewan Act.  1) The Act hardly uses the term tenure at all and not directly in this context. The existence of s.(3)(b) makes it more difficult to conclude the President's authority should be personal and unfettered, and in my view more reasonable to conclude that it is power to be exercised within parameters set by the Board, which includes collective bargaining. 2) The Arbitrators found after reviewing The University of Saskatchewan Act, 1995, S. 6.1 (the Act) and the Tenure Appeals Committee decision as if the same had been transmitted to them by the president in accordance with the terms of the agreement. The results of the arbitration were appealed. 3) The parties agreed to a lengthy statement of facts and the admissibility of number of documents.","HELD: The application was dismissed. The court held that the standard of review of the arbitrator’s decision was one of reasonableness. Section 25 of The Trade Union Act states that the conclusions of arbitrators are final and therefore the court noted they should not be interfered with lightly. Further, the court noted that the decision of the arbitrator was not of significant importance to the general public. The court reviewed the history of collective bargaining at the university and found that tenure was not dependent on the president’s personal recommendation in the past. The court found that the arbitrator’s reasoning was transparent and intelligible throughout. To include the word tenure in the definition of appointment or promotion was not the only conclusion that could be drawn. The arbitrator’s decision was within the range of acceptable conclusions and was reasonable."
"HELD: The application was allowed in part and the balance of probabilities were considered. The court found that the accused had reasonable doubt as to the reliability of the Internet search history, was in a position of trust and authority toward a person aged 16 years for a sexual purpose, touch directly or indirectly with a part of the body, any part of that body of a person under the age of 18, and that his s. 8 Charter rights had been violated as a result of the search. There was no dispute that the Crown could adduce evidence to establish the recency of a search warrant based on what the accused testified. The evidence seized was not disclosed at the hearing nor was it included in the ITO. The accused argued that it was the same ITO used by the Crown and that it could be used to amplify the information in the Internet and other files. He also argued that the search warrant was not a 'warranted search warrant' because the information was known to the police at the time it was obtained. HELD: 1)The accused was granted relief pursuant to s. 24(2) of the Charter to exclude evidence seized through the execution of a warrant.  2)His application for relief was allowed by agreement of counsel at pre-trial conference and was to await the determination of the issues.  3)There was no breach of the accused's Charter rights by the admission of the evidence seized. It was reasonable and fact-based evidence which was adduced at the amplification hearing was not admissible in respect of the s.8 Charter right. The limited scope of amplification evidence was limited to correcting minor or technical errors in the drafting of the affidavit material or to include erroneous information in an ITO, rather than deliberate attempts to mislead the authorizing justice. 4)The court found it necessary to include evidence from the ITOs in order to establish prima facie exclusion. The exclusion of evidence from a search conducted pursuant to a warrant would violate the accused’s s. 7 Charter right to be free from unreasonable search and seizure.","The accused was charged with the commission of sexual assault, sexual touching in relation to a 16-year-old and possession of child pornography. The accused came to police attention via a report by the complainant. She reported that the accused was often viewing a pornographic website while in her presence. The police prepared an information to obtain a search warrant (ITO). The ITO stated that the search would provide evidence of the accused’s viewing of pornography in the presence of the complainant, bolstering the complainant’s credibility. The ITO did not reference possession of child pornography. The ITO sought only a search of the “search history on the computer”. The issued warrant authorized a search of the accused’s computer and related devices and media, as well as documents pertaining to occupancy of the home and control of computer equipment. The complainant subsequently alleged that the accused had taken photos of her in the shower. The police did not amend the ITO to include a search for photos. The police executed the search and seized, inter alia, a laptop, an iPhone and CDs. The police delivered the material to a computer forensic specialist at the RCMP and requested a complete forensic search of the computer and phone to obtain a general search of the Internet history, pictures of the complainant and messages between the complainant and the accused. The police knew that the search of pictures was not included on the search warrant. The RCMP did not review the terms of the warrant prior to completing the examination and examined the entire contents of the laptop and phone. The accused submitted that his s. 8 Charter rights had been violated by the search and applied for exclusion of evidence pursuant to s. 24(2). The application proceeded by voir dire. The evidence was apparently located on either the accused’s laptop or cell phone, but the nature of the evidence obtained was not disclosed at the voir dire. The following issues were raised: 1) What is the correct procedure to be used to challenge evidence seized pursuant to a search warrant; 2) Was the Crown able to call amplification evidence and have it considered in support of the search and seizure conducted; 3) Did the ITO set forth reasonable and probable grounds that the items sought were evidence with respect to the commission of an offence; 4) Did the ITO use boiler plate clauses; 5) Did the ITO establish reasonable and probable grounds that the items were likely to be found in the place to be searched; and 6) What was the extent of a search of a computer or computer device. | HELD: Evidence of the accused’s search history was validly obtained. Other evidence was beyond the scope of the search warrant and obtained by violation of the accused’s s. 8 rights. The court held: 1) There is a two-step inquiry to be made when real evidence is seized during a search. The first step is an inquiry into constitutionality, and the second is reached only after a constitutional infringement has been established. Both inquiries impose an onus on the person claiming infringement. The standard of proof is the balance of probabilities. Challenges to constitutionality of warranted searches may involve either or both a facial and a sub-facial attack on the authorizing warrant. The record examined on facial review is fixed: it is the ITO, not an amplified or enlarged record;  2) In attempting to enter evidence of the complainant’s allegation that the accused took pictures of her in the shower, the Crown relied on an argument that the ends justified the means. This amplification evidence sought to allege a whole new offence and area of search. It was not admitted; 3) The point of this voir dire was not to determine admissibility of evidence outside of the search warrant context. There was no requirement that evidence sought in support of allegations made be directly connected to a complainant or the actual subject matter of a complainant; 4) The ITO did not use impermissible boiler plate clauses when read in its entirety. However, it did not set forth reasonable and probable grounds that text messages were evidence with respect to the commission of an offence; 5) The ITO provided sufficient description. It was reasonable to infer that search history meant search history of the accused with respect to the websites defined in the ITO. Further argument was required on whether text messages could be included; and  6) Police are not entitled to rummage through entire contents of a device searching for other evidence. The ITO sought only the search history."
"The applicant developer, Armoyan, made an application to the municipality of Halifax for implementation of proceedings under the Ditches and Water Courses Act. Meetings failed to achieve agreement. Armoyano, as a subdividing developer, filed a requisition with the clerk of the county pursuant to s.7(1) of the Act. HELD: The applicant's application was dismissed. The scope of appeal was set forth in s.12. The applicant was entitled to have its costs paid by Armoyans.  1)The applicant failed to meet the specific requirements set out in the Act by failing to comply with them.  2)The Act provides a method of apportioning the cost of the ditch or drain amongst the owners and prescribing the means by which will be determined the necessary technical details of the drainage. The proper outlet is for the water to flow through the land. 3)The respondent was not entitled to refuse to pay the engineer's fees.  4)The court found that Armoynan, as sub-divident, was entitled, pursuant to ss.9 and s.10, to have the drainage rights of the adjacent property owners extinguished.","The respondent had undertaken the residential development of certain lands bordering the appellant's property and constructed roadways which it proposed to convey to the Department of Transportation, who agreed to accept with the consent of owners of property where water would drain from the road. When the appellant refused to consent, the respondent applied to the municipality for proceedings under the Ditches and Water Courses Act, which failed to achieve agreement. The respondent then filed a requisition with the county clerk pursuant to s. 7(1) of the Act which allows for the appointment of a municipal engineer. The engineer filed a report in which he concluded the respondent was entitled to open a ditch on the appellant's land, subject to certain conditions. In this action, the appellant appealed pursuant to s. 12 of the Act. Allowing the appeal, that the Act appears to assume that landowners will agree that a ditch benefits their land and provides a mechanism for apportioning cost. However, it does not give an engineer authority to expropriate land or take any interest in it, nor does it provide a means by which the appellant is forced to accept the ditch. Further, the common law prohibits the use of another's property to solve one's drainage problems."
"This was an appeal by a young offender from convictions on three counts of distributing infringing copies of computer software contrary to s. 42(1)(c) of the Copyright Act. For the purposes of the Act, 'literary work' includes tables, compilations, translations and computer programs; 'telecommunication' means any transmission of signs, signals, writing, images or sounds or intelligence of any nature by wire, radio, visual, optical or other electromagnetic system; and 'electronic' means anything that, by this Act, only the owner of the copyright has the right to do. The appellant contended the Crown did not prove that the appellant distributed the copyrighted material, that he had the requisite knowledge, or that the distribution was to an extent that it prejudicially affected the owners of the copyrights. Dismissing the appeal, that the learned trial judge did not err in concluding the Crown had proved its case beyond a reasonable doubt.","The appellant appealed his conviction of distributing infringing copies of three computer programs. He argued that the Crown did not prove that he had distributed the copyrighted material, or that the distribution was to an extent that it prejudicially affected the owners of the copyrights. Dismissing the appeal, that by placing the copyrighted computer pro-grams on his computer bulletin board in a compressed format, for ease of transmission, and allowing access by modem to the programs, the appellant was distributing the programs to the prejudice of the owner's copyright."
"The accused was charged with operating a motor vehicle while impaired, contrary to s. 253(a) and 253(b) of the Criminal Code, and with driving while over.08 contrary, s.253(c) and s.255(b). HELD: 1) In the absence of the Certificate of Analysis, the evidence is not sufficient to prove the offence under s.254(a), or to be secure against unreasonable search or seizure, and not to be arbitrarily detained in regard to the issue of reasonable and probable grounds for the demand.  2) The officer observed the accused's vehicle sit through the green lights, but thereafter, he responded immediately and awoke when he took hold of his wrist. However, he also conceded that his speech was slurred. Therefore, one must consider the evidence of a strong smell of alcohol, and eyes which were somewhat glassy or bloodshot. In the context of Stellato, the nature and quality of this evidence of impairment is so frail as to leave the officer with a reasonable doubt as to impairment. Therefore the accused is not guilty of the charge under s253(a). 3) In all criminal cases, the trial judge must be satisfied that the accused was immediately awakened when the officer grabbed him by the wrist. As well, he appeared to fully comprehend the circumstances in which he was involved. The Court must consider, in the circumstances of this case, the presence of bloodshot eyes accompanied by a smell of liquor does not constitute reasonable or probable grounds to make a demand for a breath of breath. In this case the accused remained asleep through the flashing green lights and he immediately awoke when police arrived to check on the driver. That latter-mentioned reaction should have caused him to consider that perhaps he was overtired, rather than being impaired by alcohol or drug. As it must be said, the officer's observations of the accused were not reliable indicators of impairment and his eyes were glassy and glassy. It must be concluded that the nature, quality and quantity of the impairment assessed by the officer was so frail that, despite his attempts to observe the accused sleeping through the two green traffic lights, he did not have any difficulty understanding his rights and the breath demand, which were read to him from a printed card. The evidence of slurred speech is not reliable. In respect of the other factors which the officer observed in the area, he was not able to secure his opinion that there were sufficient grounds for an approved screening device demand despite the fact that the","The accused was charged with operating a motor vehicle while his ability to do so was impaired and while over .08 (breath sample readings were 160 and 150 mg) contrary to s. 253(a) and s.253(b) of the Criminal Code, respectively. Issues arising during the trial included whether there was a breach of his s.8 and s.9 Charter rights to be secure against unreasonable search or seizure, and not to be arbitrarily detained; if there was a breach, was there a remedy under s.24(2); whether the evidence was sufficient to prove the offence of impaired driving beyond a reasonable doubt. The police officer concluded that he had reasonable and probable grounds for the breath demand based upon the accused sleeping through two green traffic lights, a strong smell of alcohol, and his somewhat bloodshot or glassy eyes. HELD: The accused was acquitted of both charges. 1)The evidence was sufficient to establish breaches of s.8 and s.9 of the Charter. The Certificate of Analysis constituted conscriptive evidence which, on balance, would not have been discovered by alternative means. Its admission into evidence might render the trial unfair and bring the administration of justice into disrepute. In the absence of the Certificate of Analysis, the evidence was not sufficient to prove the offence under s.253(b) beyond a reasonable doubt. 2)The strong smell of alcohol and somewhat bloodshot or glassy eyes were not sufficient to conclude there were reasonable and probable grounds for the demand. The court is required to examine the evidence as a whole. Every case will depend a great deal on its individual circumstances. It was not reasonable for the officer to assume that the vehicle not moving at the lights was a reliable indicator of impairment for these purposes. The evidence of slurred speech was not reliable as there was nothing in the officer's notes regarding slurred speech, nor had it been included in the investigation documents. The accused did not have any problems with balance or manner of walk, was cooperative throughout, and did not have any difficulty understanding his rights and the breath demand read to him from a printed card. The officer did not ask the accused whether he had been drinking. 3)The nature and quality of the evidence of a strong smell of alcohol, and eyes which were somewhat glassy or bloodshot, in the context of Stellato, was so frail as to leave a reasonable doubt as to impairment. The 'classic' signs of impairment (erratic driving, strong odour of alcoholic beverage, glassy and bloodshot eyes, slurred speech and unsteadiness on one's feet) was not intended to be an all-encompassing list, and its application will very much depend on the circumstances of a given case."
"The defendant landlord applied by way of originating notice for a permanent injunction against the defendant. The defendant had made a twenty-five year lease expiring at the end of 2005 for 22,000 square feet. The lease provided that the lessee would use the premises only for the purposes of the retail sale of complete line of food products, as well as general retail merchandising as carried on by the rest of the stores. The sole issue was whether the defendant had established irreparable harm. Sobeys opposed the application for an interim injunction on the basis that there was no factual dispute concerning the legal formation of the lease. There was no suggestion, for example, of a mistake in the expression of the terms, nor was there a dispute as to the lease amendments. The essential aspects of the conduct alleged to constitute breach were known and uncontraverted. The potential, and the potential, for controversy, was found in light of the defendant's promise to restrict competition by other tenants. The court would not automatically engage in a prolonged examination of the merits just because a breach of a negative covenant is alleged. There were occasions for assessing the evidence for the cause of action or defence more closely than American Cyanamid might suggest. The case for the defendant was simpler than that for the landlord and M.C. LeBlanc because the landlord is a party to the S.obeys lease and is entitled to enforce the lease as a party. Unencumbered by the standing issues, the factual complication of the receiver's case is to be assessed simply based on the lease terms and the conduct which is alleged to be breach of those terms. However, this court has often recognized that the overriding principle is that interim relief must be just and convenient. Thus, there are occasions in which it is appropriate to reach or express a conclusion on the question of threshold proof. The plaintiffs rely upon Miller v. Toews, 1990 CanLII 2615 (MB CA), [1991] W.W.R. 712 (SCA) and Canada v. Saskatchewan Water Corp. (1992) for the proposition that the enquiry into irreparable harm is less vigorous or less telling in cases of a breaching of negative covenant. The logic of these decisions, adopted in Manitoba and Saskatchewan, is that the factual dispute is not preclusive of an application under 9.02 (a). Similarly, the Saskatchewan court expressed an analytical approach for interim restraint of alleged breaches of negative covenants. It dismisses the application under s. 54 for the","The defendant had a 25 year lease in a shopping centre which provided that the defendant would only use the premises for the purposes of the business of the retail sale of a complete line of food products, as well as general merchandising, as carried out by the rest of the majority of its stores. The defendant proposed to open a pharmacy on the premises. Another tenant in the shopping centre already operated a drug store and their lease provided that no other tenant would operate a drug store in any part of their premises. The other tenant brought an application for a interim injunction against the defendant. The receiver of the shopping centre also brought an application for a declaration that the defendant could not operate a pharmacy on its premises. The defendant objected to the receiver's application on the basis that it involved controverted issues of fact requiring a trial. Application for interim injunction dismissed on the basis that the applicant had not established irreparable harm; the receiver's application could proceed as an application as the potential for a factual dispute was insubstantial; defendant provided with the option of either accepting an adjournment to allow time for further investigation, the conduct of discoveries and the presenting of any further evidence or moving for the court's further consideration."
"The accused, a Jamaican national living in Canada, applied for a stay of proceedings pending extradition on the grounds of contempt of court for failing to provide proper disclosure and for breach of the common law duty of procedural fairness. HELD: The motion on behalf of the Deputy Attorney General to set a date for the extradition hearing was granted. It was alleged that the Attorney General had not disclosed all the evidence in his custody or control. Counsel for the AG undertaken that everything within the control of the AttorneyGeneral has been turned over to the solicitor for Griffiths except only the diplomatic note from USA to Canada which initiated the process. There has been no investigation in Canada of the alleged offence. The Attorney General has only that information which the USA authorities have seen fit to provide to him. The motion to set the date for extradition hearing is to proceed on January 6, 2004 or at such other date and time as counsel may agree upon in consultation with the Local Registrar.",The United States of America sought to extradite the respondent to face a charge of conspiracy to import into the USA a substance containing cocaine. The USA brought a motion to set a date for the extradition hearing. The respondent brought a motion requesting further disclosure and alleged that the USA had not disclosed all of the evidence in its custody or control. HELD: The application for disclosure was dismissed. A date for the extradition hearing was set.
"This appeal stems from proceedings under The Family Property Act, initiated by Deborah Ruskin, a nurse, against Leith Dewar, a doctor. The two had lived together for several years. She sought judgment distributing their property or its value equally between them. The trial judge held that the parties had become'spouses' within the meaning of the Act in early June 1994 and that they had cohabited with one another continuously for two years. Alternatively, he contended the gift and loans served to reduce the value available for distribution. HELD: Appeal allowed. 1) Whether the trial judge erred in concluding that the appellant, who acquired the Vancouver property in October 1994, acquired it after the commencement of spousal relationship, rather than before, is best considered in light of the material facts, the relevant provisions of the Family property Act, and the distribution made by the trial court.  2) This reduces to a finding of fact, and in my judgment it is sufficiently supported by the evidence as to preclude interference on appeal.  3) The Court considered the equivalent of Mitchell v. Mitchell (1992), 121 SaskR. 17 (Sask. C.A.). It found that Dewar's position regarding the loans he obtained from his parents to purchase the house in Regina came to rest on these provisions of s. 23. III. 4) The evidence showed that the value of the Regina house fell to be taken into account as though the house constituted the'matrimonial home', or the 'family home', rather than the $100,000 loans. 5) The appellant appealed.","This appeal arises from proceedings under The Family Property Act. The couple had lived together for several years. She sought judgment distributing their property. The property included a house in Vancouver, which he had acquired some years earlier with the financial assistance of his parents. The trial judge found that the respondent had acquired the house after the commencement of the spousal relationship and then went to hold that the petitioner was entitled to an equal share of its value with no reduction owing to the gifts or loans from his parents. The respondent appealed. HELD: Appeal allowed by the majority. Lane J.A. wrote in dissent. Majority: 1) The Vancouver property was acquired after commencement of the spousal relationship. The value of the property did not qualify for exemption under s. 23(1)(a) of the Act. There are a number of facts that merit emphasis. The respondent received $125,000 from his mother before the spousal relationship started. He still had that amount on hand when the relationship commenced. He used the money as a down payment on the purchase of the Vancouver house shortly after the relationship commenced. By establishing these facts, the respondent established the requisite conditions for the grant of an exemption of the value of the Vancouver property to the extent of the $125,000. 2) The trial judge erred in declining to take into account the loans of $100,000 the appellant received from each of his parents for the purpose of purchasing the Vancouver property. There was insufficient evidence before the trial judge to enable him to find that the mortgage debts were statute-barred and he did not make a firm finding on this point. The trial judge's finding that the respondent will not have to repay the loans was incomplete. He did not assess the loans in light of s. 21(3)(e) of the Act. On the whole of the circumstances concerning the Vancouver property and the length of the spousal relationship, there is no tenable basis for not giving effect to s. 21(3)(e) of the Act and the contributions made by the respondent's parents on his behalf to the acquisition of the property. The petitioner is entitled to share in the build up of the equity in consequence of the pay-down of the mortgage. Minority: 1) The Vancouver home ought to be distributed in accordance with s. 22 of the Act. The gift of $125,000 was made by the respondent's mother with the full knowledge that the parties were living together. In this case, the contribution by a third party on behalf of a spouse to the acquisition of family property is one of the usual factors outlined in s. 21 of the Act and it would be inequitable to exempt the gift from distribution. 2) The trial judge did not err in failing to deduct from the family property the loans given by the appellant's parents. He made a finding the loans were statute-barred. The trial judge clearly considered the legislation and his interpretation of the legislation was not challenged by the respondent. He also made the finding the loans would likely never be repaid. He simply used less than precise language."
"The Crown appealed a sentence imposed against a young offender pursuant to the Youth Criminal Justice Act. The respondent had pled guilty to a charge of robbery, an offence contrary to s. 344(b) of the Criminal Code. The offender was sentenced to 90 days secure custody, 45 days community supervision, 1 year probation and a 10 year firearms prohibition. The Crown had already served 45 days in custody on remand. HELD: Appeal allowed orally. 1) The sentence imposed was demonstrably unfit, failing to take into account the seriousness of the offence, the culpability of the respondent, the criminal history and other circumstances of the offender and the principles of sentencing set out in the Youth Code. 2) The respondent was already served the 90 day closed custody portion of the sentence originally imposed. That sentence was to be set aside. In addition to the time already served, the respondent is to serve 12 months in closed custody to be followed by a period of community supervision of 6 months and a 1 year firearms ban. He will also be subject to a 10% firearms prohibition as in the original sentence. 3) The sentencing judge in B.W.P. concluded that the principles governing deterrence were not a factor to be taken into account and could not be used to justify a sentence harsher than the offence would warrant. Nor was specific deterrence to be considered as a separate factor.","This is an application for leave to appeal, and leave being granted, an appeal by the Crown from a sentence imposed against a young offender pursuant to the Youth Criminal Justice Act. The respondent pled guilty to a charge of robbery, an offence contrary to s. 344(b) of the Criminal Code. The respondent was sentenced to 90 days secure custody, 45 days community supervision, 1 year probation and a 10 year firearms prohibition. HELD: Appeal allowed orally. The sentence is set aside and a sentence of 12 months closed custody, 6 months community supervision, 1 year probation and a 10 year firearms prohibition was imposed in addition to the 90 days closed custody already served at the time of the appeal.  1) It was clear that the primary concern of the sentencing judge was that, in the wake of the Supreme Court of Canada decision in R. v. B.W.P.; R. v. B.V.N. 2006 SCC 27, a custodial sentence might not be open to him at all. It is the Court's view that the sentencing judge's conclusion that the decision in B.W.P. virtually ruled out custodial sentences for young persons under the Youth Criminal Justice Act was unwarranted. The gist of that decision is that under the Act the principle of general deterrence is not a factor to be taken into account and cannot be used to justify a sentence harsher than the circumstances of the offender and the offence would warrant. Nor is specific deterrence to be considered as a separate factor. 2) It is the Court's view that a long custodial sentence is necessary to accomplish the task of bringing the seriousness of the offence to the respondent's attention, and provide meaningful consequences to reinforce societal values without negatively affecting the respondent's likelihood of rehabilitation."
"The applicant, a niece of the testator, applied for removal as executor of her will. The deceased testator was 99 years old and had difficulties with eyesight and hearing. He appeared to have some recollection of certain events, but had a weak grasp of other events. The applicant argued that the evidence given by the deceased executorraises grave concerns about his mental competency to continue to act as an executor and suggests that he has passed over control of all his affairs, including the executorship to a third party. Counsel for the estate claims that there is no basis upon which to remove the present executor. There was no reason to believe that he is not competent to administer the estate and the only person who is at risk is the applicant.","The estate applied to have the court find that a large number of bank shares which had been gratuitously transferred by the deceased to her great niece were being held in trust for the deceased. Following discovery examinations, the great niece, who was the alternative executor appointed under the will, applied to have the executor, the deceased's husband, removed on the basis that his discovery evidence raised grave concerns about his mental capacity to continue to act as executor. Application to remove the executor dismissed; there was no medical evidence submitted in support of the applicant's claim that the executor was not competent to administer the estate and although it was clear from the discovery evidence that he did not have a clear understanding of his duties as executor, given that he was the only beneficiary under the will, he was the only person whose interest was at risk if he failed to properly administer the estate."
"FIAT. Inland Contracting applied for an order pursuant to s.63(2) of The Personal Property Security Act, requiring the respondents to deliver four pieces of equipment. The equipment was rented by Inland to Mike Dery Holdings Ltd. and Giants Head Excavating Ltd. pursuant to an equipment rental contract entered into in 2008. In the fall of 2008 the equipment was seized leaving it in the possession of Giants Head. In February 2009, 101138096 purchased the equipment which is the subject of this application from MikeDery and other trailers and gravel crushing equipment from unrelated third parties. HELD: The application was dismissed with costs to the respondent. The registration under the Act was discharged. 1)The respondent perfected its security interest in the equipment by taking possession of it. When the applicant completed its registration on October 20, 2009 the collateral was no longer available. 2)When the respondent received the required notices prior to registration by the applicant, ownership transferred to the defendant free and clear of the claim of the applicant.","FIAT: This is an application for an order pursuant to s. 63(2) of The Personal Property Security Act requiring the respondents or those in possession to deliver to the applicant four pieces of construction equipment. The four pieces of equipment were rented by applicant, Inland, to respondents, Mike Dery Holdings Ltd. and Giants Head Excavating Ltd. pursuant to an equipment rental contract entered into at Penticton, British Columbia, between April 21, 2008 and August 6, 2008. Inland did not register any security interest in the equipment in British Columbia or Saskatchewan until October 20, 2009. In the fall of 2008, the equipment was transported to Saskatchewan by Mike Dery Holdings Ltd. and/or Giants Head. In February of 2009, respondent 101138096 purchased the equipment from Mike Dery Holdings Ltd. and Giants Head for valuable consideration. Searches were completed to establish no registrations against the equipment. In April of 2009, the equipment was leased to Giants Head and a security agreement registered in Saskatchewan on May 5, 2009 listing the equipment as general property but not specifically registering the equipment by serial number. The security agreement was taken by 101138096 to secure the rental payments owed to it under the lease by Giants Head who had possession of the equipment. Mike Dery Holdings Ltd. and Giants Head defaulted under their payments to Inland and Giants Head defaulted in its payments to 101138096. September 18, 2009, 101138096 seized the equipment leaving it in the possession of Giants Head. The equipment was subsequently removed from Giants Head's possession and stored at the farm of Bruce Bakken. On October 19, 2009, 101138096 forwarded a letter to Giants Head confirming that 101138096 had elected to retain the equipment as payment for the outstanding indebtedness. As of this date a Personal Property Security registry search in Saskatchewan disclosed no security interest other than that of 101138096 in the equipment. Inland subsequently registered both a British Columbia and Saskatchewan Personal Property registry interest by serial number respecting the equipment and its original agreements of 2008. The issue before the Court is whether Inland by virtue of its Personal Property Security registration by serial number on October 20, 2009 has priority over the interest of 101138096 which registered earlier as general security without serial numbers but who alleges to have taken possession of the equipment and elected to retain the equipment seized in satisfaction of Giants Head's indebtedness October 19, 2009. This occurred one day prior to the registration of the security interest by serial number of Inland. HELD: The application is dismissed with costs to the respondents. The respondent 101138096 had a general security registered and had actual possession of the equipment in early October 2009 which therefore perfected its security while it retained possession. As of October 19, 2009 when 101138096 elected to take the collateral as satisfaction of the debt the only party to whom notice was required was the debtor Giants Head and his notice is in compliance with s. 61(1) and s. 61(3) of the Act. When the applicant completed its registration on October 20, 2009 the collateral was no longer available because of 101138096's election on October 19, 2009. The respondent perfected its security interest in the equipment which is subject to this application by taking possession thereof. Electing to take the collateral as satisfaction of the obligation secured and providing the required notices prior to registration by the applicant, transferred title to the equipment to the respondent 101138096 free and clear of the claim of the applicant."
"The applicant was required to discontinue his studies for a failure to meet the academic standards for promotion. He followed the appeal procedures found in the College of Medicine and University, but was unsuccessful throughout. He applied to quash the Academic Appeals Committee and the University Bylaws Committee of Council seeking an order reinstating him as a student at the college of medicine pending resolution of his appeal. HELD: The certiorari application was dismissed. On the assumption that his applications will be successful, he seeks an order of reinstatement and a full appeal board.  1) The applicant has a marginal academic record. Taking judicial notice of the fact that the University has a limited number of placements and that the training of a physician is lengthy and expensive process vis-à-vis the University. 2) There is nothing in the policy to suggest the Board of Regents has the power to determine the merits of the applicant's appeal. Rather, it should be promoted to a proper forum for the application to be promoted. 3) The Board was properly empowered to take proper steps to determine whether the application falls within para.1(a) of Part VI of the policy. 4) It is not appropriate, however, to usurp the function of the Board and review the material to determine if the matter should be remitted to the appeal board under Part V, para.3. The matter is returned to the Board for a decision according to law that is whether the applicant’s appeal falls within Part VI or Part VI.",The applicant was a student at the University of Saskatchewan in the College of Medicine. He was required to discontinue his studies for failure to meet academic standards for promotion. The applicant appealed his dismissal and was unsuccessful throughout. He applied to the Court for an order of certiorari to quash the decision of the Academic Appeals Committee and the University Bylaws Committee Council and an order reinstating him as a student at the College of Medicine pending resolution of his appeal. HELD: The Court found that the Bylaws Committee Council exceeded its jurisdiction by reviewing the previous decisions made and drawing the conclusion that they were made fairly and properly. The Bylaw Committee determined the merits of the applicant's appeal and determined that it was not necessary to convene a full appeal board. There is nothing in the University policy to suggest that the Bylaws Committee has that power. The Bylaws Committee has exceeded its jurisdiction in this regard and its decision is quashed. The matter is returned to the Bylaws Committee to determine whether the applicant's appeal falls within the policy on student appeals and academic matters. The portion of the application requesting reinstatement of the applicant as a student pending the resolution of his appeal is dismissed. The applicant has a marginal academic record and there are a limited number of placements in the College of Medicine. It does not make sense to displace another student or require the College of Medicine to train a marginal student on a potentially temporary basis.
"FIAT: A major hog producer came under creditor protection pursuant to the Companies Creditors' Arrangement Act. In the resulting reorganization two new corporations, each acquired several pig barns formerly owned by the respondent defendant. The acquisitions were financed for the purchasers by Farm Credit Canada (FCC), as primary lender, and National Bank of Canada (National) as receiver. In 2008 both corporations were in default in their loan payments and the lenders took action. Within a year both corporations, both corporations and the owners, each obtained notice of National's intention to realize on its security. National arranged for the appointment of a receiver. HELD: Both applications were dismissed. Although the facts and circumstances in each case were virtually identical, the complexity of them made it appropriate that each defendant recover separate costs on the appropriate tariff. 1) The present claims for foreclosure should be dismissed or the court should declare that FCC is estopped from foreclosing or taking possession of secured property until the expiration of the respective three-year periods of barn use restriction by the doctrine of equitable estoppel. 2) The pleadings filed by the defendant fail to disclose reasonable defences to the plaintiff's foreclosure proceedings; the claims asserted on statements of defence should be advanced in separate actions; and the statements of warranties are otherwise an abuse of the process of this court.","FIAT: The plaintiff sought orders pursuant to Rule 173(a) and (e)of the Queen's Bench Rules and the Court's inherent jurisdiction to strike the entire statements of defence as they failed to disclose reasonable defences; the claims asserted on statements of defence should be advanced in separate actions; and the statements of defence were abuse of the Court's process. HELD: The applications were dismissed with each defendant to recover separate costs on the appropriate tariff. Although the defendants' pleading may delay but not defeat or prevent the plaintiff from proceeding with its foreclosure action, the defences were so closely connected with the plaintiff's demands that it would be manifestly unjust for the plaintiff to proceed without taking the defendant's defences into consideration."
"The accused was found guilty, by jury, of breaking and entering the complainant’s home and committing therein the indictable offence of aggravated sexual assault. The jury did not identify the facts that it found to support the conviction; the sentencing judge was required to make only those factual determinations necessary for the appropriate sentence. The accused had 67 previous convictions, most of which related to thefts and break and enters. He had also been a parole violator and was re-committed in 2005. The complainant had undertaken two bible studies courses while on remand and had had no institutional infractions while on the remand. HELD: The accused was sentenced to nine years incarceration, three years of which were served because of parole. The court found that the accused had an extensive criminal record dating back to 1992 when he was youth. Most of the convictions relate to thefts. The Crown found that both the accused and the complainant were principal and/or party to the offence, that is, as person who aided in the commission of the offence. The Court found that in the circumstances the accused was convicted as charged as charged and participated as principal or party in the aggravated assault.",Criminal Law – Home Invasion – Sentencing HELD: The Court sentenced Klemenz to 12 years imprisonment for breaking and entering and committing the offence of aggravated sexual assault. He was given credit for 22 months spent in custody. Matychuk was sentenced to 12 years in prison but was given credit for time in custody on a 1:1 basis because the Court had not found any circumstances to justify any greater amount of credit. Matychuk’s credit was for 19 months. The sentences were based on the circumstances of the offence: a home invasion and inflicting serious bodily harm on a young victim. The assault was violent and degrading and took place over a period of time. Weapons were used while the victim was bound and sexually assaulted and threatened.
"The parties were married 19 years. The parties had two adult children, a son and a daughter. The respondent was the sole shareholder and director of the company. The wife had difficulty finding employment, so she tried part-time sales and marketing. Eventually she was forced to accept a job with the City of Saskatoon. She eventually accepted a job at City of Regina, but only managed to get a part- time position. She was also unable to obtain employment insurance. HELD: 1)The respondent was to pay spousal support of $1,700 per month until September 1, 1993. 2)The appellant was to transfer the monies owing to the wife to the extent of $84,000. 3)The court preferred the evidence of the father over the respondent when there was avariance in their evidence.  4)The Court valued the assets as of the time of the application which was not the sum of $12,000 as being the midpoint of the Kalesnikoff'svaluations. 5)The balance of monies owed to the respondent were to be paid to the applicant. 6)The Registrar of Land Titles Office was directed to register a charge against the respondent's interest in the NW and SE ï¿½, a portion of his net worth and the balance of his R.R.S.P. based on the sale of the business. The judge found that the respondent had ample resources to support the lifestyle that she enjoyed before and during the marriage.  7)The parties agreed to a settlement in the amount of $15,000 which was to be done in installments of $54,000 to the appellant. 8)The judge determined that the appellant's assets were now valued as of September 1/1993. The amount of spousals payable was to cover the costs of the settlement.","The relief sought was divorce, division of matrimonial property, maintenance and costs. The respondent admitted to having two different financial reports prepared in 1992 for his company of which he was sole Director and shareholder. The company's accountant had been fined for preparing a false report and the respondent was being audited by Revenue Canada. The false report had been submitted to the Court for valuation of the company. HELD: 1)The testimony of the son who had worked for the respondent until fired for allegedly disclosing information to the mother was accepted over that of the respondent. 2)All assets were valued as the same time, the time of the application. The midpoint of the valuations was used to value the respondent's interest in the company at $192,727.00. 3)The petitioner was to receive the balance of the proceeds of the sale of the matrimonial home plus $13,500 to equalize for monies paid to clear off the respondent's writ of execution. 4)Any interest accrued on the sale of the matrimonial home was to be divided equally. 5)The petitioner received her automobile, RRSP and bank account. 6)She was given judgment against the respondent for $135,982.00 with a charge against the matrimonial assets to be registered at Land Titles. 7)$84,000 of the respondent's RRSP was transferred by way of spousal roll over to the petitioner. 8)$12,000 of the settlement proceeds from the wrongful dismissal claim were to be assigned and paid out to the petitioner. 9)All monies were to be paid within six months failing which the Sheriff was to proceed with the judicial sale of such of the assets of the respondent as may be required. 10)Judgment and a charge was ordered against the respondent for the outstanding property taxes in the amount of $15,428.64 which he was to have paid on or before October 1, 1993 by a previous court order. 11)Technology had passed the petitioner by and she had been economically disadvantaged to some extent from the marriage or its breakdown. She had upgraded but had been unable to secure employment. She was to receive $2,000 per month in support until the orders were satisfied and thereafter, $1,000 a month until her 60th birthday.  12)Costs were awarded to the petitioner on a solicitor-and client basis."
"The plaintiff was injured when a tree fell on him while he was removing Elm trees. The plaintiff's action against the defendants was discontinued. This defendant had joined the plaintiff's third party efforts to remove Elm trees from public roads. Dismissing the action, that the tree fell within the purview of the state's Department of Highways and was now a paraplegic. The state had no general duty of care or control over the removal of trees which were an immediate hazard to the public. To determine whether a state has a duty of caring, it must be clear from the outset that government decisions must be made with an eye on the welfare of the citizens, not on the profit motive of government agencies. Here, the plaintiff was a party to the defendant's action. The defendant was awarded costs of the action.","A large diseased elm tree fell on a truck and injured the plaintiff driver. For some years prior to the accident, the defendant had operated a hazardous tree removal program. An inspector had examined the tree that fell. The inspector had no expertise relating to trees or their diseases, nor did his immediate superior. For the plaintiff, that there is a prima fade duty of care owed by the Department of Transportation to users of highway against reasonably foreseeable hazards, including the falling of trees onto the highway. Further, the defendant had a duty to use a reasonable standard of care in the operation of the hazardous tree removal program. The defendant was negligent in failing to train the inspector properly. The Court referred at length to the Supreme Court of Canada decision in Just v. British Columbia. The defendant's claim against the third parties (owners/occupiers of property on which tree stood) was dismissed."
"The accused applied for a declaration that s.300 and 301 of the Criminal Code constitute an unreasonable limitation of one or more of the rights and freedoms guaranteed by s.2, s.3, s2, and s.6 of the Charter. HELD: Application dismissed. 1)The accused were found guilty of three counts of defamatory libel and one count of publishing without lawful justification or excuse that was likely to injure the reputation of the police officer by exposing him to hatred, contempt or ridicule or that was designed toinsult the officer knowing that the matter published was false. 2)S.300 of the Code constitutes a reasonable limit in free and democratic society as can be demonstrably justified under s. 2(b) of the charter. 3)The Court must consider all expression that is potentially restricted by s.,300 or 301 in its determination of the need to be reasonable. 4)The Actus reus element of s.302 is met. 5)Section 301 is a minimal impairment on the right to freedom of expression which is of no force. 6)Section 309 and 311 are very broad. Counsel for the applicants submits that broad range of relatively trivial or innocuous material would fall within those provisions. However, this is not the situation before. The accused are not faced with reverse onus under either s.11(c) or s.12 of the Canadian Charter. There is no violation of s.(d) of either. 7.In order to justify an infringement of s2(b), it must be shown that the objective of s303 is pressing and substantial in free, democratic society. The Court must balance the value of freedom of expressions against the value in reputation. The principles of fundamental justice, including respect for the inherent dignity of the human person, are at issue. The Actus Reus element is met as follows: 309. No person shall be deemed to publish defamatories where he proves that the publication of the defamator matter was for the public benefit at the time when it was published and that the truth of the matter itself was true. 8)Section 307 is a serious infringement of the right of expression guaranteed by ss.2(c). 9)The applicants were accompanied by a number of other persons. The sign and the printing thereon were clearly visible to persons passing by and to those looking out of windows.","The accuseds were charged under ss.300 and 301 of the Code with (i)committing and (ii)publishing a defamatory libel against a police officer. They filed a plea of justification as permitted under s.611(1) of the Code. The Crown denied the truth of the plea pursuant to s.611(4) and the matter proceeded to trial. At the opening of their trial the accuseds applied for an order declaring ss.300 and 301 of the Criminal Code to be of no force and effect on the basis that they constituted an unreasonable limitation on their rights and freedoms guaranteed under ss.2, 7 and 11 of the Charter. The Crown admitted that ss.300 and 301 limited an individual's right to freedom of expression as provided by s.2 of the Charter but argued that this infringement was justified under s.1 of the Charter. HELD: Application allowed in part.  1)The onus of justifying the limitation of a right or freedom is on the party seeking to uphold the limitation and the standard of proof is by a preponderance of probability. 2)The standards against which a limit on a right or freedom guaranteed by the Charter can be shown to be reasonable and demonstrably justified are those underlying values and principles essential to a free and democratic society. While the right of free speech is important in our society, it is not unrestricted. 3)In order to justify an infringement of this right, it must be shown that: (i)the impugned legislative provision has an objective of pressing and substantial concern and (ii)there is a proportionality to the legislation in that: (a)the measures must be fair and not arbitrary, carefully designed to achieve the objective in question and rationally connected to the objective; (b)the means should impair freedom of expression as little as possible; (c)there must be a proportionality between the effects of the limiting legislation and the objective. S.300 of the Code meets these tests, and is therefore a reasonable limit on free speech and is valid. 4)Ss.611 and 612 of the Code, which permit a plea of justification do not create a reverse onus on the accused. They are procedural and merely serve to put the Crown on notice as to the accused's defence. The Crown must still prove that the alleged defamatory libel is knowingly false beyond a reasonable doubt. 5)S.301 of the Code makes it an offence to publish a defamatory libel whether or not the accused believes it to be true. S.301 is therefore not a reasonable limit and is invalid. ADDENDUM: The Court ordered that the agreed statement of facts set out at pp. 2 and 3 of the judgment not be published nor broadcast in any manner."
"The appellant appealed her 1993 conviction for operating a motor vehicle while impaired contrary to s. 253(a) of the Criminal Code. The grounds for appeal were that the conviction was contrary to the law, the evidence and weight of the evidence; that the learned trial judge made an error in law in determining the degree of impairment by alcohol or drug required before aconviction could be entered; further and other grounds as counsel may advise and this court may allow. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. 1)The trial judge was unable to say that the appellant's findings of fact were supported by the trial evidence or that her findings were not clearly wrong so as to contradict her assessment of the facts.  2)There was no basis on which the trial judge could have deduced from her findings that impairment is an issue of fact.","The accused appealed her conviction on a charge of impaired driving. The grounds of her appeal were that the trial judge erred in determining that she was impaired, and that the trial judge otherwise misconstrued and misapplied the evidence. HELD: Appeal dismissed.  1)Both grounds of appeal raised questions of fact. Findings of fact are not to be reversed on appeal unless it can be established that the trial judge has made some palpable and overriding error which affected her assessment of the facts. 2)The Court's task is not to retry the case or substitute its own decision. A trial judge's findings of fact can only be overturned if they are so clearly wrong as to make the decision unreasonable. 3)The Court was unable to say that an error of that kind was made by the trial judge in this case."
"The plaintiff was employed with the defendant, Gabriel Dumont Institute of Native Studies and Applied Research, from January 1983 to May 1993. She was the sole supporter of her family as her husband was unemployed. The plaintiff was awarded damages of 9 months salary in lieu of notice. HELD: The plaintiff's damages were assessed at $26,514.93. 1)The onus is on the employer to establish that its former employee failed to mitigate. The trial judge was entitled to find the plaintiff justified in rejecting the offer of employment. 2)The plaintiff had taken all reasonable steps to mitigate her loss. She had received 9 months' salary in the amount of $1,325.00. 3)Pre-judgment interest was awarded on the basis of the plaintiff's salary and loss of pension benefits for a period of 9 to 12 months. 4)The defendant was awarded pre-judgement interest pursuant to the Pre-judgments Act, s.S.1984-85-86, c.P.22.2, for the sum of $30,737.93, from the date of dismissal until the date when the defendant was granted judgment.","A claim for wrongful dismissal. The position of executive secretary was discontinued for economic reasons. HELD: The plaintiff was awarded $30,737.93 plus costs plus pre-judgment interest. 1)The plaintiff had taken all reasonable steps to mitigate her losses. The duty is to take such steps as a reasonable person would take in his own interests to maintain his income and position in his industry, trade or profession. The former employer has no right to expect that the former employee will accept a lower paying alternative employment with doubtful prospects. 2)Reasonable notice would have been ten months. She had been erroneously requested to take 19.871 days as annual leave and therefore actually received one months' notice. Nine months salary at $26,514.00 plus $1,325 for lost pension benefits and $564 for the Canada Pension Plan were awarded. She was to be compensated for 19.871 days of combined time in lieu and annual leave."
"In addition to dissolution of the marriage and child support, the parties agreed on the divorce based on their separation in excess of 1 year and that Mary be granted custody of the children with reasonable access to John. There remains for determination the quantum of maintenance for the children, the issue of spousal maintenance and the division of matrimonial property. HELD: 1)The parties were in agreement that the amount of maintenance should be based on the Federal/Provincial/Territorial Guidelines. Given the relative income of the parties and current income tax implications, it was reasonable and fair for Mary to receive her share of the pension plan while she was with the parties. 2)The termination and retirement method were the route to go in this case. The respondent acknowledged his obligation to contribute to the maintenance of the two children. However, he did not intend to pursue his claim for equalization of household goods. 3)The respondent was to pay $600 per month per child per month for support of the three children, divided equally between them when and if anything wasrealized on the shares. The four valuation options provided by the parties were to be considered. 4)The reasonable and realistic figure to use for the determination of maintenance was a gross salary of $53,000 per annum. If indeed Mary did receive the greater share, it could be attributed to partial compensation for her economic disadvantage.","At issue was the determination of the quantum of spousal and child support and division of matrimonial property. HELD: 1)The respondent's supplementary allowances were taken into consideration in finding a gross salary of $53,000.00 per annum. Due to an injury he was no longer able to work overtime but was working full-time. Should a medical discharge become necessary an application to vary can be brought at that time. 2)The petitioner suffered a substantial economic disadvantage. The frequent moves due to the husband's employment had disrupted the petitioner's employment and university education. However, the court must also take into consideration the economic advantage enjoyed as a result of the marriage including the pension plan of the spouse. 3)If the petitioner did receive the greater share of the household goods it can be attributed to partial compensation for her economic disadvantage. Shares in joint names were divided equally. Other assets were divided equally. 4)Upon the granting of the divorce the petitioner will be disqualified from receiving the pension survivorship benefits. The fair solution was to use the enhanced value of the 'With Survivorship Benefits' column and the date of adjudication was used as the valuation date. The combination method of valuation was used in view of the 15 year marriage and given the economic disadvantage suffered by the petitioner. 5)The parties agreed that child support should be set in accordance with the Federal/Provincial/Territorial guidelines based on the respondent's gross yearly income. $600.00 per month per child was awarded.  6)The court must seek to promote the economic self-sufficiency of each spouse. The petitioner's future plans were realistic. $800 per month until June 1, 2001 was awarded for spousal support.  7)Costs including one-half of the cost of preparing reports and pension valuations were awarded to the petitioner."
"The defendant was charged with seven violations of The Occupational Health and Safety Act, 1993. The defendant had obtained a contract from the Hamlet to install sewer and water lines on four lots in St. George's Hill. He arranged to hire an individual he knew as a 'employer' to do the backhoe work on the excavation. The contract was for an amount of $7,800.00 and the defendant intended to use this money to pay the worker his fair share of the cost of the work. The construction industry was at a high risk of death if the defendant did not act in accordance with the Act and Regulations. The evidence showed that the relationship between the defendant and the workers was one of an employer to workers and one to which an inexperienced person ought to be allowed to work on such a potentially dangerous site without proper training and specific supervision. The Act does not define 'due diligence' but well-established case authority simply defines this as taking reasonable care to avoid causing harm which is prohibited by law. HELD: The report was inadmissible without addressing the technical aspects of the ruling or making a formal comment on the legal arguments put forth pro and con regarding the issue of admissibility.  1)Once one finds there was a legal duty on the defendant as an employer under the Act then his obligations under the law are to take active steps to supervise and oversee the excavations to make sure the usual protocols for job safety are met. 2)Once the defendant had placed the two men in the trench he had to take some reasonable precautions to prevent death or injury to them. He did not take any reasonable care of the workers. The fact that the nephew of the defendant arranged for him to work with him does not make the defendant an employer since the three men all understood that this would be work for wages in the service of Mr. Pederson.","The defendant, who was to install sewer and water lines on four lots for the hamlet, was charged with seven violations of the Occupational Health and Safety Act and Regulations. It had been agreed that the offences were strict liability. The principle issue was whether the defendant had an obligation imposed by law with respect to the workers and if so whether he discharged it by exercising due diligence in the circumstances. The essential facts were not in dispute. HELD: The defendant was found guilty on all offences.  1)There is a legal duty on an employer under the Act to take steps to supervise and oversee excavations to ensure the usual protocols for safety are met. This requires at a minimum the presence of an experienced person on site. Any reasonable person with some knowledge of worksite safety would insist that the walls be properly sloped, that there be at a ladder or other method to get out of the trench and that first aid supplies were readily available. Supervision is essential particularly when the worker is inexperienced. The deceased had had no experience in sewer and water trenching. No inexperienced person should be allowed to work on such a potentially dangerous site without proper training and specific guidance and supervision. The Law is specific on the requirements to be met for safety of the workers on excavation and sewer and water hookups. 2)The remedial progress report was ruled inadmissible. There was no formal comment on the issue of admissibility. 3)The Act does not define due diligence but well established case authority defines it as taking reasonable care to avoid causing harm which is prohibited by law. 4)The Act does not apply to a contractor. The relationship had all the ordinary indicia of an employer/employee relationship. The defendant controlled the project, tools and materials and bore the risk of loss or profit, had the ultimate responsibility for the worksite, completion of the project and the payment of wages."
The accused was convicted of having consumed alcohol in such a quantity that his blood alcohol content exceeded.08 contrary to s. 253(b) and s. 255(1) of the Criminal Code. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. 1)The trial judge was entitled to accept and rely on the evidence of the Crown witnesses to support the conviction.  2)The evidence outlined by the trial judge did not justify the conclusion that the Crown had established proof of 'care and control' beyond a reasonable doubt. It was clear from the evidence that the officer who came along later that he rejected the theory the appellant's counsel advanced. He was perfectly entitled to reject the theory.,"An appeal of a conviction for having the care or control of a motor vehicle after consuming in excess of 80 milligrams of alcohol in 100 millilitres of blood contrary to s.253(b) and s.255(1) of the Criminal Code. Although the trial judge concluded the appellant rebutted the presumption in s.258(1)(where it is proven that an accused occupies the seat normally occupied by the operator of the vehicle, it is presumed he is in care and control unless he can establish that he did not occupy the seat for the purpose of setting the vehicle in motion), the appellant was found to be in de facto control. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. It was clear from the trial judge's acceptance of the evidence of the two paramedics who had noted the car parked in an unusual place and police officer who came along later, that he rejected the theory advanced by the appellant's counsel. The location of the ignition key was not relevant. The appellant's memory of the events was far from clear given the level of his intoxication. The trial judge was entitled to accept and rely on the evidence of the Crown witnesses."
"The plaintiff injured his knee when he tripped over a 'dolly-cart' while attending at the premises of the defendant. The plaintiff was attending to clear lumber for a job at the defendant's premises when the accident occurred. He entered the premises intending to walk towards and through the glass doors to the lumber yard. However, as he entered the building, he did not see anything located on the side of the desk facing towards the glass. He suffered a knee injury which restricted his activities during the remainder of 1995 and to lesser extent, the following year and, to very limited extent, continues to the present. Awarding the plaintiff $8,500 by way of general damages, that the evidence of the accident and the defendant has not used reasonable care in these circumstances to prevent injury or damage to persons in the position of the plaintiff and, therefore, the defendant is responsible for the injuries and damages suffered by the plaintiff. Given the circumstances, the realization that some of the loss can be attributed to this accident and recognizing the need to provide fair and reasonable compensation, even where proof of actual amounts may be difficult or impossible, the court awarded the sum of $5,000.","Plaintiff suffered soft tissue damage to knee when he tripped over a dolly cart in a building supply warehouse. Knee became swollen and infected and he was off work for 12 days. He claimed for pain and suffering, loss of income and loss of earning capacity. Plaintiff was found 60% responsible for injuries and defendant 40% responsible. Damages were assessed as follows: $8,500.00 for general damages, $5,000.00 as damages for loss of income and $1,000.00 for loss of ability to perform household tasks. The dolly cart out of view behind the counter was an 'unusual danger' which the defendant knew or ought to have known of and reasonable care was not used to prevent injury. However, the plaintiff failed to look at the floor as his attention was focused on the door. He assumed nothing had changed in the area from the time he entered the premises a few minutes previously. The plaintiff was in commercial premises and should have taken greater care to observe and avoid anything in his path. The plaintiff suffered an injury which restricted his activities for the first five months, to a lesser extent for the following year and to a very limited extent to the time of trial. There was no evidence to support a claim for diminishment of earning capacity."
"The trial judge held that the lease was void because it breached the rule against perpetuities and allowed the respondents' action for declaration to that effect. He allowed the counterclaim by the appellant against the respondent Maxx Petroleum for breach of confidence with consequent directions for an accounting and assessment of damages. The principal question on this appeal is whether the appellants' oil and gas 'top lease' with the late Harry Herbert Taylor should be rendered void by the rule. HELD: The appeal is allowed and the respondent's counterclaim is allowed. 1) The lease was not unique in Saskatchewan. The concept of 'top leases' is not unique or unusual in the oil & gas industry. The evidence established that there are hundreds of such leases in this Province. The present lease was intended by the parties to have a contingent relationship with future vesting as to the reversionary interest in the mines and minerals. However, it is only after the time of vesting has been ascertained, that a determination can be made about whether that time is too remote and therefore in contravention of the rule (see Anger and Honsberger Real Property). 2) There have been changes in the meaning of the words used in the phrase 'upon' and 'in the event'. However, no change has been made to the actual terms of the lease. The policy behind the rule is not offended. 3) There has been a gradual evolution of the use of the word 'upon', which in this case refers to the parties' pleas of non est factum or breach of s. 17 of the Securities Act. To ascribe to these words an equivalent to way of describing reversionaries is to distort the words beyond recognition. 4) In this case, the plaintiffs were awarded three Hundred and Twenty (320) shares with nominal or par value of One Dollar ($1.00) per share in the capital stock of the respondent and one half of the shares as fully paid and non-assessable.","The Court of Appeal was required to determine the limits of its authority to change the application of the Rule against Perpetuities, an established common law principle, to a particular type of oil and gas lease. In 1950 Taylor entered a 'top' (head) lease for mineral rights with Freeholders Oil, effective upon the expiry of Imperial's interest in 1959. The new owner of the land recognized the assignment of the 1961 top lease sold to Tarragon in 1993. After reaching an agreement in 1993 in principle for a 'farmout' arrangement whereby Maxx agreed to drill the lands for Tarragon, Maxx concluded the top lease offended the Rule against Perpetuities and entered its own lease with the landowner. The trial judge held the 1950 Freeholders lease was void because it contravened the Rule against Perpetuities; although top leases do not offend the policy behind the rule, any modification of the rule is best left to the legislature; there was a breach of confidence. HELD: The appeal was allowed with costs on double column V. The action for a declaration that the top lease is void was dismissed with costs in Queen's Bench. 1)The top lease in question was not void as it did not offend the object and purpose of the Rule. The reasoning and approach of the Supreme Court of Canada in Salituro, Tolofson and Morguard was persuasive. The decision of the House of Lords in Arthur J S Hall demonstrates the need to re-examine archaic rules of common law which cannot be justified in modern society. The genius of the common law lies in its adaptiveness to changing times. Its basic principles are not meant to become rigid formulae. Common law rules may be tweaked to do justice between the parties when a rigid and mechanistic application of the rule would run counter to the object and purpose of the rule. Since the socio-economic and political conditions which gave rise to the creation of the Rule no longer exist, it was open to the Court to consider the application of the rule in the context of a commercial instrument such as the top lease in question.  2)Although top leases have been attacked on other grounds, this was the first case before the Saskatchewan Courts in which the Rule against Perpetuities has been advanced to void such a lease. The historical background and object and purpose of the rule were reviewed. The general purpose is to prevent the tying up of property to the detriment of society in general. The common law rule against perpetuities prevails over intention because it is not a rule of construction, but a rule of property. A mere possibility, or even a probability that the estate or interest may vest within the time is not enough. The 'wait and see' doctrine has been adopted by statute in some jurisdictions.DISSENT: The Court should not modify the Rule in the face of the significance of such a modification, the efforts of the legislature to legislate and the inability to deal with such issues as the retrospective operation of such a decision. The Rule against Perpetuities applies to this top lease. As there is no life in being in this case, the interest must vest within 21 years of its creation which would have been 1971. The Rule is not concerned with the duration of an interest but only that an interest may vest at a remote time in the future. The rule invalidates interests in land that vest too remotely."
"Where a person is killed due to the fault of another, the person's estate may sue the wrongdoer for certain damages which have resulted in an actual pecuniary loss to the estate. The main question to be decided in this case is whether the earnings which the deceased would have likely have earned had he not been killed are 'an actual peculiary loss' and are therefore recoverable by the estate in an action against the Wrongdoer. HELD: Appeal dismissed. 1) There has been no trial in Nova Scotia. The facts before the court are those agreed to by the parties for the limited purpose of resolving preliminary point of law. This is not an old statute that has been ignored by the Legislature in the many years since it was first enacted. The statute has been amended several times with respect to both the types of damages that are recoverable and the definition of persons for whose benefit the action may be brought. 2) To succeed on their survival of actions claim for damages for Paul's lost earning capacity, the estate must have a cause of action that survives his death for the benefit of the estate and, therefore, must not be excluded by the provisions of the Survival of Actions Act. 3) In this case, the appellants rely on allegedly wrongful acts of the respondent for which the respondent could have been liable. Whether the respondent was negligent and liable for damages in relation to Paul's death have not been decided and are not in issue here. The only question on this appeal is, if, if McDonald was at fault, whether the estate would be entitled to claim damages for this loss of expectation of life.","A fifteen year old died in a motor vehicle accident. The estate brought a claim for loss of future income and lost earning capacity. The Chambers judge found that such a claim was not available and the estate appealed. Appeal dismissed; the context of the legislation, its purpose and text all support the conclusion that the deceased's loss of prospective earnings is not an actual pecuniary loss to the estate."
"The plaintiff applied for summary judgment pursuant to Queen's Bench Act s. 184A(1)(a) and s. 29 of The Queen’s Bench Act in accordance with minutes of settlement agreed to by the parties following a pre-trial conference July 16, 2002. The defendant opposed the application solely on the basis that a recent amendment to the Queen”s Bench act, 1998 precludes the plaintiff from referring to the minutes of settlements. HELD: The plaintiff was granted summary judgment in the amount of $15,000 plus costs taxed to the date of the Minutes of Settlement. 1) The defendant did not file any affidavit material in opposition to the application. 2) The majority of the plaintiff›s affidavit must be struck by reason of the fact that the averments contravene s. 28.1 of the QBR Act, 1998. However this judgment shall not be entered into until the said $20,000 has been paid to my lawyer.  3) If the parties had not reached a settlement agreement any reference to such discussions, admissions, disclosures, concessions, negotiations or evidence arising from any such discussion in any subsequent proceeding would be prohibited. 4) There was no mention of settlement during the preparation of the action nor in the release of the documents. There was nothing in the terms of the settlement that could be said to refer to it. 5) The Court was unable to enter into an order with respect to settlement negotiations. 6) The applicant was not entitled to any form of disclosure, misrepresentation, duress or fraud.","An application for summary judgment pursuant to Queen's Bench Rule 184(1)(a) and/or Queen's Bench Act s.29 in accordance with the minutes of settlement agreed to follow the pre-trial conference. The defendant did not file affidavit evidence but opposed the application solely on the basis that recent amendments to the Queen's Bench Act precludes reference to minutes of settlement. HELD: The plaintiff was entitled to enter judgment for $15,000 plus costs of this application. A settlement agreement reduced to writing in no way offends the confidentiality required under s.28.1. The plaintiff is entitled to rely on the minutes of settlement and must be permitted to refer to them in his affidavit. Section 28.1 is not meant to apply to this situation. If a party to an action is unable to enforce a concluded settlement, the pre-trial process becomes meaningless. The legislation never intended such a result. There was no suggestion that there was non-disclosure, misrepresentation, duress or fraud in the execution of the minutes of settlement. Nor was it suggested the minutes were unclear or ambiguous. The defendant did not allege the settlement was amended or altered or that the balance of $15,000 does not remain owing."
HELD: The application was dismissed. The court found that the only viable options were to permit the petitioner to relocate the primary residence of the child and to allow him to have more access to his biological father and sister. The child had been living with his maternal grandmother in the Kindersley district and would be separated from his psychological parent when he moved to the Archerwill district. The petitioner had foreclosed the option of returning to live in theKindersley area. It was in the petitioner's best interests that the primary home be with the petitioner.,"The respondent applies to vary the consent joint custody order granted in October 2004. His application was prompted by the relocation of the petitioner with one of their two children, Tyson. The sole issue on this variation application is the determination of the primary residence of Tyson. HELD: 1) The petitioner wants to move Tyson 5.5 hours away from the respondent. This also requires a change in access arrangements. These are changes in circumstances that are material.  2) The petitioner has developed a strong bond with Tyson. The respondent has developed a close relationship with the parties' other child Kailey. After Kailey went to live with the respondent, neither parent did much to facilitate the access of either child. Before the petitioner and Tyson moved, although a short distance apart, neither Kailey nor Tyson saw his or her non-custodial parent and sibling on a regular basis. Even telephone access has been sporadic. Both parents have established homes that accommodate only one child. 3) The petitioner's move must be considered in light of the circumstances that existed before the petitioner's relocation. The parties had already adopted a split custody arrangement without formalizing access or adjusting child support. 4) Permitting the petitioner to relocate is in the best interests of Tyson. It is important that Tyson continue to live in the home of the parent whose constant presence he has become accustomed to. The petitioner has always been Tyson's primary caregiver. The petitioner is the psychological parent."
"Appeal pursuant to s. 39 of The Small Claims Act from judgment given January 19, 2006. The appellant asserts a palpable and overriding error by the learned trial judge in accepting, and finding as fact, part of the testimony of witness (that an amount was owing by the appellant to the respondent) but not accepting the further testimony of the witness that an amount is also owing to the appellant by the respondent. The respondent argues that there was no error of law nor unreasonable finding of fact by the trial judge, and that his conclusions are not so clearly wrong as to make the decision unreasonable. HELD: The appeal is dismissed. There is no order as to costs. 1) This appeal is not a new trial but an appeal on the record. Kitzul v. Ungar (1991), 1991 CanLII 7678 (SK QB), 90 Sask. R. 239 (Sask. Q.B.). The trial judge had an immense advantage in assessing evidence and arriving at findings of fact and the court of appeal must extend very substantial deference to the findings offact of a trial judge. The standard of appellate review is that of palpable, overriding error and its functional equivalents, including 'clearly wrong, 'unreasonable' and 'not reasonably supported by the evidence' (see: 2005 SCC 25). That principle of law and case authorities were not consulted nor argued on this appeal. 2) There was no palpable or overriding error in the judgment.","This is an appeal pursuant to s. 39 of The Small Claims Act, 1997. The appellant asserts a palpable and overriding error by the learned trial judge in accepting, and finding as fact, part of the testimony of a witness but not accepting the further testimony of the witness that an amount was also owing to the appellant by the respondent. HELD: The appeal is dismissed. The trial judge was not required to accept the entirety of the witness's testimony, despite having accepted most of it, particularly in light of the contradictory evidence of the respondent denying the sum claimed by the appellant. The denial by the respondent of the appellant's claim, accepted by the trial judge, was fatal to the appellant's onus of proving a mutual understanding and absolute acknowledgement of the alleged debt between the parties."
"The respondent appeals a decision of the Adjudicator of the Smalls Claims Court in the amount of $10,852 plus costs of $139.35 for a total of $11,031.35. The singular ground of appeal cited in the appellant's Notice is a failure to follow the requirements of natural justice. The appellant mistakenly showed up for the hearing on the wrong date, which was one day after the actual hearing. While waiting around for half an hour, he checked the doors of the Court House several times, then assumed that Court was cancelled because of bad weather. On that hearing date, the adjudicator was satisfied that the requirements for the substitution service had been met by serving a copy of the claim on the respondent's mother and by texting to the applicant the new hearing date. This was at the same time that personal service was being effected on the applicant's mother. Natural justice demanded that the appellant be heard. The respondent did nothing wrong in proceeding with the hearing. The court had sympathy for the appellant and for the reason he did not attend the hearing, but was not prepared to interfere with this finding. Allowing the appeal, that the respondent must accept the consequences of his decision to ignore the notice. It does not automatically follow that just because they were not present that their appeal will be allowed. The Court must also view the Respondent's actions and the courts record of events in determining whether due process was followed and whether the Rules and Regulations prescribed by the Court were adhered to.","The small claims adjudicator granted an order for substituted service after the respondent had trouble serving the appellant with notice of her claim. As per the order, she personally served the appellant's mother and notified the appellant of the hearing date by text message. He didn't appear and default judgement was granted against the appellant in the amount of $11,031.35. The appellant appealed, arguing the adjudicator failed to follow the natural requirements of justice. He denied being in contact with his mother. He admitted receiving the text message(s) but said he didn't believe the respondent, but didn't make any further inquiries. New evidence (a letter from his mother saying she was not in contact with her son) was allowed on the appeal. Appeal dismissed. The right to be heard is a fundamental right, and an appeal of a default judgment must be subject to the highest scrutiny. Here the respondent's claim was valid. The adjudicator had the jurisdiction/authority to make an order for substituted service and the respondent followed it. At the very least, the appellant was notified of the hearing dates by text message(s). While he may not have believed the messages, he should have taken some steps to confirm with the court if there was indeed a hearing set. He failed to prove he had a reasonable excuse for defaulting, chose to ignore the notice, and was mistaken only as to what would be the outcome if he failed to appear."
"HELD: The application was dismissed and the usual bidding rules applied. Alberta Ltd. (FMI) did not enter a defence and served demands for notice and then were noted for default of defence on March 12, 2010. The plaintiff FMI seeks an order nisi for judicial sale pursuant to s. 11 of the Saskatchewan Farm Security Act. The purpose of the bidding process in a judicial sale remedy contemplates a level playing field for all participants. The fact that FMI is owed an amount on the mortgage and that it will likely receive a significant cash payout on sale does not modify the desirability and necessity of obliging all bidders to pay into court the full bid price. To do otherwise would be to pay heed to the financial strengths of one or more of the parties or at least give a preferred position to the entity seeking foreclosure.","The plaintiff granted the defendant a mortgage over a parcel of land just outside the city limits. The defendant failed to make any payment. The plaintiff applied for foreclosure on the land and an order nisi for judicial sale. The defendant was a developer. He argued that the foreclosure action was void because the land was being used as farmland and was subject to protection under s. 9 and 11 of The Saskatchewan Farm Land Security Act. The other issues before the court were the appropriate period of redemption and whether the plaintiff could submit a bid that incorporated the value of the land as a 'credit' enabling the plaintiff to merely 'top up' the bid by the additional amount needed to reach the bid price. HELD: The Saskatchewan Farm Land Security Act (SFSA) did not apply. The undisputed evidence was that since the defendant acquired the land in 2007, their focus was to develop the land as an industrial park and they had undertaken a host of activities to achieve that purpose which clearly indicated that their intent was not to farm the land in the sense contemplated by the SFSA. There was no foundation to deviate from the usual redemption period of 90 days from the date of the decision. The bidding process in a judicial sale contemplates a level playing field for all participants. The fact that the plaintiff is likely to receive a significant cash payout from the judicial sale does not modify the desirability of obliging all bidders to pay into court the full bid price. Normal bidding rules shall apply. The plaintiff was entitled to costs."
"Rule 4.07(3) assumes that a motion to dismiss must occur prior to the filing of a defence because it directs the judge to set a time for filing the defence. More than two years after the suit started, appellant applied for stay. The Chambers judge did not explicitly determine whether the applicant had attorned to the jurisdiction of the court or not. The appeal was dismissed with costs to the respondent. Rule 8.02 is an interlocutory and discretionary decision and only available if the Chambers judge applied a wrong principle of law or made a clearly erroneous finding of fact, or a failure to intervene would give rise to a patent injustice. Here, the respondent had defended and taken steps in the proceedings which precluded right to apply for stay under s. of the Arbitration Act.",". This was an interlocutory, discretionary decision and the chambers judge did not apply a wrong principle of law or make a clearly erroneous finding of fact, nor has there been a patent injustice. A decision on the corollary issue of whether the proceeding should have taken place under Rule 4.07 (dismissal for want of jurisdiction) or Rule 88.02 (abuse of process) is unnecessary."
"Roy Longard, the plaintiff, wanted to continue to garden on the Keel property and use the Borden driveway. He had obtained a portion of the land from the Longard brothers and continued to use it for many years before being blocked off by the Defendants. The plaintiffs sued for the right to access the driveway. Dismissing the action with costs, that Roy Longard did not have a legal right to the driveway as he had always used it. The Court found that the plaintiff had not shown that the reservation contained in the 1942 Eldard deed to the extent that it incorporated the driveway, and there was no expressed reservation shown by the plaintiff as to the use of it.Prescription or 'Lost Modern Grant' The plaintiff's application for damages was dismissed. There was considerable evidence that the Longards in combination used the driveway in a continuous, uninterrupted, open and peaceful manner for years (well in excess of 20 years). This use continued uninterrupted after the defendant received the portion of his property and as long as the plaintiffs remained on his property, and continued when the property was transferred to the Seventh Day Adventist Church.","After a piece of family property was divided into two parcels, one of the brothers continued to use a driveway and maintain a garden on the other parcel. When this brother died, his son continued to use the driveway and garden, even after the second property changed hands many times. When the current owners of the second property refused to allow the continued use of their property, the son claimed that his use of the driveway was of right on the basis of expressed reservation or prescription. He argued that his uncle was incompetent when he executed a statutory declaration stating that the use of both the driveway and the garden had been with his express permission. Judgment for the defendants; there was no express reservation of the driveway in the deed to the second property and the plaintiff did not have a prescriptive right to use the driveway. Although the plaintiff and his father had used the driveway in a continuous, uninterrupted and peaceful manner for well in excess of 20 years, the statutory declaration showed that this use had been with the uncle's permission."
"The child was apprehended at birth by the Minister of Social Services but the Minister did not proceed with the application and the child was allowed to take home with her. The child had diminished cognitive abilities, as she suffers from FASD, and had challenges around understanding and retaining information, despite presenting as though this was not the case. The parents agreed that one of them would always be present to supervise the care of the child. After the apprehension, the child remained in the parents' care and was alone with the child for about six to nine months. The mother, who had recently been diagnosed with ADD, alleged that the father had physically assaulted her and threatened to kill anyone who entered the farm. The father was charged under The Youth Criminal Justice Act for assaulting the child and threatening bodily harm if returned to his parents. HELD: The child was placed in the custody of the father, as a person of sufficient interest, for a fixed period of 4 months. That period is of shorter duration than the six months suggested by the Ministry. Given a variety of reasons, the parents have not had adequate access to the child so as to build a more positive relationship with him. There is no evidence that either parent abused or mistreated this child. Both parents were able to care for this child and physical or emotional harm was likely to occur to him. The order was made under s. 23 of the Child and Family Services Act as a result of the apprehension. This child was in need of protection pursuant to s. 11(b) of the Act because the parents were not able to provide for the child's needs and there was no positive relationship between them. The concerns expressed in the maternity alert from Rosetown were: 1) that the mother was unable to parent; 2) the father was mentally and physically incapable of doing so; 3) there was evidence that the parents had not been able to parent adequately and children were at risk of harm should their child be returned to them; and 4) the plan was to return the infant to the parent's care in the same location as on November 23, 2015 with the support of a friend and neighbor of the mother.","HELD: The court found that the child was in need of protection under s. 11(b) of The Child and Family Services Act, that his parents were unable to care for him, and that physical or emotional harm was likely to occur to him. J.A.’s mother was found to be a person of sufficient interest under s. 23 of the Act. The court ordered that the child should be placed in the custody of J.A.’s mother as a person of sufficient interest for a period of four months pursuant to s. 37(1)(b) of the Act. The child’s parents should have adequate access to build their relationship with him and to allow them, with the assistance of others, to come up with a plan that would allow them to eventually care for their child."
"The respondent appeals the decision of the Small Claims Tribunal which found that it did not file the transcript of evidence at trial. The appellant argues the appeal must be dismissed based on s. 39(5) of the Act. HELD: The appeal is allowed to be filed and the appeal set to proceed. The court has determined that pursuant to ss. 39 of the act, the transcript may now be filed. The setting of the appeal date is confirmed. There will be no order as to costs in the circumstances.","HELD: The application was dismissed. The court held that pursuant to s. 39(9), it ordered that the transcript should be allowed to be filed and the appeal to proceed. The appellant had done everything required of it pursuant to the Act. The provisions of s. 39 did not require the appellant to follow up with the local registrar’s office to see if the transcript had been filed. In a case such as this, s. 39(9) of the Act provides the court with the ability to exercise its discretion to remedy the problem and ensure that justice is achieved where a transcript could not be filed within the six-month period."
"HELD: The appeal was allowed and the sentence imposed was varied to 12 months of probation. The court found that the trial judge committed an error in assessing the credibility of the witnesses, namely, that the complainant was only at the house for five or ten minutes and she never went into the bedroom. The sentence appeal was dismissed. It is well understood that an appellate court must show great deference to a trial judge’s assessment of witness credibility. The appellant was convicted after trial of sexually assaulting his 11-year-old niece contrary to s. 271 of the Criminal Code. The trial judge made errors in assessing credibility, his weighing of the evidence, and his findings of fact. The fresh evidence will be considered as it relates to the conviction appeal. 1) The evidence met the criteria for the admission of fresh evidence as set forth in Palmer (1979), 1979 CanLII (SCC), [1980] SCR 759 at 775 and the sentencing principles set out in R v W.(D.). The appellant had identified certain inconsistent statements in respect of which his counsel did not cross-examine the complainant. He has failed to establish these omissions amount to unreasonable professional judgment that reach the threshold of incompetence. 2) The appellant has failed, beyond that, to establish his minimal reliance on the former babysitter”s evidence to assess the condition of the complainant after the offence, which is corroborated by other evidence leading up to the critical event, including the events afterwards when she’d seen the accused leaving the house by the accused” s. 6 of the Sexual Assault Victim Compensation Tribunal. 3) The court concluded that it is more likely than not that the accused would comply with the conditions of non-custodial sentence than it is to comply with a custodial sentence. Given the seriousness of the offence and the fact that that denunciation and deterrence must take paramount importance, the appellant must establish that the appellant received ineffective legal representation at the trial and that he received ineffective trial representation. The principles of denunciation, deterrence and denunciation must take precedence over reasonable professional assistance. 4) There was no basis to interfere with the conviction.","HELD: The appeal from conviction was dismissed and sentence appeal allowed. The sentence was varied to 12 months of probation. The court found with respect to each issue that: 1) the presumption of competent trial representation had not been displaced. The trial lawyer’s decision not to cross-examine the complainant was a tactical one. She was very young and had difficulty expressing herself in the courtroom whereas she had given clear, coherent statements to the police shortly after the offence. The lawyer determined that it was not beneficial to the appellant’s position to highlight those statements by raising certain inconsistences between them and the complainant’s testimony;  2) the trial judge’s assessment of credibility was entitled to deference. He correctly identified R v W.(D.) as the guiding legal principle in the circumstances and his credibility findings were supportable on the evidence; and 3) the sentence was unfit because denunciation and deterrence are secondary factors in sentencing young offenders and are to be considered in a fashion consistent with the principle of “diminished moral blameworthiness” described in s. 3 the YCJA. The court acknowledged that this offence, committed against an 11-year-old and causing her serious psychological harm, might warrant a custodial sentence but for the appellant’s exemplary conduct since the offence and the almost four years that had elapsed between the offence in 2012 and his sentencing in 2016. Under s. 3(1)(b)(iv) and (v) of the YCJA, the delay in this case offended the concept of timely justice. To impose a custodial sentence on the appellant in this case would be contrary to the purposes of the YCJA as it would impede the appellant’s rehabilitation and reintegration into society. The court decided that a fit sentence in this case would be 12 months of probation."
"HELD: The appeal was allowed and a new trial ordered. The court found that the trial judge's refusal to grant an adjournment deprived the accused of his right to make full answer and defence and to fair trial. It also found that, in the course of the trial, the accused's counsel had justifiably withdrawn, leaving the accused to conduct his own defence. The issues in this appeal were whether the judge's decision was based on reasons not wellfounded in law, whether the decision affected the accused’s right to a fair trial and whether the adjournment would negatively affect the public interest in the orderly and expeditious administration of justice.","HELD: The appeal was allowed and a new trial ordered. In this case, the court found that the judge had not erred in his decisions regarding the first and the third requests for adjournment but had in the second request by failing to provide sufficient reasons for his denial. Amongst many factors it considered, the court found that most importantly, the appellant had not caused his counsel to withdraw for the purpose of delaying trial. It concluded that the error resulted in a miscarriage of justice based upon the appellant’s poor conduct of his own defence and lack of understanding of trial process."
"The respondent was seeking an unequal division of matrimonial assets and child support or a lump sum award. The parties, along with their mother, decided to purchase and operate a coffee and donut franchise. The primary caregiver for the children and to supplement the family finances by employment, was the mother of three children. She sought to have her bank loan collateral mortgage removed, arguing that this would impede her ability to work and promote economic self-sufficiency. The mother was awarded $16,868, and the parties agreed to joint custody of the three children, as well as reasonable scheduled access. The court was satisfied that the ground had been proven and granted the divorce. There was no possibility of reconciliation between the parties. The respondent was entitled to lump sum or spousal support in any event, and she was also entitled to a share in the common marriage fund.","The parties lived together for 14 years and had three children, aged eight, 13 and 14. The petitioner always worked and eventually became a successful stockbroker. The respondent was employed part-time doing minimum wage jobs and was responsible for the household duties and raising their children. The petitioner's annual income was $50,000 at the time of separation, but escalated to $200,000 in 1992 and was prone to great fluctuation. The respondent was to have custody of the children. She sought spousal and child support and an unequal division of assets. Ordering support and an unequal division of assets. The court extensively reviewed the case of Moge v. Moge (1992), 43 R.F.L.(3d) 345 (S.C.C.) and found that marriage and child care responsibilities hinder a wife's role in the workplace. The court awarded $4500 per month as spousal and child support, plus an additional $500 while the wife retrained. The court considered this an appropriate case for an unequal division of matrimonial assets in the respondent's favour. Finding that the awards were still not sufficient to satisfy the respondent's needs, a lump sum award of $18,000 was ordered. On appeal."
"The Court found that a number of former partners of the plaintiff pension plan (the plaintiffs) had breached the plaintiff's' fiduciary duty by claiming that they had received confidential information from the plaintiff regarding its pension plan. Dismissing the action, that the plaintiff had not established a conflict of interest, and that neither the plaintiff nor the defendant were privy to confidential information about the pension plan or its beneficiaries. The Court found, therefore, that Pink Breen should not be permitted to represent the applicants in this matter. Costs were awarded to the plaintiff. Given the substance of the material and the arguments and submissions, the Court found there was no conflict of interests and that the defendants were permitted to continue to act.","The solicitor for the plaintiff union had been a partner of the law firm which incorporated the defendant company and was under a general retainer to them. Several of the defendants made application to have the plaintiff s solicitor removed as solicitor of record claiming this was a conflict of interest. Dismissing the application, that the test in such circumstances is whether the public represented by the reasonably informed person would be satisfied that no use of confidential information would occur. To do so it must be shown that a solicitor client relationship existed. There must not be a danger of the confidential information coming back to haunt the client. The court found that such a relationship did not exist in this instance. In addition, the applicant must demonstrate that the solicitor received information which is relevant to the matter at hand. The court found no such evidence of this possibility. It is no bar to representation by a solicitor that some former partners at a previous firm will be examined for discovery or called to testify."
"The appellant was convicted after a two and a half-day trial of sexually touching a young girl under the age of 14 years contrary to s. 151 of the Criminal Code. The first ground of appeal alleged that the trial judge was in error by permitting the complainant to testify behind a screen without first conducting a voir dire and by relying solely upon the representations of the Crown counsel to the effect that she would be uncomfortable without a screen. The second ground alleged interference with the trial and created an impression of unfairness by posing questions to the complainant and another witness during the course of their testimony. Allowing the appeal and ordering a sentence of six months, that the verdict was unreasonable and was not supported by the evidence. The third ground alleged that defence counsel attempted to interfere by asking the appellant to read a statement she had given to the police to refresh her memory during cross-examination. HELD: The appeal against sentence of 6 months was dismissed. The sentence was not imposed on the first ground. Although excessive interference by a judge with the development of the evidence by counsel should not be condoned, the court cannot say that Judge Haliburton went beyond reasonable inquiries in this instance.","The appellant was convicted of sexually touching a young girl who was under the age of 14. He contended the trial judge erred by permitting the complainant to testify behind a screen without first conducting a voir dire and by relying on Crown's submission the girl would be uncomfortable without the screen. As well, he argued the judge improperly permitted the complainant to read a statement given to the police, to refresh her memory during cross-examination. Dismissing the appeal, that the fairness of the trial was in no way impaired by use of the screen, and no miscarriage of justice occurred. The statement was given the complainant by defence counsel, who suggested she read v.  Allegations the trial judge interfered with the trial, thereby creating an impression of unfairness, were also dismissed as being without merit."
FIAT. The respondent applied to disqualify and to remove the law firm of Robertson Stromberg from acting for the petitioner in an action related to a dispute between two of his former lawyers. The petitioner's former lawyer had recently joined the law practice of the respondent and the respondent's former solicitor had also joined the firm and was the solicitor for the respondent in this action. The solicitor had previously acted for the applicant in this matter and the petitioner now sought to have her leave as solicitor. The applicant's former law firm also sought to remove her from the practice. HELD: 1)The respondent was to have the costs of this motion and the motion and documents related to it sealed. 2)The applicant was to attend a further examination to be arranged in consultation with counsel and on 10 days' notice of the date set for the examination and payment of proper conduct money. 3)The solicitor's screening policy was to be set up to ensure that no confidential information had passed and that no disclosure would occur. 4)The application for an order with respect to without prejudice offers of settlement was dismissed.,"FIAT. An application to disqualify and remove a solicitor and law firm from acting for the petitioner. Steps were not taken to ensure that no disclosure of information would occur for a month after the firm was put on notice. At issue was whether the screening measures taken ensured that no disclosure would occur and satisfied the evidentiary burden imposed on the law firm. HELD: The solicitor and the law firm were disqualified from acting for the petitioner in the action. Because two years had lapsed further examinations were appropriate and an order issued for the petitioner to attend a further examination. If the updated information is not necessary for trial the petitioner may request costs at that time. The application for an order with respect to without prejudice offers of settlement was dismissed as matters of evidence were to be determined by the trial judge.  1)Since the decision in Martin v. Gray the Law Society amended the code of conduct to provide for rules where a member transfers from one law firm to another. 2)The difficulty in this case was that no measures were taken prior to or at the time the solicitor joined the firm to ensure confidentiality. The time period before taking appropriate steps was completely inadequate.  3)The second question, whether there was a risk that the confidential information will be used to the prejudice of the client, Martin v. Gray stated that once the presumption arises and is not rebutted, the lawyer's disqualification is automatic and no assurances or undertakings not to use the information will avail. 4)The respondent was awarded the costs of the motion fixed at $300."
"This was an appeal pursuant to s. 51 of The League of Educational Administrators, Directors and Superintendents Act from the decisions of the Discipline Committee, and the Executive Committee of the League which found the appellant guilty of professional misconduct. The Discipline Committee recommended that the appellant be transferred. The matter of sentence was dealt with by the executive committee of LEADS in August 1995 and the appellant received a reprimand (to be placed on his file for a period of 5 years) and a fine of $2,500. The discipline committee chose to accept the evidence of the appellant over that of the applicant. This was a finding of credibility which was amply supported by the evidence. Allowing the appeal, that the discipline committee erred in its determination of fact as set forth in s. 3, 4 and 6 of the notice of appeal, and in its application of the burden of proof, which is the highest possible standard applicable to a civil case, as it did in this case.","A Director was charged with professional misconduct for coercing the resignation of two principals in his school division. The Discipline Committee found the appellant guilty of misrepresenting the school process report involving the first principal and of threatening the other principal that if he did not apply for a transfer and resign the matter would be dealt with at the board table and that 'it could get ugly'. The Executive Committee of LEADS issued a reprimand to be placed on his file for five years and a fine of $2,500. At issue was whether the Discipline Committee erred in its findings of fact and the burden of proof, whether the facts, if true, constituted professional misconduct and whether the penalty imposed was excessive. HELD: Appeal dismissed.  1)The legislation does not appear to call for a change in the traditional approach. The fact that an appellate judge can substitute his or her decision for that of the Discipline Committee or order of an executive does not mean that the appellate court's view of the facts and credibility of witnesses supercedes in any way the role of the Discipline Committee unless it finds there were inappropriate inferences drawn, conclusions reached which were not supported by the evidence, or a misdirection on a point of law. None were found in either case. The Discipline Committee did not err in its interpretation of 'professional misconduct' or its application to the facts.  2)Section 52 of the LEADS Act and s62 of the Medical Profession Act, 1981 are virtually the same except for minor changes in wording and format. The jurisprudence under the Medical Profession Act was applicable to the standard of review in this case. 3)The penalty imposed was not wrong or unjustified. Section 47 of the LEADS Act gives the Executive Committee wide latitude in the nature of punishment that it may impose upon a person found guilty of professional misconduct. The Executive is not bound by the recommendations of the Discipline Committee. They are only guidelines. 4)The Act is silent as to who shall bear costs of providing the documents filed pursuant to s51(2) of the Act. If the legislature had intended the statutorily mandated costs to be costs in the cause it would have said so. LEADS should bear the costs in this case. In any event pursuant to the court's inherent jurisdiction and pursuant to s52 of the Act the costs of providing the materials were to be borne by the respondent. 5)Subject to the above the respondent was entitled to costs of and incidental to the appeal.ADDENDUM to TWL QB96220. The concluding paragraph was amended to read: Subject to what has been stated in the immediately preceding paragraph hereof, the respondent will be entitled to recover its costs of, and incidental to this appeal, from the appellant, to be taxed on Column 3."
"FIAT. The applicant applied for an order pursuant to s63 of the Personal Property Security Act for a declaration that the agreement between the parties was a security agreement within the definition of the personal property security act and s18 of the Limitation of Civil Rights Act that the respondent as lessor was limited to a lien upon the articles sold only, notwithstanding any contrary agreement; an Order that funds currently held in trust for the action be returned to the applicant. HELD: The application was dismissed. The proper forum to have the issues raised in this matter determined was the forum to which the action was commenced by the respondent. 1)The lease was a true lease as opposed to a'security' lease and denied the applicability of s18(1) of the Act and argued it would be inequitable to invoke it. The respondent did not take issue with the repossession. 2)The application was misconceived. This court lacks the jurisdiction to grant the relief requested under Part V of The Personal Property security Act. The application is simply an attempt to end run the action which has been commenced.","FIAT. The applicant sought an order pursuant to s63 of the Personal Property Security Act (PPSA) declaring that the agreement between the parties was a security agreement within the definition of the Personal Property Security Act rather than a lease and that the respondent was limited to a lien pursuant to s18 of the Limitation of Civil Rights Act; and an order that funds paid into court pursuant to a pre-judgment garnishee summons be returned to the applicant. The respondent seized the vehicle and issued a statement of claim for $5,330.81 as arrears of lease payments. The applicant had made payments for several months and acknowledged that she was in default on the payments for the tractor-trailer unit but contended the agreement was not a lease and that the respondent, having repossessed the collateral, was not now entitled to claim any additional payments. HELD: The application was dismissed. Costs in the cause. 1)The relief sought did not fall within any of the wording of s63(2) of the Personal Property Security Act and therefore there was no jurisdiction to grant the relief requested. The application was simply an attempt to end run the action commenced by the respondent. 2)The applicant was not seeking to remedy a wrong with respect to the seizure or preservation of the collateral but was seeking a remedy pursuant to the Limitations of Civil Rights Act. The proper forum was to have the issues determined in the action commenced by the respondent."
"FIAT. An application for determination of whether the defendant is liable for s. 86(1) of the Highway Traffic Act for personal injuries sustained while in the care of an infant or whether the co-defendant is immune from liability by s. 228 of The Education Act for the personal injuries suffered by the infant. HELD: 1)The first issue was whether the school board was immune from Liability by s8(1)) of the Education Act or whether it was immune by s2(1). In the event the school was not liable and the co -defendant was not the owner of the vehicle, the school could have commenced an action against the employer. 2)The second issue was the question of liability. The Education act provides that a negligent teacher is granted immunity from liability if the owner is not liable. The teacher's immunity only applies to the owner. The argument that the Education act is a general statute dealing with teacher's liability and immunity in a general way was rejected. The second issue on appeal was whether Edith was immune as a teacher from liability under s8 of the Health and Safety Act because she was the teacher within the meaning of s228. The school board could not find in favour of the board. 3)There was no apparent conflict between the statutes. The legislation provided that a teacher is only liable if the teacher had acted within the scope of s8. The only person liable for the injury was the school teacher. The evidence was that the teacher was immune under s2 of the Act. The facts were that the co'sdefendant had immunity under s.86(1 of the HTSA for the motor vehicle accident. The School Board was not entitled to sue the employer for negligence. 4)The question of whether Ed was immune was whether applied to the co.defendant's liability under the EducationAct or not. The board was ordered to consider Thompson v. Board of Education, 1967 CanLII 430 (SK QB), 60 W.W.R. 513 (Sask. C.A.).","FIAT. An application pursuant to Rule 188 for a determination of whether the defendant was liable pursuant to s86(1) of the Highway Traffic Act for the personal injuries of the infant plaintiff or was immune from liability by virtue of s228 [now s232] of the Education Act. The second point of law to be determined was whether the co-defendant as car owner was liable if the driver was found to be immune from liability. The motor vehicle accident occurred while the infant plaintiff was being transported during a field trip, approved by the defendant school board, and the defendant was the teacher. HELD: 1)The teacher/driver was acting within the scope of her duties and was immune from liability by virtue of the Education Act. 2)The owner was only liable to the same extent as the driver. The reasoning in Neault was directly on point. Just as the Workers' Compensation Act and the Highway Traffic Act prevent the injured worker from suing the owner of the vehicle because he is prevented from suing the driver, the Education Act extends the same immunity to the owner as it does to the driver by operation of s86(1) of the Highway Traffic Act. 3)There was no apparent conflict between the statutes. When read together, the legislation provides that a negligent teacher is granted immunity from liability if the teacher has acted within the scope of the Education Act. The Traffic Act is the general statute, governing liability of all drivers. The Court did not agree with the School Board's analysis that the Education Act was the general statute. 4)The injured plaintiff was not denied a party to sue for negligent operation of a vehicle as he had recourse against the school board and its insurer. The immunity under the Education Act only applies to teachers and principals."
"The defendants applied to compel responses to a large number of questions that were objected to at examinations for discovery of proper officers on behalf of Saskatchewan Property Management Corporation (SPMC). They sought an order requiring SPMC to comply with numerous undertakings. The plaintiffs had issued a statement of claim for damages in excess of $7,000,000 resulting from a fire which broke out in the Kelsey Campus in January 1997. The defendants were advised that the plaintiffs were not there when the fire first started and that they were not entitled to the names of possible expert witnesses. When asked what portion of the wall had been covered by a fire stop, the respondent conceded that the answer was 'the northeast corner of the Tower.' That is exactly the sort of information that litigation privilege is designed to protect. Objection No. 6-P. 297, Line 26 to P. 300, Line 1) The question asked was what observations were made of the damage post fire, the damage to the roof and its... and the attic that would connect the point of breakout to the point where Hagblom were operating or were working. The answer appears to be asking for the plaintiffs' expert opinion on a burn pattern. The question is too vague to answer In an application of this nature proper foundation must be laid in the context of specific questions asked and answers given or not given (Hill v. Board of Education). The plaintiffs' objection that the defendants were really asking for an expert opinion would seem to be borne out by the portion of testimony that was provided by the plaintiff. HELD: The plaintiffs were entitled to all relevant facts but not opinions. They are entitled to know what was observable to anybody looking at the wall where the Soprema was applied not to an expert's interpretation of what was actually observable, for example what chemical change took place. Those are not factual questions. The observations, the factual observations made in the report of January 31, 1997 are privileged. The only thing that could be said to constitute discoverability is whether the plaintiffs received the statements during the course of their investigation. If not, they are privileged and the defendants will have the opportunity to examine the City of Saskatoon in the third party claim. 1) There must be some reasonable degree of specificity to a question of that nature when reference is made to document. The Court was unable to see why a party to an action should be required to accept or reject an opinion of another party to the action. 2) The plaintiff was not required to answer the question posed by the defendant. 3","The defendants brought an application to compel responses to a large number of questions objected to at examinations for discovery of the proper officer for SPMC, and sought an order requiring SPMC to comply with numerous undertakings. The objections were categorized as the questions sought to elicit the plaintiff's manner of investigation or expert opinions; it should have been asked of another witness better suited to answer or third parties as the questions relate to issues between the defendant and the third parties; it was irrelevant or improper. HELD: 1)The plaintiffs were not required to answer questions which would require them to accept or reject an opinion of another party to the action. 2)The plaintiffs should answer what cellulose fibre insulation was present at the time of the fire. 3)The affidavit answered whether Miner was a participant in the investigation notwithstanding the defendants are not entitled to the names of possible expert witnesses at the discovery stage. 4)Any meeting between the plaintiff's investigators and the fire marshal clearly related to its investigation and is privileged. The defendants could obtain the information directly from the fire marshal. 5)The question of whether there was any liaison between the city fire investigator and SIAST was improper as it relates to the manner of investigation. Questions can be asked of the city. 6)Details of the plaintiff's investigation, including an engineer's report, was protected by litigation privilege. 7)The question regarding what observations were made of the damage was too vague. The plaintiff's claim was in excess of $7 million. A proper foundation must be laid in the context of specific questions and answers given or not given (Hill v. Arcola School Division). The defendants are not entitled to expert opinion. 8)Whether SPMC's insurer's investigation team participated related to manner of investigation and was therefore privileged. 9)The defendant will be able to examine the city in the third party claim with respect to documents from the fire department. 10)All discussions at mediation proceedings are strictly confidential. The name of the plaintiff's expert, who prepared the drawings in contemplation of litigation, is privileged. 11)The facts and observations upon which expert opinions are based must be disclosed including any photographs.  12)Whether any pattern on the wood would indicate contact by propane flame required expert opinion. 13)Questions concerning what material first ignited could only be answered by having experts reconstruct what in their opinion occurred at the time the fire started. 14)If the plaintiffs do not have a position (on whether there was a fire stop in the 1967 construction of the tower), there is no rule the court is aware of requiring them to adopt a position. They can be required to give an undertaking to provide a position if they adopt one at a later date. Whether they believed the building was built in accordance with the 1960 fire code when constructed in 1967 was information obtainable by the defendants. 15)If the party being examined had no control over or greater access to a witness than the examining party, it need only disclose the evidence known to it. There is no obligation to seek information from third parties when the defendants are capable of obtaining that information. 16)An undertaking was given to advise if and when the plaintiffs develop a position on whether the parapet roof was constructed in accordance with the detail set out in FC and whether the detail in the sketch of the Tower parapet was correct. 17)If the request for the proposal related to Kelsey, the document should be produced, but if it only related to the Regina campus, the document was not relevant. 18)Whether it was considered anytime that Hagblom would be a sub-consultant was a legal question. The trial judge will interpret the terms of the agreement. 19)Any information required could be obtained directly from the architects who had been added as third parties by the defendants.  20)The plaintiffs gave undertakings to answer the other questions and did not object to answering them. 21)The 36 objections (less 3 that were withdrawn) failed. It would be an abuse of process for the defendants to ask the same question of a second officer hoping to obtain a different answer. The same question can be put if the first did not answer it. The fact there were three separate officers does not restrict the defendants to only asking certain questions of each. The reason for having three officers, each with a different expertise in a certain area, was to prevent the plaintiffs from having to give endless undertakings. Having all three present during each examination would have saved time and unnecessary legal fees. 22)The exhibit was not before the court to determine how complicated the question was. Defence counsel was to break it down. 23)There were 200 undertakings. As a general rule examinations for discovery should be completed before the party being examined is required to comply with the undertakings. It would lead to endless delay if the examining party were allowed to simply adjourn and demand the undertakings be complied with. There were no exceptional circumstances.  24)Costs were left to the trial judge."
"The Attorney General applies to strike out the plaintiff's claims on the grounds that they are barred by certain statutes or alternatively that the Court has no jurisdiction over any cause of action relating to an alleged intentional tort committed by a Crown servant or employee prior to May 14, 1953. The plaintiff claims that he was physically assaulted and that he lost his traditional language and culture approximately 50 years ago, when he was attending the Qu'Appelle Residential School near Lebret, Saskatchewan (the 'Residential School'). The Attorney General argues that the twelve month limitation period in s. 2(1)(a) of the Liability and Proceedings Act applies to claims arising from acts occurring before the proclamation of the Crown Liability Act in May 1953.HELD: 1) The language of s. 24(1) is clear and its meaning unambiguous. Even if the time limitation in the POPA applies only to claims based upon the torts of its officers and servants, both negligent and intentional, the plaintiff has no right to bring the action within and of the Court's jurisdiction to determine whether the plaintiff can satisfy the requirements of discoverability. 2) The law is clear that the plaintiff cannot pursue a claim against the Federal Crown for the intentional torts committed by its servants and officers in May or June 1953. 3) Intentional torts occurring prior to that time is a factual matter to be dealt with at trial.  4) Although Hogg and Monahan review the history of Crown liability for intentional torture, the same argument was rejected in [R.J.G.] v. Attorney General of Canada (Attorney General), [2001] 1 S. 6.1, at paras. 12 and 31. 5) There is no agreement on the facts and the Attorney General does not argue that the claims should be struck on the basis of his own pleadings. It should therefore be left to the trial judge to determine if the plaintiff is able to satisfy that requirement.","The Attorney General applied to strike out the plaintiff's claims on the grounds they are statute-barred by virtue of the LAA s.3 and that all the claims except for trespass to person are not exempted by s.3(3.1); by POPA s.2; alternatively, the Court has no jurisdiction over any cause of action relating to intentional torts committed by a Crown servant or employee prior to May 14, 1953; all claims arising from the conduct of two deceased Sisters who died in 1988 and 1993 are barred by the TA and SAA. The plaintiff claimed he was physically assaulted by employees and staff and suffered the loss of his traditional language and culture between 1944 and 1952 while attending the Qu'Appelle Residential School. The AG acknowledged the plaintiff attended the school from 1946 until 1949. The AG in a previous application was granted leave to amend its statement of defence and third party claim to plead and rely upon the Crown Liability and Proceedings Act; Limitations of Actions Act ss.31(d),(h) and (j); Public Officers' Protection Act; Trustee Act s.59, or its predecessor legislation Survival of Actions Act s.10; Crown Liability Act s.3(1)(a) and the Exchequer Court Act s.19. A third party claim against the Oblats alleging they controlled and operated the residential school at all material times, was not relevant on this application. HELD: 1)The claim based on physical assault by the Sisters was struck. The Court has no jurisdiction over any cause of action relating to intentional torts committed by a Crown servant or employee prior to May 14, 1953. The Crown remains immune from claims for trespass, assault and battery committed by servants and officers before the enactment of the Crown Liability Act in 1953 (renamed the Crown Liability and Proceedings Act in 1990), which did not operate retroactively. The LAA s.3(3.1) does not create a cause of action but simply removes statutory time limitation periods barring otherwise existing actions. Before May 14, 1953 the Crown was subject to claims for negligence pursuant to the Exchequer Court Act s.19(c). The Dyson procedure is available in Canada in every jurisdiction except New Brunswick and Nova Scotia. 2)The claim based on negligence is subject to the two year time limitation prescribed by LAA s.3(1)(d) which must calculated having regard to the principles of discoverability. 3)The claims of breach of trust and breach of fiduciary duty are equitable claims subject to the six year time limitation in LAA ss.3(1)(h) which explicitly begins to run from the discovery of the cause of action (PG v. AG Canada). Relevant factual issues are to be dealt with at trial. 4)Even though the claim in trespass is based on acts alleged to have occurred over 50 years ago, it clearly falls within the class of actions contemplated by LAA s.3(3.1)(b)(ii). As such it is also exempted from any limitation period against others liable for the conduct. 5)The argument that the 12 month limitation period in POPA s.2(1)(a) should be applied in priority to the more general provisions of the LAAA was rejected in RJG v. AG Canada. 6)Claims based on direct liability of the Crown for negligence, breach of trust and fiduciary duty are not affected by time limitation periods applicable to the deceased Sister Greyeyes and her estate. The time limitation periods are abrogated by LAA s.3(3.2). Since there is no limitation period barring an action against the Sister or her estate, there can be no provincial limitation period available to the Federal Crown under CLPA s.24. 7)The other claims made directly against the Federal Crown are not affected by limitation periods applicable to Sister Elle or her estate. SAA ss.5 and 10(1),(3) and (4) do not bar the claims against her.  LAA s.3(3.2) abrogates the time limitation in SAA s.10(3)(b)."
"The parties were married in 1996 and had previously been divorced in 1993. There are no children of their relationship. The only issue on this hearing is the respondent's claim for lump sum spousal support. The parties agree all property has been divided to their respective mutual satisfaction and an outstanding debt of approximately 34,000 krona is their joint responsibility. The respondent is working part-time and the court is satisfied having regard to her education and obvious desire to remain in Sweden that lump sum payment is preferable to periodic payments in these circumstances. HELD: The respondent will pay $10,000 to the respondent by way of lump sum support. 1) The court has jurisdiction to grant a support order as an incident to divorce. Periodic payments are the norm. However, it is only when a lump sum is the proper vehicle for providing support or when lump sums are necessary to put a person in a particular position that such an award should be made. 2) There is a need on the part of the respondent, she is entitled to support, and there is capacity in the Court to pay support. 3) The respondent's evidence of intention to return to Sweden and the very high costs of her stay in Sweden are sufficient for the court to fix an amount to be contributed by the petitioner.","In a divorce proceeding, the wife claimed lump sum spousal support in the amount of $20,000 to allow her to return to her native country. She also claimed that periodic maintenance was not appropriate because of the difficulty of enforcement when she is living abroad and referenced two occasions when the husband was paying periodic support that she had to seek the assistance of Maintenance Enforcement. The husband opposed paying any more spousal support but expressed a preference for lump sum support if he was required to pay more, as it would allow him to move on with his life with his new family. Husband ordered to pay a lump sum award of $10,000 to wife; when the parties moved to Nova Scotia, the husband was able to improve his financial situation, while the wife's position deteriorated."
The applicant sought a taxation of the accounts that it issued to the respondent. The respondent opposed the applicant's application for an order granting interim possession of the matrimonial home and interim custody of the child of the marriage to her estranged husband. The applicant argued that to limit cross-examination in this manner would constitute a breach of natural justice. She also alleged that the respondent was negligent in the execution of a court order that granted interim exclusive possession. The Respondent argued that she would need exactly double that amount of time to complete her questioning. HELD: The applicant's motion for recusal was granted. 1)The applicant was properly advised of the time available to cross-examine her. 2)There was no indication whatsoever of overbilling whether with respect to the appellant's legal accounts or the respondent's. 3)The respondent was entirely unsuccessful in establishing negligence on the part of the appellant. The appellant freely admitted (without any prompting) that she was convicted of the criminal charges laid against her. Those convictions obviously weighed on her credibility. The trial judge's evidence regarding her retainer was more than sufficient to allow the appellant to canvass the issue. There was no evidence of vexatious questioning by the respondent prior to the commencement of the trial.,"The applicant law firm applied for a taxation of accounts in a complicated family law matter. The client contended that there was obvious overbilling and that the solicitor was negligent in failing to specify in an interim Order the actual time at which she had to leave the matrimonial home. Accounts as presented are certified; there was no indication whatsoever of overbilling, whether with respect to legal fees or disbursements, and there was no negligence on the part of the solicitor as she had acted reasonably in relying on the representations of the husband's lawyer as to when the Order would be enforced. It is not always necessary to examine every single entry in detail on a line-by-line basis; an overall view of the entries contained in an account can be taken when assessing reasonableness. The temporal limitation of cross-examination is within the Small Claims Court's scope of discretion in special circumstances."
"The three respondents pled guilty to three offences: trafficking in cocaine for the benefit of, at the direction of, or in association with a criminal organization, to be served concurrently, plus a 10 year fire arms prohibition; and conspiring together and with others to traffick in cocaine contrary to s. 5(1) of the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act and s. 465(1)(c) for the other counts. They were also made subjects to DNA orders and there was an order of forfeiture of a vehicle. The Crown appealed the sentences, arguing that the sentencing judge failed to give proper effect to the gravity of the offences, particularly in light of the volume of trafficking, lengthy period of time over which it had taken place, the highly dangerous nature of the substances sold, which included crack cocaine, the fact that they were working for a criminal organisation and the fact their motivation was financial gain. Appeal allowed; the total sentence in each case is 30 months, 5 months having already been served; the sentence in both cases is 30 to 35 months imprisonment for the trafficking charge and 1 year consecutive for the substances prohibition under s. 467.12. The respondents all worked 12 hours a day and rotated their shifts so that the phone and delivery car were being operated 24 hours per day, seven days per week. They all earned a lot and were doing well in the community despite the high cost of living. The Court found that the sentence imposed on the three respondents, taking into account their ages, the personal circumstances of the respondents, and the aggravating factors of their offence, was demonstrably unfit in light that the offences were carried on in furtherance of criminal organization. The total sentence imposed in this case was 30 months in the Canadian Court of Appeal, 30 months for each of the last two counts and one year consecutive in the criminal organization offence, for a total of 30 months imprisonment.","The three respondents pled guilty to three offences: trafficking in cocaine for the benefit of, or at the direction of, or in association with a criminal organization contrary to s. 467.12 of the Criminal Code; conspiring together and with others to traffic in cocaine contrary to s. 5(1) of the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act and s. 465(1)(c) of the Criminal Code; and trafficking in cocaine contrary to s. 5(1) of the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act. On the last two counts, each was sentenced to 1 year less a day to be served in the community on each count, to be served concurrently, plus a 10 year fire arms prohibition. On the first count, each was sentenced to serve 1 year, in the community, consecutive to the sentences for the other counts. They were also subjected to DNA orders and there was an order of forfeiture of a vehicle belonging to a third party. The Crown appealed these sentences on the grounds that the sentencing judge failed to give proper effect to the gravity of these offences. The Court weighed all the evidence and circumstances of the accused, and found the sentencing judge was clearly moved by the personal circumstances of the accused and while they are mitigating and would normally justify a sentence at the low end of the range, it was the Court's view that the sentencing judge gave them undue weight in comparison to the principles of denunciation and general deterrence, which must play a significant role in offences of this nature. The Court further stated the 1 year sentence for the trafficking offence, to be served in the community, was demonstrably unfit given the range of sentences established in other cases of trafficking offences, even after taking into account the mitigating personal circumstances of these offenders. The Court found the sentences must be set aside. The Court found that an appropriate sentence for each of the respondents, taking into account the seriousness of the offences, the personal circumstances of the respondents, and the aggravating nature of the offences pursuant to s. 467.12, would be 18 months, concurrent, for each of the last two counts, and 1 year consecutive for the criminal organization offence, for a total of 30 months imprisonment. HELD: The total sentence in each case is 30 months, 5 months having already been served."
"The plaintiffs sought a stay pending their appeal of a certification order in a class action. The defendants had not filed notice of defence and, pursuant to s. 4(6) of the Act, were not required to do so until 45 days after the certification order was issued. As part of their appeal, they brought a motion for stay on the basis that every cause of action advanced and remedy sought would be contested. They also sought an award of costs. Motion dismissed; there is no evidence that this will happen. The Court of Appeal will consider the merits of the Province's arguments and will not analyse the fine points of the defendants' submissions or the respondents' reply. Civil Procedure Rule 1.01 says that the 'object of these Rules is for the just, speedy, and inexpensive determination of every proceeding.' This appeal does not involve a summary judgment motion that would dismiss the claims outright, in any form, against the Province. Rather, the appeal seeks to strike the Certification Order for common issues trial in class proceeding. If the certification is struck, the Province will still face individual claims, first filed in 2004, involving similar issues. The expense of defending individual actions, whether litigated serially or jointly, might exceed the expense defending common issue trial in a CLASS proceeding. One purpose of class proceeding is to try common issues once, instead of repeatedly, which delivers an expense efficiency to both sides. If certification is not struck, that efficiency may be inapplicable to these claims. The Province has offered no evidence on the point that establishes how defending individual action would cost the Province less than defending one common issues trials. It has not established the prerequisites for stay of an enforceable order of the Supreme Court.",", motion denied. While the province has an arguable appeal, it does not concern a summary judgment motion that would result in the claims being dismissed outright. If the certification order is struck, the province will still face individual claims. The AG has not shown that defending individual actions will cost less than defending one class proceeding. There is no evidence to estimate how it may incur significantly higher expenses as a result of how the points at issue in the appeal are resolved. The matter has been ongoing for some time and it is reasonable to expect the province has already spent time and money to prepare the defence they will eventually file. To succeed on this basis, the court would require a reliable indication of what remains to be done during the stay period, what component of that residue would be wasted if the appeal is allowed, and some estimate of that cost."
"The defendant filed a motion to dismiss discovery subpoenas issued to its witnesses. The motion was allowed and the order granted included a direction as to the manner of discovery. The defendant argued that the issuance of the subpoenas was an improper and mistaken use of discovery subpoena and that the discovery process was in breach of the Rules. The plaintiff sought to increase the tariff for party/party costs by $500 as it alleged that the defendant's representative was excluded from the discovery hearing and that there would be further unreasonable delays. Defendant seeks to increase costs on a solicitor/client basis. The parties positions on discovery, when they would be held and in particular the order in which the witnesses will be examined were entrenched. The case law is applicable in that corporate defendant has a right to be represented at discovery. On the merits, whether there was implicit agreement regarding the discovery in July, when this agreement fell through, the plaintiff became frustrated and became concerned about further delay resulting in the discovery examination. In exercising the inherent jurisdiction of the court, the court reviewed the factors in increasing costs. The court found that the actions of the defendant in seeking to exclude its representative were improper, mistaken and unnecessary. It ordered further increases in the tariff range as necessary to protect credibility. Further increases were ordered in the amount of $1,000 for party-party costs in the range of $500 given in the decision of the parties.","The parties agreed on discovery dates and the order in which witnesses would be discovered. As a result of an honest error, the defendant wasn't able to attend the original dates. The plaintiff became frustrated and concerned about further delays. While the defendant was making good faith efforts to resolve the discovery issues (including whether its witnesses should be excluded from attending discovery of the plaintiff's witnesses), the plaintiff's lawyer issued discovery subpoenas to compel the defendant's witnesses to appear, making the exclusion issue moot. The defendant moved to have the subpoenas dismissed, and sought solicitor and client costs on the motion. The defendant argued the subpoenas were improper and an abuse of process, and accused the plaintiff's lawyer of making unwarranted attacks against the defendant's lawyer in his pre-hearing brief. The motion was heard over approximately one-half day. Motion granted. The plaintiff will pay total costs of $2,550 (plus disbursements) to the defendant, consisting of $1,500 in party and party costs under Tariff C and $1,050 in solicitor and client costs. The tariff amount of $1,000 is increased by $500 to reflect the fact the issuance of the subpoenas was an improper step, albeit one falling short of an abuse of process. It required the defendant to bring this motion to strike. The plaintiff was given a chance to withdraw the subpoenas and chose not to. Solicitor and client costs were warranted especially in light of the defendant's lawyer's language, which was unduly harsh and unnecessarily strong. His allegations added a layer of complexity and seriousness to the case, which caused the defendant to spend extra time preparing a response. Lawyers are officers of the court and the court must encourage them to use courtesy, respect and professionalism."
"The offender pled guilty to committing an aggravated assault on his common-law partner contrary to s.268 of the Criminal Code. The Crown applied under Part XXIV of the Code to have him declared a dangerous offender. The offender is 52 years old and with a significant criminal record. The Court has jurisdiction to entertain the dangerous offender application because it entered the conviction against the offender and prior to him being sentenced. The application was made following the conviction of the offender (1995) and before he was sentenced to a long-term offender designation. The grounds upon which it was made were that the offender was born to a stable 'traditional Austrian family' where no drugs, alcohol or violence were prevalent. He required surgery as a child to have a heart valve repaired and in 2008 he had a stroke. He is 46 years old. He has a high risk to re-offend violently in the future and this risk will be mitigated only if he conscientiously applies himself to learning alternative ways of venting his frustration and anger. HELD: The Court held that it was an absolute necessity that the respondent seriously addresses his alcohol abuse problem and makes a commitment to sobriety for the remainder of his life. If he refused, his risk for violence would rise to a high level. It was concluded that he was high risk, high need and that he should be given the opportunity to more thoroughly investigate his functioning. The respondent was remanded for a period not exceeding 60 days to be assessed. He was ordered to remain in custody for 30 days to make an assessment. The court found that it would be appropriate for the respondent to have more than one day detention per day for each day of his incarceration.","The Crown applied under Part XXIV of the Criminal Code to have the accused declared a dangerous offender after he pled guilty to committing an aggravated assault on his common-law spouse contrary to s. 268 of the Code. The application is based on the Code provisions in effect before the danger offender legislation set forth in The Tackling Violent Crime Act was passed. The accused is 52 years old and in poor health. He has a significant criminal record thatreveals a history of violence and an inability to abide by court orders. The offences occurred between the time he was 40 and ended in 2006 with his last conviction, the predicate offence. Two psychologists prepared psychological assessments both of which concluded that the offender should not be declared a dangerous offender because his risk to re-offend could be reasonably managed by supervision in the community. The issues before the Court were: 1) whether the predicate offence is a serious personal injury offence as defined by s. 752 of the Code; 2) whether the offender is a threat of the kind contemplated by s. 753 of the Code and thus a danger to society; 3) if so, whether the Court should exercise its residual discretion an impose a fixed-term sentence or resort to long-term offender provisions, even though the statutory criteria for declaring the accused a dangerous offender have been met; and if a long-term offender designation is warranted, what determinate sentence and long-term supervision order should be imposed? HELD: 1) The Court held that the aggravated assault committed by the offender was a serious personal injury offence because it was an indictable offence involving the use of violence against his spouse. 2) The Court found that the Crown had proven the criteria required that the offender clearly fits within the definition set forth in ss. 753(1)(a)(i) and (ii), in that this offender had shown a repetitive and persistent pattern of aggressive behavior, especially against women. 3) The Court decided to exercise its residual discretion not to designate the offender as a dangerous offender and found that the he met the long-term offender criteria and that his risk to re-offend could be managed within the meaning of s. 753.1(1)(c). The offender has never been imprisoned in a penitentiary and thus had never had the benefit of programming offered in that system. The appropriate sentence should be 7 years. As the offender has spent approximately 3 years and 4 months in pre-sentence custody, the Court gave him credit in that amount on a one-to-one basis. The Court ordered that the appropriate length of time for a long term supervision order is the maximum of 10 years since the offender needs to learn alternative ways to express his frustration and address his issues with alcohol."
"The accused was charged with possession of a controlled substance contrary to s. 5(2) of the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act. He was committed to stand trial on the noted offence of trafficking. At the preliminary hearing, the accused failed to complete any of the steps outlined in his previous order and had not made any attempt to inquire into a loan or home equity line of credit. He applied to have court appointed counsel appointed to his trial because he was not able to afford it. The application was dismissed. The accused now applies in this Court for Court appointed counsel because he is unable to afford counsel. Although there are financial encumbrances against the home, nonetheless there is the equity which is there and there is no reason why he could not obtain some funds from the equity in his home.HELD: The accused's application for court appoint counsel is dismissed. 1) The Court was satisfied from the information and material placed before me that the accused is probably not capable of conducting his own defence in light of the personal issues he is facing and his methamphetamine addiction. 2) It is important to provide a reasonable window of time for the accused to start to make arrangements with counsel. He has not demonstrated the requisite circumstance of being indigent as outlined in R. v. Rowbotham. 3) There are two germane criteria an accused must demonstrate in order to qualify for court appointed legal counsel: that he can afford counsel but is legitimately unable to pay lawyer; and that representation of the accused essential to a fair trial. However, this has not occurred to the accused. He comes before this Court in the same position as he was on the earlier occasion without having attempted in any way to utilize his personal resources to obtain counsel. Nonetheless, he seeks an order for court- appointed counsel for the purposes of conduct his defence on the indictment.",The Court dismissed the application. It found that the accused was not capable of representing himself but that the accused had not shown that he was indigent.
"The respondent father applied to reduce his child support obligation and to extinguish arrears of child support as a result of him quitting his job and embarking on an apprenticeship program to become an electrician. The petitioner mother applied to become the sole custodian parent of the parties two children, who are now eight and nine years of age.HELD: The application to vary child support was granted and the respondent father was granted significant costs of the application. The court was unable to find that there had been a material change in circumstances as required to vary the existing order and the petitioner's application was dismissed.",HELD: The court dismissed both applications. The respondent’s voluntary decision to significantly reduce his income was insufficient grounds to vary his child support application. The court found that there had not been a material change in the circumstances with regard to the petitioner’s application.
"The medical doctor appeals from decision of the Practitioner Staff Appeals Tribunal (Tribunal). The original suspension was done wrongfully and precipitously, and ultimately the Tribunal made fatal errors when dealing with this matter pursuant to statutory appeal. The appellant's evidence is that all options were reviewed with CC, who elected to pursue a particular course of treatment. This was done appropriately, as during the treatment of the uterine rupture, requiring remedial steps to safeguard the mother's welfare. The respondent operates health care facilities including hospitals including the appellant's. To do so, those doctors must first obtain privileges under the respondent's Bylaws, which require every health authority to make a bylaw governing the practitioner staff covering, inter alia, privileges and the matters in issue in the within appeals. The s. 45 appeal to tribunal is a de novo appeal hearing. It is not an appeal on the record. Curial deference is not owed and the tribunal may (indeed, must) take its own view of the evidence put before it and is not bound by the views of the Board. HELD: The Court finds that the Tribunal erred in finding that the appellant met the standard of care and that the errors lead to the granting of a remedy to the appellant, that of quashing the Tribunal's decision and full reinstatement of his privileges.  1) This case cannot be taken to be supportive of the suspension of the SMO. 2) There is no real nexus between this rare condition and other situations Dr. Abouhamra was called upon to manage in the course of his ob/gyn practice. The evidence from the Board and Tribunal is that the responses were accepted by the Tribunal and satisfied any concerns he might have had. Accordingly, the Tribunal suspended the appellant on an interim basis.  3) The Court concludes that the holding of critical incident review does not connote any wrongful act or omission on the part of any member of the patient care team. Rather, it is part of the process by which health authorities evaluate their delivery of care to determine if adequate standards are being met, or how things could be improved. The hearing should proceed in the same fashion as it proceeded before the Tribunal.","HELD: The appeal was granted on the basis of the first two grounds as well as others. The court quashed the tribunal’s decision and reinstated the appellant’s hospital privileges. The court reviewed the transcript of the tribunal’s hearing and its written decision. With regard to the first two issues, it found that the tribunal had erred in law in the following ways: 1) by failing to conduct a de novo hearing as required. It did not refer to the expert opinion submitted by the appellant as new evidence at the hearing; and 2) by failing to explain its decision. It did not refer to the new evidence nor did it state how it had reconciled the conflicting expert opinion evidence offered by the appellant and the respondent. It merely accepted the evidence of the SMO’s experts."
"The parties apply for partition and sale of lake front recreational property owned by them together with their brother. Each of the parties owns an undivided one quarter interest as tenants in common in the property. The property is located next door to another that until recently was the permanent residence of the parents. They are now separated and may have to be sold. The parties argue that the benefit and corresponding detriment must have occurred without juristic reason. They claim that Ronald, through the operation of the principle of unjust enrichment and resulting or constructive trusts, has contributed approximately $40,000 in materials and $40k in time to maintain and improve the property and that these improvements have added to the value of the Property. They also claim that the proceeds from the sale are over and above the contributions of the others. HELD: 1) The Court has a discretion to refuse partition under s. and s. 4. This opens the door to consider the manner in which the parties organized their relationship and whether an injustice has arisen that without equity cannot be remedied. 2) There are three elements that must be satisfied in order for a claim in unjust enrichment to succeed: there must be an enrichment of the defendant, corresponding deprivation of the plaintiff, and an absence of juristic reasons for the enrichment. The Court's Discretion Under the Act is limited to refusing partition when reasonable expectations and public policy are considered. This necessitates determining whether it is s. or s. which operates in these circumstances. If this case is governed by s. the application will be allowed as cannot see anything in the evidence that suggests that the Applicants are motived by malice or are being vexatious as those terms have been interpreted in Reed Reed (1985), [1993] SCC 10 (CanLII), [Ont. C.A.], [1995] SCR 269 (Qld) and [1996] SCBR 670 (QBR 670) in the sense that if it appears that a Sale of the Proceeds would be more beneficial to the parties then division of the property between them would not be sufficient reason to refuse the relief sought. In either case, if a sale is directed the court may or shall give all necessary or proper consequential directions. 3) There is no evidence that any of the above can be said to constitute juristic or constructive reasons for refusing a partition order. The application will have to go under the s.4(1) of the Act and not s.3(1).","HELD: The application was granted. The court ordered that the property be sold and the proceeds of sale take into account the amount necessary to protect the respondent father’s claim. The Partition Act, 1868 applies in the province. It did not allow the equitable principles of unjust enrichment and constructive trust to operate to create a proprietary interest. The court found that s. 4 of the Act applied, which provides a monetary remedy so that if the respondent father could establish entitlement to some amount for his maintenance and improvement costs, he would be protected for that amount for his costs."
"The appellant entered a guilty plea to a charge of aggravated assault contrary to s. 268(1) of the Criminal Code. The offence was committed at Joggins where the appellant fired shots at the parents of his estranged wife and brother-in-law, who was injured in the leg. The appellant contended the trial judge erred by placing undue emphasis on general deterrence and failing to adequately consider the circumstances of the offence and the offender. The Court granted leave to appeal and allowed the appeal by varying the sentence to twelve months incarceration. The other orders to continue were continued.","Appellant, who was intoxicated, fired shots at the mobile home where the parents of his estranged wife lived and at his brother-in-law, who was injured. 2 years less a day plus 2 years probation varied to 1 year incarceration with two year probation and firearm prohibition - trial judge placed undue emphasis on general deterrence and failed to adequately consider the special circumstances of the offender."
"The appellant plead guilty to the charge of slapping and striking an eight year old girl contrary to s. 266 of the Criminal Code. The Crown and the defence agreed that it was probably an instance where fine and probation order would create the necessary special deterrence and parental guidance the situation called for. The trial judge was however of the view that the conduct of the accused warranted a more severe penalty. HELD: The appeal was allowed and a sentence of 60 days intermittent was substituted for the sentence of 1 year. The probation order was to remain unchanged except to substitute the word 'approved' for'supervised' in the first condition.  1 year imprisonment was excessive. In addition, the appellant would lose his current employment opportunity. 2)The trial judge must have been influenced to a substantial degree by the lack of parenting skills displayed by the appellant in the way he mistreated and verbally abused the young girl in manner which was demeaning and destructive of her self image. As offensive as that conduct may be, a lack of parental skill does not constitute a criminal offence and the only thing that the appellant pleaded to was an assault which was not severe and produced no injury.",The accused pleaded guilty to a charge of assaulting his 8 year old stepdaughter by slapping her and striking her with a small paddle. The Crown and counsel for the accused agreed that a fine and probation would be appropriate. The trial judge sentenced him to 1 year in prison and 1 year's probation. He appealed his sentence. HELD: Appeal allowed. 1)The force applied was minimal and the child was not injured physically. 2)The sentence imposed would result in the accused losing his employment which would harm his dependents. 3)The Court reduced his sentence to 60 days intermittent.
"The plaintiff was granted an option to purchase land from the defendants. The option was exercised and a fee simple title was issued to him. The title was encumbered by caveats protecting the surface leases but there was no reference to the rent charge reserved or excluded by the option agreement. The land fell into the family of which the plaintiff was son, one who needed to expand his farming operation. HELD: The plaintiff's action was dismissed with costs. 1)It was repugnant that the court be called upon tovest in an interest which he had heretofore been freely recognized to be the property of another, both before and after receiving his transfer under The Land Titles Act. 2)The plaintiff had been put at a risk of being denied his rights under the terms of the Option agreement. He had been denied his right to rent on the land which had been previously his. 3)Discretion was exercised to protect the rights of the 'bona fide purchaser' (the 'owner of the interest in the land' as defined in the Act) who had been awarded the option. 4)The options were merged in the transfer and the issuance of a new, and for this purpose unencumbered title.","When Davidson, Sr. sold his farm to his son he retained the right to continue receiving the rentals arising from four surface leases which he had previously granted to oil companies in respect to producing oil wells. The son granted an option to purchase to the plaintiff which was exercised and a fee simple title was issued in 1973 subject to encumbrances including caveats protecting the surface leases. There was no reference to the rent charge reserved or excluded by the option agreement. The plaintiff asserted that whatever rights arose from the option agreement were merged in the transfer and effectively disappeared upon the registration of the transfer and the issuance of a new unencumbered title. HELD: Declaration denied. Plaintiff's action dismissed with costs. 1)The absence of a caveat protecting the rent charge has had no affect because of the plaintiff's continued ownership of the property.  2)Rarely, if ever, has there been a case where, as here, a purchaser has contracted to obtain the property under an instrument clearly accepting the unregistered equitable interest, then has obtained a fee simple title, then has permitted the unregistered interest to continue unimpeded for 15 years and then, perhaps tiring of the inconvenience of the lease and thinking that the money would be useful, has decided to seek an order of this Court terminating the other interest and directing that it be paid to him. His counsel made no suggestion that the plaintiff had a moral claim, it was purely an attempt to secure by legal means that which he had previously agreed to forego. This is a court of equity as well as a court of law and as such it is repugnant that the court be called upon to vest in an applicant an interest which he has heretofore freely recognized to be the property of another, both before and after receiving his transfer under The Land Titles Act. 3)It was apparent that there was no intention that the rent charge would be merged since it was recognized and allowed to continue for 15 years."
"The accused applied for an order pursuant to s.24(2) of the Charter of Rights for exclusion of evidence consisting of a knapsack and its contents. HELD: 1)The search was authorized by law and the manner in which it was carried out was reasonable. 2)The accused reasonably believed that the contents were evidence of a crime. It was neither unreasonable nor unlawful for him to search the premises. 3)Although the accused's Charter rights had been violated, this would not be a proper case to exclude the evidence under s.25(2). 4)The evidence was found to be in plain view and was found inadvertently. The evidence was excluded if it was not present at the time of the search. 5)The police were lawfully present in the premises when Sgt. Bell inadvertently found the knapsak and contents of its contents which were in plain sight.","Following the 'not guilty' pleas, both accused applied for an order pursuant to s. 24(2) of the Charter of Rights and Freedoms for exclusion of evidence consisting of a knapsack and its contents on the grounds that the knapsack and its contents were obtained in contravention of their rights to be secure from unreasonable search and seizure pursuant to s.8 of the Charter. HELD: The application to exclude evidence is denied. 1)The officers were lawfully present in the premises when Sergeant Bell inadvertently found the knapsack and its contents which were in plain view. He reasonably believed that the knapsack and the contents were evidence of a crime. Therefore it was neither unreasonable nor unlawful for him to seize these items. The search was authorized by law and the manner in which it was carried out was reasonable. 2)Even if the accused's rights under s.8 of the Charter had been violated this would not be a proper case to exclude the evidence under s.24(2) of the Charter. The fairness of the trial will not be affected by the admission of the evidence. The manner in which the search was conducted was neither abusive nor excessive. The evidence was in plain view and was found inadvertently. The admission of this evidence will not have an adverse effect upon the reputation of the administration of justice."
"The plaintiff sought a declaration of wrongful dismissal and damages including commissions and remuneration in lieu of reasonable notice, mental distress and punitive damages. The defence had not met the onus of establishing the plaintiff should have her prima facie entitlement to a jury trial denied. HELD: The application was dismissed. 1)The defendant had not shown cogent reasons why the plaintiff shouldn't be deprived of her right to a trial by jury. The issues that arise are questions of law rather than questions of fact. Where possible questions of facts should be separated from purely legal issues and such questions of truth should be left for the jury, the defendant has not met that onus. 2)The issue of whether there was just cause for the appellant's dismissal was eminently suited to assessment by jury, although specific issues such as those relating to damages could have been withdrawn from the jury notice.","This was an application by the defendant to strike the plaintiffs Notice of Trial With a Jury in a wrongful dismissal action. The notice had been outstanding for more than 10 months at the time the application was made, and a trial date had been set seven months prior to the application. Dismissing the application with costs, that, after a review of the law and the facts in this case, the defendant had not met the onus of establishing that the plaintiff should have her prima facie entitlement to a jury trial denied."
"A motion raised the question of the right of a corporate board to breach its undertaking to remain in a small community when it had taken advantage of the government-sponsored community bond program in order to establish itsbusiness. HELD: 1)The board was dominated by the original shareholders who were entitled to enough votes to exercise control of the board. The actions of the directors on the board had been high-handed and oppressive. The complainant was fully entitled to the assistance of the court in rectifying the matters complained of. 2)The applicant was ordered to take steps to consolidate its operations in Saskatoon with the intention of hiring new directors and directing the closure of the Saskatoon operation. If it was the will of the president and his wife, it may do so. 3)The Board was also ordered to withdraw from Saskatoon pending the appointment of a special director.","The question was whether a corporate board could breach its undertaking to remain in a small community when it had taken advantage of the government sponsored community bond program in order to establish its business. The Shareholders' Agreement obliged all shareholders to vote their shares so as to confirm the nominees of certain shareholders, thereby freezing the board composition without regard for its performance. As a result the board was dominated by the original Precision group of shareholders and even though the Government of Saskatchewan and Bondco were entitled to enough votes to exercise control of the company, they could not change the board and did not have the usual ways of enforcing their wishes. Members of Bondco were concerned that jobs were being obtained in Saskatoon at the expense of Rosetown jobs and the economic spin-offs expected from their $800,000 investment were not being realized in Rosetown due to the opening of the Saskatoon facility. An application was brought under s234 of the Business Corporations Act. They sought a restraining order enforcing the covenant, an order appointing new directors, an order of compensation for breach of contract and an order directing the closure of the Saskatoon operation and the return of company assets to Rosetown district unless Bondco granted written consent. HELD: It was ordered that 1)the Shareholders Agreement was amended deleting the offending paragraph concerning the Board of Directors and substituting a new paragraph; 2)certain provisions of the Articles of Continuance as amended were suspended until the Termination Date; 3)the present board was suspended pending the election of directors at a special meeting of shareholders; 4)the respondent was enjoined from moving its operations and from transferring or hiring employees at any place other than Rosetown District unless Bonco's written consent was filed with the Court. 5)The Chief Executive Officer was not displaced nor was the Saskatoon operation directed to be closed.  6)Bonco was entitled to its taxable costs against the individual respondents."
"This was an appeal from an assessment of damages flowing from the appellant's liability to the respondent in tort for negligently prepared financial statements upon which the respondent relied in deciding to purchase the shares of a business. The appellant was a businessman living in Port Hawkesbury and the numbered company was his vehicle used to acquire the company. The numbered company had a large inventory of parts and parts. It required a large capitalization to operate. The trial judge found that the appellant would not have purchased the company if he had known the true financial condition of the company at the time of the purchase. He therefore awarded direct damages of $200,000 to be paid over to Adams at the closing. In assessing consequential damages, the Court held that the trial judge had measured the loss on the footing that the respondent should be put in the position he would have been had the financial statements been correct. The Court awarded prejudgment interest for the loss of direct and consequential damages for 7 years.  It was impossible to perform that reconstruction. The award of direct damages was similar to that given by the learned trial judge.","This was an appeal from an assessment of $5,454,000 in damages resulting from the appellant's liability to the respondent in tort for negligently prepared financial statements upon which the respondent relied in deciding to purchase the shares of a business. The appellants appealed. They argued that the trial judge, by measuring the respondent's loss on the basis that he should be put in the position he would have been if the financial statements had been accurate, had applied the wrong test. Allowing the appeal reducing the damage award to $2,745,600, that the trial judge erred in the test he applied to the award of damages. The proper test is to put the respondent as far as possible in the position he would have been in if he had not invested in the company. The damages are the amount by which the actual value of the company was less than what the respondent paid at the time of purchase."
"This was an appeal for leave from a Worker's Compensation Appeals Tribunal decision which dismissed the appellant's appeal from the decision of the Hearing Officer finding that he was not entitled to temporary total disability payments under the Workers' Compensation Act. The appeal was limited to question as to the jurisdiction of the Tribunal and to the usual appellate deference to trier of fact. This Court in Doward, supra dealt with the standard of review by the Tribunal of decision of Hearing Officer at pp. 33-38, 160 N.S.R. (2d) 2. There is no reason to think that the Tribunal is any less expert generally in matters relating to workers' compensation that fall within s. 243(7) than the hearing officer. The only support for its position is found in cases where the Hearing officer heard evidence and the Tribunal did not. Support for this approach can be found in the very wide scope of review of hearing officer's decision given to the Tribunal by s.243(7)(e). An appeal to the tribunal is a statutory appeal. It is not a judicial review.","The primary issue in this appeal was the standard of review to be applied on appeals from a Hearing Officer to the Workers' Compensation Appeals Tribunal. The appellant had his appeal denied on the grounds that the decision of the Hearing Officer was not patently unreasonable. Allowing the appeal and remitting the matter for re-hearing, that an appeal from a Hearing Officer to the Tribunal is a statutory appeal. It is not a judicial review, and the standard of review is therefore one of correctness not whether or not the Hearing Officer's decision was patently unreasonable. The deference that the Tribunal must show is only with respect to the advantages the Hearing Officer may have in the fact finding process of a particular case."
"The plaintiff banked with the defendant and at the time of the accident the couple's mortgage loans fell into default. The Royal Bank agreed to defer commencement of any action with respect to the defaulted Bank Loans until such time as the husband received an accident injury settlement from SGI. The Bank refused to give an assignment to Equifax and, after receiving its settlement proceeds, refused to pay the loans. The plaintiff counter-claimed against the Royal Bank for general, punitive, exemplary and aggravated damages. HELD: The Royal bank's action against the defendant was dismissed in total. 1)The plaintiff expressly waived any contractual rights which he impliedly had to confidentiality of his credit information. By the provisions of paragraph 8 of the Personal Credit Line Agreement he authorized the Royal bank to release to Equifornian the information which it did. This part of the claim against the bank was dismissed.  2)The Royal Bank's counter-claim was dismissed as a breach of the plaintiff's duty of good faith, duty of confidentiality and by amendment application made at trial.  3)The court found that the Royal and Bank acted fairly and reasonably throughout with respectto the relationship between the bank and its borrowing customer. The bank's good faith and fair dealings resulted in the repayment of the loans in good standing. The repayment of these loans was made in accordance with the terms of the agreement signed with the parties. 4)None of the counter- claims were upheld and they were dismissed in the total.","In issue was whether the Bank breached its lending contract, its fiduciary duty or duty of confidentiality; and if so, what damages, if any, should be awarded. The defendant's bank loans fell into default after SGI disability benefits were terminated. The Bank reported the particulars of the loan defaults to a credit reporting agency (Equifax). The defendant declined to give an assignment of any accident injury settlement he might receive from SGI and requested the bank direct Equifax to eliminate any references to his default or delinquency upon the bank loans. The bank offered to put an explanatory note on their credit report confirming the arrears were the result of the defendant's automobile accident and that he had undertaken to pay the bank from the proceeds of the accident settlement. The bank commenced this action for payment. The Compains sought general, punitive, exemplary and aggravated damages in a counterclaim for breach of the bank's duty of good faith, duty of confidentiality and breach of contract. HELD: The counterclaims were dismissed with taxed costs to the bank for both the claim and counterclaims. The bank's claim was admitted at trial. 1)Compain expressly waived any contractual rights which he had to confidentiality of his credit information by the provisions of paragraph 8 of the Personal Credit Line Agreement. The principles outlined by the English Court of appeal in Tournier enumerated four exceptions to a bank's confidentiality obligation to its customers. 2)The analogy between the insurance cases and a bank and borrowing customer was not complete or appropriate. Assuming, without deciding, that banks do have a duty of good faith and fair dealing towards their customers, the bank did not breach such duties in their dealings in this case. 3)The characterization of the accounts as collection accounts was fair, reasonable and accurate in the circumstances and were not out of the normal course of business."
"The respondent admitted liability for driving his truck into the back of the appellant's vehicle. The trial judge described the accident as a very mild rear end collision. The appellant appealed the trial judge's finding that the accident did not contribute materially to his present poor health and that it caused only a mild aggravation of his pre-existing, and major, back problem. She also awarded general damages for general pain and suffering, with a correspondingly higher assessment of damages against the respondent. Appeal and cross appeal both dismissed without costs; the appeal and cross appeals both dismissed with the exception that, although recognizing the particular pain and anxiety which the respondent was found to have caused to the appellant and at the same time, recognizing that a pre- existing condition was the major cause of his present medical problems, the same judge assessed the general damages at $25,000. In our opinion, and in the circumstances of this case, that award cannot be said to be so far outside the range of damages for like cases as to be considered a wholly erroneous estimate of damages.","Liability was admitted for a very mild rear end collision. The trial judge found the plaintiff's evidence to be lacking in credibility and found that the collision did not contribute materially to the plaintiff's poor health. It only caused a mild aggravation of her pre-existing and major back problem. The trial judge assessed general damages at $25,000. The plaintiff's costs were reduced on the basis that she refused a formal offer to settle for slightly less than what she was awarded and refused a second offer which was increased before trial to an amount in excess of what she was awarded. The plaintiff appealed and the defendant cross-appealed. Appeal and cross-appeal dismissed. No strong and cogent reasons were advanced to warrant interference with the trial judge's findings on credibility. There was ample evidence to support the conclusion that the accident only caused a mild aggravation of the pre-existing condition and thus no basis upon which court could interfere with that conclusion or adjust upwards general damage assessment. Trial judge applied no wrong principle in exercising discretion to reduce plaintiff's costs. Award of $25,000 was not so far outside range of damages for like cases as to be considered wholly erroneous estimate of damages."
"The 18 year old, who was charged with the death of a single mother, pleaded guilty to a charge of manslaughter in respect of the deathof Milan Kulas. The Crown sought leave to appeal the sentence, alleging it was not proportionate to the gravity of the offence and failed to meet the requirements of the law in respect OF deterrence, denunciation and separation. HELD: The appeal was allowed. The sentence of 2½ years was set aside and a sentence of 5 years imprisonment was imposed in lieu of 10 years. The mitigating factors were that the accused had no criminal record; she did not participate in the actual physical beating and stabbing of the victims and stopped the beating of the robbers, albeit only after she seemed satisfied that he had nothing to give the robbers; and she seemed to be doing well in all programs in prison.","The Crown sought leave to appeal the sentence of 2.5 years for manslaughter on the grounds it was not proportionate to the gravity of the offence and failed to meet the requirements of deterrence and denunciation. HELD: A sentence of 5 years of imprisonment was imposed. The sentence was set aside because it did not comply with the fundamental principle of sentencing that it be proportionate to the gravity of the offence nor achieved the objective of denunciation of crimes of this nature. The manslaughter resulted from a common criminal enterprise, planned in advance, and was expected to be violent. The accused pled guilty, had no criminal record, did not participate in the actual physical beating and stabbing of the victim who died from the wounds or of the other victim; she intervened to stop the beating although only after being satisfied the alleged the drug dealer had nothing to give the robbers.  The accused appeared to be doing well in the prison programs. The sentence of the co-accused who had a record of 40 previous convictions had been increased to the equivalent of more than 10 years imprisonment."
"The defendant applied for an order setting aside a default judgment on the basis that the plaintiff's affidavit and statement of claim were not served on him. Application dismissed; the defendant had not given any reasons for not filing a defence; the originating notice, action, and statementof claim were served on both the defendant and plaintiff; the execution order and wages were garnisheed. The applicant had not shown by his affidavit why his defence was not filed and delivered within the time limited by the Rules; for all of these reasons, the defendant's application was dismissed.","The respondent entered a default judgment against the applicant and issued an Execution Order. The applicant applied to have the default judgment set aside on the basis that the Originating Notice and Statement of Claim were never served upon him. Application dismissed; on the evidence the documents were served upon the applicant; even though the experienced process server had no independant recollection of service, he swore an affidavit of service which was accepted. The applicant did not meet the test of a fairly arguable defence and gave no other reasons for not filing a defence other than his allegation that the documents were not served upon him."
"The husband applied to vary the order of the Queen's Bench Alberta by extinguishing maintenance arrears from January 12, 1993 to the present and for an order eliminating any further obligation to pay maintenance for his children. The parties had a separation agreement in 1991 wherein they agreed to joint custody of the children and in the event both children were living with one of the parties that the 'non-custodial' parent pay maintenance of $175 per month per child to the custodial parent. This agreement was confirmed in September 1992. At the time of the agreement, the husband earned $48,000 per year and by 1993, the first year in which he was required to pay a total of $4,200 his income was only 42% of his 1992 income. However, he actually paid little in excess of his required payment that year. HELD: 1)The husband was ordered to pay $213,213 for maintenance for the two children and to terminate any ongoing obligation for support based on Sandra's representations to the court and her letter to the Maintenance Enforcement Office.  2)His income had improved during the past 3 years and he was entitled to variation of maintenance for 1997-98 on a long term basis. 3)The Court found that the evidence of the late 1990s and early 2000s did not apply to him as he had not improved or dropped his income during the intervening years. Based on the evidence presented to the Court by Sandra, it would appear that his income had not substantially changed during the relevant period of time.","The father applied to vary the Alberta order by extinguishing his maintenance arrears from January 1993 to the present and for an order eliminating any further obligation to pay child support. The parties married in 1974 and divorced in 1992. They agreed to joint custody of their two children in their 1991 separation agreement. One child was expected to graduate in 2002 and the other in 2003. The father said he suffered depression and was unemployed for several years. HELD: Arrears from 1993 were eliminated. He paid 39, 9 and 0% of the required support in 1994, 1995 and 1996 when his income dropped. He paid 5% in 1997, 66 in 1998 and 117% in 1999. Any ongoing obligation was terminated in view of the mother's letter to the Alberta Maintenance Enforcement Office and her representations to the court that she was no longer seeking support."
"FIAT. The respondent father applied to vary a consent order dated April 5, 2001, by reducing his required child support payments from $236 per month to $19.00 per month. The consent order was granted one month after the respondent had quit his employment at Lilydale Foods in Wynyard. Although he remained unemployed, the respondent agreed to pay child support based upon an imputed annual income of $17,386. He purchased a one-half ton truck on which he had been making payments of $624. He no longer residing with his girlfriend. The 'changed circumstances' do not justify any reduction in his child support obligations. HELD: 1) The real issue is whether the respondent is intentionally underemployed or unemployed within the meaning of s. 19(1)(a) of the Federal Child Support Guidelines. The issue on the basis of the material filed did not appear to be relevant to the trial. 2) Income should not be imputed to a payor based on former employment that is no longer available or practicable.","FIAT. The father applied to vary the April 2001 consent order, granted 1 month after he quit his employment, by reducing monthly child support payments from $236 to $19. He agreed to pay support based on an imputed annual income of $17,386, although he remained unemployed. HELD: A trial of the issue was directed, as it could not be decided on the material filed whether he was intentionally unemployed or underemployed. The father's circumstances had changed since the consent order. The fact he no longer resided with a girlfriend and was making payments on a truck did not justify any reduction. Income should not be imputed based on former employment that is no longer available or practicable."
"The testator intended to make a separate bequest to each individual child, rather than a class gift. Although there was some evidence that the testator made attempts to change the wording of his will, nothing was properly executed and witnessed. The testator left all of his real and personal estate to his children and grandchildren, except for the jewellry and personal clothing. His will was prepared on a pre-printed stationer's form and he effectively stated that he was leaving his assets to these children. This effectively stated to the children that they were leaving their assets to them. The respondent was simply leaving no doubt as to which Jane, Nancy, Heather, Richard or Greg were referring to. The court was unable to discern a 'contrary intention' in the Will, as Clause 11 does not describe a contrary intention.","The testator had prepared his own Will on a pre-printed form and left his assets to his children, whom he then proceeded to name. One of the children predeceased the testator and an application was made for an interpretation of the Will. the gift to the deceased child did not lapse; her estate is entitled to it. The general rule that a lapsed gift falls into the residue is expressly subject to any contrary intention appearing in the will; a class gift always expresses such a contrary intention. Where the gift is to a class of close relatives (e.g. to children), if this is a class gift it does not fall under this statutory exception. In such a case, the gift falls to the surviving members of the class. This case satisfied two of the exceptions to the class rule, namely, that the number of beneficiaries was given and that the names of such were given. The gift was not a class gift but rather a separate bequest to each individual child and no contrary intention was discernible in the Will."
"The parties were married for ten years and had entered into a Separation Agreement in 2001. They have lived separate and apart for more than a year. The husband petitioned for divorce in June 2003. The wife, who had received one-half of the proceeds of the sale of the matrimonial home, filed an Answer in September 2003. She alleged that the husband failed to provide her with an automobile. The parties were separated for more then a year prior to the divorce proceeding. The issues were: 1) spousal support; 2) the husband's failure to provide the wife with an auto; and 3) the wife's allegation that the man had failed to comply with the Separation agreement requiring her to provide him with an expensive automobile. HELD: 1). The husband was entitled to spousals support retroactive to the date he ceased paying it; retroactive payments of $1,000 per month for a period of fifteen months unless, prior to this termination date, the applicant commences an application which results in her showing cause why spousa should continue.  2) Although the wife had established an entitlement to spOUSAL support at separation, the evidence supports a conclusion it was only for a year's duration. There were disadvantages related to its breakdown, which were not established by the marriage. The Court concluded that the wife was entitled, albeit temporarily, to spouse her through the marriage, and that her financial needs and needs required such support. 3) The obligation to pay spousousal supported as outlined in the Agreement was clearly reviewable by the parties. The obligation for spousation to continue for an indefinite period was not acknowledged by the husband but was acknowledged by him when he signed the Agreement to pay her $1000 monthly indefinitely.","The parties were married for 10 years. Contrary to the wording of their separation agreement, the husband argued that they had agreed that spousal support would only be payable for one year as the wife needed extra income from a secure source in order to obtain a mortgage on a new home. Also at issue was the husband's obligation to provide the wife with an automobile pursuant to the separation agreement. Spousal support to continue at the rate set out in the separation agreement for a period of fifteen months from the date of the decision at which time all support shall terminate, unless, prior to the termination date, the wife commences an application which results in her showing cause why spousal support should continue; the husband has complied with his obligations with respect to the provision of an automobile. The wife's financial means and needs required support, the husband had made an agreement to provide such support and the evidence did not support a conclusion that it was agreed to be for only one year. Although the wife did not establish any disadvantage from the marriage, there were disadvantages relating to its breakdown and her lifestyle deteriorated as result of the marriage ending."
"The plaintiff is in the business of buying and selling grain. The defendant farmer in the Grenfell, Saskatchewan, district agreed to sell 300 metric tonnes of flax to the plaintiff at a net price of $264.65 per tonne after calling several times to determine the market price for flax. The plaintiff's agent was accompanied by his regional supervisor when the contract was made. Both testified. The quantity was substantial and it was not surprising that both had clear recollection of the event. HELD: The plaintiff will have judgment for the sum of $10,875.43, together with pre-judgment interest from August 1, 2001, and costs of this action which was tried in summary way under Part 40 of the Rules of Court. The Sale of Goods Act requires some writing to support a contract such as this, however the part performance involving the sale under the contract of 2.043 tonnes is sufficient to meet the requirements of the Act. The fact that the defendant did not deliver the balance of the flax before August or at any time has no effect on the contract.","The plaintiff is in the business of buying and selling grain. The defendant is a farmer. After calling the plaintiff several times to determine the market price for flax, the defendant agreed to sell the plaintiff 300 metric tonnes of flax of which 297.957 tonnes remain undelivered. HELD: 1) The defendant did not deliver the balance of the flax before August, 2001 or at anytime and he is in breach of the contract. 2) The verbal contract was in force from the time of the telephone conversation ended in June 2001. As the price rose, the plaintiff would have profited by $36.50 per tonne. That is the loss of profit that the plaintiff's claim is based on multiplied by 297.957 and totals $10,875.43. 3) The part performance involving the sale under the contract of 2.043 tonnes is sufficient to meet the requirements of The Sale of Goods Act."
"The plaintiff sought damages in the amount of $50,000 plus interest in accordance with the provisions of The Pre-judgment Interest Act. The defendant denied that the plaintiff loaned $69,000 to the defendant, and argued that in fact it was an investment by the plaintiff and her husband into the auto brokering business. HELD: The plaintiff's claim was dismissed with costs to the defendants to the tune of $1,500 per month. The only evidence that might suggest that this transaction was a loan to either of the defendants was that some of the payments made were in excess of $500, the amount the plaintiff asserted was the monthly amount to be repaid by the defendant for the loan. The evidence of the plaintiff in cross-examination that after discussions with her husband, it was felt that they should invest the money in Kelly's business so that he could buy more vehicles. However, no evidence was filed with the court as to whether the plaintiff advanced a loan or a numbered company. The court found that the defendant had not made any enquiries as to the purpose of the financing of the action and therefore the claim was moot.","The plaintiff sues the defendants for $50,000 plus interest. The claim is based on the allegation that the plaintiff loaned the defendant Kelly $69,000. The plaintiff claims the defendants agreed to repay the loan in the amount of $1,500 per month. HELD: The plaintiff's claim is dismissed. The only evidence that might suggest that this transaction was a loan to either of the defendants was that some of the payments made by the defendant to the plaintiff were in the amount of $1,500, the amount that the plaintiff asserts was the monthly amount to be repaid by the defendant for the loan. However, there was no evidence as to when the agreement to pay $1,500 was made. In her testimony, the plaintiff stated that when the decision was made to pay the $69,000 to the business, she did not have a discussion with the defendant, Kelly. The only discussion she seems to have had was with her husband after which she wrote a cheque to the defendant."
"FIAT: The sister of the deceased testator asked that a hearing be ordered to prove her last will and testament in solemn form. She also asked that an order prohibiting the administration or disbursement of the estate of the testator without leave of the court, until the issues referred to above are resolved by order of the Court or agreement of the parties. HELD: 1) Based on the evidence, the conflict in the evidence and the law, the issue of undue influence cannot be resolved without a trial of the issue. It is necessary so that the matter can properly be assessed by the court.  2) There shall be an order directing a trial to prove the last will of Roland Linkert, November 3, 2005. The question to be tried is whether the defendant at the time of execution of the will was subjected to undue influence. In the circumstances, it is not necessary to have viva voce evidence of Violet Beaudry on this application.  3) The testator shall be the plaintiff and shall bear the burden of establishing the deceased's knowledge and approval of the contents of the Will. The applicant shall be granted the power of attorney. The purpose of this portion of the order is to determine whether any deliberate and overt act of coercion will ever occur in the presence of eye witnesses. 4) All the Queen's Bench Rules shall apply to the trial.","The applicant asks that the Will be proven in solemn form to determine whether there was undue influence on the testator. HELD: The evidence from the lawyer who prepared the Testator's last Will was that she was concerned that the testator was being influenced. The evidence from the executor of the Estate raises no such concerns. Based on the evidence, the conflict in the evidence and the law, the issue of undue influence cannot be resolved without a trial of the issue. A trial is ordered."
"The appellant was the birth mother of a child born in 2002. The child was residing with her birth parents at the time of their temporary guardianship order in Alberta. In 2005, an order for permanent guardianship was granted. Upon first learning of the welfare authorities involvement with the child, the appellant temporarily re-located to Calgary and put herself forward as a potential adoptive parent. On the same day that this permanent guardianhip order was granted, it was terminated and replaced by a Private Guardianship Order, under which the respondents became the guardians of the child. The order contained a provision that access by the birth parents was left to the respondents. The appellant appealed that order. She sought fresh evidence limited to portions of the appellant's affidavit addressing her efforts to secure counsel for the adoption hearing and the affidavit of Charlene Moore. HELD: Appeal allowed. 1)Section 83 of the Act permits an appeal of an adoption order. The judge was entitled to dispense with the mother's consent if she did not appear at the hearing. However, the court was satisfied that she had a bona fide intention to appear or be represented and that she made reasonable, although unsuccessful, efforts to do so. The right to be heard is a principle of natural justice and the test for admission of fresh evidence on appeal was set out by McIntyre, J., writing for the Supreme Court of Canada. By allowing the appeal and remitting the matter to the application court, it would be appropriate to decide whether the reference to access in the private guardianhip Order is an 'access order' or 'access provision' within the meaning of s.78(6) of the act. 2)The court would make no comment on the merits or that she's intended submissions to that court. Additionally, the Court will decide whether to grant the appellant a hearing.","The appellant appealed the adoption order regarding her natural child. Although at one time the child had been in the permanent care of the Agency, that order was terminated and replaced by a private guardianship order which had placed the child with the now-adoptive parents. Although neither of the birth parents, who resided in British Columbia, had attended the adoption hearing, the birth mother now sought access to the child and requested that the court receive fresh evidence as to her unsuccessful efforts to obtain counsel to represent her at the adoption hearing. Appeal allowed; adoption order set aside; matter remitted to the application court for a further hearing; application to admit fresh evidence granted in part; the portions of the appellant's affidavit addressing her efforts to secure counsel for the adoption hearing admitted into evidence. The appellant had a bona fide intention to appear or to be represented at the hearing and had made reasonable, although unsuccessful, efforts to do so. Allowing the appeal would be in the child's best interests as she had resided with the adoptive parents for the past three years and would continue to do so pending the further hearing."
"The Minister of Social Services applied for leave to appeal an order of a Child and Family Services judge sitting on appeal from an order in relation to the child K.W. who had been apprehended at birth due to the drug abuse of the mother. When the child was approximately 18 months old, the Minister sought a permanent order pursuant to s. 37(2) of the Act. This order was granted by Meekma P.C.J. The child's father, R.S., appealed the order and sought to adduce fresh evidence regarding his fitness to parent the child. The matter came back before the Minister on appeal. With the agreement of the parties, the judge received the psychological report of the respondent, who was in the father's custody. This report was very favourable to the respondent and the child, and recommended that the child remain in the custody of the minister for a period of 1 year after the child is returned to his father. HELD: The application was dismissed. 1)There was no merit to either of the proposed grounds of appeal. The respondent's argument that the Court of Appeal had jurisdiction to make an order subject to conditions (see s. 63(4)(c) and 37(5)(a)) was not material to this application since it was not a very broad application of the Court's jurisdiction. It is doubtful that, during the transition period, the minister retains status as parent until the transition is complete and the Child is returned, but only of viva voce evidence which was in written form. This decision bears heavily and potentially prejudicially upon the course or outcome of the particular proceedings. 2)It is doubtful, even in the very broadest sense of the word 'transition', that an order such as this would preclude or impose any appropriate conditions on the child in the circumstances of this case. Nor am I satisfied that the issue is of sufficient significance either to the parties or the wider public to warrant an appeal.","The Minister of Social Services applied for leave to appeal an order of Gabrielson J., sitting on appeal from an order of Meekma P.C.J. in relation to the child K.W. Gabrielson J. made an order returning K.W. to its parent's custody with a period of transition after receiving a psychological report on R.S. The report was very favourable to R.S. The parties agreed to Gabrielson J. receiving the report and neither party sought to cross-examine the writer of the report. HELD: Leave denied. Even if there was a scintilla of merit to the argument, the Court would not grant leave to appeal on the basis that to grant leave to appeal on an extremely technical ground would cause delay that is manifestly not in the best interest of the child in the circumstances of this case. The issue is not of sufficient significance either to the parties or to the wider public to warrant an appeal."
"The respondent's IRB for the 181st and subsequent days following an accident was not less than the IRB calculated for the first 180 days as determined pursuant to s. 116 of the Automobile Accident Insurance Act. The appellant argued that the Act is intended to correlate the non-earner's income replacement benefit (IRB) against which s. 117(4) is designed to be measured is that of a 'weighted average' calculation. Therefore, the respondent was paying an amount less than that of the respondent. The parties brought the matter back for further determination because SGI was paying the respondent an amount lesser than that. HELD: 1) The Court of Appeal referred the matter of determination of the calculation of the IRBs for both the first180 day period and the post 180 day period to me. Counsel for the appellant appealed SGI's calculation of interest on monies owed to the respondent on the basis of pre-judgment interest. 2) The respondent was awarded solicitor-client costs. Section 198 of the Act and Regulation 101 contemplate the payment of claimant's solicitor and client costs if the claimant is successful on appeal. Because Montgrand has not been successful in this proceeding, he is not entitled to any more costs from SGI. 3) SGI has correctly calculated Montgrand's net income when it made the requisite deductions as set out in s 137 and then reduced the net income to 90%. It would be neither a rational nor fair interpretation to deduct income tax, employment insurance premiums and Canada Pension contributions from only full-time earners. All earners are subject to these payments being deducted from their income but for their inability to earn an income because of an automobile accident. The further deductions are in keeping with his earning reality. 4) The hearing judge's interpretation conflicts with the provisions of s 117(3) of the Regulations, particularly s 24(1) thereof.","At issue is the amount of Income Replacement Benefits (IRB) payable to the appellant by SGI. The parties agree that the calculation of the IRB as provided by s. 117 of the Act is the annualized sum of $28,889.75. The appellant takes issue with SGI's reduction of the amount determined in accordance with s. 117 of the Act by calculating the appellant's net income in accordance with s. 135 to s. 138 of the Act. HELD: SGI has correctly calculated the appellant's IRB when it made the requisite deductions as set out in s. 137 to find the appellant's net income, and then reduced the net income to 90% to determine his IRB. It would be neither a rational nor fair interpretation to reduce a full-time earner's IRB by 90% and not the other types of earners. It would be neither a rational nor fair interpretation to deduct income tax, employment insurance premiums and Canada Pension contributions from only full-time earners. All earners are subject to these payments being deducted from their income but for their inability to earn an income because of an automobile accident. The further deductions to obtain the non- earner's IRB are in keeping with his earning reality."
"The plaintiff brought a motion for an interim injunction in response to a 30 year non-compete clause which prevented it from operating a drug store within 10 miles of the plaintiff's business. Salsman had resigned from the company and the opening of a new business was imminent. The plaintiff brought an application for an interlocutory injunction. Application allowed; interim injunction granted. The court found that there was a high potential for irreparable harm to the plaintiff company (the loss of customers, market share, though difficult to quantify, is real and is the type of harm contemplated by this branch of the test) and that it was in the best interests of the justice to put forward a strong prima facia case.","The applicant is the only drug store in a rural community. The respondent worked there for 30 years, in various positions. He signed a 5-year, 10 mile non-competition clause in 1995. He quit in early March with the intention of opening a new drug store down the street in early April. Other key staff members intended to quit and work in the new store. The applicant moved for an interim injunction to prevent the respondent from opening his store pending the hearing of their motion for an interlocutory injunction. Interim injunction granted. The new Civil Procedure Rules (2008) distinguish between interim and interlocutory injunctions. This is one of the circumstances which was contemplated when the new Rule 41.04 was enacted. Urgency exists and the applicant can't wait. While the non-competition clause may well not survive a challenge at the full hearing of the interlocutory injunction motion, all the applicant needs to show is that there is a serious issue to be tried. There is. This isn't a frivolous or vexatious application. There's a high potential for the applicant to suffer irreparable harm (e.g. the loss of customers, market share) especially given that this is a small community. An interim injunction will only result in a delay of a few weeks. The interlocutory injunction is set to heard at the end of April. The stakes are higher for the applicant than they are for the respondent."
"Civil Procedure – JudgmentSaskatchewan Government Insurance granted judgment in the amount of the Admin Fee recoverable under the doctrine of quantum meruit. The respondents were awarded judgment against the defendants for improperly charged and paid Admin Fees. The service and filing of notice of appeal dismissed the application. The plaintiff applied for a stay of all further proceedings in the action (other than the issue of the judgment and the taxation of costs under the judgment) pending the disposition of the appeal. The defendants object to the request that SGI finalize judgment as contemplated by the paragraphs 103, 104, 113 and 114 of the original judgment. HELD: Judgment was calculated using the formulas provided by the respondents. The court found that the stay imposed by Rule 15(1) did not affect all aspects of judgment and was accordingly stayed pursuant to Rule 15. The parties were to contact the Registrar in order to arrange a time for argument on any points in debate. 1)It was appropriate to calculate the judgment owing to the date of my original judgment based on the materials submitted by the defendants. 2)The parties had not been able to reach an agreement on what the judgment amount to from the above formula. 3)The costs and delay occasioned by multiple appeal hearings would be avoided by the parties. 4)The calculation was not made until the Court of Appeal released its decision on the appeals.","In the original judgment, the manner in which certain calculations should be made with respect to the amount owing to the plaintiff was left to the parties, with the provision that the judge remained seized if they could not reach an agreement. After judgment, the defendants appealed the judgment.  The plaintiffs then submitted detailed calculations of the final judgment for the trial judge's review. The defendants objected to the finalization of the judgment on the ground that, pursuant to Court of Appeal Rule 15, the notice of appeal had stayed the execution of the judgment until the disposition of the appeal. The plaintiff submitted that the calculation of the judgment was not acting on it. HELD: The defendant misconstrued the scope of Rule 15 as it does not stay proceedings. The appeal does not affect the ability of the Court to finalize the judgment. In fact, to do so will avoid costs and delay, and will hopefully be of some of assistance to the Court of Appeal."
"HELD: The appeal was dismissed. The court found that the trial judge erred in weighing necessity and qualification before determining the admissibility of certain opinion evidence tendered on behalf of the plaintiff. The trial judge then awarded damages for repair of broken concrete grade beam and for other repairs in an amount much higher than damages would have been for the triple-ply beam, notwithstanding that liability as to the concrete Grade beam was not established at trial. The respondent was properly qualified by virtue of his years of experience and that he had been awarded pre-judgment interest and costs. It was not clear from the transcript if the respondent's comments and interventions did not go beyond the nature of a legitimate attempt to ensure that all of the evidence regarding the matters at issue was before the court and was of sufficient clarity so that the court could understand it. As Hancock was self-represented, more questions of him were required than may have been appropriate in a traditional civil trial. Ground No. 1 was an error in the calculation of damages. While there was uncertainty about the timing of the broken concrete-grade beam, it was found that it had been there for over ten years. While it might have been possible to discover the cracks in the foundation, there was no evidence that the amount of work done was not necessary to repair the damage done when the foundation caved in and water entered the basement.  2) While there is a strong presumption of impartiality on the part of a trial judge, the law should not carelessly evoke the possibility of bias in a judge, whose authority depends upon that presumption. 3) While it is possible to look at the latent defects in a wall and to find the negligent misrepresentation of the structural cause, it is impossible to do so in a small claims proceeding where one or both of the parties are self- represented. Although there may be some latent defects, they do not rise to the level necessary to establish a reasonable apprehension of bias. 4) Although there is no palpable and overriding error with respect to the underlying facts, which are not to be found beyond that of someone who is experienced in investigating, diagnosing and repairing foundations, this is not a case such as that referred to in Rieger v. Burgess, where evidence of a special form of injury known as post-concussive syndrome was found to be beyond the expertise of a general surgeon even though he had some additional courses in trauma and orthopaedic surgery.","The appellants appealed a small claims judgment. The judgment had found the appellants liable for damages after the respondent, who had purchased a house from the appellants, discovered that water was entering his basement. When the respondent investigated the source of the water, he removed the interior wall of the basement and discovered that there was a second wall behind the first one. He also discovered that a large chunk of the concrete footing and concrete grade beam were broken and had slid into the space between the interior basement wall. The respondent obtained a professional opinion that suggested that the problem had been there for a significant period of time and that the wooden beam that sat on the concrete grade beam was rotten and would have to be replaced. The respondent was awarded judgment in the amount of the repair. The appellant appealed on the basis that the trial judge should not have considered the respondent's expert's opinion about the age of the defect, that the trial judge had crossed a line in assisting the self-represented plaintiff at the trial and that the trial judge erred in calculating damages. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. The respondent's expert was qualified as an expert concerning foundation repair and had the necessary experience to give expert evidence on the type of structural repair and the need for structural repair. Once qualified as an expert in the area of foundations and structural repair, he could testify on the nature of the foundation's problems, including the wooden beam. The witness was also the person who actually carried out the repair to the foundation and was entitled to give evidence on what he saw and did. The witness was properly qualified by virtue of his years of experience and the trial judge was entitled to accept his evidence as to the state of the foundation and how long it had been in such a state. The trial judge's intervention and comments to the appellant's lawyer at the trial did not go beyond the nature of a legitimate attempt to ensure that all of the evidence regarding the matters at issue was before the Court with sufficient clarity to allow the trial judge to understand it. The cause of action in this case was negligent misrepresentation. The trial judge found that the appellants were aware of the structural defect and had covered it up. The proper measure of damages is the amount of money required to put the plaintiff in the position he would have occupied if the negligent misrepresentation had not been made. In this case, the judge made no palpable or overriding error in calculating damages at the amount it cost to fix the foundation."
"This application concerns the jurisdiction of this Court to hear an appeal from a decision of the Court of Queen's Bench when the latter exercises jurisdiction under statute that is silent as to the right to appeal to this Court. The particular issue is whether ss. 7(2) and 7(3) of The Court of Appeal Act, 2000, which is referred to in s.7(2), of which the Psychologists Act refers, respectively, to a 'psychologists Act' and its predecessors, dating back to The Interpretation Act, and that s.33(1) states that 'an appeal lies to the court from a judgment, order, decree, verdict or finding of any other enactment.' HELD: The application was dismissed. The question of when right of appeal would lie to the Court is of little relevance that many of the professional statutes are silent on the question of whether the legislature has a duty or power to grant an appeal. The psychologists Act does not state that there is no appeal from here on out. It is an exercise in clarity that would allow the Court to resolve the jurisdictional issue by considering the general purpose of the Act.","HELD: The court dismissed the application. Section 7(2) indicates that whenever the legislature confers jurisdiction on the Court of Queen’s Bench, and is silent with respect to an appeal from that Court, an appeal lies from it. The Psychologists Act does not state that there is no appeal from a decision of the Court of Queen’s Bench."
HELD: The court found that the defendant was guilty of defamation as long as he was in the know about the facts and did what he was told. The court did not find that the defendants were liable in defamation as the article published in the Star Phoenix was part of a series of fair and accurate contemporaneous reporting by the defendants that were the basis of the defendants' defamation claim. The defendants opposed the application to add the defendant as a defendant on the basis that the two-year limitation period set forth in The Limitations Act in force at the time of the alleged defamation had expired. The plaintiff had already commenced a lawsuit against the defendants alleging that they had published defamatory comments about the defendant. The defendant was aware of the existence of the claim in the Sun and the StarPhoenix and he had been in contact with the plaintiffs' counsel prior to the publication of these articles. The issues were whether the statement of claim should be amended to add Postmedia Network Inc. as a sidekick to the defendants and whether the plaintiff was entitled to an injunction requiring the defendants to remove certain content from websites under their control.,"HELD: The action was allowed. The defendants had defamed the plaintiff and he was entitled to damages in the amount of $100,000. The court found the following with respect to each issue: 1) it would substitute Postmedia as a defendant pursuant to Queen’s Bench rule 3-84(2) as it was the successor to Canwest and was aware of the plaintiff’s claim when it purchased the Star Phoenix and it would not be prejudiced. It would not deprive Postmedia of a defence under s. 5 of The Limitations Act because the articles remained on Postmedia’s websites and were republished whenever they were viewed or downloaded; 2) after reviewing each of the articles and assessing the words complained of, it found that the words constituted defamation; 3) all of the defendants were found to be joint tortfeasors with Purdy because they participated in the publication of a libel and were jointly and severally liable in defamation to the plaintiff; and 3) an appropriate award for general damages was $50,000. The court allowed the claim for aggravated damages as the defendants were found to be motivated by actual or express malice because Purdy did not simply report the jury’s verdict in her articles but indicated that she believed that the jury had not reached the proper verdict in the trial. She deliberately chose to report the stories of people who had made complaints about the surgical care provided to them by the plaintiff without verifying it or seeking comment from the plaintiff. As she was acting in the course of her employment, Purdy’s malice was attributed to all the defendants. The plaintiff was awarded $50,000 in aggravated damages."
"The applicant sought a division of matrimonial property, custody of the two youngest children and maintenance for the three other children pursuant to The Deserted Wives and Children's Maintenance Act. The parties owned modest home and equity in the said home of approximately $16,000. The respondent borrowed money and bought some trenching equipment. This business failed and resulted in substantial loss. He spent more money on alcohol than he should have. The wife complained about the respondent's use of alcoholic beverages. HELD: 1)The respondent was to be given custody of all four children and the two adult children under the Infants Act. 2)He was to pay the arrears of child support in the sum of $1,800. 3)The court was satisfied the respondent dissipated the property within the meaning of the Matrimonial Property Act and that he was entitled to keep his motor vehicle and other properties in his possession as his own. 4)The applicant was to have her name shown on the property and that of the other parties as her name was already shown in the lot.","Division of matrimonial property. Husband made modest living and, eight years ago, won $100,000 in lottery. The lottery money was spent on household finances and lost in husband's small business venture. Husband 'spent more money on alcohol than he should have'. HELD: This did not amount to dissipation of matrimonial property within the meaning of the Act. Husband's mismanagement of the family's financial affairs was grounds for unequal division of the property:"
"This was an action for professional negligence against the defendant, a barrister and solicitor practising in Middleton, Nova Scotia. For the plaintiff, that the defendant had breached his and the plaintiff's contractual obligations by failing to supply the Corporation with a valid milk assignment. The terms of the loan offered were semi-annual payments of 1237 litres per day. The plaintiff was to repay the loan on a monthly basis. At issue was whether the defendant was to reimburse the plaintiff or not. Dismissing the action with costs, that there were no breaches of contract, and that the defendants were now estopped from exercising any of their rights against the plaintiff under the original instructions.","55/45. In an action for professional negligence against a solicitor for failing to obtain specific security requested in written instructions, the plaintiff renegotiated the deal and no longer insisted upon receiving the specific security. That the plaintiff was estopped from exercising any rights against the solicitor under the original instructions."
"The appellant was charged with perjury for giving false testimony with intent to mislead the court contrary to s. 131(1) of the Criminal Code. He pled guilty to the charge of break, enter and theft. He was sentenced to two years imprisonment for the charge, and another sentence of nine months for the conviction of break and enter. He appealed. Allowing the appeal and reducing the sentence to 9 months, that the trial judge committed no error in principle. He found that the upper end of the range of sentences for perjury did not appear to have reached two years, and the aggravating factors did not fall within a lower classification of time to be served.","The appellant pled guilty to perjury and was sentenced to two years imprisonment. He appealed the sentence as being excessive and too harsh. Allowing the appeal and varying the sentence to nine months, that while perjury is a very serious offence, the sentence exceeded the range imposed for offences of this nature."
The appellant appealed the trial judge's decision which convicted him of driving a motor vehicle while his ability to operate was impaired by alcohol was impaired. (1)The trial judge erred in law in that she failed to direct herself or misdirected herself in law as to the appropriate burden of proof in a criminal case; (2)The court reviewed the cases to which it had been referred and found the appellant did not err. The trial judge applied the correct test for impairment and was responding to speculations made by the defence counsel during his summation.,"The appellant appealed his conviction for impaired driving, contending the trial judge failed to direct herself in law as to the appropriate burden of proof. Dismissing the appeal, that the trial judge applied the correct test for impairment. The Criminal Code does not prescribe special tests for determining impairment. The trial judge must receive sufficient evidence to satisfy him or herself beyond reasonable doubt that the accused's ability to operate motor vehicle was impaired by alcohol. On Appeal."
"The petitioner sought a divorce, custody of the children, spousal and child support and an unequal division of matrimonial property. The respondent, who had recently taken a leave of absence from his employment with the Provincial Government, applied for an order for interim support which provided for joint custody with the children. Application for sale dismissed. There had not been a significant increase in the petitioner's assets during the marriage and, therefore, it would not be unfair and inequitable to the petitioner as custodial parent to order such a division. HELD: 1)The respondent was ordered to pay $1,400 per month in child support plus $800 for spousals and child and $400 in arrears. 2)The petitioner could not avoid his responsibility of providing an adequate level of support by turning his back on well-paid employment. Upon the assumption that he will resume his employment in January 1996, the respondent will deduct his share of the matrimononial home from his taxable income. 3)The parties had a traditional marriage. The parties lived together until they separated in 1994 when the respondent transferred to Regina. He was then transferred to Saskatoon. He lived in the home until September 1995, when he was granted sole custody. He rented the home for three years until he sold it in 1996. During his occupancy the home was to be sold and the proceeds divided in accordance with the reasons provided in the Rules of Court. 4)It was not unreasonable for the petitioner to infer that he made up his mind to avoid complying with theorder for interim financial support.  5)It would be unfair to the respondent to order an equal division of the home when the children are children within the meaning of the Divorce Act.  6)Costs were refused.","The petitioner sought a divorce, custody, spousal and child support and an unequal division of matrimonial property. The respondent counter-petitioned for similar relief, including divorce, joint custody and an equal division of the property. HELD: 1)Sole custody was awarded to the mother with access on the same terms as contained in the interim order. Two reasons for not awarding joint custody were the obvious acrimony between the parties and the respondent's reluctance to support his children. Three weeks after his application for sale of the home was rejected, he applied for a leave of absence from his job. It was inferred that he was trying to avoid complying with the order for interim support. 2)The mother re-entered the workforce after many years' absence. She suffered an economic disadvantage from the marriage and its breakdown. 3)The car owned by the petitioner when she married was exempt property. The motorcycle was disregarded as there had not been a significant increase in value. The list prepared by the respondent was used to divide household goods, tools and equipment. 4)The respondent was to assume one-half of the bank loan and it was agreed that the pension funds should be shared equally. 5)It would be unfair and inequitable to the custodial parent to order an equal division of the matrimonial property. The petitioner was granted possession of the matrimonial home until the younger child's 18th birthday or until she vacated the property. 6)The respondent cannot avoid his responsibility of providing an adequate level of support by turning his back on well-paid employment. Spousal and child support were deducted from his share of the matrimonial home. The petitioner was given leave to return to Court after February 28, 1999 for reconsideration of child support."
"The applicants sought an order under s.11 of the Landlord and Tenant Act vesting the whole term of their sub-leases with either V.I.P. Business Centre or 598710 Saskatchewan Ltd. on such conditions as the Court deems proper. The latter had commenced an action against Bennett in 1996. At issue was whether a valid renewal of the head lease existed between the applicants and Bennett; whether valid renewals of subleases and head leases met the requirements of s.4 of the Statute of Fraud; did the Court have jurisdiction to hear a notice of motion? HELD: The application was dismissed. 1)The evidence led by the applicants was true. Neither Bennett nor the applicants had initiated an action.  2)The actions and performance of the applicants fell short of constituting part of the performance for the purposes of sec.11 regardless of whether a narrow or broad interpretation of the doctrine was applied.  3)The applicants were not entitled to the relief offered by Bennett. Further, the Court had no discretion to deal with the issues by way of summary procedure. 4)The Court was of the view that a decision on issue nos.3 and 4 could dispose of theapplication and perhaps the issues between the parties. Therefore, will address them.","The applicants sought an order under s.11 of the Landlord and Tenant Act vesting the whole term of their sub-lease with either VIP Business Centre (VIP) or 598710 Saskatchewan Ltd (SaskLtd). Bennett, owner of an office building (the Plaza), leased space to VIP for five years ending in 1997. Issues included (i)whether there had been a valid renewal of the head lease; (ii)whether there had been valid renewals of sub-leases; (iii)assuming valid renewals, did s4 of the Statute of Frauds bar enforcement against Bennett; (iv)whether the Court had jurisdiction to hear an application for relief under s11 brought solely by notice of motion; (v)are the applicants entitled to such relief; (vi)whether Bennett was bound by the sub-leases by virtue of taking the assignment from VIP. HELD: The application was dismissed. 1)It was assumed that the evidence led by the applicants was true in order to determine issues (iii) and (iv) which dispose of the application. Issues (i), (ii) and (vi) could not be dealt with summarily because of the conflicting affidavits. 2)Notwithstanding Queen's Bench Rule 13(1), the term action in s11 includes summary application by way of notice of motion. There is no reason for landlords to have better access to this Court than the tenants concerning possession of demised premises. The words 'or otherwise' include extrajudicial actions by landlords, including re-entry. Had it been concluded that it was necessry to proceed by statement of claim, such error would have been procedural one, curable under Rule without affecting the jurisdiction of the Court. 3)The Court should exercise its discretion within the guidelines outlined in Golden Griddle. grant of relief requested by the applicant would constitute an improper exercise of such discretion. They were not the sole tenant in stand alone building of the kind in Chatham Empire Theatre. The relief sought would unfairly affect the landlord. As the applicants expressed no interest in taking over the whole head lease premises on the terms of the head lease, there was no need for a conditional order of the nature of London Bridge. 4)The only memoranda consisted of the original head lease and subleases and the unsigned fax messages. The fax messages did not meet the essential requirements for a valid lease. The actions and performance by VIP and the applicant fell short of constituting part performance for the purposes of s.4 regardless of a narrow or broad interpretation of the doctrine. In any case the Court would not have exercised its discretion by binding Bennett with leases which comprised less than 15% of the head premises in the absence of evidence that clearly demonstrated the owner's ability to rent out the balance of the head lease premises was not impaired economically or physically. The applciants could obtain other office space including that offered by Bennett. General and punitive damages would provide an adequate remedy."
"FIAT. The proposed plaintiffs applied to set aside proposed amendments to the original statement of claim and the joinder of parties to that claim. In the end, the Court held the amendments did not require leave to amend and found that the infant could be joined as plaintiff on the basis she was an infant against whom the limitation period of 1 year set out in The Urban Municipality Act had intervened. The amendment could only be considered pursuant to an application under s. 44(11) of The Queen's Bench Act as amended. HELD: The application was allowed. On the basis of the foregoing the defendant was not successful. As there was no legal impediment to making the amendments requested, it was an appropriate exercise of judicial discretion to allow the amendments. The limitation period in s. 314(1) applies from the time when the damages were sustained, not from the date of the occurrence which led to the damage. The plaintiff was a joint owner of the property and should have been included as a plaintiff at the original action. Her joinder as a party in this situation is contemplated by the Rules (Rule 38(1)) and normally would not be contested. The defendant's claim that it has suffered actual prejudice is not accepted.","FIAT. It was held in an earlier fiat in June that the addition of the two proposed plaintiffs asserted new causes of action and amendments to the statement of claim could only be considered pursuant to an application under s.44(11) of the Queen's Bench Act. The defendant resisted the joinder of the new plaintiffs and amendments on the basis of undue delay and actual prejudice. The statement of claim alleged nuisance, and in the alternative, negligence against the City with respect to the design, construction and maintenance of the sewer system causing his basement to flood. The plaintiffs stated they only became aware of the damage to their home and possible health problems over period of time. Leave to appeal the June fiat was denied. The defendant plead limitation period defence to the amendment and argued that if the City had received notice of any ongoing problems it would have investigated and possibly taken steps to minimize any damage; that evidence had been lost; it may be too late to determine the causes. HELD: The amendments were allowed. 1)The limitation period in s.314(1) applies from the time damages were sustained, not from the date of the occurrence which led to the damage. The facts were uncertain. It was uncertain when the limitation period commenced. If the date the applicant should have discovered the additional damage was the date they received the geotechnical and structural engineering report, the amended claim was brought within the 1 year limitation period. 2)Inexcusable delay was not established. 3)It was not accepted that the defendant suffered actual prejudice. If it was prejudiced it was through its own inaction. No evidence had been lost. The basement was available for inspection. It had the benefit of the reports provided by the applicants. 4)The requirements of s.44(11) were met and judicial discretion was exercised to allow the amendments. The fact that the joint owner of the property was not included was due to inadvertence rather than any deliberate choice. It was also appropriate to join the new plaintiff. It appeared that the expanded claim alleged in the requested amendment was not apparent at the time the original claim was issued and arose out of the same occurrence. 4)Costs in the cause."
"The plaintiffs sought to enforce payment by the defendant of judgment for $23,396.03 in US currency awarded to them by Carver County District Court in the First Judicial District of Minnesota. The action was defended on the basis that the defendant was not ordinarily resident in the state of Minnesota and did not appear before the Minnesota court or submit to its jurisdiction. HELD: The plaintiff's action was dismissed with costs to be taxed.  1)The Court had reviewed the definition of 'ordinarily resident' as it is used in the subsection and the time question raised in subsection 3(a) needs no further explication. 2)Saskatchewan is the province of the Foreign Judgments Act and the Act reflects that difference. The case law have reviewed the terminology used in s.3(a), (b) and (c) of The Foreign Judgement Act. 3)Because of the activities of the defendant in Minnesota, that is to say its activities in sales, the logical conclusion, so it seems to me, is that it is a business address.","The defendant manufactured solarium in Saskatoon which it sold to the plaintiffs in Minnesota. The plaintiffs alleged the solarium was defective, sued and obtained judgment in the Minnesota Court which it now sought to enforce in Saskatchewan. The defendant argued the Minnesota court did not have jurisdiction because at the time the action was commenced he was not 'ordinarily resident' in the state of Minnesota. The defendant was served in Saskatoon with notice of the claim but did not appear or defend the action or surrender to its jurisdiction. HELD: The action was dismissed with costs to be taxed. 1)The defences available to defendant in Saskatchewan where an action is brought to enforce foreign judgment are set out in s.6 of the Foreign Judgments Act. 2)While there may be evidence supporting the conclusion that the defendant was carrying on business in Minnesota, that same evidence does not support the conclusion the defendant was ordinarily resident there. The defendant advertised its business in Minnesota and elsewhere in the United States and employed agents there to sell its product. The logical conclusion was that the address in the city of Minneapolis was a business address. It could be argued that the defendant carried on business in the state of Minnesota but the question was whether the defendant was ordinarily resident in that state. The Foreign Judgments Act reflects real difference in the meaning of 'ordinarily resident' and 'carrying on business'."
"The parties applied to vary the child support provisions of the consent judgment, pursuant to s. 15.1(3) of the Divorce Act and the Federal Child Support Guidelines. The respondent was ordered to pay $1,000 per month for support, maintenance and education of the children. The petitioner worked full time for the Government of Saskatchewan and used child care services in her home. She spent $5,357 on child care in 1999. She produced child care receipts for 2000 of $2,790 plus $1100 which is said to be owed to a family member. She estimated her child care expenses would be in excess of $4,000 this year. HELD: The application was dismissed with costs. 1)Once a material change has occurred in the circumstances of a child, it becomes an issue of whether there has been any material change. This application was brought just ten months after the pre-trial conference. The material did not satisfy the Court there had been any change in the child's circumstances and it was not suggested that material change had been made in the manner requested. There was no material change in either of the parties' circumstances. 2)Once the parties agreed to impute income the respondent has the onus of satisfying the Court that there have been material changes in his condition, means, needs or other circumstances which would have resulted in a different determination of his income. There is no basis for the respondent to vary access under the Guidelines. Once the respondent leaves the province he is to provide seven days' written notice to the petitioner. If he chooses not to exercise access on Friday night or during the daytime on Saturday he is provided with 7 days' notice. These orders have been made to provide some predictability for the children and to provide a level of child support which is reasonable to the Court. It does not constitute a variation of the custody/access regime but rather, specific directions with respect to execution of the access regime.","The mother had custody of the 12 and year olds under the terms of the January 10, 2000 consent judgment. The father applied to vary child support in November on the basis of his reduced income. HELD: The application was dismissed with costs to the petitioner fixed at $1,000. The onus is on the applicant to provide cogent, independent or objective verification of change of circumstances. This application was brought 10 months after the pre-trial conference. It was of no consequence that someone may come into the home rather than using commercial day care service. There was no change in the father's hours of work or the schedule. The only change was that the mother was no longer available to provide care during Saturday of his access weekends. The mother was not to schedule activities during the father's access periods without his consent and he was to provide 7 days written notice if he chooses not to exercise access during specified times. This was not a variation of the custody/access regime but rather specific directions to provide some predictability for the children."
"The accused was charged with owning a dog that without provocation attacks a person contrary to s. 135.3(3) of the Urban Municipalities Act. The accused owned four separate incidents involving the dog in September 2001 involving the complainant's daughter. The evidence indicated that the dog was in close proximity to the complainant, that it ran through her backyard, then into the alleyway where it upset the complainant’s daughter. HELD: The accused was fined $200. On the definition of attack, the Court concluded that the accused failed to take reasonable steps to prevent the offence from occurring. On all of the evidence, the court concluded that it was beyond reasonable doubt that the defendant had attacked the complainant. The appropriate fine was $200 and that the seven specific pieces of evidence backing up the conclusion that the officer did not take reasonable precautions to prevent an attack were: the dog ran from its yard; the complainant was frightened by the dog; the chain was attached to a post in the ground and the dog had to take few steps to get to the ground; the accused had taken reasonable steps on three separate occasions to control the dog. The dog was kept within an enclosed fence and the fence must be continuous, surrounding the perimeter of your property and include a gate or gates which prevent the dog from exiting the property except when on a leash; the dog must be kept within the enclosed fence; unless on a loose leash the dog is kept within three feet of the complainant; the court ordered liability insurance in an amount not less than $300,000 to cover damage or injury caused by the animal.","The accused was charged with owning a dog that without provocation attacked a person contrary to the Urban Municipality Act s.135.3(3). There were four separate incidents involving the dog in September 2001. At issue was whether the Crown had proven an attack on any of the four occasions. The accused agreed that the presumption of non-provocation set out in s.135.2(1) of the UMA applied and that presumption had not been displaced. HELD: 1)A $200 fine was imposed along with conditions. The dog must be kept within an enclosed continuous fence and chained to a post. There must be a gate preventing exiting except while on a leash and muzzled. The owner must display a sign stating Guard Dog on Duty. 2)If dog is territorial or protective, and the facts show the human has, by intruding, been in law provocative, the offence may not be proven beyond reasonable doubt. On the evidence there was no intrusion sufficient to justify an attack or which could be considered provocation. 3)There were seven specific pieces of evidence which supported the conclusion that the owner did not take reasonable steps to ensure his dog did not attack someone in the fashion prohibited by s.135.3(3). It is irrelevant at law that after dog attacks it responds to its owner's commands. The dog escaped the yard, was off leash and was not sufficiently restrained or enclosed. logging chain affixed to post is substantial way of tethering dog. One would not expect dog to be attached to logging chain if there were no concerns."
"The plaintiff sought damages for unlawful arrest and assault, including aggravated or punitive damages, arising out of events which resulted in his arrest and a charge of obstruction. During the course of his arrest, the plaintiff received a cut to his scalp just inside the hairline above his left eye. The actions of the defendants were in dispute as to whether the plaintiff's actions amounted to obstruction or unlawful arrest pursuant to s. 495(2) of the Criminal Code and whether the police officer assaulted the plaintiff. HELD: 1)Credibility was assessed as being at odds with what the other witnesses said and because their evidence did not distinguish between Ms. Krupa and Mr. Hashemian as to who did what. 2)The plaintiff did not require transportation to hospital but was asked if he wished to go to the hospital and if so, if any of the reasonable force provisions of the Police Act and s. 10(3) of The Police Act applied. 3)The events leading up to the arrest and the activity of all participants while in the lounge were not largely in dispute and vary in minor detail only. The action of the plaintiff outside of the lounge are in dispute. 4)Although the plaintiff was lawfully arrested for obstruction, the action he took was not reasonably necessary to arrest him. The plaintiff had no direct knowledge of the reasons for the obstruction charge and was entirely disinterested in calling the police.","The plaintiff seeks damages for unlawful arrest and assault, including aggravated or punitive damages arising out of events which resulted in his arrest and a charge of obstruction. During the course of his arrest, the plaintiff received cut to his scalp. He remained in custody until released at approximately 7:30 a.m. that morning. The three named defendants are members of the Saskatoon Police Service. The City of Saskatoon is their employer. HELD: The action for wrongful arrest is dismissed. The plaintiff was assaulted when his head was driven onto the hood of the vehicle. The plaintiff is awarded $2,500 in general damages and pre-judgment interest on that amount. It is not an appropriate case to award punitive damages, but the Court awarded solicitor client costs to the plaintiff in the amount of $6,000 plus taxable disbursements. 1) The Court accepted the plaintiff's evidence that he did not physically interfere with the police officers outside of the lounge. The police officers that attended at the lounge and became involved in the arrest of Mr. Sampson were in the execution of their duty. The plaintiff does not dispute that he possessed the general intent to make the comments that he did throughout the proceedings and that he did so wilfully. The issue is whether or not his actions obstructed the police officers, who were in the execution of their duty. 2) The combined actions of the plaintiff and Ms. Krupa clearly interfered with the police officers' arrest of Mr. Sampson, to the point that Constable Pura called for back-up help. Once the back-up officers arrived, one of them was required to expend time and effort restricting the movements of the plaintiff and Ms. Krupa. Once on the street, they again confronted the police officers. Their combined actions clearly affected the work of the police officers in the execution of their duty. There were reasonable and probable grounds to believe the plaintiff was obstructing the police officers in the course of their duty. 3) On the facts in this matter, the same conclusion is arrived at based solely on the plaintiff's individual actions. The plaintiff's officious interference consisted of verbal abuse, excessive criticism and undue pertinacity in his discussion and questioning and provided reasonable and probable grounds to believe he was obstructing police officers in the execution of their duty. The action for wrongful arrest is dismissed. 4) The cut to the plaintiff's head is a minor one, not requiring stitches or immediate medical attention. The plaintiff experienced headaches for several weeks. He also had stiff neck and sleep disturbance. There were no long term effects. Corrigendum received January 25, 2005 and added to fulltext."
"The plaintiff commenced an action against the defendants seeking various items of specific relief and costs on solicitor-client basis. Thereafter, the plaintiff brought notice of motion seeking an order that the defendants provide an accounting in relation to specified items. In February 2005, the defendants made an order directing that the plaintiff provide an order for leave to amend the statement of defence. The defendants deny that they have any obligation to redeem the plaintiff's preferred shares, as asked for by the plaintiff in paragraph 38 of the Statement of Claim. The plaintiff seeks costs of the application and cross-examination of the defendant on a solicitor-and‑client basis and an order pursuant to Queen's Bench Rules 217, 173(e) and the inherent jurisdiction of the Court striking the defendant's statement of defense of all the defendants. HELD: 1) The plaintiff's motion does not require the defendant to make any payment to purchase or redeem any redeemable shares. Rather, the corporate defendant is not making payment to redeem shares, in essence, but rather, following judgment however and whenever it would be required to be paid to other shareholders, including execution. Such execution or enforcement of judgment is not tantamount to redemption of shares.  2) The amount sought to be recovered by plaintiff in the amount of $214,600 does represent debt or liquidated demand as contemplated in s. 34(2) of the Business Corporations Act. The defendant's application for summary judgment does not serve to prevent the plaintiff from seeking summary judgment from the Court. The effect of granting a judgment, if it is otherwise appropriate to do so, does not place the corporation in a position of breaching the prohibitions contained in s34(2).","There is no dispute between the parties as to the nature of the plaintiff's investment in the defendant corporation. The real issue between the parties is whether the plaintiff is entitled to the summary relief, which she now seeks pursuant to Rules 129 and 133 of The Queen's Bench Rules. It is the position of the plaintiff that the cross- examination of the defendant on his affidavit discloses that the corporation is profitable company and that s. 34(2) of The Business Corporation Act does not provide any defence to the defendants against the requested relief sought. The parties are in disagreement over the issue of the amount of dividend payments that have been made by the corporation to the plaintiff pursuant to her investment in the corporation. HELD: 1) The plaintiff's application for summary judgment does not require the corporation to redeem any redeemable shares. Rather, the plaintiff's application is one seeking summary judgment. The corporate defendant is not making payment to redeem shares, but rather following judgment however and whenever obtained, it would be subject to the normal judgment process, including execution. Such execution or enforcement of judgment is not tantamount to redemption of shares. The plaintiff provided notice in writing to the corporation that she wished to redeem all her Class E preferred shares effective March 2005. The principal amount of her shares is $214,600. It is this amount that she seeks as the substance of her summary judgment. Section 34(2) of the Act does not serve to prevent the plaintiff seeking summary judgment from the court. The effect of granting judgment, if it is otherwise appropriate to do so, does not place the corporation in a position of breaching the prohibitions contained in s. 34(2) of the Act. 2) The defendants have not demonstrated that there is real insolvency on the part of the corporation. The defendants have failed to provide responses to the undertakings. Further, the defendants have not provided any professional analysis or evidence in support of their position that s. 34(2) is applicable. 3) The amount sought to be recovered by the plaintiff does represent debt or liquidated demand as contemplated by Rule 129. The plaintiff is entitled to summary judgment against the defendant corporation for the sum of $214,600 pursuant to Rule 129. Further the plaintiff is entitled to interest at the rate of 16% from March 2005 in accordance with the Share Agreement. 4) The plaintiff has not demonstrated an appropriate basis for summary judgment against the individual defendants. 5) The plaintiff is entitled to costs."
"The plaintiff brought an action for water damage sustained to her former residence when frozen pipes burst. She alleged that she instructed the Town of Martensville to shut off her water supply and the failure to do so led to the damages being sustained. The defendant contested such instructions and, in any event, the cause of the pipes bursting was not as result of the water not being turned off, but because the plaintiff had the power and heat disconnected. HELD: The plaintiff's action was dismissed. There was no order as to costs. 1)The defendant was not the cause or source of the damage. It was her daughter who was the legal representative for the Town and, therefore, the plaintiff's right to proceed with the claim. 2)The court could not find clear instructions given by the plaintiff to the town to disconnect the water service. To the contrary, the form executed by the defendant clearly indicated request for final billing. This cannot be construed as negligence in the circumstances by the town nor does the fact that specific forms are now used for disconnect purposes elevate the matter on the facts before the court, to negligence by the Town, to which the court is to add the sum of $50,000.","The plaintiff sues the defendant town for water damage sustained to her former residence when frozen pipes burst. The plaintiff claims she told the Town Office to shut off her water supply and the failure to do so let to the damages being sustained. HELD: The claim is dismissed. 1) There is no evidence that the plaintiff gave clear instructions to the town to shut off her water. 2) The proximate cause of the damage was turning off the heat and power without ensuring that water line, toilets, and the water tank had been properly drained. 3) The plaintiff sustained no damages herself. She admits she negotiated the sale price of $50,000 with her daughter prior to any damage being sustained to the property. No adjustment had to be made to her daughter thereafter for any 'loss' occasioned. Any claim would have to be made by her daughter not her."
"The Workers' Compensation Board appealed the effective date of the chronic pain benefits awarded to a worker. That date had been found to be earlier than November 26, 1992. Appeal dismissed; although s. 228 of the Act may be applied to applications for injuries during the window period, the entitlement under s. 9 of the Chronic Pain Regulations restricted to an effective date in this case.","The Workers' Compensation Board appealed the effective date of the chronic pain benefits awarded to a worker. That date had been found on the evidence to be prior to November 2, 1992, which was the date set out in the legislation's transitional provisions (s. 228) dealing with injuries suffered during the 'window period.' appeal dismissed; s. 228 has no application to the payment of chronic pain benefits for injuries during the window period as no recalculation of benefits is involved; nor is entitlement under s. 9 of the regulations restricted to an effective date of November 26, 1992."
"The defendant farmer cut down some trees on his property. The farmer was a friend of the defendant farmer and was allegedly doing so to help him deal with a septic field problem. The farmers were concerned that the defendant, who had worked in forestry all of his life, might be involved in a joint enterprise. The defendant farmer offered to pay the plaintiff back for the trees he had cut down, but the plaintiff was not prepared to pay for the work himself. The plaintiff sued for general damages, claiming that the defendants were negligent in letting the trees fall and that they were not able to provide the plaintiff with the assistance they needed to mitigate the damages. The defendants appealed. Dismissing the claim and awarding damages against the plaintiff in the amount of $3,750 for tree replacement and $2,000 for tree removal, for a total of $5,750. The plaintiffs were not content to limit their recovery to the defendant as they feared he would not have assets to satisfy judgment. The court found that the enterprise was itself unlawful, and there was no reasonable foreseeability that the plaintiff would stray so far from the area discussed that a neighbour's property might be breached. The claimants were allowed their costs in the amounts of $1,234.90 in addition to the damages of $6,750 as against the defendant Renouf, in the sum of $4,750 to be awarded to the plaintiff for tree maintenance and $1 million for repairs to the defendants' septicfield.","The claimants live on property abutting the defendant Burrow's property. The defendant Renouf is Burrows' friend. As favour, Renouf attended the property while Burrows was away and cut down some trees that he was asked to cut. He went on to cut down several others that he felt were diseased/damaged. eventually realizing he had crossed the property line and cut down more than 17 of the claimants' trees. The claimants sued for the cost of replacing the trees with a comparable number of mature trees, the cost of removing the felled trees and to recoup for anticipated damage to their septic field. At issue was: 1. whether Renouf trespassed; 2. whether Burrows was liable for Renouf's actions (for 'hiring' Renouf or because they were engaged in a joint enterprise); and 3. damages. The claimants did not want Burrows helping with the tree removal, even if doing so would save money. 1. Renouf trespassed on the claimants' land and is liable for damages. That it was an honest mistake is irrelevant since trespass does not require bad faith or improper purpose. 2. Burrows is not liable. He was not Renouf's employer, nor were Renouf's actions foreseeable. It was a favour and Renouf went way beyond the scope of what he was asked to do. Burrows is not responsible for everything that flowed from their limited enterprise. The case law requires a degree of blameworthiness (a neglectful or unlawful enterprise) which creates a foreseeable risk of harm. 3. Renouf to pay the claimants: $3,750 to replace the trees with young, native trees (half the amount sought by the claimants), $2,000 for tree removal (half the quote submitted by the claimants since they refused to mitigate the damage by allowing Burrows to help). While Burrows had counterclaimed for damages arising from a confrontation between the claimants and his son, he did not seriously pursue it and it was dismissed. Costs of $1,234 awarded to the claimants (including $960.77 for disbursements). While the amount seems high, the case was large one and the counterclaim, although not seriously pursued, hung over the claimants' heads as they prepared for trial."
"The Plaintiffs claim $6,700.77 against the Defendant for water damage sustained while in transit from Edmonton to Nipawin, Saskatchewan in a one ton, 17 foot cube van owned by the Defendant. The Defendant denies responsibility for the damage and questions the quantum of damages sustained. HELD: 1) Whether the Plaintiffs are precluded from recovery by virtue of the contractual term acknowledging the equipment is water resistant and not water proof, as well as the posted disclaimers to this effect. The Court assesses its current value prior to damage at $100.","The plaintiff claims against the defendant for water damage sustained to their belongings while in transit from Edmonton to Nipawin in a one ton, 17 foot cube van owned by the defendants. The issues are whether the plaintiffs are precluded from recovery against the defendant by virtue of the contractual term acknowledging the equipment to be water resistant only as well as the posted disclaimers to this effect. HELD: The plaintiff shall have judgment for $250 plus costs of issuing the claim and service. 1) Notwithstanding that the plaintiff signed the rental contract acknowledging that the equipment was not waterproof and only water resistant, it appears from the last three sentences of the inspection report that water was entering at the corners of the door by virtue of the door not sitting flat at the corners. This defect would have permitted excess water to enter prior to being cleaned. Perfection could not be expected since it was acknowledged that the rental unit was not waterproof and some seepage may be expected even after the door had been fixed. Nonetheless, the sealing problem would have taken it beyond the acknowledgment of the unit being only water resistant. 2) The plaintiff acknowledges that the truck remained parked outside in heavy rainfall for two days and nights prior to being unloaded. This exacerbated the scope of the damage claimed since the water would have continued to seep in unabated for roughly six times as long as the trip itself took. The Court concludes that the defendant is only 20% responsible for the damages sustained to the plaintiff's possessions."
"HELD: The defendant was found not guilty of sexual assault, assault causing bodily harm, sexual assault and breach of recognizance. The complainant swore she tried to flee from the hotel room after the defendant punched her in the face five times as hard as he could, while he was still at large on his Recognizance entered into before a Justice or a Judge and being bound to comply with a condition that he not contact or communicate directly or indirectly with F.M., except through a member of the Law Society of Saskatchewan. The Court found that the defendant was guilty of both charges. On these facts, it is clear to the defendant that he knew the complainant was trying to leave the hotel and physically prevented her from doing so on several occasions, against her will. The Crown has proven each required element of the offence beyond a reasonable doubt and the defendant is guilty of unlawful confinement.","The complainant and the accused were in relationship and came to Regina where they stayed in hotel, drank, consumed cocaine and shopped. An argument ensued about missing shopping bag. The accused was charged with two counts of uttering death threats to the complainant; unlawfully confining the complainant; assault causing bodily harm on the complainant; committing sexual assault on the complainant; breach of recognizance in having contact with the complainant. At trial, both the complainant and the accused testified as to what transpired during the argument that resulted in the charges. HELD: 1) The accused was found not guilty of sexual assault. 2) The accused was found guilty of unlawful confinement. 3) The accused was found guilty of assault causing bodily harm. The Court did not accept the accused's invoking of self-defence pursuant to s. 34(1) of the Criminal Code. The accused admitted to striking the complainant with a closed fist five times as hard as he could and the force used was excessive. 4) The accused was found guilty of threatening to kill the complainant at the hotel. 5) The accused was found guilty of uttering death threats and breach of recognizance by contacting the complainant. The Court did not accept his testimony and denial."
"The accused was charged with four counts of sexual assault. The Crown alleged that the accused touched the victim with his hands and, while he was in a common-law relationship with the complainant, he also invited the victim to his home and touched directly a part of her body, including her penis, contrary to s. 271(1)(a) of the Criminal Code, and for a sexual purpose touching the victim's body with the tip of his penis and touching it directly and with the other part of his body contrary to S. 152 of the Code. During the course of the alleged incidents, the accused and the complainant both moved between residences, sometimes at different times, depending on whether the complainant was a student at the time of the offences, or whether the relationship was closer to the norm than it was for the accused's own children. The accused was also charged with sexual assault and assault of a person under the age of 16 years for the same reason that S. G. and his family moved from Halifax to Dartmouth, Nova Scotia between 2005 and 2009. HELD: The accused is guilty of both counts. The evidence from the Crown and the defence is that of the four witnesses who testified that they had been sexually assaulted by the accused. Based on the Crown's evidence, the court concluded that the Crown had not proven beyond a reasonable doubt that either the accused or the complainant committed the offences. Based upon the evidence presented at trial, the Court found that both of the accused were consistent with independent witnesses and that internal consistency of the testimony was found to be a factor.","The accused was charged with sexual assault and various other sexual offences with respect to his niece (who had spent weekends and summers with her father, who lived with his sister and the accused) when she was between the ages of 12 to 15. The accused denied the allegations, suggesting that, since the niece had not disclosed any of these matters until she was 17 years old, she had made up generalized allegation against him to stop her boyfriend from breaking up with her and then found it necessary to maintain the lie, tell her friends, her mother and the police and get more specific when pressed for details. He also argued that she was not credible because her testimony in court was inconsistent with that in the preliminary inquiry and although there were numerous persons she could have confided in at the time, she never told anybody about the alleged incidents but kept going back to visit her father. Accused found guilty of all counts. Although she was at times frustrated and unable to recall precisely, the niece's demeanour was consistent with a young person doing her best to be truthful and accurate in intimidating and embarrassing circumstances. Her evidence was both consistent with that of other witnesses and internally consistent and the inconsistencies with her previous statements were minor. The court found she had no motive to lie initially or during her trial testimony and the reality was that by making these allegations, she knew her father would be forced to move and would become estranged from his sister, her family would be fractured and the 'sister'-like relationship she had with the accused's daughter would end."
"The accused was charged with three offences under the Criminal Code, including operating a motor vehicle while impaired by alcohol or drug (Criminal Code s.253(1)(a)) contrary to s.255(1) and driving while disqualified (C.253)(4)). The issue before the court was whether the accused was pedaling his bike as his sole means of propulsion and whether the electric engine was operable. HELD: The accused was found not guilty of the charges of impaired driving and driving with a revoked or suspended licence. The issue was whether there were pedals on the accused's bike. The accused had stated on his web site that he was not driving a motor car as defined by the Code and therefore was not obligated to acquit him. The defence took the position that the accused should be acquitted of the impaired driving charge and the offence of driving while disqualifying. The offence of impaired causing was not defined in the Criminal code s.254(3)(a) as there was no evidence before the Court regarding the status of the accused’s driver’ s licence. HOLD: The offence was impaired driving. The officer was acquitted of both charges. The Crown had failed to prove that the Rookes bike was a motor motor vehicle as defined in s. 253(1(a)) of the Code. The Court was unable to decide whether the Rooks’ bike was motor vehicle or whether the Electric Motor Vehicle was operABLE. The only defence witness was witness to the accused dragging his feet while driving the moped. The police officer testified that he observed the accused pedaling the bike with both of his feet being close to the ground rather than resting on the floor board as the electric motor powered the bike.",The accused was charged with two counts being driving while impaired contrary to s. 253(1)(a) and refusal to provide a breath sample contrary to s. 254(5) of the Criminal Code. The Court had earlier acquitted the accused on the charge of driving while disqualified as there was no evidence regarding the status of the accused's driver's licence. At issue was whether the GiO cycle or moped which the accused was operating was a motor vehicle as defined by the Criminal Code. The accused asserted that his GiO bike was operated that night by pedaling it as the electric motor was not working and asserted that driver's licence was not required to operate the GiO bike nor was he required to put licence plate on it. HELD: The accused was found not guilty of the charges before the Court. There was no evidence that the electric motor on the GiO bike was operational that evening and the officer testified that he observed the accused dragging his feet while driving the moped.
"The accused was found guilty, after trial, of two counts of sexual assault contrary to s. 271 of the Criminal Code. The accused had been drinking and the two victims stayed at the accused's residence. While the two women were there, the accused touched the complainant's breasts and vaginal area, touching her and touching her back and shoulders. The complainant told the probation officer that the accused had a back problem that prevented him from gaining employment. The probation officer conducted two risk assessments and found the accused at low risk to re-offend, both sexually and violently. The Court of Appeal gave the accused a suspended sentence and 18 months probation respectively. HELD: The accused was sentenced to 30 months incarceration. 1)Three years is the appropriate starting point for a sexual assault on a minor, as the offence occurred in a singular incident and the parties had no previous relationship. There is no reason why the same starting point should not be used in a case such as this. 2)The accused is 61 years of age and had two previous convictions of sexual interference on children. He is also a high risk to offend again, as there has been 14 years since the last sexual assault. The offences occurred within the meaning of s. 742.1 of the Code, precluding the use of a conditional sentence order for a'serious personal injury offence' which carried a maximum penalty of 10 years, when that offence was prosecuted by indictment. 3)The court reviewed the factors set out in R. v. Ashby, 2009 SKQB 441, and the cases cited therein. It is the position of the Crown that the record of the accused establishes a pattern of sexual assaults. The defence took the position that the evidence established by the trial judge was insufficient to support a sentence of 30 months imprisonment or probation. 4)The Court reviewed other sentencing decisions to determine the range of sentence for sexual assaults similar to the facts in this case.","HELD: The Court sentenced the accused pursuant to s. 742.1 of the Criminal Code in force at the time of the offence that precluded the use of conditional sentence order for a serious personal injury offence, which included sexual assault. The Court found that the offences fell on the low end of the sexual assault spectrum as there was no skin to skin contact, the contact was brief and without violence or threats. The aggravating factors were that the accused had two previous convictions for sexual offences and that one of the victims had some cognitive disability. The accused was sentenced to a term of one year imprisonment for each count, followed by a term of probation of two years. The sentences were to be served concurrently."
"The sole issue is whether the plaintiffs and their lawyer should be disqualified from continuing to act for the plaintiff because of a conflict of interest. HELD: 1) The court found that the Holgates were acting in the best interests of the plaintiff and that it was necessary for them to have the sale agreements drawn up by their lawyer and that both sides use the same lawyer to save costs. At its core, the action between Pearce-Ell and the plaintiffs pertains to the terms of the agreement for sale, or at the very least, a related matter to the original retainer. That alone is sufficient to justify their disqualification. As the plaintiffs possessed relevant information from a former client which could prejudice them in the within action, disqualification is generally automatic. 2) There was no delay. The court applied the Martin test to determine whether the defendant and his law firm were ethically bound by the Rules of the Law Society of Saskatchewan to refrain from acting against former clients in the same or any related matter. It turned to the application of the Calico test, which examined whether the defendants had waived their right of objection either though delay in raising the conflict issue in timely way or by waiver of any confidentiality which would have attached the discussions at the July 2011 meeting.",HELD: The Court granted the application. It held that: 1) a solicitor-client relationship was created between the applicants and the defendants based on the evidence; and 2) that the applicants had not rebutted the presumption that they had received confidential information during the meeting that was relevant to the plaintiff’s action against the defendants. That finding was sufficient to disqualify them for acting for the plaintiff.
"The accused was charged with impaired driving and driving with a blood alcohol level over.08. He was acquitted of both charges. The Crown appealed the acquittals of the accused and the conviction of impaired driving. The accused argued his rights under ss. and of the Charter were violated because there were not sufficient objective grounds for the officer's suspicion. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. 1)The trial judge specifically found that the accused relied only on three factors in forming his suspicion. This is a finding of fact. There is no basis for disturbing this finding of facts. 2)The evidence was found to be reasonable and, therefore, reasonable. The trial judge's conclusions were not reasonable and there was a violation of the appellant's s. and s. of the Canadian Charter rights. 3)The officer was not deliberately trying to violate the accused's rights, but his dealings with the accused were less than what society should expect from a police officer who has been trained in the use of the ASD. The officer had reasonable grounds to suspect that the driver had alcohol in his body. The Court noted that the trial judge erred in finding that the officer relied only upon three factors: 1)His suspicion was not reasonable; 2)There was no evidence of any other reason for detaining the accused. The ASD demand was not based on reasonable suspicion. The reasonableness of the officer based his suspicion must be evaluated based on the facts known at the time the demand was made. The evidence was reliable, relevant and necessary for the Crown's case.  3)Where a trial judge has made a palpable and overriding error, but the appeal court must not substitute its view of the evidence for that of the trial court, the trial Judge categorizes the breaches as very serious. The impact of the breaches was significant. The case law was reviewed and the trial result was excluded from the remedy under s. 24(2) of the charter. The court found that, in the circumstances, the officer had not been properly trained in how to conduct an ASD demand on the accused, the reasonabliness of the reason was found in relation to the ASD demand. The fact this incident occurred at 5:12 in the morning is a factor that will be relevant to the trial's determination of the remedy. The issues are: 1),did the trial trial judge err in determining there were reasonable grounds for a reasonable suspicion to make an approved screening device demand on an accused? 2)Had the trial officer based her suspicion on three facts, including the smell of",The determination of whether the trial judge’s conclusion regarding the officer’s suspicion was reasonable was question of law subject to the correctness standard. The respondent conceded that the officer had the requisite subjective belief that he had alcohol in his body so the appeal centered on whether the objective test had been met. The appeal court did not find any basis to disturb the trial judge’s finding of fact as to the factors the officer based his suspicion of alcohol consumption on. The court noted the trouble with the fact that the respondent admitted to drinking alcohol that “evening” but the stop was at 5:00 am in the morning. The trial judge disregarded the respondent’s admission to drinking because there was no smell of alcohol and the trial judge said there should be if the consumption was recent. The court concluded that the trial judge erred in dismissing the alcohol consumption admission. A reasonable person would have assumed that the officer’s question was with respect to recent consumption of alcohol not an earlier irrelevant time. It was also found reasonable for the officer to believe the consumption was recent. The court concluded that a reasonable person standing in the officer’s place would reasonably suspect that the respondent had alcohol in his body. An answer by an accused person that they have been drinking was found to be stronger support for a suspicion than the smell of alcohol. Because the respondent’s Charter rights were not breached a new trial was ordered.
"The plaintiff applied for an order nisi for judicial sale of the property owned by the defendants. The Limitation of Civil Rights Act does not preclude the plaintiff from suing on the covenant because this is not a purchase-money mortgage. However, a judicial sale is required so that the plaintiff may apply to have the amount of deficiency set by the court. Otherwise, as provided by s. of the LCRA, foreclosure of the mortgage operates as full satisfaction of that debt. HELD: 1)The draft order sets out the proposed proposal for disbursing the purchase monies. It is from this draft order that certain rulings and directions are now provided. The proposed selling officer ought not to be the plaintiff's own counsel. 2)The setting of the reserve bid is an exercise of judicial discretion. The only information before the court as to the value of this mortgaged land is a partial appraisal. From this partial appraisal and with no information on the condition of the premises, setting a reserve bid at $100,000 may not reflect the best possible price that can be attained. 3)The realtor is permitted to reduce the list price to a amount of the interest reserve bid without further direction from the Court. It would be more fair to set the reserve b bid at an amount closer to $125,000. If the mortgaged lands cannot be sold at that amount, the plaintiff has leave to return the matter to court to seek a lower reserve bid, based upon evidence to support its position. Therefore, the proposed seller has been refused the right to proceed with this application. 4)Solicitor-client costs are assessed by the Court on notice of application pursuant to Rule 10-47(2).","The court gave leave to counsel for the plaintiff to file an amended draft order nisi. It made the following recommendations regarding the draft order: 1) the sale should be held under the direction of a solicitor other than the plaintiff’s solicitor; 2) that relying upon a partial appraisal and in the absence of information on the condition of the property, setting the reserve bid at $100,000 might not reflect the best price. Fairness demanded the reserve bid be set at $125,000 but the court set the bid at $115,000. If the property could not be sold at that price, the plaintiff was given leave to apply to the court for a lower reserve bid; and 3) Queen’s Bench rule 10-47(2) required that purchase monies are to be paid into court to the credit of the cause to be applied as directed by the court, including costs. Only after an application and service upon the defendant and after the court had assessed solicitor client costs could monies be disbursed to the plaintiff. Monies owed under the mortgage must be set out by the court on application. All of these matters may be addressed in one final proceeding, in the application to confirm the sale, if the judicial sale proved successful."
"The Crown appealed the conviction of the respondent member of the Regina City Police Service who pushed the victim of a sexual assault to the ground and kicked him in the abdomen. The Summary Conviction Appeal Court judge determined that the trial judge had erred in finding the respondent guilty, set aside the conviction and entered an acquittal. The Crown applies for leave to appeal the decision of the summary conviction appeal court pursuant to s. 839 of the Criminal Code. HELD: The appeal is allowed and the conviction is entered in the Provincial Court. 1) The trial judge did not err in his assessment of the force used by the respondent in the defence of self-defence or in considering the nature and extent of the threat. He found that the respondent's response to the assault was reasonable and was not in breach of s. 34(1) of the Code. The trial court judge instructed himself to disregard the evidence of the RCMP officer and to measure the force employed by the police officer to nicety. This is a form of modified objective inquiry. 2) In assessing whether there is an air of reality to the proportionality requirement, that is whether the responsive force was no more than necessary in all of the circumstances, the judge ordered himself to ignore the evidence and to take into account certain factors in his analysis of whether the level of force was objectively reasonable, such as the time period from which the force was used, the number of arrests, the relative strength and size of the parties involved and the applicable onus of proof.","HELD: The majority of the court granted leave to appeal and restored the conviction entered by the trial judge. The parties and court agreed that the provisions of s. 34(1) as they read prior to May 2012 were applicable. The issues were determined as follows: 1) the appeal court judge erred by misunderstanding the applicable test and inappropriately focusing on the respondent’s belief. The appeal court judge reviewed cases that led him to focus on the doctrine of mistake of fact, which was not argued by the respondent at trial and were not part of his grounds of appeal; 2) the trial judge accepted some but not all of the expert’s evidence, as he was entitled to do. The trial judge also reinterpreted the video evidence, which was found to be an error by the Court of Appeal. The trial judge considered the factors without weighing the use of force to a nicety. He was determining the objective reasonableness of the force based on the factors; and 3) the appeal court judge properly instructed himself on the standard of review but failed to analyze the decision of the trial judge based on that standard, namely, whether the evidence was reasonably capable of supporting the trial judge’s conclusion based on the evidence as a whole. The dissenting judge would have granted leave to appeal but then would have dismissed the appeal. The dissenting judge of the Court of Appeal found that the appeal court judge erred in his approach but reached the right conclusion that the trial judge erred. The trial judge ignored the fact that the encounter was only three seconds long and he mischaracterized the thrust-kick as extreme force. The respondent had to react quickly. The trial judge also erred in questioning whether the respondent honestly believed he was in danger of harm."
"The accused was charged with assault contrary to s. 266 of the Criminal Code and breach of probation by failing to keep the peace and good behaviour. The complainant was child protection worker employed by the Ministry of Social Services. She enlisted the assistance of Moose Jaw Police to enter the accused's apartment to investigate whether the children were in need of protection and if necessary to apprehend those children. The accused was released on conditions of bail that included that he was to have no contact with the complainant. She was not in hot pursuit of an individual, and had not seen the accused at all that day. The argument between the parties was escalating and the complainant and the officer both believed that the accused had contact with Ms. Bigsky and that she wanted the accused charged. The defence argued that the evidence obtained following the unlawful entry did not alter that situation. The issue was whether the accused actually had the legal authority to enter Ms.'s apartment suite and to apprehend the accused. HELD: The Court held that the officer did not have the lawful authority to allow them in. The fact that the worker had directed him not to have any contact with her does not alter the situation. There was no evidence that the father had any authority under s. 13.1 of the Child and Family Services Act or that he had any other legal authority. The evidence was excluded from the evidence.","HELD: The accused was found not guilty. The court found that the accused’s s. 8 Charter rights were breached. Pursuant to a Grant analysis, the court excluded the evidence obtained after the illegal entry of the accused’s home. The court found that the accused had not consented to the entry by the officer and the complainant and it was therefore a warrantless search. The officer did not have the lawful authority to enter the home on the basis of arresting the father as he was not in hot pursuit. The complainant had not obtained a warrant under s. 13.1 of The Child and Family Services Act to enter the accused’s home and therefore had no lawful authority to enter the home. There were no exigent circumstances to justify the search such as preventing the destruction of evidence as they already established that the person they sought was not in the house. The unlawful entry and search of the accused’s home was a severe breach of the accused’s Charter rights. The impact upon her was severe as the complainant gathered evidence and apprehended her children. The accused’s assault on the complainant was minor in nature and although not excusable, her offence was a reaction to a significant breach of her rights. The administration of justice was served by excluding the evidence."
"HELD: The accused was found guilty of impaired driving. The court found that the accused had reasonable suspicion as to her level of impairment. The delay in obtaining the sample was unreasonable. The police officer essentially decided that he had the reasonable suspicion to make the ASD demand, which would result in a Charter breach. The reasonable suspicion standard may be law, but it requires something more than mere hunch. The accused's explanation for not being able to leave the scene till some time after she arrested was not satisfactory. The need to take the tests as soon as practicable is to ensure that the test results are as accurate as possible at the time of driving. This delay was unreasonable according to the defence.","HELD: The court found with respect to the following issues: 1) it would not permit the defence to argue the s. 8 violation at the conclusion of the trial because it had not mentioned it in its Charter notice. The Crown disclosed the video-taped interaction between the officer and the accused to the defence at the outset and it was clearly pertinent to the issue of reasonable suspicion, but the defence failed to raise it; and 2) there were two periods of delay and the court was satisfied that the 77 minutes between arrival at the station and the taking of the second sample was satisfactorily explained. However, the court found that first period of 35 minutes between the arrest to the time of departure was not satisfactorily explained. The officer did not act expeditiously and the delay may have prejudiced the accused because when, as here, the readings are slightly above the legal limit, the tests need to be taken as soon as practicable to ensure that the accused’s blood alcohol content at the time of driving is determined accurately. The Crown was not entitled to rely on the presumption in s. 259(1)(c) of the Code."
