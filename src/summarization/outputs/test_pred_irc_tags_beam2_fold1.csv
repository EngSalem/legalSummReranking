1991canlii2445.txt,"This was an appeal from a judgment refusing to gram certiorari and other relief following findings by the respondent disciplinary panel that the appellant was guilty of professional misconduct. The appellant sought declaratory relief or relief under s. 24(1) of the Charter. Dismissing the appeal that (1) the Charter has no application to this self-regulating body; (2) the panel was properly constituted in accordance with the respondent's by-laws; (3) the panel acted within its jurisdiction; (4) there was no evidence of bad faith on the part of the panel members; (5) the panel complied with the rules of natural justice, and (6) the trial judge, in refusing to grant certiorari, made no errors in so concluding.","The appellant sought relief in the nature of certiorari, attacking the constitution and jurisdiction of the board and claiming it had failed to observe the rules of natural justice. He also alleged nine errors of law in his notice of appeal. Dismissing the appeal, that the appellant did not contend that sections 7 and 11 of the Charter create any new rights, but rather seeks the remedies available under s. 24(1) of the Code."
1991canlii4504.txt,"The defendants applied to exclude the plaintiff grandchildren of the deceased from their respective discovery examinations in connection with an action under the Fatal Injuries Act. Dismissing the application, that there was insufficient evidence to indicate there would be a violation of an essential of justice if the parties were excluded from hearing each other's testimony. The only evidence before the court was that the lines of questioning of each grandchild would be identical. This was insufficient to displace a party's inherent right to attend his co-party's discovery.",The plaintiffs brought an action against the defendants for alleged negligence in the manner in which the deceased was killed. The defendants applied for an order excluding the grandchildren of the deceased pursuant to the Fatal Injuries Act. HELD: The plaintiffs were ordered to attend discovery examinations and to be excluded from the evidence of each other.  1)There was no evidence before the Court that there would be a violation of an essential of justice if the grandchildren were not excluded from hearing the evidence. 2)The plaintiffs had not met the statutory requirement that they be present at the discovery examination. 3)The evidence did not suggest that there was a violation. 4)The court was satisfied that the burden of proof had not been met by the plaintiffs.
1993canlii3448.txt,"The applicant sought an order for certiorari quashing a decision of the trial judge granting an adjournment and a prohibition from hearing the trial. In earlier hearings, the Crown and applicant had each sought new trial dates to ensure procurement of witnesses for trial. The Crown sought to subpoena the victim to testify. Due to the delay in obtaining authority to serve an out of town subpoena in New Brunswick, the Crown was unable to serve the victim until three days before trial. The victim did not learn of the trial date until the day before and was unable to attend. An adjournment was granted. The applicant contended the trial judge had exceeded his jurisdiction. Dismissing the application. It is within the jurisdiction of the trial judge to deal with the issue of adjournments in accordance with the provisions of the Criminal Code. Jurisdictional error is not to be equated with error of law. Any decision to grant an adjournment is therefore within the court's proper discretion. If a remedy exists, it is by way of an appeal and not a prerogative writ. In any event, the sequence of events was sufficient to justify the granting of an adjournment. There was neither neglect nor laches on the part of the Crown.","The applicant sought an order of prohibition and certiorari directing that the judge and other provincial court judge could not hear the trial of the Queen v. Jessome. The judge granted the order and the applicant appealed. Dismissing the application, that the decision as to whether or not to grant an adjournment was within the jurisdiction of the judge, and that any decision in that regard was an exercise of his discretion within that authority."
1994canlii3880.txt,"The accused, a young offender, pleaded guilty to 16 counts of auto theft. He was sentenced to 6 months open custody and 2 years probation. Prior to being sentenced, he spent 13 days on remand and 2 months under house arrest under s.7.1 of the Young Offenders Act. The Crown appealed the sentence. HELD: Appeal allowed. 1)The accused was 15 years of age and had no record. He assisted the police once apprehended. 2)Although another young offender involved in these offences had received a sentence of 9 months open custody, uniformity of sentence was not a factor to be given great weight in comparing dispositions of young offenders. 3)The sentence was increased to 10 months open custody.","The Crown appeals the disposition arguing it is not fit having regard for the number of offences and the need to maintain the public's confidence in the administration of justice. HELD: Appeal allowed. 1)The dispositions for the auto offences which had occurred prior to June 21, 1994 were set aside and disposition of four months open custody and 18 months probation substituted. 2)The custodial disposition was not fit as a result of the large number of theft offences committed prior to receiving a disposition of 6 months open and 2 years probation. The factors weighing in this case were the age of the offender, his co-operation with the police and the fact that he had co-operated extensively with them throughout the course of the offences."

The defendant claimed that the aircraft crashed in 1992 due to faulty and substandard materials used in the manufacture or construction of the PA-12 package. The plaintiff claimed that his loss arising from what he was was negligence in the manufacturing and inspection of the aircraft parts. The defendants applied to have the action set aside as this Court has no jurisdiction, or to have it stayed on the basis of forum non conveniens. HELD: The application was dismissed. 1)There was a real and substantial connection in this case to both jurisdictions. 2)The plaintiff had chosen Nova Scotia as his forum.

1997canlii9808.txt,The appellant sought to have the support payments ordered by the chambers judge increased on the basis the income of the respondent was incorrectly estimated and should have been increased by adding the value of unsold grain on hand and 100 percent of his capital cost allowance. HELD: The appeal was dismissed with costs. 1)There was clearly no basis for adding the value of the grain on hand to the income of the respondent. There was no indication of any underhanded or inappropriate action on the part of the respondent and the grain was to be viewed as part of his gross income in the year in which it was sold. 2)There was no reversible error by the chamber judge in accepting the respondent's agreement to include 20 percent of his capital cost allowance as part of his income. What if any portion should be added must be based on the facts of each case.,The appellant sought to have support payments ordered by the chamber judge increased on the basis the respondent's income was incorrectly estimated and should have been much greater. The chamber judge accepted the appellant's offer to include 20 percent of his capital cost allowance as part of his income and accepted the trial judge's decision that commercial realities required the replacement of farm equipment. HELD: The appeal was dismissed with the usual costs on double Column V. There was no reversible error in the acceptance of the figure by the chambers judge in this instance.
1998canlii13707.txt,"FIAT. The applicant hotel was charged with five breaches of s.112(1)of the Alcohol and Gaming Act for failing to demand proof of age from minors. The hotel was convicted on one charge and the remaining charges were held in abeyance pending its appeal. The hotel sought an order staying the hearing scheduled by the Commission to review a decision of the Authority suspending the applicant's tavern permit for three days, pending disposal of the criminal charges. Grounds for a stay were that the Commission's hearing would prejudice its defence on the criminal charges because it will be necessary to call similar defence evidence with respect to each proceeding; secondly, it would be manifestly unfair to have a decision for a potential penalty imposed by the Commission which may be contradictory to a finding of fact and a determination of guilt on the same facts and information before the Provicial Court. HELD: The application was dismissed with costs. 1)The second ground raised a substantive issue and in any event was effectively disposed of by R. v. Wigglesworth. There was nothing inconsistent with the Commission considering a form of disqualification of the applicant's license or permit, while the state exercises its criminal law power with respect to the same set of facts. 2)The applicant failed to show any prejudice to its criminal defence. The disclosure of any defence in the Commission hearing will not result in any new facts that were not already known to the Crown.","FIAT. The applicant sought an order staying the hearing scheduled for November 19, 1998 until the Commission could review a decision of the respondent Authority to suspend the applicant's 'tavern permit' for a period of 3 days, until criminal charges arising out of the same facts were disposed of. HELD: The application was dismissed with costs. 1)There was nothing inconsistent with the respondent Commission's decision not to consider a form of disqualification of the appellant pursuant to s.112(1) of the Alcohol and Gaming Regulation Act. 2)The second ground raised a substantive issue as to whether the Commission's hearing should beopposed to a procedural one and in any event was effectively effectively disposed of by R. v. Wigglesworth. There was nothing unconsconsistent with the commission's consideration of such a form in s.11 of the Charter. There is nothing inconsistent or capricious about the Commission hearing being allowed to proceed. Where disqualifications are imposed as part of a scheme for regulating an activity in order to protect the public, disqualification proceedings are not the sort of 'offence' proceedings to which s. 11 is applicable. Proceedings of an administrative nature instituted for the protection of the public in accordance with the policy of statute are also not the same as 'offences' proceedings. 3)The applicant failed to show any pre-judgment prejudice to its criminal defence if the Commission Hearing was allowed to take place as scheduled."
1999canlii12687.txt,"The accused was charged with three offences under the Narcotic Control Act. The accused contests the admissibility of marijuana plants seized by the police. A police officer on highway patrol approaching the Manitoba border noticed a rental van with Ontario license plates stopped on the road. The police officer stated he had no reason to believe an offence had been committed and he approached the accused to see if he required any assistance. The officer stated it was his practice to offer assistance to motorists. The officer asked the accused if there were any problems with the vehicle and the accused answered he was looking for a place to relieve himself. The officer asked him where he was going and was told BC. He then asked the accused what he had in the back of the van and was told two cases of wine. The officer testified the accused was no longer free to go as he had believed the accused committed an offence under the Alcohol and Gaming Regulation Act. The officer searched the vehicle without a warrant and discovered 524 marijuana plants ranging in size from three to nine inches. HELD: The evidence is excluded. The police officer when he pulled up to the van was not in investigative mode but pulled up to see if he could offer assistance. The officer had no reason to suspect the accused was involved in a crime. When he asked what was in the back of the van the officer was fishing to see what answer he got. The Court is satisfied by the cases of Mellenthin, Young and Simpson, that if a person who has been detained cannot be asked what is in their gym bag or their pocket, how can a citizen who is not detained be asked a similar question. The s.8 right against unreasonable search and seizure involves balancing the citizen's reasonable expectation of privacy against the states interest in law enforcement. The police officer's question as to what was in the back of the van was unrelated to the purpose for which he had engaged the accused in conversation. The fact is the officer was attempting to determine what was in the back of the van and searching to see what answer he would get. The Court is satisfied the warrantless search began when the police officer asked the accused what was in the back of the van. The onus of a warrantless search is on the crown which has not established the search was authorized by law. The accused's right to unreasonable search and seizure was violated. The evidence was conscriptive in that the accused was compelled to participate in the discovery of the evidence as a result of the unreasonable search which began when the officer asked what was in the back of the van. The result is the admission of the marijuana into evidence would render the trial unfair and bring the administration of justice into disrepute unless the crown establishes that the evidence would likely have been discovered in any event. The crown suggested no basis upon which the evidence would likely have been discovered in any event.","A voir dire was conducted to determine the admissibility of marijuana plants seized by a police officer as a result of a warrantless search. The officer observed a rental van stopped on a grid road and approached the vehicle. The accused was asked if there were any problems with the vehicle and asked if he could empty his pockets. The driver complied and the officer asked if the accused was okay to call lawyer. The police officer asked the accused if he had two cases of wine in the back of the van and the accused said he did not. At this point, the officer indicated that he was looking for a place to relieve himself. The vehicle was parked on grid road near a tourist information booth and the police officer observed the accused standing at the rear of the vehicle with two large bags of marijuana. The van was stopped and the driver was asked to open the trunk of the truck and the vehicle was padlocked. At that point the officer noticed that one of the pockets of the accused's jeans appeared to be bulging and asked him if he would like to empty his pants. He asked the driver if there was a problem and the defendant replied that there was not. He then asked the officer what the marijuana plants were and the operator replied that the marijuana plant was in the van. The conversation between the officer and the appellant continued for approximately 15 minutes before the officer realized that the van was empty and the conversation ended with the officer asking the accused what he thought of the marijuana. When the officer saw the van, he approached the driver to see if he needed any assistance. The search was made without the requisite foundation of reasonable and probable grounds and the search was unreasonable as it was not authorized by law. The Court held that the officer was entitled to question the accused in an investigative mode and the only way to do so was to ask the question 'where are you going?' The officer was advised that the search began with the questioning of the driver. The court held that even if the officer read to the accused that he had read to him from a card he carries for that purpose, that by asking the question ""what is in back of a van"" Cst. McLaughlin was fishing to see what answer he got. The question has nothing to do with determining whether the accused required any assistance"
2000skca99.txt,"See also 150 SaskR 185.In 1998 the Court of Appeal dismissed the applicant's sentence appeal and appeal of his 1997 convictions which consisted primarily of sexual offences involving family members and others. The sentence of imprisonment was increased from 5 to 10 years. The applicant, on advice of two counsel, did not initially seek leave to appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada. He changed his mind 2 years later and sought an extension of time to apply for leave and for leave to appeal. The applicant brought an application for release from custody pending the SCC's decision. HELD: The application was dismissed without prejudice to reapply should leave to appeal be granted. 1)The application was premature. The application pending before the SCC was likely to be determined within 3 to 4 months. The Court of Appeal was not satisfied the appeal as a whole was not frivolous having regard for the requirements of s.679(3)(a) and (c). Some grounds for appeal would clearly fail such as the ground the Court of Appeal erred in failing to give reasons for its judgment. The new grounds of appeal were difficult to assess on the basis of the incomplete material before the court. 2)His continued detention was necessary in the public interest having regard for the whole of the circumstances. His release would undermine public confidence in the administration of justice.","The applicant was convicted of several sexual offences, consisting in the main of sexual offences involving members of his family and others close to him. He appealed against his convictions, and the Crown appealed. In 1998 this Court dismissed his appeal against his conviction and allowed the Crown's appeal, increasing the sentence from 5 to 10 years. In the meantime the applicant wanted to be released from custody. HELD: The application for release was premature. The Court of Appeal erred in failing to give reasons for its judgment. The new grounds of appeal are difficult to assess in their entirety, given the material before me. On the basis of that material, which is incomplete, I am not convinced the grounds relied upon have sufficient merit to satisfy the requirements of clause (a) of the section. The applicant's continued detention for the time being is not necessary in the public interest. The present release would be inimical to the public good, having regard for the whole of the circumstances. To do so would be counterproductive to the administration of justice given the history of the past proceedings, the current state of the present proceedings and the prospect, as the Court of Queen's Bench would see it, of the applicant succeeding either in having all of the convictions set aside or in having the sentence reduced to the time already served."
2001skqb148.txt,"FIAT. The infant complainants, who alleged sexual assault and other offences, failed to identify the plaintiff, a former police officer, and a stay of proceedings was entered in 1993.  The plaintiff commenced an action in 1994 for malicious prosecution, negligence, conspiracy and breach of Charter rights and claimed general, specific, punitive and aggravated damages, interest and costs.  Two motions to dismiss the plaintiff's claim were brought under Queen's Bench Rules 173(a) and 188, plus Rule 173(e) in the motion brought by the two chiefs of police. The plaintiff sought several orders in a third motion, two of which were granted summarily; one was adjourned sine die. The applicants submitted the action should be struck, except for claims based on malice, because it was not commenced within the time prescribed by the Public Officers' Protection Act (POPA). Referring to the 2 year and 6 year limitation periods prescribed by s.3(1)(d) and (j) of the Limitations of Actions Act (LAA), the applicants argued a retroactive order for further time was prohibited because a second limitation period had expired. The substantive issues were whether the plaintiff's claim was barred by statutory limitation periods; whether any limitation period should be extended nunc pro tunc; whether a portion of the plaintiff's claim failed to disclose a cause of action against five of the defendants because there was no allegation of malice; whether the plaintiff's claim in tort against the Government of Saskatchewan was barred by statute. HELD: 1)The time to bring the action was extended to September 10, 1994, retroactive to September 8, 1994. The applications to have the action dismissed as having been commenced beyond the statutory limitation period were dismissed. Whether the limitation period was extended was best determined at trial. It was not certain the limitation period was not extended as the statement of claim alluded to subsequent conduct by some defendants. As a general rule, the statutory limitation period created by s.2(1)(a) of the POPA commences to run when a stay of proceedings is entered pursuant to s.579 of the Criminal Code. Although a stay has been entered, actionable conduct of a public officer may continue. The only limitation period applicable in this case is s.2(1) of the POPA. Limitation periods are substantive in character, as opposed to procedural. The LAA does not supersede or replace s.2 of the POPA. The intent and purpose of the LAA is to avoid conflict with other legislation by removing its application from situations specifically dealt with by other legislation. The limitation in the POPA is not necessarily absolute. 2)The application by the chiefs of police to strike the claim in negligence was dismissed. The position in Beckstead v. Ottawa and Reynen v. Canada was adopted. The immunity in s.10 of the Police Act does not extend protection to police officers in general. 3)The claim in negligence against the other defendants was struck without prejudice to amend pleadings. The pleadings as to the Crown Attorneys were struck. They could not be saved, absent an allegation of moral turpitude implicit in malice, bad faith or improper purpose. 4)The Government's application was granted in part, such that all the claims were dismissed except those alleging conspiracy and Charter breaches. The Crown does not enjoy absolute immunity and must bring itself within s.5(6)(a) or (b) of the Proceedings Against the Crown Act which will depend on the particular facts. Immunity does exist for malicious prosecution and negligence. If the decision to prosecute is protected, then the conduct in carrying out the decision should be afforded the same protection. A claim for negligence could not be maintained against the government as employer where it was struck against the Crown Attorneys. Leave to amend pleadings was not entertained as the plaintiff failed to give advance notice.  5)The two applications based on Rule 188 providing for a determination of a point of law were dismissed as there was a factual component. An order should not be granted under Rule 188 in the absence of an agreed statement of fact. 6)The plaintiff demonstrated a prima facie cause of action; provided a reasonable explanation for the delay given the circumstances and his emotional and mental state at the time; and no prejudice will flow to the defendants as they had all actively participated in the litigation from the outset. The only reasonable course was to grant a retroactive order given the time, effort and money already expended. It was not appropriate to require the action be commenced anew.  7)No costs.","FIAT: The defendants brought a motion pursuant to Queen's Bench Rules 173(a) and 188 that the plaintiff's claim be struck because it was not commenced within the time prescribed by the Public Officers' Protection Act (PPA) and because a portion of the plaintiff’s claim failed to disclose a cause of action against the defendants because there was no allegation of malice. HELD: The motion was allowed with costs under double Column V and the order to be retroactive to September 9, 1994. 1)The plaintiff had a prima facie case. He knew then as much about the surrounding circumstances as he did when he initiated this action over a year later. 2)The limitation period was extended by 1 year. The plaintiff had not given an opportunity to tend to the issues that arose during the limitation period. The application to dismiss the claim was based on Rule 188. 3)Even though the applications are grounded in a limitation period, there still is a factual component and absent an agreed statement of facts there should not be an order granted under Rule 188 because it is a statute-barred action."
2003skqb487.txt,"At issue was the interim custody of the child and child support. HELD: Interim custody was given to the petitioner with access to the respondent. The respondent was ordered to pay interim child support in the amount of $193 per month. On an interim custody application, the Court must take into account the status quo.","At issue on this application is the interim custody of the child of the petitioner and the respondent. The parties began to cohabit in May 1998. In May 1999, the parties would switch the child every second day and that after that the respondent had access every weekend until November 2002 when the petitioner ended access. Since then, the child has resided with the petitioner, with access and visitation arrangements to the respondent, and has had a loving, stable relationship with her mother. Notwithstanding the instances of suspended access, the arrangements for access appear to have worked relatively well and appear to be in the petitioner's best interests. The petitioner admits that she loves the child and has exercised access to her on fairly regular basis. The respondent has had plenty of access to the child at various times from 1999 to 2003. HELD: 1)Interim custody is granted on an interim basis to the petitioner. The child has and does reside with the respondent with access to him, with visitation arrangements and a like amount on the first day of each month thereafter until further order. 2)The current status quo, namely, that the child had and did reside with petitioner, is consistent with the current situation. There is plenty of affidavit evidence to support this. The affidavits of the parties and their family members and relatives satisfy the court that both parties are loving parents to their child. The mutual love and acceptance demonstrated by the families and relatives of each party is self-evident and commendable. The court must also take into account the current state of affairs in the child's life, namely the current relationship between the parties, the respondent's access arrangements and the petitioner’s current access arrangements. 3)The court must take into consideration the current status status quo. Rather than focussing on the long-term best interests of the children, court focusses on the short-term needs of the party. As a result, interim orders usually reinforce the status quo in an attempt to reflect on the best interests and make a change in the circumstances."
2004skca100.txt,"The Superintendent of Pensions seeks leave to appeal an order staying six separate proceedings brought by him in purported exercise of powers conferred on him by s. 8 of The Pension Benefits Act, 1992. HELD: The application was dismissed. It was clear that the judge's finding was for procedural purposes only and was not intended to be definitive. The judge left it open to the Superintendent to proceed with his applications when the McMaster action was finished and that her decision respecting his powers was open to review upon further evidence being adduced.","The Superintendent of Pensions sought leave to appeal an order staying six separate proceedings brought by him in purported exercise of powers conferred on him by s.8 of The Pension Benefits Act. The subject matter of the action and the Superintendent's applications was certain monies that his estranged wife had paid into a pension plan and in which she had an interest by reason of judicial division of matrimonial property. HELD: The stay was granted upon the applications of the respondent corporations and was to remain in effect until an action against them was settled or otherwise completed. The respondent corporation appealed the stay. The application was dismissed with costs. The court found that the letter of August 6, 2002 was not a direction of the Superintendent, which may be enforced pursuant to s.16 of the Act. Section is to assist the Superintendent in carrying out his administrative duties and the letter is beyond the legislative authority of the superintendent and beyond his administrative capacity.

2006nssc158.txt,"The parties, who were the parents of two children, separated after a seven year marriage. For the five years since the separation, their parenting time with the children had been distributed on a two-week basis. In the divorce proceeding, the mother, who planned to remarry and relocate, sought to become the primary caregiver of the children, with the father to have access only every second weekend. The father sought to vary the parenting time so that both parents would equally share their time with the children. Current parenting arrangement to remain in effect with the parties retaining joint custody of the children; table amount of child support set. The parenting pattern followed for the past five years had been working well for the children and appeared to be serving their needs; the mother's proposal would lessen the children's time with their father and the father's proposal would also create a significant change for the children, removing their current home base.","The parties were married for five years and separated in December 2002. The parties lived separate and apart for more than a year prior to the commencement of the proceeding. The petitioner petitioned for divorce and the parties agreed to be designated joint custodians of the children. The mother sought to become the primary care giver for the children and for the father's access to take place every second weekend. The father sought to vary his parenting time so that he and the petitioner would equally share their time with the children, although the petitioner indicated she plans to remarry and relocate. HELD: The current parenting arrangements have been in place for 5 years and there is no evidence that a change is necessary nor would improve the parent/child relationship. The current arrangements would appear to be working and there was no evidence to support a conclusion a change was necessary nor a change would be detrimental to the children's academic or social well-being. The court found that the petitioner's suggestion that the father should reduce his access was in retaliation to his seeking to share equally their time. The Court ordered that the current parenting arrangement remain in effect with the exception of the change regarding Remembrance Day.  1)The current arrangements are working. The children have been following the same pattern in their interaction with their parents. There has been no suggestion that this routine has been harmful to them. 2)The petitioner's relocation would create significant variations in the parenting arrangement. The parents have, to a degree, a home base. They have a child base. 3)The parties have a common ground regarding parenting arrangements. The respondent's relocation will create significant variation in the parents' relationship. There is a significant change in the circumstances in which the children are living. The husband has a significant amount of time with his children. There are significant variations of the parenting arrangements in the past five years. The present arrangements have not created significant variations. The proposed change would not create significant changes in the parent's life base. 4)The children will retain the interest they acquired in their own pensions. Spousal support will be retained."
2007nspc30.txt,"Immediately after the complainant accused the defendant of stealing lumber from his property and directed him to remain off the property, the defendant entered upon the complainant's property in a state of anger to challenge the complainant's authority to issue such a direction. The complainant armed himself with a knife when the defendant entered the property, at which point the defendant grabbed a shovel, moved towards the complainant, struck him on the arm with the shovel and punched him in the ribs while he was on the ground. The complainant suffered a fractured ulna bone and a fractured rib. The defendant, who was charged with aggravated assault, assault by using or threatening to use a weapon and possession of a weapon, claimed to have acted in self-defence. Defendant found guilty of all three charges; conviction entered only on the aggravated assault charge. The actions of the complainant were justifiable as using no more force than was necessary to prevent a perceived trespass; the defendant, who was under no imminent danger, and could reasonably have retreated  upon seeing the knife, instead chose to arm himself with a shovel and strike the complainant.","The accused was charged with aggravated assault and breach of a recognizance. The accused was driving in anger toward the accused and entering his residence and striking the accused in the arm causing a fracture of his ulna bone. At the time of the assault, the accused suspected that the accused had taken some two by four pieces of lumber from his property. The defence evidence showed that the defendant had indicated that he intended to use a weapon for a purpose dangerous to the public peace. HELD: The Court held that the Crown had proven beyond a reasonable doubt all of the Criminal Code charges against the accused, being that of aggravated assault, by wounding the complainant and that of assault of the complainant by using or threatening to use the weapon, contrary to S.268(a); that of possession of a weapon dangerous to a public peace, and that the offence was committed in self-defence. 1)The accused's argument that he was justified in using force to prevent what he perceived as a trespass upon his property provided he used no more force than was necessary was not supported by defence evidence. 2)The evidence established that the appellant was intent in prevailing over the complainant's direction to stay off his property and assert what he unreasonably believed to be his right to enter thereon. The Court found the appellant to be in the role of an aggressor. 3)The Court found that the Court held the accused to be within the scope of reasonable force. It would have been reasonable for the Court to acquit the accused if the accused believed the complainant to be a trespasser and justified in use no more than is necessary to prevent the perceived trespass."
2008skqb287.txt,"The eldest daughter, 15 years old, her sister, 14 years old, and their brother, 12 years old, were apprehended from their mother on 2 March 2006. The Minister sought an order pursuant to s. 37(3) of The Child and Family Services Act placing the children in the care of the Minister until each child turned the age of 18 years. The mother opposed the Minister's request for long term orders for the three children, taking the position that the children were not 'children in need of protection' pursuant to s. 11 of the Act, and that the children should be immediately returned to her care. In the alternative, the mother proposed that the court make a short term supervisory order under s. 37(1)(a) of the Act, returning the children to the mother's care under supervision and conditions. The issues were: 1) whether the children were children in need of protection pursuant to s. 11 of The Child and Family Services Act; and 2) if so, the appropriate order to be made, respecting each of the children, pursuant to s. 37 of the Act. HELD: The children are children in need of protection pursuant to s. 11(a)(i),(v), (vi) and 11(b) of the Act. There shall be an order pursuant to s. 37(3) of the Act that the children be placed in the custody of the Minister until each child attains the age of 18 years. There shall also be an order with respect to access. It is well established that child protection proceedings involve a two step process. First, there must be a determination pursuant to s. 36(1) as to whether the child is in need of protection as that term is defined in s. 11. If it is determined that a child is in need of protection the next step is to determine the appropriate order among the options contained in s. 37.The Ministry had a legitimate concern that, based on a prior conviction for assaulting the child of a previous common-law partner, the mother's common-law partner posed a risk to the children. The Ministry acted appropriately by requesting the execution of a parental services agreement (PSA) with a condition therein that her partner should not have any unsupervised time with them. The Ministry had evidence that the partner and the mother breached the terms of the PSA. They received information from the school, neighbours, the children and, importantly, the mother herself, that the partner was having unsupervised contact with the children. The Ministry then proceeded to apprehend the children in light of its concern regarding possible harm to the children at his hands. The Ministry made an appropriate determination that the children were in need of protection as a result. If the court is wrong in the determination that s. 11(a)(i) is applicable, it finds that all three children were in any event in need of protection pursuant to s. 11(v), (vi) and s. 11(b) of the Act. The Ministry had evidence that the mother was having difficulties caring for the two children with special needs. The mother's actions could have, and likely did, impair the development of the children. Further, with respect to domestic violence, the mother herself characterized her relationship with the partner as emotionally abusive. Finally, having reached conclusions that there was risk to the children, the Ministry determined that there was no other adult person able or willing to provide for the children's needs as set out in s. 11(b) of the Act. The mother argues, in addition, that the children are no longer in need of protection. Thus, the court has to determine whether there has been sufficient change since March 2006 so as to conclude that the children are no longer in need of protection and can immediately be returned to the mother's care. Unfortunately, the court cannot reach that conclusion. Indeed, the mother herself acknowledged that it would be a slow process regarding unification of the children into her home. The mother continues to object to suggestions made by the Ministry to improve her parenting abilities. Although the mother appears to have come some distance in understanding she has problems, she continues to resist recommendations for change. She continues to fight the Ministry as opposed to cooperating with it. For these reasons, and the reasons set out above, the children continue to be children in need of protection pursuant to s. 11 of the Act. The Ministry seeks an order pursuant to s. 37(3) that the three children be placed in the custody of the Minister until each child attains the age of 18 years. The mother says that a more appropriate order would be a short term supervisory order pursuant to s. 37(1)(a) of the Act. All three children love their mother and want to continue to spend time with their mother. However, they are doing extremely well in their current foster placements. In this case, the age of the three children is a critical factor. The children are now 15, 14 and 12 years old. There is not much time for the mother to take all the necessary steps she needs to take before the children are returned to her and the time the children will be reaching the age of 18 years. The Ministry has not pursued a permanent order under s. 37(2) of the Act. Indeed, the mother and the grandmother should continue to play a substantial role in the children's lives. An order pursuant to s. 37(3) of the Act, placing the children in the custody of the Minister until each child reaches the age of 18 years is the appropriate order in this case. The mother will, with a long term order, have the ability to make the necessary changes in her life and, if she does so, apply for a variation of this order in the future.","The Minister sought an order pursuant to s. 37(3) of The Child and Family Services Act placing the children in the Minister's care until each child turned 18 years. The mother opposed the request for long term orders. The Minister took the position that the children are not 'children in need of protection' pursuant to S. 11 of the Act and that the child should be immediately returned to her care. The father of the children, who was also apprehended, took the positions that the three children were not 'properly' children under the S.11 of the act and that they should be returned to the mother's care. HELD: The Court held that the Minister was acting in the best interests of the 3 children. The Court ordered that the Court make an order under s.37(1)(a) respecting each of the Children under the Act. The Children were placed in the care of the Minister until the age of 18 years, with the order of Wright J. making an order for long-term orders."
2010skqb292.txt,"The plaintiff entered into a contract with the defendant for the sale of organic oats. The contract between the plaintiff and defendant stipulated that the oats were to be delivered at a stipulated moisture content. The defendant accepted the oats from the plaintiff and did not indicate any issue with the moisture content. In turn, the defendant sold the oats to a broker for shipment to Germany. When the oats arrived overseas, the German buyer rejected the oats saying they had heated and did not meet his required moisture content. The defendant refused to pay the plaintiff the amount owing under the contract and argued the plaintiff had failed to meet his contractual obligation. HELD: The contract was between the plaintiff and defendant. The defendant accepted delivery of the oats from the plaintiff and did not object to their quality. The evidence before the Court was that the defendant had no complaint with the moisture content of the oats at the time of delivery by the plaintiff. There was nothing in the contract between the plaintiff and defendant that allowed the defendant to transfer the shipping acceptance risk to the plaintiff. The resale of the oats to Germany was the defendant's responsibility and the plaintiff is not a party to the contact with the German company. The plaintiff was awarded the balance of the contract price, plus pre-judgment interests and costs.","The plaintiff, certified organic farmer, sold organic oats to the defendant who in turn sold the oats through a broker in Ontario to the ultimate destination being a miller in Germany. The German miller rejected some of the oats as having a high moisture content, the miller refused to pay the farmer and the defendant refused to supply the farmer with the oats. The plaintiff claimed pre-judgment interest on the sum of $51,608 from September 2006 until the date of judgment. HELD: The plaintiff was entitled to costs to be taxed on a party-party basis under Schedule I B, Column 3 of the Tariff of Costs. The testimony before the court established that the contract as described above was validly entered into between Wlaswich and Bio Canada. Despite Bio Canada's attempt to place the contractual risk between itself and the German millard, it has failed to do so.  1)The plaintiff was not a party to the contractual obligation which was incurred solely by the defendant. 2)There was no evidence that Bio Canada tested the retention samples that they had originally taken and found a problem subsequent to the delivery of oats. Although the Canadian Grain Commission requirements may be method of determining the appropriate moisture level, certainly those methods are not the only fashion in which the moisture content could be proven. 3)Despite Bio Canada’s attempt to put the onus of delivery of the right to deliver oats in acceptable condition to the German Miller upon Wlaske even though he is not a part of that contractual obligation, and thus entitled to full payment of the contractual price, the plaintiff was unable to prove that he had satisfied his contractual obligations to the company. The Court found that the plaintiff had not been bound by the contract. 4)The Court found there was no contractual obligation entered into by the plaintiff that puts that risk on him. On the evidence he has complied with that obligation. There is nothing further required of him in order to be paid the money owed. 5)The defendant was awarded costs of the action. The defendant was ordered to pay $61,608 to the plaintiff to satisfy the contract in the amount of $50,608. 6)The court found that there were no requirements for such testing in the contract between Bio Canada and the millard. The requirement was for oats of a certain moisture level. Although there was a contractual arrangement between the parties to contract, the requirements may not be the only way in which they could be proved."

2_1999canlii18445.txt,"The accused was charged with the sexual assault of his 13 year old step-daughter, which led to her impregnation. Blood was drawn from the complainant and her infant daughter, as well as the accused pursuant to a warrant. The accused challenged the validity of the warrant. He contended that a warrant could only be issued for comparison purposes with a bodily substance found in circumstances described in section 487.05(b) of the Criminal Code, which, he alleged, did not include a bodily substance created by virtue of the conception of a child. Admitting the evidence, that the DNA of a baby born as a result of a sexual assault is a bodily substance for the purposes of section 487.05(b) despite the fact that the child did not exist at the time of the offence.","The accused was charged with one count of committing sexual assaults contrary to s. 271 of the Criminal Code. The accused had consented to a blood sample being drawn pursuant to a warrant obtained from a Provincial Court judge. The warrant was not lawful, the actions taken by the police were not authorized, and the use to which the sample of his blood was put was illegal. The Crown sought to exclude the evidence on the basis that his s. and s. Charter rights were breached. The defence argued that the warrant was authorized by law and the accused's consent to provide blood samples was not required. HELD: The accused was found not guilty. The Court found that the accused had not demonstrated any violation of either his right to be protected from self-incrimination or his right not to be secure from unreasonable search and seizure pursuant to s8. 1)The Court found no violation of the accused’s right to a fair and just hearing and that the voir dire was not a sufficient remedy to exclude his evidence.  2)The accused had admitted that he had given written consent to the blood sample taken from the accused. He argued that s. 487.05 of the Code contemplates analysis of a sample taken by a suspect for comparison purposes with a bodily substance “found” in circumstances described in s.485(1) of the code. The evidence is ruled admissible for the purpose of the trial. 3)There was no evidence to support the defence position that the evidence could be restricted beyond the scope of s. 24 of the Charter. 4)The court found that there was no breach of either the accused s. s. 7 Charter rights or of his Charter rights."
2_2001nssc164.txt,"The applicant applied for an order directing the removal of a ground sign which violated its' Municipal Planning Strategy and Land Use By-laws. The respondents argued that the applicant's by-law violated their rights under s. 2(b) of the Charter. Application allowed; respondents directed to remove the ground sign; if the sign is not removed within fifteen days, the Town can enter upon the land and remove the sign at the expense of the respondents. Although advertising is a form of expression and falls within the scope of sec. 2(b) of the Charter, the purposes of the by-laws (maintaining a distinct aesthetic character of the downtown, minimizing adverse impacts on adjacent properties and reducing safety concerns) were both pressing and substantial and the limiting measures were rationally connected to the objectives. The by-laws had a minimal impairment on the rights of the respondents, as advertising was not prohibited but only limited.","The Town of New Glasgow made an application pursuant to s266 of the Municipal Government Act, 1998 S.N.S. c.18 directing the removal of a ground sign erected at 152 Provost Street. The by-laws prohibit the erection of signs in the downtown core zone. The restrictions regulate how and where the signs can be placed and does not prevent advertising, but only limits it. The issues are whether or not the provisions of the by-law offend s. 2(b) of the Charter and if they do infringe on the respondents' freedom of expression, are the limits imposed demonstrably justified pursuant to the Charter. HELD: The application was allowed and an order was issued pursuant to S. 266(3) of The Municipal Government act directing the respondents to remove the ground sign. The primary objectives of the By-laws are to develop and maintain a distinct aesthetic character of the downtown area, minimize adverse impacts on adjacent properties and reduce safety concerns. The limiting measures of the law are rationally connected to the objective and it effectively addresses unrestricted use of available space in a way that maximizes the effective use of signs. The principles of free and democratic society are inseparable from the Charter, and the limiting measures are rational and effective. They are not arbitrary measures which infringe upon the rights of the respondents. They do not violate the Charter's fundamental rights. They serve the purposes of the municipal government. The By-law is not a complete prohibition of signs and the primary objectives are to preserve the town's esthetically pleasing environment and to protect the individual. The Town's objectives are not restricted by the by law. The only restriction is that the sign is a third party sign and it is not restricted to a particular location. It is not an arbitrary measure which restricts the right of the respondent to express his or her views. The limited measures are rational connected to their objective and effectively address unrestricted use in a manner which maximizes their use. They reduce restrictions upon size in specific areas in accordance with its objectives. They prevent arbitrary restrictions upon the size of the sign in specific area in accordance. They also reduce the risk of injury to adjacent properties. The Court found that the restrictions on size are not unreasonable. The regulations are reasonable and proportionate to the infringement of the appellant's right of freedom of speech."

To require them to produce their financial records, in the absence of even the slightest evidence such production would disclose anything which would in any manner assist in determining the amount of child maintenance payable by the petitioner, would be totally unjust.","FIAT.

The mother had produced her income tax returns, prepared by her accountant, and a trial had been ordered. The court ordered the mother to produce all relevant information relating to her ability to pay maintenance and for her examination by the respondent to determine her income. The issue of child maintenance was adjourned pending fulfilment of the requirement that the mother, Janice Petersen, produce all information related to her abilities to pay the maintenance and be examined by the court to determine the income of her.

He entered into a settlement with the owner after she complained to the Real Estate Commission but misled and did not cooperate with the Commission. At the discipline hearing, his evidence was found not credible. The Committee gave a written decision outlining the reasons for finding him guilty of five counts of professional misconduct, but failed to provide reasons for the sanctions imposed, which included a two year licence suspension and hearing costs of $10,000. The realtor appealed both the findings of professional misconduct and the sanctions imposed. Applying the standard of review of reasonableness, appeal from the findings of misconduct dismissed; applying the standard of review of correctness, appeal granted on the issue of the sanctions imposed; matter remitted back to the Committee for reconsideration, based on the principles of sanctioning outlined in the decision.

In this case the plaintiffs should not be precluded from adducing evidence related to Walbaum's dealings with each of the applicants or required to segregate the evidence into two, three or four separate trials. Given the likelihood that the applicants will be required to attend portions of the trial in respect of the Walbaum Group in any event, severance would not necessarily result in a significant saving of time and expense.  2) The plaintiffs acknowledge that only relatively small portion of trial time (perhaps less than 1 day) will pertain to the claims against any one of the Sims, Gabriel or Dumurs. It would be unfair to require all of the applicants to participate in all of the trial when very little of it will be relevant to them.

2_2009nssc364.txt,"The parties entered into an agreement and registered it with the court in 2008. It provided for a combined spousal/child support payment of $2,000/month, which the husband was able to claim on his taxes because of the shared custody arrangement they were in at the time. At the time of their divorce in 2009, the wife wanted to incorporate the agreement into the corollary relief judgment. The husband argued a dramatic drop in his income forced him to abandon the parties' shared parenting regime, which resulted in significant tax consequences and justified a change to the agreement's support provisions to include only the table amount of child support. He argued the change in circumstances was so extensive as to undermine the integrity of the agreement. The evidence showed the wife needed $2,000/month in order to keep the bank from foreclosing on the home she occupied with the children, and to allow her to finish retraining so she could enter the workforce. The husband (a self-employed financial planner) argued the recent world economic crisis had adversely affected his business to an extent unanticipated when the agreement was executed (October 2008). The evidence showed that his focus was to solicit new business rather than cut expenses to make his business more viable. He chose to spend less time with the children to do this, which impacted the children and wife. The agreement is binding; the support provisions are to be incorporated into the corollary relief judgement. This concerns an agreement registered under the Maintenance and Custody Act. It is not an application to vary under the Divorce Act, but rather an application to overturn an agreement (although the distinction doesn't impact the outcome). The terms of the agreement must be given great deference. Will enforcing it reflect the parties' original intent and be in substantial compliance with the Act? The court looked at the second branch of the test in Miglin: whether something has happened that was outside the parties' contemplation when the agreement was made. Care must be taken to distinguish between circumstances giving rise to the agreement and those making compliance difficult. Taking judicial notice, the court observed the world economic crisis was the subject of much debate before the agreement was made, even if it was more extreme than anticipated. Here, the agreement: used strong, unambiguous language; was arrived at after extensive negotiations by sophisticated parties and with the assistance of counsel; and was very important to each party. To overturn it would not be in the children's best interests: they would lose their home and their mother would be unable to finish her retraining, adversely impacting her ability to provide for them. The change in the husband's circumstances are less likely to impact the integrity of the agreement than would his proposal to disregard it. The husband cannot unilaterally alter the agreement simply by deciding to change the parenting arrangements. His decision to work additional hours and spend less time with his children was not reasonable or fair and in effect transferred the financial and parenting burden to the wife (who was also managing significant financial and professional challenges).",HELD: The court found that the parties' separation agreement was not in breach of s. 17(7) of the Divorce Act. The parties had entered a parenting agreement which provided for a shared parenting arrangement. The petitioner now sought to have the spousal and child support obligations reflected in paragraph 9 of the agreement changed in as much as he seeks a corollary relief judgment that would not contain this obligation. There was no suggestion the parties did not enter a binding agreement or that they did not engage in binding agreement.
2_2009skqb516.txt,"In 1999 the plaintiff Bank granted the defendant, Wheatland, a credit facility of $500,000 plus an additional $20,000 in Visa Credit, all financed by means of a general security agreement pledging Wheatland's present and after acquired personal property with personal guarantees from two individuals. In April 1999 the Bank registered its security interest with the Personal Property Registry (PPR). Wheatland carried on business as a farm equipment dealer. Wheatland entered into dealership agreements with equipment suppliers (CNH). The Bank entered into a priority agreement whereby the Bank postponed its interest in favour of CNH. The issue in the present application is the Bank's priority with respect to credits for returned parts. The issues require an interpretation of the respective priority agreements between the Bank and the CNH companies. HELD: 1) The critical issue is the distinction between inventory and credits paid for by Wheatland and inventory and credits financed by CNH that Wheatland has not paid for. The objective of the contracting parties when they entered the priority agreement was that the CNH security would have priority over the Bank security as to Wheatland inventory supplied by the suppliers but not paid for by Wheatland or returned for credit. But once the supplied inventory was paid for by Wheatland, the Bank's general security on Wheatland's present and after acquired property would prevail.  2) The second issue only arises as the result of the first issue. It relates to the Receiver's right to require CNH Canada to repurchase parts inventory acquired from CNH Canada or its predecessors, notwithstanding that these parts were shipped direct to Wheatland by third party suppliers at the request of CNH. The issue arises pursuant to s. 50(14)(c) of The Agricultural Implements Act (AIA). While it is obvious that the direct ship parts are contractually excluded, the question is whether the direct shipped parts in this case were 'specially ordered' by Wheatland as stipulated in s. 50(14)(c) of the Act. The direct ship parts at issue consist of very ordinary articles such as nuts and bolts, washers, O-rings, seals, gaskets and bearings. The contractual provisions entitle CNH to refuse to restock direct ship parts. However s. 50(2) and s. 50(3) override the contrary contractual provisions in certain circumstances. It appears that the contractual arrangements were intended to enable CNH to opt out of its AIA obligations to repurchase inventory from a terminated dealer. The AIA does not permit or accommodate such opting out. The provisions of s. 50 appear to be designed to protect the supplier as well as the dealer. The Court is not persuaded that the parts in this case were in any way unique or specially ordered. They were commonplace articles of personal property required by a farm machinery dealer for its use and for use by its retail customers.","HELD: The court found that the goods/parts issue was the cornerstone of the priority agreement. The parties agreed that the items were to have priority over the TD security and that TD was obliged to pay certain amounts to the receiver on the understanding that the part was not returnable by the dealer. The court also found that there was no dispute that the TD priority agreement had been entered into by the parties and that the parties had assumed their respective rights and obligations relating to TD priority agreements. The issues relate only to the interpretation of the respective priority agreements between TD and the CNH companies and to the corporate policy of CNH Canada to refuse to restock direct ship inventory. The contractual provisions clearly entitle the defendant to refuse restock the inventory of a farm machinery dealer for its use and for use by its retail customers. The critical issue is the distinction between inventory and credits paid for by Wheatland and inventory and the credits financed by NHCC that Wheatland has not paid for in full. The defendant is entitled to set off credits against debits in other Wheatland accounts relating to the sale of whole goods and against goods supplied by New Holland and Case Canada Ltd. that the plaintiff has paid in full for. The plaintiff is also entitled to recover the value of the bank's credit on the security of present and after-acquired goods. The defendants are entitled to claim the same security as TD, but only on the basis of the specific reference to new goods, used goods and trade-in goods."
2_2010skqb444.txt,"The accused was charged under s. 5(2) of the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act after a highway traffic stop in which the accused was driving a motorhome that was found to be modified to carry cocaine and marijuana by a group of officers designated to search for drugs in vehicles. The cocaine found in the motorhome had an estimated street value of between 1.1 and 2.5 million dollars. The marijuana had an estimated street value between $471,000 and $733,000. The officer who stopped the motorhome saw it weave from the centre line to the fog line approximately six times. The officer testified that he suspected the driver might be impaired by alcohol. The officer stopped the vehicle and found no indicia of impairment by alcohol. The officer ran the motorhome on his computer system and found that it was registered to the driver. Another officer arrived on scene and approached the motorhome. The second officer noted a smell of fabric softener in the vehicle and testified that the accused appeared unusually nervous. The second officer testified that fabric sheets are frequently used to mask the odour of drugs. The second officer testified that he suspected the Vehicle Identification number on the dash had been tampered with because the rivets looked too new. He testified that he compared the Vehicle Identification Number on the dash to the number on the door and found they did not match. He later acknowledged that he was in error and later discovered that the numbers did match. The second officer commenced a search of the vehicle purportedly to search for paperwork that would confirm that the vehicle was not stolen. The accused was arrested for possession of stolen property. As the officer searched the vehicle, he noted signs that it had been modified. A drug sniffer dog was brought to the scene and had a positive reaction near the rear vent of the motorhome. The officers conducted a search of the vehicle which revealed that the motorhome hnd been significantly modified for the purpose of transporting illegal drugs. The accused was arrested for trafficking. The accused advised the officers that he wanted to contact a lawyer after he was arrested for trafficking. Another officer attended the scene to transport the accused to the detachment. That officer assisted with the search of the motorhome for approximately half an hour before driving the accused another hour and a half to the detachment where he was allowed to contact a lawyer. The accused argued that his rights under ss. 8, 9 and 10 of the Charter were infringed and sought exclusion under s. 24(2). HELD: Section 8 Ã» The motorhome had been extensively modified for the purpose of carrying contraband and could no longer be used as a motor home because its domestic systems had been disabled. The accused was entitled to no greater expectation of privacy in the vehicle than he would have had in any other passenger vehicle that he had the ability to regulate access to. The officers did not have a reasonable suspicion that the motorhome was stolen. The real purpose of the detention and arrest for possession of stolen property was to search the vehicle for drugs. The observations of the second officer on scene to support his reasonable suspicion that the motorhome was stolen were not capable of verification. He chose not to look at or consider the available information indicating the vehicle was not stolen including: the valid registration presented by the accused and the information from the CPIC query. Virtually all of the other observations of this officer had little to do with the possibility of a stolen vehicle and were indicators of a vehicle suspected of carrying contraband. In conducting the search, the officers were acting on little more than a hunch based on intuition. The search of the motorhome incidental to the accused's arrest for possession of stolen property amounted to a breach of s. 8. By the time the sniffer dog was deployed, the police had a reasonable suspicion that the accused was transporting drugs. However, the search of the motorhome and observations of its modifications were incidental to the arbitrary arrest of the accused for possession of stolen property, therefore, their grounds for the reasonable suspicion did not support the deployment of the sniffer dog. Section 9 Ã»  The arresting officer did not have reasonable and probable grounds to believe the motor home had been stolen when he arrested the accused. He had not carried out even a cursory investigation into the possibility that it might have been stolen. His inability to compare the two vehicle identification numbers accurately was willful blindness or flagrantly negligent. The accused was arbitrarily detained when he was arrested for possession of stolen property. The observations that lead to the reasonable and probable grounds to arrest the accused for trafficking were derived from his arbitrary arrest for possession of stolen property. The detention had little practical effect on the accused because he remained confined to the back of the police car as a result of the earlier arrest for possession of stolen property. Section 10 Ã»  The accused was not provided with an opportunity to retain and instruct counsel in a timely fashion. However, the police did not attempt to elicit any incriminating evidence from the accused during the time it took to get him to the detachment to call a lawyer. There is no causal connection between the breach of the accused's rights under s. 10(b) and the discovery of the drugs. The evidence was excluded under s. 24(2). The breaches of the accused's rights under ss. 8 and 9 were very serious. The officer was so determined to find evidence of contraband that he became blinded to the constitutional requirements of a reasonable suspicion for investigative detention and reasonable and probable grounds for arrest. His actions showed a flagrant disregard for Charter requirements. The deprivation of liberty and privacy resulting from the breaches was significant but not egregious. These two factors favor excluding the evidence. The charge is a serious one and involves a large quantity of drugs. The evidence is highly reliable and critical to the Crown's case. The truth seeking function of the Court favours admitting the evidence. On balance, the administration of justice would be brought into disrepute if the evidence was admitted and that standard is paramount.","The accused was charged with possession of cocaine and marijuana for the purpose of trafficking contrary to s. 5(2) of the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act. He applied for an order excluding evidence of marijuana and cocaine found in his motor home on the basis that his rights under ss. 8, 9 and 10 of the Charter were violated. HELD: The accused was found not guilty. The evidence was excluded. The accused's right to be secure against unreasonable search or seizure under s. of the Act was infringed. The Court found that the accused had reasonable expectation of privacy in his vehicle and that his right to retain and instruct counsel without delay under ss10(b) of s. 10(b), was not infringed when he was held at the roadside and 'booked in' before being given access to counsel."
2_2011nsca89.txt,"The defendant, who was in a very small apartment with two other individuals, got up from the couch and proceeded through a doorway behind the complainant, purportedly to use the bathroom. A few minutes later, the complainant found something wrapped around his neck and he was choked until he passed out. When he regained consciousness, he was lying on the floor with the defendant crouched over him. She left without saying a word and he later discovered that money was missing from his wallet, which he found under his back. The defendant was convicted of robbery when the complainant maintained that the third person in the room never left his sight and was still seated directly in front of him when he felt something being tightened around his throat. Although the third person's testimony supported the complainant's evidence, the defendant alleged that while she was in the bathroom, she heard a commotion and when she came out she saw the complainant lying on the floor and the other individual stated that she 'had the money' as she ran out the door. Not knowing what to do, she crouched over the complainant and lifted his head to see if he was okay. When he came to and said he was going to call the police, she ran because she was afraid of having her parole revoked. She appealed the conviction on the basis that the trial judge had erred in treating the conflicting Crown and defence evidence as a credibility contest. Appeal dismissed;  it was clear that the trial judge had accepted the complainant's evidence as to what had occurred along with the other witness' evidence as to who had strangled him and rejected the defendant's testimony and denials of responsibility. Although he did not specifically refer to the principles in R. v. Wry (1991) (SCC), the court was satisfied he recognized their importance and did not fall into the trap of simply comparing the Crown and defence positions without assessing the whole of the evidence. The complainant never wavered in his evidence that the other individual had never left his sight and was still seated directly in front of him when he felt something being tightened around his throat, which was supported by the other individual's testimony.","The appellant was convicted of robbery and sentenced to four years' imprisonment. She appealed her conviction on the single ground that the trial judge erred in law by treating the conflicting Crown and defence evidence as a credibility contest. HELD: Appeal dismissed. 1) The trial judge did not refer to the principles set out in R. v. W.(D.) nor did he refer to them in his judgment. 2) After a short trial before Nova Scotia Supreme Court Justice Peter M. Bryson (as he then was), the appellant sat on the couch across from the kitchen table where the accused was seated and that at some point shortly after their arrival, the appellant got up and proceeded through doorway behind the accused, purportedly to use the washroom. A few moments later, the accused felt something wrapped around his throat. He was choked until he passed out. The appellant said nothing and left the apartment. The accused and her friend, who were on parole at the time, went to the accused's residence. They called the police, who quickly apprehended the accused and apprehended her hiding under a bed at the accused’s residence. The police were unable to recover any of the money that the accused had lost. The Crown and the defence both argued that the ultimate issue was not credibility, but proof to criminal standard. The appeal dismissed. The judge recognized that the final issue was the issue of credibility but recognized that there was no error in his assessment of the credibility of the evidence."
2_2011nssc338.txt,"A small claims adjudicator determined he had jurisdiction to hear the respondent's application for a review of his rent increase. He adjourned the matter and asked that it return to him for a hearing on the merits. The appellant appealed. At issue was whether the appeal was properly before the court or premature. There was also an issue concerning the admissibility of an affidavit that wasn't before the adjudicator at the original proceeding. Appeal dismissed and matter returned for a continuation of the hearing on the merits before the same adjudicator. The court has no jurisdiction to hear an appeal on an interlocutory decision of this nature. There can be no appeal from the Small Claims Court until a final determination is made. Until this matter is decided on its merits, there has been no final determination. There are sound policy, as well as practical, reasons for this approach.",HELD: The Small Claims Court adjudicator made an error of law and was in excess of jurisdiction in determining that the Small Claims court had jurisdiction to hear the application of the respondent for review of rental increase. The adjudicator is now hearing an application for declaratory relief. The applicant seeks to have the matter referred back for a continuation before the same Small Claims adjudicator who made the interlocutory ruling on the preliminary motion. Application dismissed; application allowed; the adjudicator declined to entertain an appeal of the preliminary decision; the matter was referred back to the Small claims court for a continuance.
2_2011nssc500.txt,"The accused was charged with trafficking in cocaine and possession of cocaine for the purposes of trafficking. He was arrested within minutes of two officers observing what they believed to be a drug transaction. After watching the accused roam the street, they had observed him meet up and speak briefly with another person, whom he motioned to follow him and they proceeded by different routes, meeting up at the rear corner of a building. Although the area was dimly lit, one of the officers saw the accused remove something from a small pink plastic bag, which he then placed in the other person's hand. The encounter was very brief and neither officer observed any money exchanged. A ball of crack cocaine was later seized from the other person's jacket pocket. Although no drugs were found on the accused, a search of the area located a pink baggy of drugs stashed in a rock wall close to ground level. The defence argued that the drugs seized from the other person could have come from anywhere and constructive possession had not been proven with respect to the baggy located in the wall. Accused found guilty on both counts; the court accepted that the drugs found in the wall belonged to him and his possession was constructive, done knowingly for his use and benefit so he could return to the stash for his next transaction. The encounter described was consistent with low level street trafficking (brief and direct contact between buyer and seller, the passing communication and gesture to go to another place to avoid police scrutiny and the frequent disposal of the remaining drugs by stashing) and inconsistent with any other possible explanation. Moments after handing something to the other person, the accused's silhouette was observed in the area where the drugs were stashed and the court was satisfied that he had placed the drugs in the wall minutes before his arrest.","The accused was found guilty of two counts under the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act, s.5(1) and s. 5(2) for possession of cocaine for the purpose of trafficking. The accused had been in possession of the drugs for the purposes of trafficking when he was arrested. He was also charged with possession of a weapon contrary to s.4(3)(a)(ii) of the Criminal Code and possession with intent to supply. The Crown had argued that the accused stashed the drugs in the rock wall after the transaction and did so minutes before his arrest. The defence argued that this was not a public hidy hole but one chosen so it could not easily be seen one foot off the ground pushed into the wall just inside the corner of the building. HELD: The accused was convicted of both counts. The Court accepted the Crown's evidence on these practices and found the encounters between the accused and the seller were consistent with these drug trafficking practices and not consistent with any other possible explanations."
2_2012nssc10.txt,"Rule 77.03 – Liability for costsThe court found in favor of the respondents after a half-day chambers hearing. They sought solicitor-client costs or costs under Tariff C, with a multiplier of four for a total of $12,000 given the applicants' conduct and their failure to include important information in their claim. Held, party-and-party costs of $6,000 awarded to the respondents, using Tariff C and a multiplier of two. This matter was sufficiently complex and important to the parties that it required significant preparation and effort to prepare/review the evidence and conduct the hearing. While they did omit relevant information, the applicants' conduct wasn't so outrageous, scandalous or reprehensible that it warranted an award of solicitor-client costs. The dispute was acrimonious, but the litigation was generally conducted in a civil manner.","The Bowsers were successful as Respondents in Chambers application which was heard for full day on October 18, and half day in October 20, 2011. The Bowsers claim solicitor client costs or in the alternative costs under Tariff “C” of $3000 to which they say a multiplier of four should be applied for a total of $12,000 costs plus disbursements of $302.75. HELD: 1) As appropriate partial compensation toward the Bowsers’ expenses of litigation, and to do justice between the parties here, I should apply a multiplicate of two for $6000 in costs. 2) Rule 77.01(1)(a) and 77.02(1) of the Rules make it clear that the winning party in the litigation is presumptively entitled to partial compensation of their costs of litigation. Customarily this has been viewed as substantial, but not complete, indemnification of their expenses of the litigation. The dispute concerns to what extent there should be partial compensation."

At the second intersection he collided with another vehicle, causing serious injury to three people. He pleaded guilty to three counts of dangerous driving causing bodily harm; the Crown proposed an intermittent sentence, but the judge sentenced him to nine months incarceration concurrent on each count plus two years probation with conditions. The appellant appealed on the grounds the judge failed to consider the Crown's recommendation, failed to sufficiently state his reasons, and the sentence was excessive. Dismissing the appeal, that the sentencing power of a judge is not limited by Crown submissions, that the failure to state every reason does not constitute and error, and that in view of the appellant's record and other factors, the sentence was not excessive to the point of constituting a reversible error.",The appellant was sentenced to nine months incarceration plus two years probation on each charge to be served concurrently. He appealed his sentence of nine months in provincial court to be paid off and a sentence of three years probation pending his appeal of his conviction for dangerous driving causing bodily harm.

SaskPower sought an order pursuant to Queen's Bench Rule 547 to require the plaintiffs to post security for costs on the ground Wind Power was a non-resident plaintiff with little or no assets in the province of Saskatchewan. HELD: The motion was dismissed.  1)Rule 547 is limited to cases where the plaintiff is a non-resident or where the defendant is given a statutory right to apply. Wind Power is an Alberta company extra-provincially registered in Saskatchewan. Dove Industries, a Saskatchewan company incorporated specifically to develop a pilot project in Saskatchewan which did not proceed, had shareholders in the province. 2)Given the amount of the claim against SaskPower in the amount of $6,400,000 and the significant claim for costs in excess of $50,000 the Court would have granted the security for costs but for the delay by SaskPower in bringing its application. The action was commenced in April 1996. Unexplained delay by a defendant in seeking security for costs will prevent the grant of an order. To make an award for security for costs at this stage would place a burden on the plaintiffs and possibly prevent the action from taking place at the scheduled time.  3)The plaintiff was awarded one set of costs in any event of the cause.","FIAT. The defendant sought an order pursuant to Queen's Bench Rule 547 requiring the plaintiffs to post security for costs in this action on the ground that Wind Power Inc. was a non-resident plaintiff with little or no assets in the province of Saskatchewan and Dove Industries was a corporation incorporated specifically for a wind power demonstration project which did not proceed (and which is related to the subject matter of this action). The plaintiff alleged that the defendants knew that the action was not going to proceed quickly. The plaintiff brought this action to court arguing that such a move would place a burden on the plaintiffs and possibly prevent the action from taking place at the scheduled time.

The Court was required to decide whether the questions were the proper subject matter of a stated case.

The respondent raised a preliminary objection, arguing that the matter should not proceed by way of judicial review but that the applicant should be restricted to an appeal of the Rentalsman's decision under s.49(1) of the Residential Tenancies Act, and that the applicant had failed to do so within the prescribed 30 day limit. The applicant argued that she never received any notice of proceedings making it impossible for her to appeal within 30 days. HELD: Preliminary objection dismissed. The court ordered that the application be returned to the Chamber's list for a hearing on the merits.

At the hearing on the application, the executor, under cross-examination, admitted that he had 'done a disservice to the estate' and that his actions were a 'perfect example of why executors shouldn't have done what I have done.' The Chambers judge found that the executor converted estate funds to his own use and ordered the appellant to post security pursuant to the Act. The executor appealed. He submitted that the Court had not explicitly determined that he had committed waste, and accordingly there was no basis or foundation for an order requiring him to post security. Dismissing the appeal, that the appellant's own admissions under oath were sufficient bases for the Court's finding. This was also one of those rare occasions where solicitor and client costs on the appeal were warranted, as the executor's actions amounted to a serious dereliction of duty which the Court termed reprehensible and unconscionable.","The appellant was found guilty of a flagrant breach of fiduciary obligations owed by him as executor of the estate.

3_2000skqb75.txt,"The applicant sought to vary the 1995 consent judgment by terminating or significantly reducing spousal support of $2,500 per month. The respondent suggested the reduction should be limited to the amount she now received from her old age pension and CPP. Neither wanted a trial of the issue and submissions were primarily confined to the financial information filed. HELD: On-going spousal support was reduced to $1,750 per month from April until March 1, 2001 and $1,250 thereafter.  1)It is clear from Bracklow that each case involving spousal support must be determined on its own facts. The court must give due consideration to all the factors and objectives of a spousal support order set out in s.15.2 of the Divorce Act rather than focusing on one factor alone, such as income levels or self sufficiency.  2)There had been a material change in circumstances as the applicant, now 62, had lost his employment and suffered a debilitating leg injury while the respondent, now 67, was receiving an old age pension. 3)The 1995 agreement did not provide spousal support was either time limited or that it was to be varied if there was a substantial change in their future financial positions. However, it was unlikely the parties intended spousal support to continue indefinitely at $2,500 per month even after the applicant retired. The respondent was disadvantaged by the traditional marriage to a greater degree than the applicant as she devoted her full time to working in the home. She received her full share of their joint efforts in the form of an equal division of the matrimonial property. The economic benefits and disadvantages that flow from the marriage and its dissolution must be taken into account (Moge). There was no merit in the wait-and-see suggestion of the respondent. 4)No costs.","The applicant applied to vary a February 1, 1995 consent judgment by terminating or significantly reducing his obligation to pay further spousal support. The applicant's loss of employment and a debilitating leg injury had resulted in a substantial change in the circumstances. The respondent had been unemployed for most of her life and no longer received the substantial salary that she had enjoyed. Although she had university education, she stayed at home during the marriage to raise their three children. She earned $20,000 per year. She qualified for Old Age Pension benefits that are currently $417 per month. She was also entitled to receive her proportionate share of the applicant's Canada Pension Plan benefits. The combined current amount of these benefits is just over $775 per month for the applicant. The application before the Court was ordered that the respondent should continue to pay $2,500 per month until April 1, 2001. The court found that there had not been a material change in circumstances since the 1995 consent divorce judgment and that the applicant had met the threshold for a variation application by demonstrating there had been a change in circumstance since the order was last revised. Although this entitles the applicant to have the Court review his obligation, it does not follow that his obligation should be terminated."
3_2001skqb332.txt,"An appeal of convictions on two offences under the Excise Tax Act. Grounds for the appeal were summarized as lack of jurisdiction to proceed because of alleged defects in the summons; alternatively, the appellants were not properly advised of the charges they were facing contrary to s.11(a) of the Charter; Kimery should not have been convicted of an offence contrary to s.330 when the information set out an offence contrary to s.326 of the Excise Tax Act; there was no evidence to justify a finding that the Goods and Services Tax returns were not filed; unreasonable delay compromised their right to a fair trial; the demand for a return which was filed was invalid as there was no proof that it was signed by a person authorized to sign on the Minister's behalf. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. 1)Any defects as to the form or service of the summons were unimportant. The record clearly indicated the appellants appeared, pleaded and proceeded with the trial and made no objection. Kimery never requested an adjournment nor was there any suggestion that he desired to be represented by counsel. There was nothing to suggest he was confused or misled by the proceedings or that he did not understand the nature of the charges the appellants were facing. The trial judge did everything required of him in the circumstances. 2)Section 330 does not set out a separate offence but merely clarifies the circumstances under which a director can be convicted of the same offence as a party. This is no different than the situation of an accused being charged with a substantive offence under the Criminal Code on the theory that he is a party by virtue of s.21 of the Criminal Code. Kimery was sole director of the corporation during the period in question when the returns were required to be filed. It was open to the trial judge to find he must have directly participated in or at least acquiesced in the failure to file the appropriate GST returns. 3)There was evidence to support the finding that the appellants failed to file returns as required by s.326. The appellants filed blank returns. The trial judge found as a fact that there was no information relating to GST in any of the documents.  It was agreed the returns were not merely defective but did not qualify as returns at all. 4)The appellants were not denied the right to a trial within a reasonable time as required by Charter s.11(b). Pre-charge delay is not a factor which can be taken into account at this stage. The appellant, having failed to rectify the omission after reasonable opportunities, could not now say they were somehow prejudiced. Once charges were laid, the matter proceeded to trial within a reasonable time.  5)The decision in R. v. Swyryda is a complete answer to the argument that the field position of 'Director Tax Services Office' was not authorized to exercise the powers and perform the duties of the Minister. Also, s.24(2) of the Interpretation Act gives implied powers to persons acting under the authority of a minister of any Crown department over which that minister resides to undertake any act or do anything on behalf of the minister if that person is acting in a capacity appropriate to do the act or thing. Section 24(2) appears to be a codification of the common law, frequently referred to as the Carltona principle based upon the 1943 English case, and followed in R. v. Harrison where the SCC held that responsible and experienced officials will have the ability to exercise the Minister's authority in accomplishing Ministerial duties. The service of the demand in this case was not part of an explicit statutory or regulatory scheme of delegation. It falls under an implicit scheme of delegation and sub-delegation as allowed at common law and in accordance with the Federal Interpretation Act.  The execution and service of a demand to file a GST return is purely an administrative act.  It does not require the exercise of Ministerial discretion nor does it deprive any citizen of any right by restricting a right to appeal. The notice simply requires a taxpayer to comply with the statutory requirements of the Act. The fact that the true copy of the notice annexed to the affidavit of service contains a facsimile signature is not significant.",The appellants appealed their convictions for two offences under the Excise Tax Act. They argued that s.326 of the Act provided a definitive answer to the issue of authorization and that the demand for a return which was filed was invalid as there was no proof that it was signed by some person authorized to do so. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. 1)S.326 does not set out a separate offence but merely clarifies the circumstances under which a director can be convicted of the same offence as a party. There was no evidence to justify the learned Provincial Court judge's finding that returns were not filed. 2)The notice simply requires a taxpayer to comply with the statutory requirements of the act. The fact that the true copy of the notice annexed to the affidavit of service contains a facsimile signature is of no moment. 3)There was no error by the trial judge as to the reasoning of the appellants. The appellants were not dealing with an administrative act such as sending a notice or request to file a return in compliance with the relevant statutory requirements.

Immediately after the appointment of the receiver, the supplier presented a written demand for repossession of the books. The receiver refused, claiming that the books were subject to an agreement for sale to the institution's students and therefore, exempt.  A judge of the Supreme Court agreed and the supplier appealed. Appeal allowed; return of books or payment of their value to the supplier ordered. Although the goods were supplied as course materials, the institution's contract with its students obliged it to provide, in its discretion, textbooks and courseware needed for the program and the students acknowledged that it was necessary for the institution to change materials from time to time. The books had not been distributed to the students as of the date of the supplier's demand. The fact that the institution intended to supply certain materials did not give rise to a contractual obligation to provide these particular materials. Thus, the books were not subject to any agreement for resale within the meaning of the Act.","This is an appeal by a supplier from the refusal by a receiver to release goods to the supplier pursuant to s.81.1 of the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act. The single issue is whether the judge erred in finding that the goods were subject to an agreement for sale at arms' length at the time the supplier presented a written demand for repossession. ITI retained discretion under its contract with its students as to what course materials it would supply and the students acknowledged that 'it is necessary for ITI to change materials from time to time' and that such changes may be made during the course of the student's program. The fact that ITI intended to use the books which had been supplied for a module starting at the end of August but they had not been distributed to the students and remained on the shelves at ITI as of the date of receivership and the supplier's written demand in mid-August. The judge held that once ITI had decided what course material it would use, there was a binding contract to supply those materials to the school. He found that ITIs had selected the books in issue here and that, therefore, the books delivered to ITI were subject subject to a sale for sale. The Court held that the judge had erred by finding that once the school had decided which course materials to use there was binding contract for sale and that the school retained discretion to supply the materials. The court also found that the respondent retained discretion in its contract to provide the materials and the fact that it intended to supply certain materials did not give rise to a contractual obligation to provide those materials."
3_2002skca102.txt,"The accused applied for a stay of proceedings on the ground the Crown failed to provide adequate disclosure. In making disclosure, the Crown appended a copy of the respondent's criminal record to its affidavit. The defence then applied for a stay on the ground of perception of bias on the part of the Provincial Court judge because the respondent's criminal record was before her. The Crown appealed the order which prohibited the judge from continuing as trial judge in respect to the respondent's criminal charges of impaired driving, driving with blood alcohol levels exceeding .08, and dangerous driving. HELD: The appeal was allowed. The order for prohibition was quashed and the matter was remitted to the Provincial Court for trial. There is abundant authority that disclosure of an accused's criminal record to the court alone does not amount to an automatic disqualification of the court on the ground of apprehended bias, appearance of bias or other prejudice to the accused. The judgment in R. v. Peters is almost directly on point. The judge in this case said she had not read the record, she was not biased as a result of the information tendered at the pre-trial proceedings and the record was something she could put out of her mind as she did in all instances where she ruled evidence inadmissible. She was correct in these circumstances to dismiss the application for a stay and to decline to recluse herself.","This appeal is from an order made by a Queen's Bench judge prohibiting McMurtry P.C.J. from continuing as trial judge in respect of criminal charges against the respondent Herzberg. The respondent was charged with impaired driving, driving with a blood-alcohol level exceeding.08, dangerous driving and dangerous driving. He moved for stay of proceedings on the ground that the Crown had failed to provide adequate disclosure. The Crown filed an affidavit to show disclosure had been made. HELD: The appeal was allowed. 1)The appeal must be allowed. There is abundant authority that disclosure of an accused's criminal record to the court, whether composed of judge and jury or jury alone, does not amount to an automatic disqualification of the court on the grounds of apprehended bias, appearance of bias or other prejudice to the accused. 2)The matter was raised with the trial judge and the respondent was at fault by filing the criminal record in an affidavit. The evidence complained of was inadvertently introduced. If inadvertent, inadmissible evidence should automatically result in termination of the proceedings, then more egregious, and perhaps deliberate errors on the part of the Crown, or its witnesses, would necessitate no less result. 3)The appellant contended that the trial had not commenced as no evidence had been called and therefore it could not be said the trial was commenced. The trial judge dismissed the application, noting that she had not read the record and that the record was something she could put out of her mind as she put it on the record.

3_2004skqb374.txt,"FIAT: In 1996, the respondent was ordered to pay $600 per month as child support for his daughter. He now applies to reduce his support obligation and rescind the arrears which have accumulated. HELD: 1) In 1999, the respondent sold his ownership interest in a business and retained a one-third interest. In 2001, he was terminated from his full-time employment as a result of an unexplained absence from work after he received a suspension for insubordination. Since his termination, he has not obtained full-time employment. He has continued to work seasonally 3 months a year and earn the gross amount of $21,000. The Court found that it is the respondent's choice to work a minimum amount each year. It has been said that individuals, who are subject to support obligations, are entitled to make decisions in relation to their careers as long as the decisions are reasonable at the time having regard to the circumstances. The respondent's decision to work only three months a year and to possibly return to school is not reasonable. 2) For the purposes of this application, the respondent's income was imputed to be $40,000 and he was ordered to pay $328 per month as support for his daughter. 3) The sharing of the s. 7 special expenses should be based on the respondent's imputed income. 4) A retroactive variation of child support is warranted. The respondent commenced his application for variation in June 2002 and the chambers judge was of the view that any variation of support should be retroactive to September 2002.  In light of the fact the respondent's previous support obligation was tax deductible/tax inclusive, the petitioner may in fact benefit from a retroactive variation as the child support she will receive, pursuant to this order, will be payable on a net of tax basis.  5) Rule 608(2) provides that a successful party will be entitled to costs of a family law proceeding unless, pursuant to Rule 608(3), the successful party has behaved unreasonably or has acted in bad faith. The difficulty in the matter before me is determining whether or not the respondent has been successful. Although his support obligation decreases, his previous payment was tax deductible while his ongoing payment will be net of tax. It is very likely that the respondent's financial position has not changed as a result of the order. The Court also had grave concerns respecting the substantial delays in the proceedings caused by the respondent's unwillingness to provide financial disclosure. Costs were awarded to the petitioner in the sum of $750, as the discovery motion would not have been necessary had the respondent provided appropriate financial disclosure.","FIAT. The father of one child applied to reduce his child support obligation and rescind arrears which had accumulated under the previous order. HELD: The father was ordered to pay child support of $600 per month. The mother's decision to work only 3 months of the year and return to school was not a reasonable decision when he had a continuing obligation to provide support for his child. The court found that the father's choice to work a minimum amount each year and, if he should return, it will be his choice to attend school and severely limit his earnings for a significant period of time. The son's decision not to work 3 months per year was not only unreasonable but also a reasonable one when he has a continuing duty to provide child support. The child support should be based on his imputed income of $40,000 and the mother's own income $39,000. The costs of this variation application were awarded to the mother."
4_1993canlii6771.txt,"Appeal from [1993]TWL QB93106 QB93p55. HELD: There was no tenable basis for interfering with the trial judge's decision to award custody to the father. An award of $700.00 a month spousal support was not unreasonable having regard for (i) the length of the relationship (approximately fifteen years), (ii) the husband's wage (approximately $55,000.00 per year) and (iii) the fact that the wife had seldom worked outside the home.","HELD: The appeal was dismissed. Having regard for the governing standard of appellate review, found in Pelech v. Peleching and Talbot v.Henry, 1990 CanLII 57 (SK CA), [1987] 1 S.C.R. 801 at 824, and Talbots v. Henry (1990) 5 W.W.R.(SK CA) at 264), we can find no tenable basis for interfering with the trial judge's decision to grant custody of James (b.d. June 4, 1984) to his father, Harvey Fick. The trial judge chose to accept the testimony of the father's witness who testified as to relationships within the family over that of Tracy Fick's expert witness. He also found the mother's interpretation of events not to be credible."
4_1996canlii6648.txt,The applicant sought to have the law firm barred from acting for the plaintiff because a member of that firm had been active in representing the defendant prior to 1991 when the defendant changed lawyers following a change in government. This action was commenced after the change of solicitors and there was no suggestion that the subject matter of the action was ever the subject of any consultation between the defendant and its former solicitors. The applicant raised arguments about the confidential nature of its adjusting and investigation of loss claims and internal policy procedures and litigation strategies in relation to the denial of claims. HELD: The application was dismissed with costs to the respondent in any event of the cause. 1)In 1993 in a similar application respecting another member of the same law firm the judge ruled against the plaintiff. This was consistent with a similar attempt following the 1982 change of government.  2)The only identifiable strategy (or perhaps a tactic) adopted to date has been excessive delay requiring applications to force compliance with the Rules and two applications to deprive the plaintiff of its chosen legal representation. 3)Once it is determined that there is no actual knowledge of the case in question the onus to establish the existence of confidential information shifts to the party asserting the concern. 4)As the applicant is a public corporation it is doubtful it has or should have secret strategies with which to defeat persons claiming under its insurance scheme. It is entitled to have its own preordained policies in respect of disputed claims but if such policies exist they probably should be made known to the public for whose benefit the corporation exists. Also such policies may well have changed since 1992.,The applicant seeks to have the solicitor barred from acting for the plaintiff by reason of being consistent with a prior ruling involving a similar attempt to displace the applicant's present solicitors from certain litigation then existing following the 1982 change of government. HELD: The application is dismissed with costs to the Respondent in any event of the cause. 1)The applicant was consistent with previous court decisions involving similar attempts to dislodge solicitors by similar applicants. 2)Costs were to be paid to the respondent. 3)The respondent had no knowledge of the case in question and had not referred to it as a'secret' case.
4_2000skqb340.txt,"The plaintiff purchased a medical insurance policy from MSI for the time he expected to reside in the USA pursuing studies. The policy did not cover the periods he would be in Saskatchewan where he ordinarily resided with his parents. The plaintiff suffered chest pain following a water-skiing accident in August 1997 in Saskatchewan and underwent a thoracostomy for a collapsed lung while in Saskatchewan. He underwent a further thoracotomy in February 1998 while in the USA. MSI denied coverage arguing the plaintiff should have postponed the operation and returned to Saskatchewan for the surgery and that, in any event, the condition pre-existed the purchase of the insurance policy. The medical reports agreed that surgery was necessary. They also agreed it could be postponed for a time but there was disagreement over the length of any postponement or the patient's ability to travel home given the circumstance of a collapsed lung and the suspected but unconfirmed existence of a bleb. HELD: The plaintiff was awarded $26,864.46 plus costs, to be taxed. 1)The evidence that travel was dangerous and put the plaintiff's life in jeopardy was accepted. Therefore the plaintiff was unable to return to Saskatchewan for the surgery. 2)The exclusionary clause did not exempt MSI from liability for payment. The definition of a 'pre-existing condition' is not clear and does not operate to relieve MSI of its obligation under the policy to extend the benefits in question. The policy was in effect from August 1, 1997 to July 31, 1998. It was not raised in a letter confirming the dates of his coverage sent after the plaintiff had experienced the pneumothorax of which MSI had been informed.","The plaintiff purchased medical insurance policy from the defendant for the period of time he expected to reside in Chicago, Illinois, U.S.A. pursuing studies in optometry. The plaintiff had an accident while water skiing which he associated with the events of the water skiing engaged in by Hurd. Hurd required medical attention and surgery, necessarily performed in Chicago for a condition undetected earlier by qualified medical personnel and therefore not a pre-existing condition as that term is defined in the policy. HELD: The plaintiff was awarded judgment for $26,864.46.  1)The definition of a 'pre-existing' is not clear and does not operate to relieve MSI of its obligation under the policy to extend to Hurd the benefits for which he sues in this action. 2)The plaintiff was unable to return to Saskatchewan for surgery as the plaintiff was not able to return for surgery.  3)The Court concluded that the definition of an 'existing condition' was not clear. The definition of travel was dangerous and put Hurd's life in jeopardy. The Court found that Hurd could have returned to Saskatchewan if he wished. 4)Costs to be taxed were to be paid. 5)The terms of the insurance policy must be read in conjunction with the clause set out in Section V of the policy under the heading Exclusions and Limitations. If any covered person chooses not to return and is, on medical evidence, able to, on an emergency basis, able, return to Canada following an emergency treatment for a medical condition which requires continuing medical services or surgery performed outside of Canada, the expense will not be covered by this policy. 6)The fact that travel was hazardous and put the plaintiff in jeopardy did not operate the court's obligation to pay. The court found neither of the quoted terms could be construed to relieve the insurer of its obligations to pay"
4_2004skqb280.txt,"This was an application pursuant to The Inter-jurisdictional Support Orders Act for a declaration of paternity and child support. HELD: By agreement there was an order pursuant to s. 45 of The Children's Law Act, 1997 declaring the respondent the biological father of the child. The respondent does not currently earn sufficient income to pay child support. He was to advise the petitioner within 30 days if he receives an offer of employment or contract and if so, the terms of his employment including his gross income. 1) The respondent's ability to earn income is limited by his health to sedentary types of employment. There is no suggestion or evidence that his pursuit of education is unreasonable.  2) An individual who chooses to be underemployed or unemployed to avoid paying child support is 'intentionally underemployed or unemployed'. That is not the only circumstance envisioned by s. 19(1)(a) of the Guidelines. The Court adopted the reasoning of the Manitoba Court of Appeal in Donovan v. Donovan and the Ontario Court of Appeal in Drygala v. Pauli and found that 'intentional' extends to situations where a parent required to pay child support chooses, for whatever reason, to earn less than they are capable of earning. The fact that the parent chooses to be underemployed or unemployed, brings their situation within the meaning of 'intentional' and creates the circumstances envisioned by s. 19(1)(a). The reason for such a choice does not change the fact it is intentional, but it may impact on the Court's decision whether to exercise its discretion and impute income.","FIAT: This is an application pursuant to the Inter-jurisdictional Support Orders Act (ISSA) for a declaration of paternity and child support. The parties never lived together but had an intimate relationship which resulted in the birth of a child. HELD: 1) The applicant has not provided the necessary evidence to establish that any continued unemployment is unintentional or, if intentional, that it is reasonable in the circumstances and does not warrant the imputation of income. 2) The respondent's current income is below the amount normally required for Table support. Given his health, his education, and the fact that he has three other children, the court will impute income in the same fashion that it did before the introduction of the Federal Child Support Guidelines. While the applicant has other children to support, her ability to earn income in limited fields is limited by his health to sedentary types of employment. The applicant must lead cogent evidence to determine why the table amount would cause undue hardship. 3) The onus is on the party applying under s. 10 to establish undue hardship; it will not be presumed simply because the applicant had the legal responsibility for another child or children and/or because the standard of living of the applicant's household is lower than that of the other spouse. The evidence in this case does not support finding of intentional unemployment. The only issue is whether the Court can impute the child support pursuant to s. 19(1)(a) of the Guidelines on the basis he is intentionally under-employed or unemployed. The court must consider what is reasonable under the circumstances."
4_2004skqb516.txt,"The accused applies by notice of motion to quash the search warrants that were issued authorizing the search of his residence and to exclude any evidence obtained as a result of the search. The application alleges a violation of the accused's s. 8 Charter rights. HELD: Although the search warrants relied upon in this case are invalid and the resultant search of the accused's premises was a violation of his s.8 Charter rights, nevertheless, the facts and all the circumstances do not satisfy the Court that the admission of the evidence would bring the administration of justice into disrepute. The application to exclude the evidence is dismissed.  1) The Crown stipulated the s. 487 Criminal Code warrant is invalid. That leaves the validity of s. 11 of Controlled Drugs and Substances Act (CDSA). 2) The CDSA warrant is invalid in that it does not sufficiently or adequately state the offences in respect of which the warrant was issued. The search was therefore warrantless. 3) The evidence seized was non-conscriptive and so its admission would not render the trial unfair. 4) There was no bad faith, malice or intentional omission involved in the preparation of the warrants. The officer was negligent in failing to review the applicable sections and forms of the Code and the CDSA. The absence of any malevolent intention, while it does not bear on the validity of the warrants, has some bearing in the s. 24(2) Charter analysis. 5) The existence of reasonable and probable grounds to obtain the search warrants to search the accused's residential premises, together with the seizure of $750,000 in cash from the accused's residence as a result of the search, fulfill a number of the circumstances under s. 24(2) of the Charter.",HELD: The Court found that the search warrant issued to search the residence of the accused was invalid. The evidence seized from the premises was not supported by the evidence seized. The search was conducted pursuant to s. 487 of the Criminal Code and s. 11 of the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act. The accused was found not guilty of all charges. The Court also found that only if both warrants are found to be invalid the seizure of the property from inside the dwelling and the vehicles and equipment seized from surrounding premises are legal and valid. It was also found not to be in violation of the Crown's Charter rights.
4_2005skqb265.txt,"The respondent applies to vary his 1992 divorce judgment to fix support for his oldest son, who resides with him, retroactive to August 2004 and to terminate the payment to his former spouse for him. In March 2005, this Court made an order fixing the parties incomes and providing for ongoing support for this son of $129 per month. The sole issue is whether these orders should be made retroactive. HELD: It is fair and equitable to terminate the respondent's obligation to pay $670 per month for the oldest son effective August 2004 and to make the petitioner's support payments for him retroactive to that date.  1) This Court favours an approach to retroactive child support that leaves the decision to the discretion of the Court. In exercising that discretion, the Court must keep in mind the objectives of the Guidelines and take into consideration the circumstances of each individual case. 2) The Court must consider whether the application is interim or final, the objectives of the Guidelines, the same factors should apply to retroactive orders whether they increase or decrease child support and whether they are pursuant to federal or provincial legislation, and the individual facts of each case must be considered to ensure that parents are jointly responsible for the support of their children and the principles of fairness and equity are met. If the Court decides to order retroactive support then, pursuant to s. 15(6.1) of the Divorce Act, it must do so in accordance with the Guidelines. 3) By February 2004, the respondent had written to the petitioner, putting her on notice that he wanted the payment to terminate because the oldest son was residing with him. The petitioner refused even though the son had very little contact with her. There was no justification for the payment to continue. It is difficult to understand her failure to provide support for this son while at the same time insisting on the continuation of the respondent's payment for that same son, who was spending no time with her.","FIAT: The respondent applies to vary his February 28, 1992 divorce judgment to fix support for his oldest son, who resides with him retroactive to August 1, 2004 and to terminate the payment to his former spouse for August 2004. HELD: The Court finds that the Guidelines apply to applications for retroactive support pursuant to the Divorce Act. The Court also finds that there is a presumption in favour of retroactive child support to the date the order was granted and that the Court must exercise its discretion to determine when and from what date such an order is appropriate. The court does not refer to the impact of the Guidelines on the impact on the parents."

4_2010nssc85.txt,"The parties were separated and had difficulty communicating. They were together for eight years, and had two children (ages six and three). The husband had interim care and sought sole custody/primary care, while the wife wanted shared custody (50/50). She alleged the husband was abusive. The evidence showed she unreasonably refused to cooperate with him in relation to matters concerning the children. Sole custody/primary care to the father, with access to the mother as per the interim arrangement (every second weekend and other times). The mother was not credible and her allegations of abuse unfounded. If a party expects the court to believe there was domestic abuse, their position on parenting should reflect that. Shared custody arrangements require cooperation and the ability to jointly plan. Similarly, joint custody requires a level of cooperation. A requirement to make decisions jointly is not in the children's best interests if it leads to conflict and creates a potential power imbalance. Looking at the nature and extent of the parents' conflict, sole custody is appropriate until there has been an established track record of respectful parenting.",HELD: The court found that the children were placed in the sole care and custody of the husband. The children were in the wife's care and the husband's custody. The court ordered joint custody. Children were to be placed in his custody and custody. There was no evidence that the wife had rebutted the husband’s allegations that he would not allot funds from his pay directly to her while he was deployed. The wife had not responded to questions put to her under cross-examination. The Court found that there was no conflict between the parties’ views on parenting and that the child had been exposed to the effects of domestic violence when he was in the Navy.
4_2011skpc13.txt,"The accused was charged with impaired care or control. The Court dismissed the charge of care or control over .08 after a non-suit application. During re-examination of the final Crown witness, and after the defence had concluded its cross-examination of the witness, it became apparent that the disclosure package given to both the Crown and Defence did not include the bottom portion of the Intoxilizer Operator's Checklist because it had been cut off during photocopying. During the defence cross-examination, the officer testified that he could not recall if the accused had slurred speech. In re-direct, the Crown showed the officer the original Intoxilizer Operator's Checklist and the officer confirmed that it listed slurred speech in the observations section.  The accused applied for relief under s. 24(1) of the Charter alleging a breach of his right to make full answer and defence. HELD: The defence lawyer did not know the full content of the Intoxilizer Operator's Checksheet until after he had completed his cross-examination of the author of the document. The Court was satisfied that if the defence lawyer had been aware of what was noted in the document, he would not have challenged the officer on his failure to mention that the accused's speech was slurred because he would have been able to predict that such a question would result in re-direct by the Crown. The accused suffered actual prejudice in his right to make full answer and defence and a breach of s. 7 is made out. While the Court cannot attribute bad faith to either the RCMP or the Crown, the Court was satisfied that the prosecutor referred to the original checksheet during its re-examination of the officer without taking sufficient time and care to ensure that the original was what had been disclosed to the Crown and Defence. This is an exceptional case where the lack of full disclosure and the time at which it was discovered rendered the trial unfair in a way that can only be remedied by excluding the evidence under s. 24(1).","The accused applied to the Court pursuant to s. 24(1) and s. 2 of the Charter for remedies, which include a stay of the impaired driving charge, an order for a mistrial on that count, a direction that the Crown prosecutor be allowed to further cross-examine Crown witnesses and an order excluding evidence. The accused applied for a nonsuit. HELD: The accused's rights were infringed. 1)The Operational Checksheets and any reference to Exhibit P2 in the re-direct examination of the accused were excluded from evidence at this trial. 2)The accused suffered actual prejudice in his right to make full answer and defence as a result of a lack of full disclosure. This is not a case where bad faith was the cause of the lack of disclosure on the part of either Cst. Granrude or Mr. Stricker. The officer inadvertently failed to copy the full extent of the Operational Chechsheets, and the incomplete copy went to both the defence lawyer and the Crown Prosecutor. That said, the prosecutor referred to the original Checksheet during the defence's cross-examination of the author of the document. Had he known of the reference to slurred speech in the original document, he would have known that such a question would inevitably drawn the redirect examination which occurred in this case. In the context of how and when the failure in disclosure came to light, I am satisfied that the accused suffered an actual prejudice. His rights under s. 7 were infringered. 3)Had the officer known the full contents of the original check sheet, he wouldn't have challenged the Crown on his failure to make mention that Mr. Charron's speech was slurred. That is because, had he known the Full Content of the Original Checksheet, if he had taken sufficient time and care to ensure that the original was what he had in his file and what had been disclosed to the defence, the accused would not have been able to challenge the Crown's call to testify. 4)Had he known about the reference, the Crown would have referred to it in the Re-direct Examination. The Crown's failure to provide full disclosure resulted in an unfairness which could never be remedied through an adjournment and disclosure order or exclusion is necessary to maintain the integrity of the justice system"
4_2011skpc89.txt,"The plaintiff entered into a verbal agreement for the defendant to supply and install business equipment. The plaintiff alleged that the equipment sold never worked properly and sought damages for breach of contract and, in the alternative, damages for fraudulent misrepresentation, damages for negligent misrepresentation, and damages for unjust enrichment in the amount of $20,000. HELD: The Court dismissed the action as the plaintiff did not establish its case on a balance of probabilities.  The Limitations Act applies and the action was barred. The defendant agreed to supply and install the equipment which was done; there was no agreement to maintain, service or reprogram equipment. There was no material misrepresentation or fraud or concealment of facts, nor unjust enrichment.","The plaintiff sold business equipment to the defendant in September of 2007. The defendant alleges that the equipment sold never worked properly and seeks damages for breach of contract and in the alternative, damages for negligent misrepresentation and damages for unjust enrichment. The majority of the facts are not in serious dispute. The plaintiff operates the Whitewood Inn and in September 2007 entered into an agreement with the defendant to supply and install business equipment at the Inn. The equipment consisted of two groups of computerized business equipment which can be loosely categorized as the Cash Equipment and the Camera Equipment. The Cash Equipment as its name implies is designed to enter and receive payments for purchases at the inn, mostly restaurant purchases. Despite repeated efforts by the defendants to install the equipment, the equipment was never installed properly and is unusable. The Defendant supplied the equipment that they agreed to provide and in their view, and installed correctly. There was no material representation and no fraud. HELD: The plaintiff has not established any element of its case on a balance of probabilities. The Court found that there was no evidence of fraud or any concealment of facts that would allow the plaintiff's claim to succeed. The Limitations Act sets forth a finite period so that the party being sued can properly defend an action. It is precisely the sort of situation that occurred in this case that the Limitations act was designed to prevent. The court found that the defendant had completed his part of the transaction and the equipment had been in the exclusive possession of the plaintiff at all material times. There is no evidence that there is a material representation or any fraud. The Plaintiff has always made his payments to the plaintiff and the agreement has been in place for 66 months at an agreed rate of interest with the monthly payment being $445. The essential element of this Agreement is equipment rental only. Apparently they have not done this and despite continuing to make all the regular payments on equipment, have done nothing further to ensure that it is working for the purposes for which it was designed. The claim of the Plaintiff is statute barred as any agreement they had was entered into prior to October 2007. There were never written agreements between the parties. There are no maintenance, service, or other agreements which attach to this Agreement. When period of limitation has expired, the defendant should be able to assume that he is no longer at risk from stale claim. The evidence does not support this conclusion. The facts do not support the conclusion that the plaintiff is content with the equipment."

The defendants, Xtreme and Banga, brought an application pursuant to Queen’s Bench rules 7-9(1), (2), and 13-8 for an order that portions of the statement of claim be struck out as immaterial. The plaintiffs included in their pleadings regarding the first cause of action paragraphs that described the details of the plaintiff Bell’s business and real property, which he owned before he was hired by the applicants. Regarding the plaintiff’s pleadings respecting the second cause of action, they included details of the plaintiff Bell’s health condition at the time he was dismissed from employment. The plaintiffs pleaded a description of the contents of a meeting between them, Banga and his legal counsel in connection with the second cause, which, if proven, would establish that the plaintiffs were not responsible for acts of intimidation and that the defendants dismissed the plaintiffs for an improper and malicious purpose. The facts were material to the issue of wrongful dismissal and defamation. The other paragraphs that were considered immaterial by the applicants dealt with remarks made by Banga to the media. HELD: The court dismissed the application with respect to the plaintiffs’ pleadings about the plaintiff’s prior business and health condition. Similarly, the plaintiffs’ pleadings with regards to the meeting were not struck, nor were the paragraphs related to the reporting in the media as the plaintiffs were not certain of the exact words used by the defendant, and therefore could not draft anything at that time. It allowed the application respecting the pleadings that related to an individual who was not a party and struck the paragraphs in question as irrelevant and immaterial.","The plaintiffs commenced an action against the defendants, Xtreme Mining & Demolition Inc. and Leonard Banga, for wrongful dismissal, wrongful dismissal and a third cause of action, inducing breach of contract. The defendants were the only members of the Hells Angels Motorcycle Club employed by XTREME at the time of the action. The information contained in the paragraph, namely the number of Hell's Angels and dates of employment, was ostensibly pled by the plaintiffs as evidence in support of their claim that the defendant defamed them individually by making statements regarding the Hell’s Angels generally. The plaintiffs alleged that the defendants had induced the plaintiff to leave the company and that the plaintiff had threatened and intimidated other employees. The plaintiff’ s claim for moral damages was dismissed. The statements of media outlets reproduced at para. 67(a), (c) and (d) of the statement of claim describe the alleged defamatory statements with sufficient certainty, clarity and precision that the Defendants ought to be fully equipped to respond. The facts in para. 66 are material to the plaintiffs’ case as they establish a pattern of behaviour on the part of the defendant that raises the issue of wrongful dismissal.

The defendant physician had advised against driving after having an abortion.

The claims for repair was far in excess of those provided for in the lease which were the tenant's responsibility._____ HELD: 1)The landlord was entitled to a writ of possession since the tenants were in breach of the covenant to pay rent for more than two calendar months. 2)A trial of the issue was ordered to determine whether the tenants were in breach of covenants in the lease. The matter should not be decided summarily where there are questions of fact or law.

In June 1995 he began to experience pain in his back which slowly worsened until he was hospitalized in October 1995. He was diagnosed with a large central and right sided disc herniation. SGI denied his claim for income replacement benefits as a non-earner under s.117(1) of the Automobile Accident Insurance Act. In issue was whether the accident caused the disc herniation. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. The plaintiff had not met the onus on him of establishing causation on a balance of probabilities. Two family physicians supported his contention but the medical director of rehabilitation services for SGI and the orthopaedic surgeon who treated the applicant were both of the opinion the herniation was not caused by the accident.,"The respondent denied the applicant's claim for benefits contending the accident caused the disc herniation. The applicant applied for income replacement benefits as a non-earner pursuant to s. 117(1) of the Act contending that the accident did not cause the disc hersiation. He appealed. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. 1)The evidence showed that for a period of time after the disc sheniation, the applicant was unable to hold the employment he could have held at the time of the accident and would be entitled to an income replacement benefit if the heriation was caused by the accident. 2)The onus is on the applicant to establish his claim to the benefits on a balance of probabilities."

The plaintiff claimed the creditor wrongfully converted monies after a full and final settlement of his account for a lesser sum ($2,000 on a $15,600 account). He sought punitive damages for 'high-handed and malicious behaviour'. The plaintiff assigned his future crop insurance benefits and Canadian Wheat Board payments for application to his outstanding account in May 2001. In June 2001 a farmhand had an accident, while operating his employer's unlicensed vehicle. An occupant of the other vehicle in the accident was critically injured and died. The defendant says it was subsequently induced to settle the debt for a lesser sum by the plaintiff's false representation that SGI was suing him for between $200,000 and $300,000; that he would be found liable and would likely make an assignment in bankruptcy, making the account uncollectible. SGI initiated proceedings against the plaintiff in May 2002 claiming $17,660. The defendant contended that, if there was an accord and satisfaction, it was avoided due to mistake of fact or misrepresentation. HELD: The application for summary judgment was dismissed. A summary trial was ordered. Costs in the cause. Whether the plaintiff's remarks constituted an operative misrepresentation could not be resolved in the absence of cross-examination.","FIAT The plaintiff's creditor wrongfully converted monies after full settlement of his account was agreed upon. In addition, the plaintiff seeks punitive damages for the defendant's 'highhanded and malicious behavior'. HELD: The motion for summary judgment was dismissed. A summary trial was ordered. 1)The plaintiff had no money and with the impending action by SGI against him for the recovery of damages due to his unlicensed vehicle being involved in a fatal accident, he was not to pay anything to anyone given his impending bankruptcy. The defendant's manager advised the plaintiff they would not be prepared to accept $2,000 to settle $15,600 account if there was no law suit. It was only then that the plaintiff's manager said he would accept the offer. The plaintiff gave a statement to SGI that he was being sued for sure. The manager at the time said he advised him they were not prepared to forfeit the assignment if they were sure the court case would ever happen. The statement of fact honestly held by a person qualified to hold such an opinion cannot constitute an innocent misrepresentation founding an action for rescission. 2)Costs were ordered."

5_2008nspc12.txt,"A youth was arrested and charged with possession of a stolen motor vehicle after the vehicle arrived near the location of a pre-arranged drug transaction. The youth was later charged with possession for the purposes of trafficking after a strip search conducted at the police station resulted in a quantity of crack cocaine being removed from his underwear. A voir dire was held to determine the lawfulness of the strip search and the admissibility of the cocaine seized. The evidence is admissible; there was no breach of s. 8 of the Charter and, in the event that there had been a breach of s.8, the admission of the evidence would not bring the administration of justice into disrepute. The strip search was incident to arrest and conducted in a reasonable manner, being reasonably quick and non-invasive. There is nothing in the Youth Criminal Justice Act or the common law which requires that young persons be afforded the opportunity to consult with counsel or a parent or guardian prior to a search. This was real evidence, the admission of which would not affect trial fairness; any breach was conducted in good faith; the search was motivated by a sense of urgency; and significant efforts were made to respect the privacy and personal integrity of the young person.","A young person was charged with possession of cocaine contrary to s. 5(2) of the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act. The search was conducted to prevent the loss or destruction of drugs. The accused was the confirmed driver and sole occupant of the motor vehicle that had been reported stolen within the previous 48 hours. The police intercepted the stolen vehicle at the agreed upon location and arrested the accused. The strip search was lawful and there was no breach of s. 8 of the Charter. In the event of a Charter breach, the evidence would nonetheless be ruled admissible. The evidence sought to be excluded was 17.8 grams of crack cocaine. The Court found that the search was motivated by a degree of urgency and by the necessity to prevent loss of drugs and that significant efforts were made to respect the privacy and personal integrity of the young person. Although it can not be said that the accused was willing participant to the strip search, he reluctantly agreed to the search despite the refusal of his request to call counsel or his grandmother."
5_2011nspc8.txt,"The defendant entered into a plea agreement to a charge of sexually assaulting his young son but, shortly before the sentencing hearing, he applied to withdraw his guilty plea on the basis that he had not been fully informed of the nature of the allegations, partly due to a communication issue (English was not his first language) and partly because he had not viewed the video of his son's statement to the police prior to the plea. He did not accept the Crown's version of the incident and had not fully understood the effect and consequences of his plea, especially its effect on his ability to have contact with his son. The defendant argued that he thought the charge was based upon an incident where he had touched his son's penis for the purpose of showing him how to clean it as opposed to the Crown's assertion that he had masturbated his son and himself while viewing pornography. Application to withdraw guilty plea dismissed; the defendant's evidence regarding his knowledge of the facts alleged by the Crown in relation to the sexual assault was inconsistent and the court was not convinced that either his failure to see the video of his son's statement or a language/communication issue had prevented him from having a full understanding of the specific allegation of the sexual assault. The defendant's motivation for pleading guilty did not alter his knowledge and understanding of the nature of the allegation nor his understanding that he was, by his plea, admitting to that allegation.","The accused was found guilty of sexual assault of his son contrary to s. 271(1)(a) of the Criminal Code and further that he had committed sexual assault on his son while watching porn and masturbating while he was in possession of a computer. The accused had pled guilty to the sexual assault charge and had not seen the video of the complainant's statement to the police although it had been disclosed to his lawyer. The Crown alleged that the accused had taught his son how to clean his penis and that he did not accept the Crown version of the incident upon which the charge was based. HELD: The Court dismissed the application. The test in Nevin, supra, was not met and the application of the accused to withdraw his guilty plea was dismissed. The Court held that the evidence regarding the accused's lack of knowledge of the nature of the allegation was not credible and that the Court was not persuaded that the plea was not valid."

In particular, the accused sought disclosure of police reports, videotaped evidence, witness statements, warned statements regarding the multiple arrests and charges incurred by the victims and disclosure of their criminal records. In 2012 SKQB 543, the Court ordered production of the records. This decision deals with whether the documents should be produced to the accused. HELD: The documents were disclosed to the accused. The judge vetted the documents to black out words, phrases or numbers that have no probative value or where the privacy interest of the witness would have been unjustifiably affected.","The Court directed the Crown to seek from the relevant police agencies or prosecution service the police reports and witness statements of the accused and in respect of two Crown witnesses, the alleged victims of aggravated assaults, the accused, the complainant and the accused. The Crown also directed the court to provide updated criminal records for each of the two accused. HELD: The Court ordered the release of all 95 pages of documents to counsel for both of the defendants. The documents had words, phrases or numbers that had no probative value or where the privacy interest of the witness would have been unjustifiably affected. The Court also directed that the Crown provide updated Criminal Records for each applicant. The court ordered that the documents be made available to counsel and to Crown counsel in sealed envelopes. Copies of the documents were made available and to the accused in sealed envelope for delivery to the Court. The original packet of documents filed by the Crown will be retained by the Court until the trial is completed. The accused's interest in obtaining disclosure for the purpose of making full answer and defence will outweigh any residual privacy interest held by third parties in the material. This is particularly so in respect the criminal investigation files concerning third party accused."
5_2013skqb237.txt,"The accused was charged with one count of impaired driving and one count of operating a motor vehicle while his blood alcohol content exceeded .08, contrary to ss. 253(1)(a) and 253(1)(b) of the Criminal Code. After trial, the accused was found not guilty on both charges. The Crown appealed on the basis that the trial judge erred in law in finding that the accused's rights were violated pursuant to s. 10(b) of the Charter and by excluding the evidence pursuant to s. 24(2) of the Charter. The accused was stopped by RCMP at 2:47 am to check his licence, registration, and sobriety. There were no driving irregularities leading to the stop. The officer noted a slight smell of alcohol and the accused blew a 'fail' on the roadside screening device. The accused indicated at roadside that he would like to contact a lawyer. At the detachment, the accused was asked which lawyer he wanted to contact and the accused gave a name to which the officer misunderstood. A search for the misunderstood name by the officer did not result in any findings. A search for a second name given by the accused resulted in 60 persons and the officer did not pursue any of them. The officer suggested legal aid but the accused refused. The accused was never provided a phone or a phonebook. The accused subsequently indicated that he understood the waiver regarding legal counsel and that he did not want to contact one. The accused did not recall this waiver. The accused indicated that he provided breath samples right away because he thought the officer was in a hurry and he understood that if he did not provide breath samples he was automatically guilty. The accused's readings were .11 and .04. The trial judge held that the accused was not given a reasonable opportunity to exercise his right to counsel of his choice and that the appropriate remedy was to exclude the breath sample results. HELD: The appeal was not successful. Whether there has been a Charter breach and whether evidence should thus be excluded are both questions of law reviewable on a standard of correctness. There is both an informational component and an implementational component to s. 10(b). The implementational component was the one of concern because the accused was not provided with the opportunity to consult counsel of his choice. The appeal court had to determine who was responsible for that failure. The failure was that of the officer first in misunderstanding the lawyer's name, then in not asking the accused the name again, and then in abandoning the search of the second lawyer when too many names were returned. The waiver did not remedy the situation because the accused did not fully understand it and it was therefore not effective. The trial judge did not err in finding that the accused`s s. 10(b) rights were breached. The trial judge correctly applied the test for s. 24(2) and the finding that the admission of the breath samples would bring the administration of justice into disrepute was not set aside.","The accused was charged with impaired driving contrary to s. 253(1)(a) of the Criminal Code and with operating a motor vehicle while impaired by alcohol contrary to ss.253(1(b)) of the Code. The accused had consumed alcohol in such a quantity that the concentration thereof in his blood exceeded eighty milligrams of alcohol in 100 millilitres of blood. The trial was held on January 5, 2012 and on March 1, 2012, the accused was found not guilty of both charges. The Crown did not pursue the first count but did launch an appeal as to the second count. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. 1)The trial judge addressed the factors and correctly applied the test. The Court found that the trial judge erred in law by holding that the Respondent's s. 10(b) Charter right was violated. 2)The respondent's attitude was not fully comprehended at the time of the search. The failure to provide the accused with a list of lawyers and obtain a copy of the lawyer's name was compounded by the fact that the officer mistakenly understood the name to be 'Vaughn Taylor'. The officer did not return to the accused to check the spelling of the name. Rather, another name was sought from and provided by the accused. There was no error of law. 3)The accused's attitude and attitude were not fully understood. The respondent's failure to act fully informed the accused of his right to consult counsel of his choice. 4)The Court found there was no breach of the accused's Charter rights by excluding the results of the analysis of breath samples."
5_2014skpc78.txt,"Constitutional Law – Charter of Rights, Section 8Criminal Law – Sexual Touching – Child VictimThe accused was charged that she did, with a sexual purpose, invite a person under the age of 16 years to touch a part of her body contrary to s. 152 of the Criminal Code. The case involved alleged improper acts by the accused with respect to her eight-year-old son. The information regarding the alleged incident had been given by the accused’s son to her husband. The parties were separated. The husband apparently involved a child protection worker, who interviewed the child. After this RCMP were contacted. On the basis of an RCMP’s affidavit, an ITO was prepared and a search warrant obtained. During the search, the accused’s cell phone was seized and photographs were found on it. They showed the accused lying naked on a bed with her breasts and vaginal area covered and showing her son in his pajamas, holding a bottle of lotion and touching her legs, feet and stomach. Before trial, defence counsel requested that a voir dire be held for the purpose of determining whether the information to obtain the search warrant (ITO) was sufficiently defective that the warrant was invalid, thereby infringing s. 8 of the Charter and that the evidence obtained should be excluded. The ITO did not allege that the commission of sexual assault or the creation of child pornography. The search warrant though authorized a search for images of explicit sexual activity with a person under the age of 18, with emphasis on sexual organs and the anal region, which were not related to the offence alleged to have been committed and was not supported by the ITO. The warrant authorized the search and search of devices that included cameras capable of storing images or data and computers or any other electronic devices as well as conventional photographs depicting sexual activity as described above. However, the warrant to search specifically stated that the police were authorized to search for the said “things and to bring them before or some other justice”. When the search warrant was executed, about three constables and a social worker went to the accused’s home. She was in her bedroom and was very upset when advised that there would be a search of her house. She was arrested for obstruction when she objected to the police looking at a computer, taken into custody and removed from the house to a police vehicle. During the ensuing search, one officer looked through a computer, searching for pictures. He testified that he had done so as “previewing for relevancy” and had in fact, found relevant photographs. Another constable, who had not reviewed the warrant, searched the accused’s purse and found a cell phone, which was an item not included in the warrant. Other issues raised by the defence included that the information contained in the affidavit had not met the test of establishing that an offence had been committed and that misleading information had been included. The affidavit had identified that the search was for explicit sexual pictures that did not correspond to the information obtained from the child, who was the only source of information of the alleged offence. The information in the ITO came from a number of different sources, including the original complaint by the accused’s husband who was engaged in a matrimonial dispute with her. The husband had made a number of complaints against his wife in the past, none of which resulted in a conviction. The officer who swore the affidavit had not differentiated between information obtained by him and information from third party sources. The officer also set out information, including photographs, he had obtained from an Internet search that pertained to the accused as a lingerie model. The purpose of including the information was not made clear. The officer did not disclose in the ITO the detailed nature of the information disclosed by the child to the child protection worker, which would have had the potential to detract from the likelihood of an offence having been committed, such as the accused asking her son to massage her because she was sore. The child stated that he did not believe that he had been sexually abused. Furthermore, the child identified the photographer, but the police had not interviewed him. The issues before the Court were: 1) if the Warrant to Search was valid in view of the issues raised with respect to the completeness and validity of the ITO; 2) if the search of the computer conducted on the premises was legal, either because of the rules established in R. v. Vu or because of the wording of the warrant itself; and 3) if there was a breach or breaches of the Charter, should the evidence be excluded?  HELD: The Court found with respect to the issues that: 1) the ITO could not support the issue of the warrant by a justice acting judicially in considering the effect of the statements in the ITO regarding modelling and the omission of the information in the child protection worker’s report, that the husband of the accused had previously made allegations against her, the misleading statement in the ITO concerning the specific types of pictures that the officers would search for, suggesting an investigation of more serious activity not supported by the information provided. The Warrant to Search was a nullity and the search unlawful; 2) the search of the computer on the premises was illegal both in terms of its violation of the terms of the warrant and because the Supreme Court decided in Vu that a warrant must expressly grant the authority to search a computer; and 3) the evidence from the illegal search of the computer was excluded. The breach of the accused’s s. 8 Charter right was serious because of the negligence shown by the police in their investigation of the complaint, the drafting of the ITO and the execution of the warrant. The impact of the breach on the accused was serious. Her entire home was unlawfully searched as well. The effect of the search was emotional and upsetting to the accused and resulted in her arrest. The interests of society in the administration of justice will be protected because the exclusion of the evidence would not be determinative of the Crown’s case.","The accused was charged with sexual assault and invitation to sexual touching contrary to s. 152 of the Criminal Code. The accused alleged improper acts by the accused with respect to her eight-year-old son, specifically massaging her in the nude while an adult male took photographs of the occurrence. The search was conducted immediately on the premises, and without further authorization or authorization as is now required in R. v. Vu, supra, and the search was unlawful. The court found that the information to obtain the search warrant was sufficiently defective that the warrant was invalid, thereby infringing section of the Charter, and that evidence obtained should be excluded. The Court found that there was no evidence obtained by the respondent who swore the ITO in detail, and there was a modeling information included that added no information regarding the offence, but could suggest unwarranted sexual inferences."

For the plaintiffs, that the Vendors and Purchasers Act can be used to establish possessory title, and the plaintiffs had succeeded in demonstrating 'open, notorious and continuous possession' of the property for over 40 years.

The vendors and their predecessors in title have established a good and marketable possessory title to the lot in question. The evidence submitted by the vendors is so remote as to be frivolous and as such is not a valid objection to the title. HELD: The application is granted without costs. 1)There is no evidence of any claims by others against the lot. 2)The evidence submitted is so strong that even if find that possessory titles have been established by the required proof of possession for more than 40 years, this would not defeat the claim by the Crown under the Limitation of Actions Act. 3)There are no other proven records of possession by vendors or purchasers of the lands in question as there is no record of any conveyances to the land. The only evidence of such a possession is that of the deceased's daughter. 4)The respondent's claim is dismissed. 5)The court has expressed conflicting views as to whether possessory property may properly be determined under the Act. The issue is whether the respondent has established a 'Good and Marketable' title to a lot in this case. 6)The issue here is whether there is a 40 year period between the time the land was conveyed to the respondent and the present day. The respondent has not proven that possession for 40 years. 7)Even if the respondent had an interest in the lands, the evidence from the respondent indicates that such possession has been exercised since at least 1938 when the 15' strip was transferred from the Bond daughters to the appellant's widow. 8)The petitioner has not demonstrated that the land has been fenced and that there was someone who cared and it was my understanding that the gardens belonged to her. 9)The appellant has not shown that the respondent's daughter has any claim to the lands. The appellant's claim against the respondent is dismissed with costs. 10)The Registrar of the Registrar of Deeds has not reviewed the history of the land in question and there is nothing to suggest that there has been open, notorious and continuous possession by the appellant and his predecessors since 1961. The Registrar of deeds has reviewed the land and found no evidence that the appellant has established any such possession."

Two passengers were knocked unconscious. One sustained a bruised collar bone and the other required stitches to the head. HELD: The defendant was found not guilty. His action did not fall short of the standard of care demanded of ordinary prudent drivers faced with similar circumstances. The defence of due diligence was established with respect to the failing to yield. The second requirement of s.50(3) is that the defendant shall not make a turn until he has afforded a reasonable opportunity to the approaching vehicle to avoid a collision. It was found as a fact that that when he commenced his turn, any lawfully vehicle approaching from the opposite direction would have been able to avoid the collision.  1)Since the defendant turned across the path of the on-coming vehicle and since they came into collision, it would appear prima facie that he failed to yield as required by s.50(3). The right of way, however, is not absolute. As most regulatory offences s. 50(3) is an offence of strict liability which means that once it is established the defendant did the prohibited act, it is open to him to establish a defence of due diligence on a balance of probabilities. 2)Speeding by the second vehicle was a contributing factor. It could not be determined whether the second vehicle had only its parking lights on. Neither road nor weather conditions appeared to have been a factor. Alcohol was not a factor. Visibility was reasonably good given the time of day and the fact the intersection was lit by street lights. 3)When the defendant commenced his turn across the path of the second vehicle he was entitled to assume it was safe to do so as there did not appear to be any other vehicle close enough to the intersection to present a hazard.","This was a charge of failing to yield contrary to s. 50(3) of The Highway Traffic Act. The defendant was proceeding north on 15th Avenue when he stopped to allow several south-bound vehicles to go by. Before turning left, he saw another vehicle approaching from the opposite direction, this one a 1987 Ford Tempo driven by Adrianna Wormworth. HELD: 1)The defendant was entitled to assume that it was safe to do so, as there did not appear to be any other vehicles close enough to the intersection to present a hazard. 2)The evidence of the drivers and their passengers and to all of the circumstances did not suggest that the defendant had the right of way. It was not necessary to regulate his driving as if in constant fear that other drivers who are under observation, and apparently acting reasonably and properly, may possibly act at a critical moment in disregard of their safety and other users of the road. 3)The court found the defendant did not fall short of the standard of care demanded of ordinary drivers faced with similar circumstances, and that with respect to the failing or yield, the defence of due diligence was established."
6_2003skqb61.txt,"FIAT. An application by two siblings to act as personal decision makers and property guardians for their 68 year old mother, who suffers from Alzheimer's. Although their four siblings consented, the Public Trustee opposed their appointment as property guardians without a bond. This is one of a number of cases similarly contested by the Public Trustee since the Adult Guardianship and Co-Decision-Making Act was proclaimed July 15, 2001. Under the previous Dependent Adults Act, the Public Trustee was not served with notices of and did not intervene in applications for property guardianship and the practice for when a bond was required was ad hoc. The prescribed amount by regulation is $10,000. Arguments advanced by applicants generally is that a bond is expensive; in many cases the proposed applicants do not have adequate assets, which equal or exceed the value of the estate; the court has the power under the Adult Guardianship and Co-Decision-Making Act s.47(1)(a) to place any limitations or conditions on the guardianship it considers appropriate. HELD: The application to be appointed personal decision makers was granted. No order was made with respect to the application for property guardianship. The requirement for a bond is mandatory under the new Act as indicated by the use of the word 'shall' unless an applicant can qualify for dispensation under s.55(4). Under s.55(4)(b), it is no longer adequate for the nearest relatives to consent to the appointment. The only discretion is in s.55(4)(c) where the court may dispense with a bond in any other situation the court considers appropriate. Reading the section as a whole and bearing in mind both its purpose, context and historical evolution, the word 'appropriate' means suitable or appropriate for the end in view, which is to ensure the adult's estate remains intact during the guardianship, or can be restored in the event it does not. To consider this an appropriate case to dispense with a bond would be to largely negate the mandatory requirement for the filing of a bond contained in s.55(1).","FIAT: This application by two siblings to act as personal decision-maker and property guardian for their 68-year-old mother is opposed by the Public Trustee insofar as they request they be appointed property guardians without the necessity of a bond. HELD: 1) The application is in order and an order may issue with the authorities identified in the draft order submitted. 2) Leave is granted to the applicants to supplement the existing material should they see fit to do so. Leave to supplement is granted in the circumstances with the result the public trustee is prepared to consent to the application. If the applicant was from out of the Province, or was not beneficiary under the dependent adult's will, then the court may dispense with the filing of bond pursuant to Regulation to The Public Guardian and Trustee Act. 3) There is no evidence to suggest this is an appropriate case to dispense a bond as the applicants do not have adequate assets which equal or exceed the value of the estate to be administered. Almost every application would so qualify. 4) The court has the power under s47(1)(a) to place any limitations or conditions on the guardianship that it considers appropriate, and may also require the property guardian to have the appointment reviewed within specified period of time. The fact is this is a routine application by siblings, who are most usually the applicants, and to consider this an appropriate situation to dispose with a bond would be to largely negate the mandatory requirement for the filing a bond contained in s55(1)."
6_2006nsca89.txt,"Six years after the action was commenced, the plaintiff applied to add the defendant's Section D insurer in order to add a cause of action against an unidentified driver. The limitation period for suing under Section D had expired and no notice of the application had been given to the insurer. The chambers judge held that he had no discretion to grant the amendment and dismissed the application. The plaintiff appealed. Appeal allowed; the plaintiff is entitled to renew the application for the amendment in Supreme Court chambers on notice to the proposed, as well as the existing, defendant within sixty days of today's date; if not filed within that time, the application to add the insurer will be deemed to have been abandoned. The court had a discretion to grant the amendment even though the case did not fall within any of the specific situations set out in Rule 15.02 as the broad power to amend conferred by Rule 15 is not limited to the specific instances set out the Rule. Although there was no firm rule that notice to a proposed defendant was necessary in all such applications, generally the applicant should give notice to the proposed defendant (as well as the existing parties) where it is apparent from the circumstances that the proposed defendant likely has a reasonable basis to oppose being joined, such as being prejudiced in its defence by the plaintiff's long delay in asserting his claim.","The appellant sued the Halifax Regional Municipality for negligence. Years later, he decided he should amend his action to add a new claim against a new defendant. By then, the new claim was barred by a limitation period. He applied in Supreme Court chambers for permission to make the amendment. The chambers judge held that he did not have authority under Rules 15.01 and 15.02 to grant leave to the appellant to amend his statement of claim to add Lombard as a party and to assert the Section cause of action against it. The appellant appealed. Appeal allowed; the appellant was granted leave to appeal. The appeal was allowed; and the respondent was granted an opportunity to renew the application. The respondent appealed. HELD: Appeal allowed. 1)The Rules gave the judge a discretion to grant the amendment even though the limitation period had expired. 2)The appellant had no authority under the Rules to amend. The Rules gave him the discretion to do so. 3)The respondent was not given notice of the application to amend to be given to the proposed new defendant until the expiry of that limitation period, which was a strong signal of the risk of injustice to the defendant if the amendment was granted. 4)Limitations were not limited to the limitation periods. 5)The limitation period did not limit the discretion of the Court to grant an amendment. 6)The Court reviewed the history of amendments made in the past and found that they did not apply to this case. 7)The issue of prejudice was not whether the appellant's delay had prejudiced the defendant's defence. 8)Limits were not the focus of the submissions in this case either before the chambers judge or in this Court. The Court reviewed whether the specific language about cases involving limitation periods in the Civil Procedure Rules limits the general language about amendments in the Rules."

The chambers judge granted the application finding that the affidavit filed in support of the writ contained false and misleading information and that to allow the writ to stand would constitute an abuse of process. The issue on appeal is whether the chambers judge erred in inquiring into the accuracy of the facts sworn to in the proposed appellant's affidavit, in light of the provision in Rule 407(2) of the Queen's Bench Rules that provides that the validity of the writ shall not be questioned in any interlocutory proceeding where the affidavit substantially complies with the requirements of the Rule.

The ruling of the chambers judge raises an issue of considerable importance to the general operation of the writ of replevin as provided for in the Rules of Court.","The proposed appellants sought and obtained a writ of replevin in relation to some valuable breeding dogs which were in the possession of the proposed respondent but claimed by the proposed appellant appellants.

The trustee did not oppose the applicant's discharge and in its report dated February 8, 1996 stated that the there were no facts, matters or circumstances that would justify the Court in refusing an unconditional order of discharge. Now, more than 13 years later, there remains an unresolved issue concerning non-exempt equity in the applicant's homestead. The applicant applies for relief under s. 37 of the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act for an order reversing the trustee's decisions and restoring the property interest to her. The Court reviewed the relevant case law and found that only the value of non-exempt homestead equity existing at the time of the bankrupt's application for discharge can be attached by the trustee.

6_2011skqb386.txt,"The tenants were given short written notice to vacate their apartment unit. The tenants applied under the Residential Tenancies Act for the return of their security deposit and damages including moving expenses. The landlord was out of country at the time of the hearing but authorized by letter that the caretaker would attend the hearing to represent the landlord. The caretaker confirmed the tenants endured a protracted plumbing problem and restriction on bathroom use in the apartment. The hearing officer awarded the tenants half of the actual moving cost and 1 year of rent abatement. The landlord appealed the hearing officer's decision. The landlord alleged that he was not given the opportunity to be heard or to adequately respond to the tenants' claim as he received inadequate notice and alleged that the award of damages was unreasonable. HELD: The landlord's appeal was dismissed. 1) The tenant gave notice of his claim by two separate documents and the landlord showed no misapprehension of the tenants' position based on his written response. The landlord did not indicate in his letter that the caretaker had a limited role and the landlord could have sought an adjournment but did not.  2) Section 70(6)(c) of the Act empowers the hearing officer to order payment of damages where the hearing officer considers it just and equitable. The wording of this provision is broad and unconstrained excepting that the nature of damages that may be imposed must not be punitive. The decision on rent abatement was principled and to compensate the tenants for their loss of use of usable space. The award for moving costs was intended to compensate for inconvenience, aggravation and related expenses. The awards were reasonable both in fact and law and no reviewable error was made by the hearing officer.

6_2013skca2.txt,"The Crown applied for leave to appeal a Queen's Bench decision that set aside the convictions of the respondents, Chisum Log Homes and Lumber Ltd. and its sole director, Varga, for operating a forest products processing facility without a licence, contrary to s. 18.1 of The Forest Resources Management Act. The charges had stemmed from the manufacture of log-home packages by the company under the direction of Varga. The manufacture of these packages entailed the purchase of felled trees harvested by others from Crown lands. The logs were then cut at the respondents' facility into various lengths and notched, marked for construction and assembled into log-home packages. In the appeal to Queen's Bench of the convictions, the judge found that these steps in the manufacture of the packages did not engage the licencing provisions of the Act. HELD: The Court gave leave to appeal and allowed the appeal. Based on the definitions provided in s. 2 of the Act with respect to the words 'processing facility', 'forest products', and 'manufacture', it found that the operation of the facility by the company and Varga without a processing facility licence was unlawful as being contrary to s. 18.1. As the Provincial Court judge's conclusion was correct, the Court held that the convictions must stand and did not interfere with the fines and surcharges imposed upon the respondents.",The accused were convicted of operating a forest products processing facility without a licence contrary to s.18.1 of The Forest Resources Management Act. The accused were fined and ordered to pay a surcharge. HELD: The appeal was allowed and the convictions restored. 1)The Court of Queen's Bench misconstrued the provisions of the Act and in consequence misapplied them. 2)The judge who heard their appeal allowed it and set aside the convictions. He did so on the basis the steps taken in connection with the manufacture of the log-home packages fell squarely with the meaning and scope of the provisions. The Court of Appeal was of the view the trial judge misconstimated the provisions and in the opinion the judge mislied the Act.
6_2017skca42.txt,"Statutes – Interpretation – Limitation of Civil Rights Act, Section 2The appellants had granted a residential mortgage in favour of the respondent that secured a loan in the amount of $460,800. The loan was a consolidation of existing debt, part of which was the balance of $373,089 owed on the original loan that had enabled the appellants to purchase the land. The remaining $87,711 was non-purchase money financing approved by the respondent. The appellants fell into default, and the respondent commenced foreclosure proceedings when the balance owed had increased to $536,186. The property was sold through judicial listing orders and the net sale proceeds were paid to the respondent. As the proceeds were insufficient, the respondent sought an order entitling it to the deficiency. The Chambers judge considered s. 2 of The Limitation of Civil Rights Act (LCRA) and held that the amount of the deficiency should be $162,675.99. The issues on appeal were how the proceeds of sale should be applied against the mortgage balance and what the proper amount of the deficiency was. HELD: The appeal was allowed. The court reviewed the purpose and policy behind the LCRA. It then examined its conflicting decisions in Hrynewich Holdings and Andrews and held that the latter was a per incuriam judgment and therefore not binding and the approach set out in Hrynewich would guide the disposition of this appeal. Therefore, it found with respect to each issue that the holding in Hrynewich meant that payments should be allocated on a pro-rated basis to purchase money and non-purchase money debt balances and the proper amount of the deficiency to which the respondent was entitled to judgment against the appellants was $31,160.23.","HELD: The appeal was allowed. The court found that the sale proceeds should be applied against the mortgage balance and the non-purchase money portion of the loan. The respondent was entitled to take out a deficiency judgment in the amount of $31,160.23 against the appellants. The Chambers judge considered s.2 of the Saskatchewan Real Property Security Law and held that the amount owed to the mortgagee was $162,675. This amount was determined by deducting from the total debt the value of the land. The decision accords with the policy behind the legislation as set out in this judgment. Hrynewich Holdings was awarded the balance of the balance owed against the purchase money portion. The appellant was awarded a deficiency judgement of $186,293.00. The Court of Appeal remitted the matter to Queen's Bench. The appeal is allowed with respect to the amount and amount of the deficiency judgment. The issue is how should the proceeds of the sale be applied to the balance, and b) what is the proper amount of deficiency judgment? Hrynich Holdings accords well with the Policy behind the Saskatchewan Limitation of Civil Rights Act. The appellants were awarded a judgment of $717,275 (46/100x717.275) against the respondent. The balance owed was reduced to $142,582.48 and the vendor's balance was increased to $132,582 (Sask CA) at the time of the Chambers hearing. The parties agreed that the sales proceeds of sale should be used against the balance owing against the loan and to sue for the balance. The sale proceeds were to be distributed pro rata between purchase money and non-Purchase money balances. The proceeds of this sale must be applied exclusively to the purchase, non, and purchase money debt. The loan was secured by a mortgage granted to the respondent in relation to the land purchased and another quarter section of land already owned by Mr. Andrew. In addition, the loan was to be credited against the remaining LCRA protection of $18,770.48. The order below should be varied to entitle the respondent to take the respondent out of deficiency judgement against the appellant. The final decision of the Court in Andrew (CA) was not binding and the reasons in Hryneich Holdings should guide the disposition of this appeal."

In issue was whether the police officer had reasonable and probable grounds to make the breath demand; whether the demand met the requirements of the sample being taken by or under supervision of a medical practioner; whether the officer actually obtained information that taking the sample would not endanger the accused's life; whether the accused gave valid consent; whether the blood samples were taken as soon as practicable; whether the Crown could rely on the certificate where there was a reasonable doubt as to whether the physician took the sample himself or supervised a technician. HELD: The accused was found guilty. There was no basis on the evidence as a whole to exclude the Certificate of Analysis, which established the accused's blood alcohol level was 1.59 at the time of driving. 1)The officer had reasonable and probable grounds when he made the demand, including the accused was in the driver's seat; the odour of alcohol; the open bottle of beer; the nature of the accident. 2)Although the medical certificate could not be accepted as proof of the facts set out therein, the Crown did prove beyond a reasonable doubt by other evidence all the matters that could have been proven by the certificate. There was a reasonable doubt as to whether the doctor addressed his mind to the facts and opinion to the truth of what he was certifying. The doctor's mind was directed to the medical needs of the patient. His evidence was based on normal practice - not specific memory. There was no other logical conclusion that either the doctor or technician took the samples. The doctor would not have given permission to take samples if there was any danger to the life or health of his patient. 3)Since the officer had reasonable and probable grounds to make a demand for a sample of blood, the accused's consent was not required. 4)The officer proceeded with all due diligence and without any necessary delay. The blood was taken within a reasonably prompt time under all the circumstances.  5)The accused's admission that the accident affected his memory of the events following it and had no recollection of having passed the other vehicle just prior and that he was not driving like he normally drove and was perhaps going too fast for the road conditions (the gravel road was a wash board but was not at its worst condition) were noted.","The accused was charged with operating a motor vehicle while impaired.

The evidence at trial did not support this conclusion. 2) There was no other logical conclusion on the facts other than that either the doctor took the blood sample himself or took the sample under the doctor's supervision. The doctor would have acted to prevent any occurrence that would have endangered the life of his patient. 3) The evidence was in relation to a visit by the officer to the hospital and not at his home. The medical practitioner testified that if he said it was okay to take the sample, he would have advised the officer that it was. 4) The Court was left with reasonable and probable grounds to conclude that the officer acted to ensure that the samples were taken safely and that the Court was satisfied that the medical practitioner gave the consent of the accused to take them. 5) There were no other reasonable grounds on which the officer could have relied on the evidence other than the doctor taking the samples. 6) The court found that the facts in the officer's mind were in mind when he made the demand and the officer did not rely on it. 7) The officer's testimony that he did not recall the doctor signing the second certificate did not amount to reasonable or probable grounds for his doing so. 8) There is no evidence the officer was aware of the physician taking the blood when the officer asked him to do so. The Court found that neither the officer nor the doctor signed the second Certificate. 9) The test results were not conclusive. 10) The only logical conclusion was that the doctor had taken the samples themselves.

Costs of any major repairs were to be split equally pending the sale. The petitioner was entitled to occupy the property and was to pay the mortgage, insurance, utilities and other usual costs.  6)It was inferred the value of the chattels was the same as that at the date of the marriage. It would be inequitable to order a distribution of chattel property given as antiques or heirlooms by her parents valued in excess of $6,000. The inheritance from her aunt who died almost a year after the separation was excluded. The motor vehicles were divided in accordance with their value as of October 2000. All other matrimonial property and debts and obligations were valued as of the date of the petition. RRSPs were to be equalized as of October 15, 1999 by rollover. 7)The respondent was to convey one-half of the commuted value of his pension at date of the petition to a locked in RRSP in the name of the petitioner. The balance in excess of the maximum amount transferable under the Pension Benefits Act resulted in an adjustment of $2,042.75. The respondent was to assume any debts.  8)No costs were awarded.","The parties had been living separate and apart since January 23, 1998. In issue were custody, access, child support, spousal maintenance, possession and division of matrimonial property. The parties had agreed on joint custody of the children with the respondent to reside primarily with his father and the petitioner to reside with her mother. The petitioner sought adjustments for some maintenance and repair costs and insurance costs incurred after the petition and with respect to minimum monthly payments made on the Canada Trust Powerline loan. HELD: 1)The respondent was ordered to convey 1/2 of the commuted value as of the date of the petition (½ of $21,804.38 = $10,902.19) to a locked-in RRSP in the name of the petitioner. 2)The petitioner was to deliver $1,500 to the respondent by rollover from the respondent's account to the petitioner's account and to deliver documents as may be required to accomplish such rollover. 3)The parties agreed that the value of certain items of chattel property alleged to have been owned or acquired prior to the marriage was $150,000. This amount was to be divided according to the Federal Child Support Guidelines (SFPSG). 4)The husband was ordered not to contribute any maintenance or repair costs, with an allowance for interest thereafter."
7_2004nsca118.txt,"The father, who was in arrears under an order requiring him to pay child support, applied to vary the support order which had been made less than a year before. He failed to make the required financial disclosure and relied on a medical disability of which he gave no prior notice. The judge allowed the application to proceed, over the objections of the mother, and reduced the child support obligation to $1 per month. The mother appealed. Appeal allowed; the judge's decision to allow the application to proceed was procedurally unfair to the appellant and wrong in principle. Only in rare circumstances should a party applying to reduce child support be heard absent that party making full disclosure.","The mother appealed an order of a judge in response to a variation application by the father of two children, aged and 7. The father had been in arrears for several years. He had filed an incomplete Statement of Financial Information, which was 10 months out of date and he was in default of disclosure provision in Justice MacLellan's order. He also sought to obtain a copy of his income tax return, complete and with all attachments, even if the return is not filed, along with all notices of assessment received from Revenue Canada. HELD: Appeal allowed per reasons for judgment of Cromwell, J.A.; Glube, C.J.N.S.; Freeman, JA. concurring. 1) Only in rare circumstances should a party applying to reduce a child support obligation be heard absent that party making full disclosure. In the respectful view, only in the rarest of circumstances should that party applying in reducing a child maintenance be heard in absent the party making disclosure. 2) The appeal was procedurally unfair to the mother and wrong in principle. The judge erred in allowing the father's variation application to proceed even though he had not made adequate disclosure of his financial situation. In rare circumstances, only if a party applies to reduce the amount of child support and to cancel arrear, absent full disclosure by the Father, the mother is entitled to make full response to the application. In this case, the court erred by allowing the variation application, even though the father had made full disclosure of the financial situation, and by allowing it to proceed without the father making full response."
7_2016skpc104.txt,"Criminal Law – Evidence – CredibilityCriminal Law – Evidence – Expert Evidence – Blood Alcohol ConcentrationCriminal Law – Impaired Driving – Blood Alcohol Level Exceeding .08 The accused was charged with three Criminal Code offences: driving while impaired, contrary to s. 253(1)(a); driving over .08, contrary to s. 153(1)(b); and with failing to stop for a police officer as soon as reasonable in order to evade that officer, contrary to s. 249.1(2)). As he was completing a traffic stop, an officer heard the accused’s truck in the early morning hours. When the officer engaged his police vehicle emergency lights, the accused spun his tires, fish-tailed, and took off. The accused failed to stop at two stop signs and eventually stopped in the driveway of his house. The accused was arrested for the s. 249.1 offence and was given a breath demand after he failed as ASD. He failed the ASD between 3:01 and 3:03 and the breath samples were taken at 3:55 and 4:17. The accused admitted that he was drinking alcohol that evening, but denied being impaired. He said he was not trying to evade the officer when he failed to stop for him. He also said that alcohol he had just had was not in his system yet when he was driving, but was at the time of the breath samples. The officer indicated that the accused had glossy, watery eyes, but his walk and speech were fairly normal. The officer smelled alcohol coming from the accused, but was surprised he did not show more impairment given his driving. The accused indicated that he had consumed six beer that day, but the officer noted more than six empty beer cans on the accused’s table when he was getting his shoes. The accused indicated that he downed six or seven ounces of vodka just before driving at 2:45. An alcohol expert and the accused testified. The defence expert testified that the accused’s blood alcohol concentration (BAC) at the time of driving would not have been over .08 based on the drinking the accused testified to. The issues were: 1) whether there was proof beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused’s ability to drive was impaired by alcohol; 2) whether the accused’s evidence raised a reasonable doubt that his blood alcohol concentration was over the legal limit at the time when he finally stopped his vehicle; and 3) whether the accused had reasonable excuse for not stopping immediately for the officer and whether his actions amounted to him evading the police officer. The accused had nine drinking and driving convictions since 1982 with the most recent in 2007. HELD: The issues were determined as follows: 1) the Crown did not prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused’s ability to drive was impaired; 2) section 258(1)(d.1) deals with the last drink defence. The court had to be satisfied that the accused’s drinking was consistent with his BAC being not over .08 at the time of driving yet being consistent with the BAC’s in the Certificate of Analysis. The court preferred the officer’s evidence over the accused’s, given the drinking affected his recollections. The court was not satisfied that the defence provided a credible account of the accused’s alcohol consumption. Given the findings, the court was unable to apply the expert’s opinions. The court did not have a reasonable doubt regarding the accused’s guilt on the driving while over .08 charge; and 3) there was no doubt that the accused knew he was being pursued by the police and did not stop as soon as was reasonable in the circumstances. The court concluded that the accused did not have a reasonable excuse for not stopping. There was also no doubt that the accused attempted to get away from the officer because he was afraid of the legal consequences that he could face. The accused was found guilty of the evading charge.","The accused was charged with driving while his ability to do so was impaired and while his blood alcohol concentration exceeded the legal limit of.08 and with failing to stop for a police officer as soon as reasonable in the circumstances. HELD: The accused was found not guilty. The accused's blood alcohol content was over 80 mg% at the time he got out of his vehicle and approached the officer. The officer noted approximately ten to twelve beer cans on the coffee table, which got his attention because the accused had told the officer that he had only drank six beer throughout the day. He did not specifically count the beer cans and put them in his notes, he was adamant that there were more than six beer cans. The offence was committed when the accused was pursued by the police officer who engaged his emergency lights for a stop. There was no doubt based on the evidence that the accused knew he was being pursued, that he knew the officer had engaged the emergency lights, and that he did not stop. The only question is whether the accused has a reasonable excuse for not stopping and whether he did so in order to evade the officer to stop his vehicle. The Court of Appeal in Kulchisky defined “evade” in the sense that it equates with an attempt to elude or get away from. The defence provided a credible account of the accused’s alcohol consumption. The issue was whether there was a credible reason for the accused to not stop, and whether his belief that he would be 'home free' if he reached his driveway was a mistake of law because of what accept was this officer's power to stop Mr. Lehman under s. 209.1 of that Act taken together with the Saskatchewan and Alberta court of appeals’ interpretation of the extension of that power from public road to private road in Anderson[1]. Regardless of the finding, given that the evidence of Cst. Cobbledick and the accused is at odds, the Court rejected the evidence and accept the evidence. The court was not satisfied that the defence provided an adequate account of Mr. Lehman’ s. 249.1(2) and the BAC readings contained on the Certificate of Analyses."
8_1996canlii4963.txt,The appellant was acquitted of communicating with another person for the purpose of prostitution. A new trial was ordered on the basis that the Provincial Court judge included a requirement as an element of the actus reus for an offence under s.213 that there be a specific conversation with the respect to payment of money for specified sexual services. The Queen's Bench judge concluded that this was an error in law and cited as a correct test that set out in R. v. Schmidt. HELD: The proper disposition is to set aside the judgment and restore the decision of the Provincial Court acquitting the appellant of the offence. 1)On reading the entire oral judgment the court concluded that the judge was saying in effect that the evidence failed to convince her beyond a reasonable doubt that the offence had taken place. 2)The trial judge was incorrect in finding that under s.213 the actus reus must include a specific conversation specifying the sexual services and the money to be paid.,"The appellant was acquitted after trial in the Provincial Court of communicating with another person for the purpose of engaging in prostitution contrary to s. 213(1)(c) of the Code. However, on appeal to the Court of Queen's Bench a new trial was ordered, and this appeal arises. The Queen's bench judge interpreted her oral reasons to include a requirement as an element of the actus reus for an offence under s.213 that there be a specific conversation with respect to payment of money for specified sexual services. The appellant argued that the conversation did not reach the point where the matter of payment was discussed. The Crown argued that this was an error in law and cited as a correct test a comment in R. v. Schmidt (1986 CanLII 3096). HELD: The appeal was allowed. 1)The facts before the learned Chief judge constituted evidence from which a properly instructed jury could reasonably infer that the respondent was communicating with a female person. The evidence was relatively specific on the issue of money and for which he intended to pay. However on a reading of the entire oral judgment, the appellant was saying that the evidence failed to convince her beyond a reasonable doubt that the offence had taken place. 2)If indeed the Provincial court judge had found that under s 213 the actuses reus must include a particular conversation specifying the sexual services and the money to be paid for them, she was incorrect. 3)The Court of Appeal reversed the decision of the Queen’s Bench judge in acquitting and restored the sentence of the previous trial."

The defendant has applied for an order setting aside the judgment and striking out the plaintiff's claim. A car-pedestrian accident occurred causing personal injury to the plaintiff. The defendant was convicted of dangerous driving under the Criminal Code. The plaintiff sued for battery and assault. The defendant was noted for default on this claim and the damages were assessed at $37,717.35, $10,000 of which were punitive. The plaintiff submits that s.102 of the Act should not deprive a citizen of the right to sue a defendant for injuries caused by assault, battery, fraud, or similar torts. HELD: The plaintiff has no cause for action by virtue of her injuries having been caused by an automobile. The plaintiff was precluded by s.102 of the Act from commencing a valid legal action with the result that the judgment obtained is a nullity. Although s.102 of the Act prohibits certain types of law suits, the act provides victims with compensation for injury.

8_2001nssc179.txt,"The defendant obtained a tender to bank, blend and load coal at the plaintiff's coal preparation plant. In performing the contract, the defendant experienced equipment problems resulting in the plaintiff having to rent equipment from the defendant's predecessor. The plaintiff terminated the contract without any prior warning or notice to the defendant and brought an action for reimbursement of monies advanced under the contract and expenses incurred for the equipment rentals. The defendant counter-claimed for damages arising out of the termination of the contract, for services performed under the contract and for extras which had not been paid. Plaintiff entitled to reimbursement for overpayments and equipment rentals; defendant entitled to fair and reasonable compensation for extras for which court awarded the sum of $10,000. Both parties were in breach of the contract, the plaintiff's breach occurring because the volumes of coal supplied did not approximate the tonnages represented in the contractual documents. The clause excluding liability for errors in the forecast did not excuse the plaintiff because the actual volumes were not even approximate to the forecasted tonnages and the rates bid by the defendant were directly related to the anticipated tonnages. Absent evidence as to how the plaintiff arrived at the information used in the calculation of the forecasted tonnages, no negligent misrepresentation could be found, as there was no evidence that the information was negligently obtained. In respect to claims where on the evidence there was a loss, but it was difficult, if not impossible to quantify, damages were awarded even where it could be said the amount is a matter of guesswork.","The plaintiff/defendant sought reimbursement of monies advanced to the defendant by counterclaim for expenses it incurred because of the failure of the defendant to perform under the contract.

HELD: The defendant brought this action. The plaintiff was awarded the contract and continued until the termination of the contract without prior notice. The contract was cancelled by either party following written notice or by mutual agreement by both parties. The court found that the defendant had not acted under the purchase order and the plaintiff had not responded to the invitation for tenders by submitting a bid. The breach of contract claims the defendant's obligations under the agreement were not as extensive as they would have been if the original invitation had been used. The defendants agreed that the contractual obligation to maintain and service the banks, ditches, railway and power lines was to be met. The contractual obligation was to provide the services the defendant was required to perform, and to reimburse the plaintiff for expenses incurred for equipment rentals and other activities it says were required because of failure of Roper Ltd. to perform. The plaintiffs counterclaimed against the defendant, who counterclaimed monies received under the tender and expenses incurred by the plaintiff and the defendant for equipment rental and other expenses it claims were required by the failure. The Court found that although the plaintiff's obligations were extensive, the defendant’s responsibilities were not extensive and it had not been paid for services performed under the original contract."

HELD: The conditional provision was removed as time spent on electronic monitoring and post sentence efforts were considered. A conditional sentence was not available in the circumstances. The 38 year old had 49 prior convictions. The sentencing judge noted the accused's 3.5 years of sobriety, community support, education and technical trade training, and positive pre-sentence report but failed to consider the gravity of the offences, the need for deterrence, and above all, protection of the public.

8_2009skqb54.txt,"FIAT: Each of the defendants and third parties (collectively the 'applicants'), apply to stay either permanently or on an interim basis the plaintiffs' claim commenced pursuant to The Class Actions Act. The stay applications seek the same discretionary order of the court pursuant to s. 37(1) of The Queen's Bench Act, 1998 and/or Rule 173 of the Queen's Bench Rules. The plaintiff's action claims damages for injuries that are alleged to have been caused by the testing and application of herbicides at a Canadian Forces base in New Brunswick. To date 11 statements of claim have been filed across Canada, 9 by Merchant Law Group (MLG). MLG has proceeded with various stages of the class action proceeding which it has commenced through the various jurisdictions in Canada as it has considered to be to the best advantage of the plaintiffs which that firm represents or seeks to represent. Now Saskatchewan is the clear preference. Many of these strategic decisions are driven by the nature of state of class actions legislation in the various jurisdictions in which claims were commenced. The applicants claim these strategic decisions are and do constitute an abuse of process. They claim they are a costly expenditure of time and money. The applicants have already participated in certification hearings in Newfoundland and New Brunswick. The issue on this application is whether the Saskatchewan action should be stayed permanently or on an interim basis with or without conditions on the basis of abuse of process. HELD: The applications to stay, on either an interim or permanent basis, the Saskatchewan action are dismissed. 1) The Court has concluded that virtually all, if not all of the concerns raised by the applicants in support of their stay applications are intended to be, and for that matter, mandated to be considered by the court during the certification application of this class action.  'Traffic control' as between the nine or ten existing class actions commenced in the other provincial jurisdictions is the responsibility of this Court upon certification as now required by s. 6(2) and s. 6(3) of the Act. The objectives and relevant factors by which the court is to be guided and which it must consider involve the very considerations upon which the applicants base their stay applications. They include avoiding, where possible, the risk of irreconcilable judgments, the promotion of judicial economy, the consideration of the law applicable, the stage each action has reached, the plan for the proposed multi-jurisdictional class action and the location of the representative plaintiffs, class members, evidence and witnesses. The discretion granted by the legislature to the court with respect to any certification orders it may issue as outlined in s. 6.1 of the Act is very broad. That discretion must be exercised having regard to the criterion set out in s. 6(2) of the Act. That may prompt a conclusion that deference should be given to an existing class action commenced in another jurisdiction. The discretion of the court is further circumscribed by the objectives and relevant factors set out in s. 6(3) of the Act. The concerns raised by the applicants in support of their stay application have been eclipsed. They are not specifically and legislatively required to be addressed by the court at the certification stage and after a certification hearing has been conducted. 2) Even if the criteria in Englund v. Pfizer Canada Inc., 2007 SKCA 62; were to be applied to the consideration of the stay applications presently before the Court, the Court would be inclined, in any event, to dismiss the stay applications in the facts and circumstances of this case. There are many differences between the proposed Saskatchewan class to be certified, its inclusiveness and exclusiveness, the nature of the injuries claims for, the substances alleged to have cause those injuries and the enumerated defendants or third parties in the actions commenced in each of the other jurisdictions. That alone, without the assistance of s. 6 and the other amending provisions of the Saskatchewan Act, distinguish this case from those criteria which the Court of Appeal applied in Englund to reach the conclusion that the action should be appropriately (but conditionally) stayed.","FIAT: The plaintiff’s claim commenced pursuant to the Class Actions Act. The defendants and third parties applied to the Court to stay either permanently or on an interim basis, the plaintiff”s claim pursuant to The Class Actions act. The applicants sought the same discretionary order pursuant to s.37(1) of the Queen’S Bench Act and/or Rule 173 of the Court of Appeal. HELD: The application was dismissed. The court found that the concerns raised by the applicants in support of their stay applications were clearly and legislatively required to be addressed by the Court at the certification stage and after a certification hearing had been conducted. The Court found that these concerns were specifically and legislationally required to address by the court at the Certification stage and post certification hearing.

Sole custody to the mother, with supervised access for a period of time (to reintroduce the father to the child), moving to increasingly longer periods of daytime access. The father must complete a parenting course to better learn how to meet the child's various needs. There was insufficient evidence to show he is unable to protect the child from her severe nut allergy. There was insufficient evidence to establish he is a flight risk. Even if he had threatened to flee with the child, it is relevant that he lacks the means to do so. While there has been unpleasantness and some violence between the parties, the evidence does not establish domestic violence of a nature that would require supervised access on an ongoing basis.",The mother sought to have the Father's access supervised. The Father had not had contact with the child since January 2010. The Mother had suggested that he might be able to obtain an Egyptian passport for their daughter and remove her permanently from Nova Scotia.

8_2010skca149.txt,"The father appealed from the decision of the Chamber's judge which varied the custody provisions of a consent judgment. The father had been unsuccessful in arguing for a shared custody arrangement in the Court below. The father argued that the Chamber's judge erred in her application of the best interests of the children and failed to apply the principle of maximum contact by applying a presumption in favour of the status quo and finding that the wishes of the children were irrelevant. For the first time on appeal, the father also argued that there was insufficient uncontroverted evidence before the Chambers judge to allow her to make a proper decision. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. It is implicit in the Chamber's decision that there was sufficient evidence before the Court to reach a conclusion about the best interests of the children and to find a change in circumstances. No error was made on this issue. The Chamber's judge correctly applied the test to determine the best interests of the children as articulated in Gordon v. Goertz. The Chamber's judge correctly concluded that the Act does not provide that the maximum contact principle alone provides a sufficient basis for ordering shared parenting. She addressed this principle in the context of the children's best interests. There is no evidence that the Chamber's judge stopped her inquiry at the status quo and that she did not assess the children's best interests against the proposed new circumstances and its impact upon them. The Chamber's judge was entitled to give limited or no weight to the wishes of the children. There is no material error or misapprehension of the evidence.","The father appeals from the decision of the Chambers judge which varied the custody provisions of a consent judgment dated March 30, 2005 governing custody and access to the parties' children. The father argues that the chambers judge erred by failing to apply the principle of maximum contact, by applying a presumption of the status quo and by finding that evidence as to the wishes of the children was irrelevant. HELD: Appeal dismissed. 1) Given the state of the evidence before the Chambers Judge, evidence which was partially inadmissible, largely contradictory and materially deficient, we are all of the view there was an insufficient factual basis for the making of the custody order in issue. The Chambers judge correctly stated that s. 17(9) of the Act does not provide a sufficient basis upon which to order shared parenting. The evidence regarding the children's wishes was limited and inconclusive. In the context of conflicting evidence regarding their wishes, it is open to the Chambers court to decline to make an assessment of the issue, and to proceed to base the decision on other factors. 2) Given that the evidence was largely inadadmissible and largely contradictory, the material was too controverted to allow a decision to be made on affidavit evidence alone. The chambers judge clearly failed to consider the impact of the change in circumstances when making her determination. The fact that there was insufficient uncontroverted evidence on material issues on which a decision could be made was not a sufficient reason to dismiss the appeal."

9_1992canlii2588.txt,", The Crown appealed the acquittal of the respondent on a charge of assaulting his wife. The trial judge had found the respondent, who had taken a sleeping pill and was drunk at the time of the assault, did not have the intent to commit the assault. Allowing the appeal, that voluntary intoxication cannot be considered as raising a reasonable doubt as to intent in a general intent offence unless the degree of intoxication is so extreme that the accused did not even possess the minimal intent to perform the actus reus because his state was akin to automatism or insanity. The Court noted that no medical evidence as to the affect of the sleeping pill with the alcohol was adduced, nor was there any evidence concerning the strength of the pill or the amount of alcohol consumed and concluded that the evidence supported the conclusion that the respondent appreciated the circumstances of the assault, even though he could not remember it afterward. The Court set aside the acquittal and entered a verdict of guilty pursuant to s. 686(4)(b)(ii) of the Criminal Code as it had concluded that the respondent 'should have been found guilty but for the error in law'.","This was an appeal from the acquittal of the respondent on a charge of assaulting his estranged wife. The evidence indicated that the respondent had been extremely intoxicated and that he did not intend to assault his wife. HELD: The appeal was allowed and the verdict of acquittal was set aside. The trial judge did not properly direct himself as to the type of evidence necessary to conclude, as result of the degree of intoxication, that the accused had the minimal intent to perform the actus reus of the offence because his state of awareness was akin to automatism or insanity. The wife's evidence indicates that the appellant had an appreciation of the circumstances of the assault at the time, although he cannot remember. The'sack of potatoes defence' was not supported by any evidence. The Court was of the opinion that voluntary intoxication of a person cannot be considered as raising a reasonable doubt as to his intent in connection with a general intent offence unless the degree is so extreme that the the accused did not even possess the minimal intention to perform it.

The petitioner filed a motion seeking a variation of the Spousal Maintenance Order made in November in light of his bankrupt financial situation and his inability to earn any income at this time. HELD: 1)The respondent's claim for set-off was allowed. The Court ordered a hearing date for May 13 at which time it was asked to complete the division. 2)The petitioner did not pursue livestock operation on the farm for a number of reasons, one of which being the fact that he required income to live on and the parties equity in Saskatchewan Wheat Pool which fell into that category. In any event he paid one half the net proceeds to his wife which covered the maintenance payments ordered for November, December, January and $300 to the respondent in bankruptcy. The petitioner argued that for the foreseeable future he will be unable to make any maintenance payments to his former wife. 3)The Court granted a division of property on all of it. The respondent wife was entitled to the following set-offs to be included in her share of the Matrimonial Property division. 4)The wife was to bear her own costs. 5)Division was based on asset values which are at this stage problematical and indeed by including some assets which may not be exempt in whole or in part from the bankruptcy proceedings. The husband was to pay the respondent $2,300 by way of maintenance out of the proceeds of certain barley he sold privately.

The evidence supports this position so I ordered a variation."
9_1994canlii4999.txt,"PCL applied for an interlocutory injunction restraining the members of the Defendant unions from picketing the entrance to a construction site at which PCL was constructing an addition to the City's sewage treatment plant. The picketers were completely blocking the entrance to the construction site, were threatening the occupants of vehicles using the entrance and damaged one vehicle as it entered the site. No City employees were working on the site. ISSUES: 1)Is the picketing secondary picketing? 2)Is the manner of picketing unlawful in any event? HELD: Application allowed. 1)Picketing of the premises of an employer, where there is no direct dispute between him and the picketers or between him and his employees, is secondary picketing, is per se unlawful and cannot be jusified merely because the picketers are engaged in a legal strike against another employer who has business relations with the employer being picketed. 2)If the court had determined that the subject picketing was not secondary picketing, then, in the particular circumstances it would still have held that the subject picketing was unlawful, and ought to be restrained, as, on the whole of said evidence it was satisfied that the applicant had established that said picketing was not being carried on for the purpose of lawful communication, but, rather, was being carried on in a manner designed to obstruct, impede and interfere with the lawful performance by the applicant of its construction contract on the construction site.","The plaintiff sought an interim injunction restraining the defendants from engaging in secondary picketing of the plaintiff's premises. HELD: The application was granted. The injunction was granted and the proceeding continued. The defendants were ordered to vacate the premises and return the notice of motion. Pursuant to the interim injunction, that the plaintiff had no right to trade. The plaintiff had a right to engage in trade, and the right to demonstrate its dissatisfaction with the status quo. The acts complained of were illegal and caused irreparable damage to the plaintiff. The court reserved its decision thereon. It was not supported by any evidence that the acts alleged were supported by hearsay evidence."
9_1994canlii7210.txt,"The defendants permitted a private building to remain on public reserve lands contrary to s. 197 of The Planning and Development Act, 1983 and the zoning bylaws of the Resort Village of Echo Bay. They contended the bylaws were inapplicable. They conceded the activities may be an offence under the provincial statute, but submitted the selective prosecution should be stayed as an abuse of the legal process, and a violation of their right to 'equal protection and equal benefit of the law without discrimination' under s. 15 of the Charter. Legislation required 10% of land intended for subdivision to be given to the province. This land was designated as 'public reserve', and its use was limited by s. 197 of The Planning and Development Act, 1983. Most public reserves were not developed by the government, but rather by cottage owners. Some cottage owners asserted the public was able to use the construction on public reserve, and allowing such access made such construction things that 'facilitate the use of the reserve as a public recreation area' under s. 197(f) and were legal. In Echo Bay, the subdivision plan created a public reserve in front of cottage lots, vested in the province on October 25, 1983. The provincial Department of Municipal Government ('Department') was to determine what fell within s. 197. The province had no policing mechanism for violations. The Department acted as if maintaining the reserves was the municipality's responsibility, even though the province held title. In August 1986, Mr. and Mrs. Taillon built a boathouse on public reserve. They did not seek permission, as their realtor said they could treat the land as part of their lot. Their neighbour Mr. Zeah complained to Mr. Brickwell, the Senior Planner of the Department. This resulted in an enquiry into if the defendant's activities violated s. 197 or the municipal zoning bylaw. On October 28, 1986, Mr. Brickwell told the mayor that Department officials inspected the site and asked council to request the Taillons remove the structure. Council advised the Department on November 24, 1986 that it was not their land or responsibility. Mr. Brickwell informed council of proposed legislative amendments that would give title and enforcement responsibilities to municipalities. In June 1989, council asked Mr. Fraser to produce authority to construct his boathouse and if not, they would issue a stop work order under the zoning bylaws, even though they believed they did not apply to public reserves. Council was trying to avoid future problems once they heard of the amendments. They received no response and issued an order. Mr. Fraser then contacted Mr. Brickwell who told him there were numerous violations, but enforcement was lacking. Mr. Brickwell said he did not demand the boathouse be removed because, in his view, his Department did not police public reserves. On October 21, 1989, council passed a motion to turn the prosecution of violations of s. 197 over to the RCMP. The province was the landowner and enforcer of the Act, so it was appropriate for the RCMP to assume prosecution. The RCMP declined, and Mr. Brickwell informed council his Department would not act. On January 31, 1991, an amendment to The Planning and Development Act passed which allowed municipalities to take title and passed responsibility for prosecuting offenders to local councils. Echo Bay took title on July 6, 1992. On February 21, 1991, council's solicitor requested the defendants and the Fosters to remove their boathouses by June 31, 1991. The Fosters complied, but the defendants did not. On November 16, 1991, council proceeded with the action. Although council believed the boathouses were illegal, the Taillon boathouse was assessed for property taxes. Council believed they must prosecute offenders to fulfill their duty to uphold the law, discourage further violations, and ensure public reserve lands were open for public use. The defendants believed either none or all violators should be prosecuted. Council stated it was wiser to prosecute only boathouses to obtain the court's opinion. If council was correct, it may not be necessary to prosecute others because they might comply with the law as expressed by the court. If the court did not agree, council should not incur any further expense. Council asserted prosecution of boathouse owners was appropriate as boathouses caused the complaint, and they were clearly private. The defendants view their selection for prosecution out of a numerous violators as unfair and discriminatory within the prohibition of s. 15 of the Charter. HELD: A municipality may further restrict uses of reserve land, but it cannot allow uses not permitted by s. 197. Taxing the boathouse was immaterial and did not imply approval. The defendants were not misled as to their legal rights by a person in authority. The Taillons could not have believed the opinion of the realtor; they knew they did not own the land. Mr. Brickwell's comment that there were numerous violations being ignored could not be taken to mean the defendants were able to build on public reserve. It was an opinion that they might escape prosecution. The case turned on whether it was an abuse of the legal process to prosecute the defendants when other violators were ignored or a case of violating their rights under s. 15 of the Charter. How unfair it was depended on how many violators were overlooked which turned on the reading of s. 197. John Nanson, the Principal Planner of the Community Planning Services Branch, believed things on public reserve available to the public were not violations of s. 197. The court did not accept this view as it allowed citizens to determine what constituted a 'public facility' and required council to launch civil actions to remove private construction. If this was intended, no offence would be created in the first place, and the titleholder would just be left with civil remedies. An interpretation which allowed private citizens to effectively turn public reserve into private land defeated the legislation's objective. The fact that the titleholder was the province or a municipality and the use of the word public indicated the legislature wanted the government authority to decide what constituted a public facility. It cannot be public unless it was authorized or actually built by the government authority and was open for public use at all times. If the legislation was interpreted as Mr. Nanson suggested, then there were fewer violators. This made council's decision to prosecute only boathouses less unfair, and it did not give the defendants a defence as the boathouses were not open for public use. They constructed a private building on public reserve contrary to s. 197, therefore the boathouses were illegal under s. 221(1)(a)(ii) of the Act. The defendants were guilty unless prosecution was stayed as an abuse of process or because it violated s. 15 of the Charter. Council prosecuted defendants whom they saw as committing clear violations. To prosecute all violators initially would add expense at no benefit. A decision on boathouses was likely to lead to the desired clarification of the law. They had a complaint upon which they had a duty to act and wanted a test case to determine the legal position. Selective prosecution, per se, is not an abuse of process; rather it depends on the circumstances. The defendants must show they were singled out unfairly, not just that they were singled out. There was no such evidence. Stopping prosecutions for abuse of process is a power only to be used in the 'clearest of cases' (R. v. Keyowski). The defence must show that proceeding exceeds 'the limits of the community sense of fair play' and the administration of justice is best served by stopping the prosecution. In R. v. Rourke, the SCC said there was no general discretion to stay proceedings because they were considered 'oppressive'. In R. v. Jewitt, the SCC adopted the test from R. v. Young that 'there is a residual discretion in a trial judge to stay proceedings where compelling an accused to stand trial would violate those fundamental principles of justice which underlie the community's sense of fair play and decency, and to prevent the abuse of court's process through oppressive or vexatious proceedings'. Picking out defendants to prosecute from a pool of offenders to ascertain the legal position of the parties because one of their group has been the subject of a complaint did not violate 'the community sense of fair play and decency'. The defence relied on Regina v. Miles of Music Ltd. where the court said that 'no cause can fall within the category of the Ã¦clearest of cases' unless it can be fairly said that the cause of the apparent unfairness complained of can be Ã attributed to either the police or the Crown or both'. The defence said council not only did not prosecute, but did not investigate whether others were in violation. The court acknowledged this was so, but accepted the motivation was that council believed Mr. Nanson, and they did not currently intend to prosecute all violators. The defendant's real complaint was the decision to only prosecute boathouse owners. Council was trying to ascertain the law, so they could fulfill their duty to uphold it. The court found council proceeded against the defendants because it seemed sensible and financially responsible to do so, not because of any male fides. The municipal bylaws were not applicable to public reserves, but it made sense to seek the court's opinion on their applicability since council was going ahead with the action. The fact that one count was laid under the bylaws did not violate the community sense of fair play, but if it did, this would mean that count should be stayed. Council rightly attempted to get others to prosecute which caused a reasonable delay and did not prejudice the defendants. Any unsatisfactory delay was caused by the Department and not council. The Charter gives a right to a trial within a reasonable time, but this applies after a charge is laid. The delay by the province occurred pre-charge. There was no unreasonable post-charge delay or abuse of the legal process. Section 15 of the Charter is not limited to the enumerated types of discrimination, but it does not prohibit all discrimination. It must be commonly accepted discrimination abhorrent to the basic principles of society with no reason that justifies a breach of such principles. It was not discrimination contrary to s. 15 to select individuals to prosecute as a test case where it was not done for improper reasons.  'Equal protection and equal benefit of the law' did not mean one was entitled to have prosecution stopped until all violators were prosecuted. Picking out boathouse builders was not an example of discrimination prohibited by s. 15. The defence argued the law was not allowed to have unequal impact because of irrelevant circumstances (Law Society of British Columbia v. Andrews). This case should not be read so broadly. In the court's view, the proceedings should not be stayed because there was no violation of s. 15, and if the court was wrong, it was not 'appropriate and just' that such a remedy be granted, as required for relief under s. 24 of the Charter.","The defendants were charged with permitting a private building or facility, to remain on public reserve lands contrary to both the provisions of the Planning and Development Act and the Zoning Bylaws of the Resort Village of Echo Bay. The defendants were the owners of the buildings and land and bearing legal description as Lot 10, Block 10, Echo Bay, Plan 83B16092. They claimed that the bylaws of the resort were inapplicable and that, although their activities may constitute an offence under the provincial statute, the prosecution of it should be stayed as an abuse of the legal process, and a violation of their rights to be afforded 'equal protection and equal benefit of the law without discrimination.' HELD: 1) The defendants did not deny it, although they did require the crown to prove it, as has been done. 2) The Department took the position that the expense of maintaining the reserve was the responsibility of the municipality, despite the fact that the municipality was the titleholder. 3) The Municipality stepped into that position. Moreover, it could be argued that after the enactment of the interim zoning bylaw in 1986, permission from the municipality had to be obtained if their zoning bylaws did apply, in this case, to public reserves. 4) The municipality was not prepared to act under the possible authority of the provincial government. The fact that it was the municipality that was responsible for maintaining the reserves was not rooted nearly so much in any concern he had with improper use of the reserve, or the government's rights as landowner, as it was a provincial agency representing the land owner, the Province. 5) It was clear that the Municipality had been singled out from among a great number of offenders for prosecution for, as they see it, no good reason. 6) In the case of subdivisions created after their transfer from the Province to the municipality in 1992, cottage lots do not go to the high water mark. The municipality is the representative of the landowner with the responsibility to prevent trespass, whether or not it is on the list of permitted uses under the said Act. 7) In some cases, the municipality is responsible for maintenance on public reserves, not policing Sec. 197. 8) In other cases, municipality officials are the agency designated to determine what activities fell within the range permitted under Sec.197. 9) In this case the municipality became title holder. 10) The municipalities are the landowners and the municipality has jurisdiction over the land. Therefore, having the municipality settle the matter would be a curious step"

Lanson loaned Nickel $16,000 to purchase a mobile home and registered their financing statement giving them a security interest in the mobile home. The trial judge found that Lanson knew that Nickel would either rent or sell the home but that upon a sale Nickel would repay the loan in full. Nickel sold the home but did not disclose the sale to Lanson. The purchaser, SP Trucking, did not require financing and did not search the Personal Property Registry. SP Trucking sold the home to Rempel who obtained financing from the Credit Union which registered a financing agreement claiming a security interest in the home and its proceeds. Lanson attempted to seize the home. The trial judge found Lanson's security interest continued and took priority over that of the Credit Union as Lanson had not authorized the sale to the trucking company and that Lanson had no interest in releasing the security interest until he received payment in full.  HELD: 1)Section 28(1) reiterates the common law principle of nemo dat quod non habet. The debtor's right to deal with collateral is subject to the security interest granted to the creditor unless certain things occur- ie. the secured party authorized expressly or by implication the dealing with the security. 2)The trial judge was in error in finding the secured party, Lanson, had to authorize the buyer, SP Trucking, to deal with the property and that the buyer must know of the authorization. Section 28(1) does not contemplate an authorization to a third party to deal with the collateral. The fundamental issue was whether the authorization was subject to the pre-condition of payment in full. 3)The authorization to sell must be given before the sale. Lanson clearly gave Nickel express authority to deal with the security which would include resale. The fact the debtor failed to pay the secured creditor did not invalidate the sale to the buyer.  4)Canadian Commercial Bank is restricted to cases where the secured party agrees with the buyer to release the security interest on the express condition that the obligation is satisfied in full and makes it clear to the debtor he does not intend to rely simply on the proceeds. There is a distinction between a conditional authorization and an authorized sale subject to conditions that the proceeds be remitted to the secured party. 5)The trial judge clearly found that Lanson authorized the dealing. It followed that the security interest did not continue in the collateral and the title passed to the buyer. The Credit Union acquired the collateral free of the security interest of Lanson and Lanson's rights against Nickle were restricted to the proceeds.  6)By declining to deal with the matter of s30(2), the appellate court was not to be taken as approving of the reasons of the trial judge. 7)The appellant was awarded costs on double Column V.","The issue on this appeal is the priority of security interest in a mobile home granted by the respondent to the respondent and subsequent purchaser for value, the Credit Union having regard to the operation of s. 28(1) and s. 30(2) of The Personal Property Security Act, 1993. The respondent loaned the respondent $16,000 to purchase mobile home. At trial it was found that the respondent knew that Nickel would either rent to sell the mobile home, their only concern being that upon sale Nickel would repay the loan in full. The trial judge concluded that Lanson, the secured party, authorized the sale within the meaning of the P.P.S.A., and the sale did not occur in the ordinary course of business as contemplated by s.30(2). The Credit Union appeals this decision. HELD: The issue is reduced to whether the security holder, the respondent authorized the respondent, to deal with the secured creditor. It does not contemplate an authorization to a third party to deal the collateral. The fundamental issue is whether the authorization is subject to the pre-condition of payment in full and whether his security interest continues and takes priority over the security interest of the credit union. The Credit union appeals the decision. 1)Section 28(2), the security agreement between the parties anticipated the respondent dealing with the security. The defendant knew that the applicant would rent to the buyer and that the buyer must know of the authorization. 2)The respondent's security interest did not continue in the collateral and title passed to the purchaser, Spruce Meadow Trucking Ltd., free from the secured interest. The credit union acquired the collateral free of any perfected or unperfected security interest. It was at this time that the defendant discovered that the mobile Home had been sold and attempted to seize it.

9_2002skpc30.txt,"The Crown applied for three DNA warrants pursuant to s.487.05 of the Criminal Code. Each of the three Informations sworn by an RCMP officer alleged the accused and his 19 year old daughter committed incest contrary to s.155, and a 7 month old child was born as a result. The Informations deposed that the Crown had obtained a DNA sample of the person who claimed to be the natural mother of the 19 year old.HELD: 1)No case was found dealing was a similar application regarding a possible charge under s.155. The words of s.487.05 were analyzed to determine its proper meaning and interpretation. 'Bodily substances' is not defined in the general definition s.2 nor the DNA definition s.487.04 of the Criminal Code. Assuming, without deciding, that it is proper to conclude that the child is a victim, there has been no bodily substance found or obtained from the child or from anyone else, and accordingly no portion of s.487.05(1)(b) is applicable. Subparagraphs 487.05(1)(b)(ii), (iii) and (iv) all refer to a bodily substance found or obtained on or within the body of a victim or some other person involved with the offence; 487.05(1)(b)(i) and (iv) refer to bodily substances found or obtained at or related to the place where the offence was committed. Nothing in s.487.05 suggests that a blood sample of a child born of an alleged incestuous relationship, which is not in the possession of the Crown and remains in the child, is a bodily substance found or obtained within the meaning of s.487.05(1)(a). 2)There were numerous deficiencies in the Informations. The paragraphs did not set out the basis or source of the officer's information, the relationship of the parties to the named informant, nor why the information was considered reliable. There should be some indication as to how the DNA analysis will establish that the adult male is the natural father and how it will negative any suggestion that the parents of the baby are 'strangers' genetically speaking. The qualifications of the RCMP officer who will take the blood samples and of the corporal who trained him should be set out. The paragraphing format was confusing. 3)A DNA warrant application would be premature. The custodial parent or parents are in the legal position of being the persons who can give informed consent to the taking of the baby's blood. It may be appropriate at some point to order a sample be obtained. It was questionable whether it was in the best interests of the administration of justice to make such an order now.","The Crown applied pursuant to s. 487.05 of the Criminal Code for DNA warrants to obtain blood samples from the male, the female and the child. The Informations in Support depose that the Crown has obtained a DNA sample from the person who says she is the mother of the 19-year-old and that the child has been born as a result of the incestuous relationship. HELD: A DNA warrant application with respect to the 19 year-old was premature. The court was of the view that, subject to the nature of the additional information, that a warrant may be issued when some substance such as saliva, semen, hair, blood or like product produced by or is found in or within the body of a victim or other person present at the time the alleged offence was committed. There was nothing in the Informations In Support which could reasonably be said to suggest that a blood sample of a child born of an alleged sexual relationship, which sample is not in the possession of the Crown and which remains in the child's child's body, would be premature but may be renewed in due course if the Crown is so advised. The proper inference to be drawn from the words in the words of the Information in Support is that a search warrant may only be issued if the DNA of a person who is the natural mother is found or obtained. There is nothing in s.485(1)(b) which can in the best interests of the administration of justice to make such an order. The last page and half of the informations in support after paragraph 3.1(a) do not set out whether the RCMP officer who will take the blood samples has a certificate or any similar qualification, nor is the qualification of the corporal who trained him set out."

The Crown proceeded against the accused on the following counts: 1) the officer observed what he thought was a dog food bag with duct tape in the back seat of the accused's vehicle. The red bag had a small child in it. The child was crying and the RCMP officer stated that he had not seen the dog food in the vehicle and that he did not see any evidence of drugs in it at the time he stopped the accused. The police officer testified as to the crack tail light in the accused’s vehicle and the fact that he observed the dog dog in the passenger seat and that the dog had a large child in his back seat covered with a blanket. The dog was crying because the police officer had not noticed the dog in his vehicle and had not even the slightest suspicion that drugs or alcohol were in the car or in the possession of the appellant. The second basis, namely, that the officer, upon smelling the marijuana, then had reasonable and probable grounds to conduct a warrantless search, was not supported by the Charter argument. The Court found that the evidence obtained in this case infringed or denied any rights or freedoms guaranteed by this Charter. The evidence was excluded if it was established that the admission of it in the proceedings would bring the administration of justice into disrepute. The court found that there was no evidence that the officers acted in the manner described in the Charter. There was nothing to suggest that they did so because the evidence did not exist. The only evidence that could be excluded was that of the officer who had observed the accused in the first place."

The applicant had previously provided the court with a sworn Affidavit of Service indicating otherwise. The respondent was provided with the judge's assistant's name and phone number and given a date by which he was to contact the assistant. The assistant was not contacted but the respondent sent a second letter to the court enclosing a document entitled 'Affidavit' which again stated that he had not been informed of when the hearing was to take place. A telephone conference was arranged but the court was unable to contact the respondent at the set time despite numerous calls and messages from the court. The applicant now sought additional costs due to the time counsel had taken to prepare for the telephone conference. Affidavit of the respondent struck; applicant entitled to additional costs in the amount of $250. The court was not convinced that the respondent had not received adequate notice of the hearing and because he did not make himself available for cross- examination, his affidavit was struck.","The Court received a letter dated March 25, 2004 in which he stated that he was not served with the Applicant's application and supporting material.

The court was also awarded costs for disbursements of disbursement. The Applicant was awarded additional costs for the time he took preparation for the telephone conference.  1)The Court was satisfied that the defendant received adequate notice of the hearing. 2)Because the defendant did not make himself available for a telephone conference and was not available for cross examination, his affidavit is struck. 3)The Applicant is entitled to further costs."
9_2004skqb324.txt,"Wal-Mart Canada applies for an order pursuant to Rule 664 and Rule 673 of The Queen's Bench Rules of Court quashing the orders of the Board. The orders require Wal-Mart Canada to discover and produce documents. Wal-Mart Canada says that the Board does not have the jurisdiction to use the subpoena or make the disclosure and productions orders in the manner in which it has done. Wal-Mart Canada also applies for an order declaring s. 9 of The Trade Union Act unconstitutional. HELD: The orders of the Board are quashed with costs payable forthwith to Wal-Mart Canada by UFCW. The application for an order declaring s. 9 of The Trade Union Act to be unconstitutional and of no force and effect is dismissed without prejudice to Wal-Mart Canada to bring its application back. 1) The Court concluded that a review of the transcript was essential to the proper determination of the issues raised by the application and that it must be considered part of the record.  2) The case law has determined that orders made by the Board that in reality are document discovery orders, are orders made without jurisdiction to which the applicable standard of review is one of correctness. 3) The Board abused its jurisdiction and power to issue the subpoena duces tecum in two respects. First the Board issued the subpoena without any prior consideration as the relevance of the documents that it compelled Wal-Mart Canada to produce. The subpoena was issued before the hearings commenced. There is no evidence that the Board exercised its discretion judicially in considering the issue of relevancy. It is unlikely that the Board even scrutinized the subpoena or it would have likely required the scope of it to be narrowed. Second, the subpoena was far too generalized and amounts to an order to discover documents. The Board must restrict its consideration to evidence that is relevant to the issues before it. It is precluded from making its decision on the basis of irrelevant or improper considerations. 4) The Board exceeded its jurisdiction and abused its power in making the discovery and production orders it did. The comments of the Court with respect to the subpoena duces tecum apply in principle to the Board's discovery and production orders. The orders were not production orders but directed Wal-Mart to comply with the subpoena duces tecum.  5) The requirement that evidence, including documentary evidence, be relevant before it can be properly considered, is a substantive issue that goes to the heart of the legitimacy of judicial or quasi-judicial dispute determination. It is an important consideration in determining whether there has been a denial of natural justice where there has been reliance on improper considerations rather than relevant evidence. 6) Some of the documents sought are in the possession and control of a third party non-resident American corporation. Additional factors and procedures should at least have been considered such as the 'likely relevance' of the documents to an issue. Solicitor and client privilege was raised with respect to some of the documents yet the Board ordered the production of those documents without ruling on the issue or without providing a means by which the confidentiality of the documents could be maintained until a ruling was made. 7) The Board has demonstrated a reluctance to give up its perceived powers of discovery despite two previous decisions of the Court of Queen's Bench and the Court of Appeal. If it interprets this decision of the Court in the same fashion, an order to reconsider the issues would be of little value to the applicant. The only feasible option is to grant the relief that is sought by quashing the two orders.  8) Wal-Mart Canada submits that the Board has already interpreted s.9 of The Trade Union Act very broadly so that its effect violates s. 2(d) of the Charter. Wal-Mart Canada submits this is evidenced in two ways. First, by the manner in which the Board has permitted the proceedings to be conducted and second, by the focus of the hearing on the alleged anti-union philosophy of Wal-Mart Canada instead of on whether or not Wal-Mart Canada has in fact influenced its employees to bring their applications against UFCW. If the Board has interpreted s. 9 of The Trade Union Act in accordance with UFCW's submissions, then such an interpretation appears to be on a collision course with s.2(d) of the Charter of Rights. If s. 9 of the Act has the effect of restricting freedom of expression between an employee and an employer that does not constitute interference or coercion, then s. 9 may well violate s. 2(d) of the Charter and if not saved by s. 1 of the Charter, is unconstitutional. However, Wal-Mart Canada's application respecting the constitutionality of s. 9 of the Act is premature in the sense that the Court did not have a sufficient factual foundation or context to properly measure s. 9 of the Act against s. 2(d) of the Charter.","Walgreens, Inc. applied for an order pursuant to Queen's Bench Rules 664 and 673 quashing the orders of the Board made on May 21, 2004 and June 24, 2004. These orders require Wal-Mart Canada to discover and produce documents, including those referred to in a subpoena duces tecum. The applicant also applied for a stay pending the appeal of the May 2004 order. HELD: The application was dismissed. 1)A review of the transcript is essential to the proper determination of the issues raised by the application and that it must, in this case, be considered part of the record. 2)The order is unconstitutional and not protected by s.1(d) of the Charter. The parties can always by agreement overcome the difficulty of an incomplete record. The application is contested by the applicant and by certain Wal- Mart Canada employees who are designated by the Board as 'Interested Parties'. 3)The Board has incorporated the evidence into its orders within the exception outlined by Lord Denning in Pushpanathan v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration), 1998 CanLII 778 (S.C.R. 982), [1998] and [1999] SCC. R. 983. 4)The applicant is required to produce the following documents: a copy of the first affidavit of Paul Meinema. The second affidavit of the applicant. The third affidavit is a summary of its views as to the validity of the subpoena and the reasons for its use. The Board has conceded that two exceptions to the general rule apply. It is beyond the scope of this judgment to review and comment on the relevancy or privilege of the affidavit evidence. 5)The application is a challenge to s.9 of The Trade Union Act. The board has incorporated this evidence into the record to consider each aspect of the breach of Charter allegations. The issues raised in the hearing are: communications to employees, not on communications among management. 6)The respondent has admitted that it was ordered to produce certain documents referred to by the respondent in the subpoena. The respondent has acknowledged that the respondent is seeking the discovery and production of documents in contravention of the previous rulings of the Saskatchewan courts. 7)It is not in dispute that the Board had the jurisdiction to order production of materials respecting communications between management and documents of the corporation to its managers. 8)Warrantless proceedings are ordered."
9_2005nssc297.txt,"The appellant was convicted of driving a motor vehicle while his licence was suspended. The appeal centred upon the adjudicator's acceptance of the police officer's evidence and the reliability of that evidence versus the defence witnesses who testified that the appellant's son was actually the driver of the vehicle. Appeal allowed; verdict of acquittal entered. The adjudicator erred by failing to address whether the appellant's evidence raised a reasonable doubt as to his innocence, particularly on the central issue of whether the appellant was the only person present in the vehicle. But not making a finding on this critical issue, this tended to suggest more strongly that the adjudicator engaged in an either/or analysis in accepting the evidence of the Crown's witnesses over that of the four defence witnesses; the adjudicator should have made clear findings of credibility based on the evidence before him.","The appellant plead not guilty to driving while his license was suspended contrary to s. 287(2) of the Motor Vehicle Act. At trial, the Crown called one witness, a Halifax police officer, who testified that the appellant was not the driver of the vehicle but that his son was. The appellant appealed the conviction on the grounds that the adjudicator failed to address the issue of whether the vehicle was driven by the sole occupant or whether both Guthro's were in the vehicle as well as their mixed breed dog. The adjudicator also failed to give the benefit of reasonable doubt to the appellant. Appeal allowed; conviction upheld; new trial ordered. The appeal of the conviction was allowed on the ground that the verdict was unreasonable and cannot be supported by the evidence and that there was insufficient evidence to prove the appellant's guilt."

The plaintiff was to provide labour and the necessary equipment to feed and maintain the cows for $.50 per cow per day. The defendant was to provide the feed and medicine. At paragraph 6 the contract stipulated that the plaintiff was to receive a bonus for each live calf that he got to pasture. The amount of the bonus was left blank. The plaintiff sues the defendant, claiming a bonus for the 2004-2005 year and the 2005-2006 year. HELD: The claim is dismissed. In law an agreement to come to an agreement is not enforceable. This is especially true where an essential term regarding remuneration has not been agreed to. The parties agreed that they would settle on the bonus amount later on but they never did. The plaintiff believes he is still entitled to a bonus. The Court cannot make the agreement for the parties.","The parties signed a handwritten agreement on the 20th day of October, 2004. The contract was to cover feeding and maintenance of one hundred and one cows to be boarded at the plaintiff's farm. The plaintiff took delivery of the cows and cared for them as he had agreed to do in the October 2004 contract. He looked after the cows as well as the calves as they were born. He sent monthly invoices to the plaintiff who paid them as they got to pasture. At the end of each month the plaintiff submitted an invoice to Ray for any costs associated with the above conditions.

9_2009skqb313.txt,"The appellant appeals a demolition order pursuant to s. 329(4) of The Cities Act issued against his property. Issues on appeal was whether the board erred by considering material which had not been before city council, whether the board committed a jurisdictional error by failing to disclose evidence to the appellant prior to considering the appeal, and whether the board was biased against the appellant. HELD: The appeal is dismissed on all grounds. The board's order is confirmed. Counsel for the City advised that it would be appropriate to extend the suspension of enforcement of the demolition order to a period of 6 months from the date of this court order. The applicant is granted a 6 month period to remedy the problems identified. 1) The board complied with the directions of the Saskatchewan Court of Appeal to ensure all disclosure had been made to the appellant of relevant evidence that would be considered by the board. The board has ensured that the appellant knew the case he had to meet. No error of law has been committed. 2) The appellant had all the information considered by the board disclosed to him. 3) There is no evidence of bias. Oppositely, the evidence supports the board's conclusion that the situation in the building constituted a nuisance related to the activities around the building, including the safety of the residents and surrounding neighbours. There is no evidence of bias against the appellant personally.","The registered owner of the property appealed a decision of the quasi-judicial board confirming the demolition order made by the City of Prince Albert with certain conditions. He alleged that the police allowed criminal activity to escalate in the building and that the board's decision to vacate and demolish the building had the effect of abating the nuisance complained of. He sought leave of the Court to withdraw as his counsel because he wanted to present his written proposal to the Court. The board confirmed the demolition and confirmed the order. The order was suspended for 6 months to allow the applicant to bring forth his proposal to remedy the nuisance. HELD: The appeal was dismissed on all grounds. 1)The board's order was confirmed. It is too late to raise such an allegation now. There is no denial of natural justice with respect to police information. 2)The applicant was granted a period of 6 months from July 24, 2009 to bring his proposal forth. Oppositely, the evidence supports the board’s conclusion that the situation in the Minto Apartments constituted a nuisance relating to the use and activities surrounding the building, including the safety, health and welfare of the residents and surrounding neighbours. The applicant was not given an opportunity to raise any allegation of bias. There was no denial that the Board had not met its obligations under s. 329(1) of the Cities Act. 3)If the applicant elects not to pursue either opportunity as outlined in the Board decision, the Board will ultimately have the responsibility of deciding what weight is to be given to such evidence, if any. The Nuisance Abatement Order dated November 18, 2004 is hereby confirmed. 4)The appeal was also dismissed on the following grounds: 1)There was no evidence to support the Board's finding that it was biased against the applicant. It was too late for the Board to consider the importance of the failure of the City to supply copy of the report to the applicants prior to the appeal to the board. The appellant could not properly respond without knowing how the case was to be presented to Council. The evidence supported the board decision that the situations in the apartment constituted a'mon nuisance' which was a nuisance as defined by the Nuisance abatement Bylaw as defined in s.329(4) of The Cities Act, which states:"
9_2013skca110.txt,"HELD: The Court addressed the issue of jurisdiction by holding that it would follow its usual practice to refuse to hear an entirely new matter argued for the first time on appeal. Since the order being appealed from was not a Part II order under SCNA, what was being appealed was a procedural order under Queen’s Bench Rule 173 and the inherent jurisdiction of the Court, and therefore the Court had jurisdiction to hear the appeal pursuant to ss. 7 and 8 of the Court of Appeal Act. The Court held with respect to the decision in Chambers that the judge properly exercised her discretion and did not err in refusing to grant the stay requested. The Chambers judge appropriately balanced the factors respecting the fairness of allowing re-litigation and determined in all of the circumstances that it would not be unfair to the appellant to allow the SCNA application to succeed because the purpose of that legislation was different and had a wider ambit of The Residential Tenancies Act. However, the result of this appeal could not be taken to have decided whether a public officer’s actions pursuant to a statutory power could be an abuse of process or that an application under The Residential Tenancies Act to terminate a tenancy by the director and subsequent SCNA application respecting the same residence may never be questioned in any circumstances.","HELD: The appeal was dismissed. The Court of Appeal held that it had jurisdiction to hear the appeal on the basis of Rule 173(e) of the Queen's Bench Rules of Court and the inherent jurisdiction of the Court to strike out or stay the application of the Director of Community Operations for a community safety order under The Safer Communities and Neighbourhoods Act on the grounds that the Director was trafficking from the premises and that the order being appealed was in the nature of a procedural order under Queen’s Bench Rule 173 and/or the inherent authority of the court. The court found that the jurisdiction to appeal under Rule 173 (e) and the Court’S inherent jurisdiction to deal with this appeal was not extended to include the issue of abuse of process. The jurisdiction of this Court was not limited by any provisions of SCAN because the application before the Hearing Officer originated as either relitigation of the same issues or fresh litigation in the interests of justice as alluded to by Abella J. in British Columbia (Workers’ Compensation Board) v. Figliola, 2011 SCC 52 (CanLII), [2011] S.C.R. 422 (C.A.) at para. 1. HELD: Appeal dismissed. 1) The court was not bound by the principles of fairness and the exercise of its inherent jurisdiction. 2) The Court was unable to decide whether the Chambers judge erred in determining in all the circumstances that there was no abuse of the process and that a stay of the order was appropriate. 3) There was no evidence that the Chambers Judge erred on the issues of estoppel, abuse of processes, or in the absence of a proper analysis of the law to determine if there was abuse of a process."
9_2014skpc205.txt,"There was contradictory evidence regarding the central issue of consent and therefore the court had to assess credibility. The complainant’s action of fleeing the situation was found to be consistent with both not consenting and with regret, humiliation and embarrassment. The evidence of the accused’s witnesses was found to raise a reasonable doubt about the complainant’s non-consent. The court concluded that the complainant was not as intoxicated as she said; for example, she had a conversation with the accused’s sister. Therefore, the court was also not satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that the complainant was incapable of consenting due to her level of intoxication. It was unnecessary for the court to consider whether the accused had an honest but mistaken belief in consent. The accused was found not guilty.","The accused was charged with sexual assault of the complainant contrary to s. 271 of the Criminal Code. The complainant had no memory of the sexual activity due to an alcohol induced blackout. The accused did not deny that he had sex with the complainant and claimed that the activity was consensual or alternatively, that he lacked the mens rea for sexual assault. HELD: The accused was found not guilty. 1)The complainant's conduct raises reasonable doubt about her non-consent and that she was capable of consenting. The evidence of the defence witnesses raises reasonable doubts about the complainant's non- consent. 2)The accused is not guilty of sexual assault because the complainant testified that she did not consent to the accused having sex with her. She was not aware that the complainant had a problem communicating her level of intoxication. 3)Credibility is to be assessed in light of all the evidence having regard to the principles established by the Supreme Court of Canada in R. v. Ewanchuk, 1991 CanLII 93 (SCC), [1991] 1 SCR 742. The Court heard contradictory evidence with respect to the central issue of consent, namely, that consent must be voluntary. Even if the complainant consented, or her conduct raised reasonable doubt, they are equally consistent with regret, humiliation and embarrassment caused by the activity being broadcast. 4)The Court heard conflicting evidence with regard to credibility, which is assessed in the light of the principles establishing by the SCC. The first issue was credibility. Consent is an essential component of both the actus reus and mens resa. If the accused believed the activity had been consensual, there was no actus. If he believed the sexual touching to take place, he lacked mens sa. 5)The second issue was whether the complainant was able to communicate beyond a reasonable doubt that she had an honest but mistaken belief in consent."
9_2016skpc123.txt,"HELD: The Charter application was granted. The accused was found not guilty. The court found that the accused’s s. 8 Charter rights had been breached. After applying the Grant analysis, the court decided that the breach was serious and that the unreasonable search affected the accused’s privacy, liberty and dignity because the accused did not invite the officer into her house, she was followed by the officer throughout her home and then handcuffed outside her home in full public view. The court concluded that society’s interests to be free from police interference in their own home without proper judicial authorization supported the exclusion of the evidence. Regarding the impaired driving charge, the accused was found not guilty because of insufficient evidence.","The accused was charged with impaired driving contrary to s. 8 of the Charter. The accused had worked at a 7-11 store and was concerned that perhaps the person who had been driving around with the young child in the vehicle was out driving around in the house. The police responded to the store and approached the home of the accused. When the accused opened the door, she was handcuffed and put in a car seat. The officer followed her around the house and observed the woman driving around the home. The officers followed the accused around the residence and around the vehicle and around it so she did not lose eye contact with her. The Crown did not argue the impaired driving charge and found there was little if any evidence to support the charge. However, the police officer's behaviour was egregious and the Charter breach was serious. HELD: The accused was found not guilty. The unreasonable search contrary to ss. 8 and s. 2 affected the accused's privacy, liberty, and human dignity. She did not ask the officer in and as I have said the police officers' accompanying her around and the actions outside of the home in full public view in a residential neighbourhood are serious. The Court of Appeal held that pursuant to 24(2) the police have an implied power to knock on someone's door for the purpose of investigating a possible drinking and driving offence, even if they do so with the intention of gathering evidence about the state of an occupant's sobriety. Although the Crown had not really argued the impairment charge, it did find there was a Charter breach."

The order was made to diminish the disparity between the income and lifestyles of the parties. The application for interim distribution of property was dismissed. The court found that this was not a situation where the net assets exceeded the amount of the distribution claimed. As the respondent had no liquid assets, the distribution of family property might eventually involve a spousal rollover from the pension funds to the petitioner.","FIAT: The wife applies for interim spousal support and an order providing her with an interim distribution of property in the amount of $25,000. HELD: The court finds that the wife has failed to demonstrate a need for support. The court orders the husband to take out loan to pay an interim amount. The wife's application for an interim order is dismissed. 1)Where there is a significant disparity in the incomes of each of the former spouses in the immediate post-separation period, and such economic disparity defines a corresponding disparity in affordability of lifestyles of the current spouses, the court directs that the husband pay the wife $500 per month in interim spouse support to equalize the gross incomes of the parties. 2)Where the net assets far exceed the amount requested, the husband must take out a loan to facilitate the payment of the interim order. 3)The court has authority to order an interim dividend pursuant to s.26(2) of The Family Property Act, SS 1997, F-6.3. 4)The wife seeks an order of $2,000 per month to equalise the gross income of the two spouses. The husband contends that this is not sustainable long-term and that the Spousal Support Advisory Guidelines should not apply in these circumstances. 5)The husband does not take issue with the wife's entitlement to interim support but states that she has failed, in the interim, to demonstrate need for it. The Court also states that the new Divorce Act, (1985) is a move away from strict needs/means analysis to broader based analysis of factors (s. 15.2(4) and objectives (s15.2)(6) of the Pensions and Benefits Act). This principle does not demand equal household incomes as is so often misunderstood. The only way to address the economic disparity between the parties is by means of an adjustment to the husband's child support obligations and the fact that he is supporting a minor child in his care. The amount of spousals should provide both of the spouses with an 'interim standard of living' which more closely relates to that of each other and to the standard of a living experienced by both before their separation. The net assets for distribution should exceed that amount requested."

b_1995canlii5809.txt,"FIAT An employer sought judicial review of a unanimous decision by an arbitration board ordering the reinstatement of an employee. The employee had previously been terminated and then reinstated by the mutual agreement of the union and the employer. The employee was then terminated a second time for a repeat infraction. The employer took the position that the agreement was a 'last chance' agreement and that the arbitration board was therefore required to uphold the second termination. The Board ruled that the agreement was not a 'last chance' agreement because the agreement stated on its face that a further infraction would result in 'discipline up to and including dismissal'. The Board therefore reinstated the employee but imposed a 16 month suspension, without pay. HELD: 1)On issues involving the interpretation of a collective agreement, an arbitration board's decision can only be overturned if it is patently unreasonable. If there is any evidence on the basis of which the board could have found as it did then its decision should not be interfered with, even if the Court would have come to a different conclusion on the same evidence. 2)Decisions involving the interpretation of a statute or the common law, however, are not within an arbitrator's core area of expertise and should therefore be reviewed with reference to the standard of correctness. 3)In this case, the 'mutual agreement' was subsidiary to the collective agreement and its interpretation was therefore within the core area of the arbitrators' expertise. The standard to be applied to the board's interpretation of the mutual agreement was therefore one of patent unreasonableness. 4)The employer's evidence that it had verbally advised the employee that he would be fired for any repeat infraction was rightly rejected as contravening the parol evidence rule. The board's interpretation of the mutual agreement was therefore not patently unreasonable and in fact was correct. 5)The board was also entitled to reject the employer's argument based upon the doctrine of 'culminating incident' and it did not act unreasonably in so doing.","FIAT. An application for judicial review of a unanimous arbitration award by a three-person panel dated December 1, 1994 which reinstated the respondent as an employee of the applicant. The respondent took the position that themutual agreement was what is colloquially referred to as a last chance agreement. Based on this agreement and the evidence presented at the hearing, the Arbitration Board was obliged to uphold the termination. The penalty imposed was a suspension without pay for 16 months. HELD: The application was dismissed with costs. 1)The Board's interpretation of the mutual agreement with respect to clause 10 was correct. 2)The respondent's statement to the grievor was admissible for the purpose of qualifying clause 10 of the agreement which provides for a range of discipline and compliance, and for substituting the word 'dismissal'. 3)The penalty imposed by the respondent was a suspended without pay of approximately 16 months for 16 month."

The GIC was attachable pursuant to s5(1) of the Attachment of Debts Act.  1)The main point was whether the debt was not attachable because it was not accruing due when the garnishee summons was served in that it did not bind the debt. 2)The leading authority, Webb v. Stenton, concluded that existing debts payable in the future are attachable. 3)The garnishability of the debt owing under a promissory note is not prevented because the debt is conditional by reason of the possibility of assignment.  4)Saskatchewan courts have followed Bel-Fran holding that a term deposit is attachable. The only exception is Tradewinds which overlooked the aspect of s5(1) which permits attaching of debts which are accruing due. Tradewinds is contrary to Spiritwood and misapplies the law summarized in Barsi v. Farcas. The historic review demonstrated that there have been gradual changes in the law of garnishment. Based on the cases reviewed the assignability of a GIC is not the type of condition which has been held to affect the determination that a debt is accruing due. 5)Because of the early payment to the estate there were no intervening claims and no priority issue arose. It would be inappropriate to deny judgment in the circumstances. DISSENT: The appeal would be dismissed for reasons other than those reached by the chambers judge. 1)The statement that the creditor cannot be in a better position than the debtor to demand payment under the GIC is probably correct but was not a factor as the Bank was not seeking payment before its maturity date. The Bank's position was the debt had been garnisheed and payment should have been made to the Bank on maturity. 2)The chamber judge's comment that the Bank could have seized the GIC under execution and then had it sold by the sheriff was obiter. 3)The debt was a present debt due on its maturity date and therefore qualified as one that was accruing due. 4)Whether it was conditional depended upon whether the opportunity of assignment constitutes a conditional obligation. There is no significant difference between a promissory note and a GIC as they both contain a promise to pay a sum certain at a designated date. 5)Some jurisdictions specifically provide that a debt payable within six years of the service of the garnishee is garnishable.","Whether money owed under a guaranteed investment certificate (GIC) is a debt 'accruing due' under the Attachment of Debts Act, R.S.C. A-32 and subject to garnishment cannot be determined by reference only to garnishability of promissory notes not yet due. In this case, the Bank applied in Queen's Bench chambers under s.18 of the ATTACH of Debt Act for judgment against Firstline in the amount of $10,100.14. The Bank was concerned that existing debts payable in the future were attachable to the GIC. The GIC was not a debt owing under the mortgage but a conditional one and made so by reason of assignment."
b_1996canlii5628.txt,"The plaintiff was terminated as a sales agent after being employed by the defendant for 26 years. As part of the termination package he received 14 months salary continuation. The plaintiff claimed that he had not received 'reasonable notice' and sought damages. He also claimed that he was owed arrears of salary at the time of his dismissal. The defendant argued that the plaintiff had failed to mitigate his damages. Dismissing the action, that the appropriate period of notice was in the range of 14 to 15 months. Since the calculation of a 'reasonable period of notice' is not an exact exercise, either period could have been justified. Thus, it could not be said that the 14 month period given by the defendant was unreasonable. Furthermore, the plaintiff was not owed any arrears. Finally, in view of a non-competition clause in the contract of employment, it was not unreasonable for the plaintiff not to have pursued employment with other insurance companies any more than he had.","The plaintiff was terminated as a sales agent in 1991. He had been with the defendant since 1965 and continued in his position for approximately 26 years. The defendant had previously offered him a position as an insurance agent in a company that offered its sales agents a compensation package that increased the level of compensation on new policies written and at the same time reduced the level on renewals. The plaintiff was also advised that he would receive salary continuation and benefits until January 1993 or until he secured alternative employment, whichever first occurs. HELD: The plaintiff's termination was not a failure by the defendant to mitigate his damages. 1)The plaintiff's course of conduct was not unreasonable and as such, did not constitute a failure. His employment contract with Allstate incorporated a two year 'non-competition clause' which had no part in his termination. The employer sought to enforce the non-comp competition clause as an impediment to the plaintiff's successful obtaining new employment. The court rejected the claim that any awarded reasonable period of notice exceeded the already paid 14 months provided by the plaintiff to the defendant. The Court held that the plaintiff was entitled to reasonable notice in respect to his termination as long as he continued to seek employment. 2)The defendant failed to provide reasonable notice to the terminated employee. The termination of the employee's employment contract did not result in the termination of his employment. Rather, the termination was a failure of the defendant's reasonable notice."
b_1996canlii6726.txt,"FIAT. The plaintiffs sought an order preserving and detaining certain proceeds from oil production properties which were being held by an escrow agent pursuant to an order of the bankruptcy court in Alberta and a further order preserving and detaining all future proceeds from those properties. The applicants claimed such orders were necessary to protect their claims under the approximately 408 builders' liens filed against those oil properties. The contents of the statements of claim in each of the five actions were identical. HELD: The application was dismissed. The escrow agent was ordered to remit to Herc the lien property revenues with any interest earned less the agent's appropriate costs. With the exception of SEM the parties appearing through counsel were awarded their costs against the applicants. 1)The tests set out in Bean on Injunctions for granting a mandatory injunction were summarized in Cupar School Division. The tests really state in different forms the generally recognized test for prima facie case, irreparable harm and balance of convenience but with more stringent requirements. 2)Only one lien holder filed an affidavit, no invoices or other information were filed substantiating the amount claimed in any of the liens. The word 'or' used in one of the liens indicated that the person subject to the lien did not know whether the water or oil was transported. Whatever prima facie case the lien holders might have was weakened. 3)The applicants had not established a very strong probability that grave danger will accrue. The risk to the respondents if the order should be granted was far greater than the risk to the applicants if the order were not granted. The oil properties would continue to decline without further development or recovery efforts to maintain or increase production. If a preservation order issued SEM would likely exercise its extensive powers under the Oil and Gas Conservation Act. 4)While s33 of the Builders' Lien Act provides for a lien on the holdback of any trust funds held by the contractor, it does not give the lienholder a charge against any other moneys. A builder's lien cannot be looked on as 'proof' that the amount claimed is what is actually owing. The only remedy open to the lienholder is to enforce its claim under Part VIII of the Builders' Lien Act. The statement of claim said nothing about dates and times. On the material filed it was impossible to know whether any of the respondents were intervening parties within s49(5)(a). 5)The second and third tests were not met. The order would guarantee irreparable harm by freezing the capital necessary to hinder the decline in value. It would be unacceptable to SEM that lien holders should receive the income from the properties without being responsible for the environmental costs. 6)The fourth test required that the defendant know exactly what he has to do. If the order were to issue it would be difficult to determine the proper amount of lien property revenue that should be paid to an escrow agent. There was no definition of net revenues in the Plan. The applicants would have been required pursuant to Rule 390 to pay full compensation before the order was issued.","FIAT. The plaintiffs sought an order preserving and detaining certain proceeds from certain oil production properties, those proceeds now being held by an escrow agent pursuant to an order of the bankruptcy court in Alberta and a further order preserving the proceeds from future proceeds from those properties. HELD: 1)The plaintiffs had not met the first test of prima facie case, irreparable harm or balance of convenience. 2)The applicants had not established a very strong probability that grave damage would accrue to them in the future. 3)The plaintiff had not demonstrated a strong probability upon the facts that grave harm would accue to him in the near future. 4)The Court held that the plaintiffs' application was premature. The Court found that if the order was made, the plaintiffs would suffer irreparable damage because the fruits of any successful litigation will be no longer available at the time the litigation comes to an end, and they suggest the liened lands will not have enough value in them to satisfy judgment."
b_1996canlii7148.txt,"A claim for damages to the plaintiff's leased automobile arising out an accident. The action against the defendant Ruhr had been discontinued. An SGI adjuster appraised the damage but during the course of repairing the vehicle further damage was found. A roving adjuster authorized the replacement of the exhaust system but deducted 20% for depreciation. The plaintiff brought an action for reimbursement of the $503.73 arguing that SGI elected to repair or replace the exhaust system under statutory condition 8(4) of s39 of the Automobile Accident Insurance Act. SGI took the position that as Crestview was the registered owner of the vehicle the plaintiff was not entitled to bring this action as he was not the insured within the meaning of the Act. SGI also argued that Crestview authorized the repairs and acknowledged the 20% deduction as registered owner and that if the plaintiff paid the $503.73 he did so under his private lease contract with Crestview. It also argued that it is entitled to deduct for depreciation in any event. HELD: The claim against SGI was dismissed with taxed costs.  1)An election under statutory condition 8(4) amounts to an irrevocable decision to repair regardless of costs of repairs. Once an election is made the insurer is bound to pay or reinstate. An insurer by its conduct may be deemed to make an election to reinstate. The insurer's election to reinstate unilaterally creates a new contract which the insurer may not unilaterally revoke. On the facts the insurer neither expressly nor by its conduct elected to reinstate. The roving appraiser provided an appraisal to Crestview which included the depreciation deduction. Crestview repaired the vehicle without advising the plaintiff. 2)The concept of waiver in insurance law encompasses an election to pay or to reinstate. Estoppel was not applicable. Two provisions of the Saskatchewan Act provide that SGI in certain situations is not deemed to have waived provisions of the Act. The roving appraiser reassessed the claim and included the newly found damages. These acts related to the appraisal of the claim and could not constitute a waiver of statutory condition 8(1). They did not constitute an election under statutory condition 8(4). Crestview, not SGI, took the steps to repair the vehicle. As the plaintiff did not receive a written waiver of statutory condition 8(1) pursuant to s77 the insurer could not be deemed to have waived its option to enforce statutory condition 8(1).  3)The exhaust system was three years old and had 46,000 km of wear. A 20% deduction for depreciation was appropriate and therefore allowed.  4)It was not necessary to determine whether the plaintiff was the 'insured' as defined by the Act.",This was a claim for damages to the plaintiff's leased motor vehicle arising out of an automobile accident. The plaintiff claimed for reimbursement of the $503.73 deducted for depreciation. The insurer argued that SGI elected to repair or replace the vehicle under statutory condition 8(4) of the Automobile Accident Insurance Act. HELD: The claim was dismissed. 1)The plaintiff was not aware of the 20% deduction for depreciation until he attended to pick up the vehicle. The repairs were complete at that time. 2)SGI was not responsible for the entire cost of the repair. 3)The claim was not made within the meaning of s. 39 of the Act.

The plaintiffs applied for an order striking out the statement of defence and counterclaim and separate statement of Helen Rilkoff as not disclosing a reasonable defence or cause of action.

The defendants asserted their damages arose in 1994 and that the cause thereof was different than those previously dealt with. HELD: The application was dismissed with costs to the defendants in any event of the cause. 1)The fact that the plaintiffs filed a 55 page brief in support of their submissions and the defendants filed a 14 page brief in response evidenced that the issues were not easily resolved and certainly not on a summary basis.  2)An application to strike out pleadings basically permits only an examination of the impugned pleadings to determine if any justifiable dispute is revealed. If no facts are in dispute, the parties may resort to Rule 188. Only if the defendants consented to the application being converted into an application pursuant to Queen's Bench Rule 188 could the court proceed to resolve the questions of law.",FIAT The plaintiffs applied for an order striking out the defendants statement of defence and counter-claim and separate statement of defense of Helen Rilkoff. HELD: The application was dismissed with costs to the defendants in any event of the cause.  1)The issues raised in the defendants' statement of argument and counterclaim did not disclose a reasonable defence nor did the issues in the counter-statement show a reasonable cause of action. 2)The Court was not permitted to embark upon the resolution of legal questions in order to determine whether the pleadings should be struck as requested. 3)The application was not subject to the usual caveats of Queen's Bench Rule 188 and Rule 173. 4)The issue raised did not appear susceptible of being resolved on a summary basis and certainly not on a summarily basis.
b_1997canlii11437.txt,"A month following the birth of the plaintiff's only child by caesarian section, she underwent a hysterectomy on an emergency basis. She believed that the post-partum haemorrhage was caused by retained products of conception and that failure to perform a dilation and curettage procedure resulted in the hysterectomy. HELD: The plaintiff's claim was dismissed with costs. 1)The plaintiff failed to prove that the defendant was negligent in his treatment of her. The doctor's treatment and care met the standard of care expected of the average physician and surgeon, specializing in gynaecology and obstetrics. 2)She failed to prove that the cause of the post-partum haemorrhage was retained products of conception or that his failure to perform a D&amp;C resulted in the necessity of a hysterectomy or because of any other negligent act or omission on his part. The most likely hypothesis was that the post-partum hemorrhage was caused in this case by the necrosis of the cervix. Given the rarity of this condition and paucity of documented medical knowledge the defendant doctor could not be faulted. The evidence did not support the suggestion that a D&amp;C would have cured the hemorrhage. ADDENDUM: 1)The first paragraph was deleted and a new paragraph substituted: Kaban v. Sett in applying Ares v. Venner rejected the view that nurse's notes are only prima facie evidence and, if there is sworn testimony contrary to the notes, the notes cease to be prima facie evidence. 2)A paragraph was added after the quote on page 4: The Manitoba Court of Appeal, in dismissing the plaintiff's appeal, agreed with the trial judge's determination of the admissibility of the nurse's notes.",HELD: The Court held that the plaintiff's allegations of negligence on the part of the defendant were not supported by the medical evidence. The Court found that the likely cause of the hemorrhage was a miscarriage which the doctor failed to remove from her uterus by a dilation and curettage procedure which the plaintiff alleged would have remedied the bleeding which in turn would have obviated the necessity of performing the hysterectomy.
b_1998canlii12364.txt,"The primary issue was whether the youth court has jurisdiction in proceedings which are commenced in youth court where it was not possible to determine whether at the time the alleged offences were committed the accused was a young person or an adult. The secondary issue was whether a writ of mandamus should issue. The accused was charged with two indictable offences, sexual assault and incest, as well as acts of gross indecency. The Crown stayed an identical information previously laid against the accused alleging the same offences occurred when he was an adult. The accused became an adult in October 1985 and was charged with certain offences which occurred between 1985 and 1989. The summary conviction appeal court judge found the provincial court judge erred in declining jurisdiction and that because of the uncertainty when the alleged offences occurred, the accused should be tried under the least onerous regime, youth court. The appeal judge then ordered a writ of mandamus directing the youth court judge to render a decision. It was common ground that a youth court judge does not have jurisdiction with respect to offences committed while he was an adult. HELD: The decision of the summary conviction appeal court was set aside and the matter remitted to youth court. Either party may apply for an order under s16 to decide the proper forum to hear the charges.  1)Section 16 is the ideal vehicle for the youth court to make a proper determination of the proper jurisdiction to hear the charges. If the Crown after a complete investigation is unable to particularize the time when the offence(s) occurred and alleges that it (they) occurred over a period of time which included when the accused was a young offender and an adult, the preferable approach is to have the Crown commence the proceedings in youth court because some of the offences occurred while he was a youth. The Crown should then apply to a youth court judge for a transfer hearing under s16 to determine the proper forum to hear the charges.  2)There are two ways to determine which of the two courts should assume jurisdiction: view the facts in a manner most favorable to the accused and deem the offence was committed when the accused was a young person; or order a transfer hearing under s16(1) of the Young Offenders Act to determine whether the offences should be heard in youth court or ordinary court. 3)The transfer hearing must proceed in an impartial fashion in accordance with the principles of natural justice and s7 of the Charter. 4)Section 16(2) provides the factors to be taken into account in determining the competing interests of the youth and the public. 5)The position taken in the Ontario Court of Appeal in R.v. A(EA) does not lend itself to universal application. R. v. A(EA) is distinguishable and should be confined to its particular facts.","The appellant was charged with two indictable offences over a period of seven years. The Crown had previously alleged that the offences occurred when the appellant was a young person. The youth court judge dismissed the Crown's identical information and ordered a transfer hearing under s.16 of the Young Offenders Act to determine the proper forum to hear the charges. The appellant appealed. Appeal allowed. The primary issue on this appeal is whether the youth court has jurisdiction in proceedings which are commenced in youth court where it is alleged the offences could have occurred. If the Crown, after a complete investigation, is unable to particularize the time when the offence or offences occurred, it is not possible to determine whether the accused is a young offender or an adult. The secondary issue of whether a writ of mandamus should issue will of necessity follow the result of the determination of the first issue. HELD: The appeal was allowed. 1)The decision of the summary conviction appeal court judge is set aside and the matter remitted to a youth court to be heard according to law. In the circumstances either party may apply to a Youth Court judge for an order under s16 to determine if the charges against the accused should be heard. 2)The Crown has the onus of establishing a sufficient conflict between the competing interests, rehabilitation of the youth and public interest, such that the court will give precedence to the public interest. The Court considered the effects of the transition provisions in the Act and in particular s.79(4) in R. v. B.(K). It would appear there are no adverse consequences from making such an order. The court also considered the issue of when the accused committed the offences, because some of the offences were alleged to have occurred when he was a youth. It would be most favourable to the appellant to conclude that the time of the commission of the offence was when he wasn't young. 3)If the Crown was unable to find a time of particularization, the Court would order that the charges be proceeded within ordinary court with the law ordinarily applicable to an adult charged with the offence. In this case the primary issue was whether a youth Court judge should commence the proceedings in youth or adult court. The issues here are whether the Crown should apply to the Youth Court Judge for a transfer proceeding under s 16 of the Act to decide the appropriate forum for the charges and if a writ should issue to determine that forum. 4)The Court reviewed the factors that led to the conclusion that the accused was not guilty of any of the alleged offences."

In the second application the mother sought to have the paragraph in the 1994 order restraining the parents from removing the children from the province without the other's written consent or court order struck. HELD: 1)The mother was advised to apply by notice of motion with appropriate supporting affidavits.  2)The arrears were $11,838.39 as the father had paid money directly which was not accounted for in the Statement of Arrears. Since the Guidelines were not in force prior to 1997, they do not automatically apply to a support payable prior to 1997. The father's income was sufficient for him to pay child support for 1996 and 1997. Arrears for 1993 to 1995 inclusive were reduced as he was not able to pay according to the order at those times.

The arrearing for the respondent was $13.472.39. 3) The petitioner's gross annual income was $22,993.00. 4) The amount owed to the respondent for access was $1,584.00 directly from the respondent. The petitioner did not proceed by way of notice motion nor did she file appropriate affidavit evidence in support of her application. In the circumstances, the Court advised her that she was prepared to apply for notice. 5) The father was to pay $250 per month to the petitioner for access not less than one full weekend per month between 6:00 p.m. on Friday to 6:30 p. m. on Sunday upon two weeks prior notice together plus other periods of time when he is available to attend at Saskatoon for the purpose of exercising access in a manner consistent with the best interest of the children including their need to be available for school. 6) The mother was to have access for the children in the amount of $325 per month for the sum of $350 per month. 7) The court ordered that the respondent pay $5,000 on account that the arsars accrued in the 1993 and 1998 payments be extinguished unless otherwise ordered. 8) The parties agree that the father should have access to all children on the terms heretofore stated.

b_2001skqb124.txt,"The medical doctor alleged the other medical doctors owed a fiduciary duty to act in good faith with respect to their agreement to perform on-call services for the District Health Board. Under the voluntary arrangement doctors who chose not to enter the arrangement remained on-call to look after their own patients and to respond to emergencies. It worked well until Hanna established another clinic and began dividing his time between Regina and the Moosomin clinic. HELD: The actions against the doctors and health district were dismissed with taxed costs.  1)Hanna's exclusion from the roster was authored by his own conduct. When he was habitually late on his weekend on-call duties and sometimes failed to show at all, the remaining doctors set up a new on-call roster which did not include him. Such action was necessary under the bylaws governing the hospital and to provide good patient care to the hospital. He was not only remiss in performing his on-call duties but there were serious questions about his professional competence. He would admit a patient and fail to attend upon him or her for several days. Or he would fail to diagnose an obvious condition. His reasons for his failure to attend a meeting convened by the hospital administrator to resolve the problems was unacceptable. 2)There was no evidence of a legally binding contract between the doctors. The on-call arrangement was voluntary. There was no expressed intention that it be legally enforceable. 3)The common characteristics defining a fiduciary relationship were discussed in Baskerville v. Thurgood. There was no fiduciary with power over anyone and therefore no fiduciary relationship with respect to the doctors.  4)The relationship between the hospital and its doctors having privileges in the hospital is one that is defined by the Hospital Standards Act and Regulations and bylaws of the Health District. Consideration was also given to the relationship with the College of Physicians and Surgeons. A hospital is never, on the facts, in the position of a fiduciary towards its doctors.

The court dismissed the action against Crouse and Kirsch as having no legal obligation to act in good faith in connection with an arrangement entered into by all of them to perform the on-call services required of each of them by the defendant. The plaintiff was neither the originator nor the party to the arrangement introduced by the doctors nor party to it.

HELD: The order of severance sought by the applicant is granted so that the issue raised in the action may proceed at an early trial. The issues raised in this action are of no concern to the applicant. The applicant is standing by while the third party proceeding is debated. The plaintiff is stalled in the pursuit of resolution of the issues of his claim. He is also facing the prospect of being prejudiced in the claim for apportioning the amount of any judgment as between Canada and Les Oblats de Marie Immaculee du Manitoba. The plaintiffs are also at risk. The Attorney General of Canada vigorously opposes severance on the ground that the Government of Canada would be prejudiced if the issues are severed. The fears of procedural unfairness expressed by counsel for the Attorney General if the issue are severed are groundless. The court was satisfied that although the litigation was meritorious, it would result in a very lengthy period of time. The pursuit of the issue of cross- claim and third-party proceedings will result in the plaintiff's pursuit of a resolution of his claims. Not only the plaintiff but also hundreds of claimants who had been asked by the management pre-trial judge to regard the plaintiff as a test case are standing by pending a judgment whereby they will be able to measure the success or failure of their claims. The actions pending in this proceeding will be fairly dealt with under the Rules. The concerns of procedural fairness expressed by the counsel for counsel for AG if the sides are severed were groundless and the costs of the litigation would be substantial. It is in the best interests of justice that the order of the severance requested by the plaintiff should be granted so as to allow the issue to proceed.

b_2002skqb72.txt,"Both sought to vary the June 30, 1999 child support order under which the father was to pay monthly child support of $987 based on an income of $80,278. He ceased paying when the children did not attend school full-time. The 21 year old worked for several years before returning to his mother's home in August 2001 and commencing full-time studies. He continued to work part-time and obtained student loans and a student line of credit. The daughter resumed living with her mother in January 2002 and was attending university full-time. Both adult children were assuming responsibility for most of their education costs by taking student loans. The mother's position was the father should pay the table amount of support for both children and his proportionate share of post-secondary expenses not covered by student loans. At issue also was payment of arrears for July to December 2001. HELD: 1)The father was to pay $1,153 per month for support for the adult children for the months of September to April inclusive, pursuant to s.3(2)(a) and 3(1)(a) of the Guidelines. Based on the criteria set forth in Farden and Zaba, both children were children of the marriage as contemplated by the Act. They were involved in the reasonable pursuit of post-secondary education and neither was able to withdraw from the charge of their parents. It was appropriate to determine the obligation in accordance with s.3(2)(a). The student loans covered most direct education expenses of tuition, books and fees. The line of credit was not considered a part of the son's means available to meet his needs. The father has a reasonably substantial income ($96,300) and cannot seek to reduce or avoid a child support obligation by guaranteeing a loan, which the child will have to repay. Child support arrears for July to December 2001 for the son to a total of $2,872 were payable at a rate of $718 per month. The daughter's needs were met while attending university in Alberta.  3)While it would appear beyond debate that an adult child must make reasonable efforts to contribute to his or her support and education, it is not so clear how this is to be applied to an individual circumstance. The principles enunciated in Francis were recast in the context of s.3(2). A similar summary, albeit with respect to an application under s.4, is found in Metzner as reiterated in MacDonald. It is clear from Francis that determining inappropriateness is not a matter of the court determining what the budget ought to be and whether a Table amount exceeds that budget. To revert to such an approach is to undermine the presumptive rule and legislated objectives of predictability, consistency and efficiency. 4)The father was to pay his proportionate share (80%) of any expenses not covered within 30 days of such funds being due. If the parties were unable to work out an adjustment for any unused education tax credit, an application may be brought to court. 5)The mother was awarded her costs of the application fixed at $750.","The parties sought to vary the existing child support order. The petitioner had two children, aged 21 and 18. The respondent was paying child support in the amount of $987.00 per month on the basis of an income of $80,278.00. HELD: 1) The respondent failed to have resort to the provisions of s. 3(2)(b) of the Guidelines. The child was not a child of the marriage inasmuch as he was not dependent upon his parents for the necessaries of life. The court found that the respondent's income had increased with the age of majority and the child was now able to contribute to his or her own support through part-time employment. 2) Based on the criteria set forth in Farden and Zaba, supra, both the petitioner and the respondent are children of the Act. They are involved in the reasonable pursuit of post-secondary education and neither is able to withdraw from the charge of their parents. The Court of Appeal found that it is not inappropriate to award the amount prescribed by the applicable Table. 3) The petitioner's financial statement indicates food and shelter related expenses of $18,000 per annum out of total living expenses, exclusive of source deductions of approximately $30,000.  4) The court concluded that the criteria for determining whether an 'adult child' in attendance at university qualifies as a child under the Act and, if so, the extent of the obligation of parents to support their child. 5) The Court found that in the circumstances at hand and the demonstrated ability of the children to obtain reasonably remunerative summertime employment that they are not dependent on their parents during the summer months and have the ability to contribute adequately to their food, shelter and related expenses when not in attendance for school. 6) The amount of support payable by the respondent in accordance with the Table amount is $1,153 per month based upon the respondent’s income. This amount is not so high as to exceed the generous ambit within which reasonable disagreement is possible. The amount determined by applying the Guidelines as if the child were under the age- majority is assumed to be approximately $600 per month. 7) The chamber judge misapplied s.3(2) of The Guidelines. He ought to have determined the amount having regard for the actual means and needs of the child and the financial ability of each[sic] his parents to contribute toward his support. 8) The Table amount awarded to the petitioner was an amount based on the full extent of his"
b_2003skqb397.txt,"The plaintiff claims that his father intended to designate him as the sole beneficiary of a $60,000 mutual fund but that this plan was defeated by the negligence of the defendants. The defendant admitted he was aware of the deceased's intention to leave the investment to his son. The defendant entered the plaintiff's name in the beneficiary designation portions of the fund application. However, the beneficiary designation was void by virtue of the mutual fund being non-registered. The defendant gave evidence that he advised the deceased that he would have to make a specific bequest in his will. The deceased made no special designation in his will and, at his death, the investment became part of the residue of his estate and was divided between the plaintiff and his sister. HELD: The plaintiff was awarded judgment against the defendant Nordstrom for half the value of the investment at its maturity, plus pre-judgment interest and costs.  1) Nordstrom was a professional, who held himself out as possessing special skill, judgment and knowledge in financial planning. The advice and information provided to the deceased was provided in the course of the defendant's business. The defendant had a financial interest in the transaction and was cognizant of the fact that the realization of the deceased's intent to benefit the plaintiff was dependent upon there being a valid beneficiary designation. The products sold by the defendant are used as estate planning tools. The intervention of death removed any opportunity to correct the matter and, without the application of the Wilhelm principle, this financial planner would go scott free and the plaintiff would bear the loss. The 'disappointed beneficiary' principle was applicable in this case.","The plaintiff claims that the mutual fund ought never to have formed part of his father's estate. It was his father’s intention to name him as beneficiary of the fund but that this plan was defeated by the negligence of the defendants. HELD: The plaintiff’ s claim for 50 percent of the value of the investment at its maturity was dismissed. The defendant‘s negligence in failing to include the names of the deceased beneficiary in the beneficiary designation portion of the application form did not reflect the standard of conduct and care one is reasonably entitled to expect of a professional. The intervention of death removed any opportunity to correct the matter and, without application of the Wilhelm principle, this financial planner would go scott free and the third party would bear the loss. The plaintiff had cause of action as disappointed beneficiary and that he suffered damages as result of Nordstrom’d negligence. The defendants’ claim for prejudgment interest from the date of death of Mayer to the date that judgment is payable and his costs to be taxed. Given that the products sold by the defendant were frequently used as estate planning tools, all evidence of a failure of the professional to discharge his duty of care to the client was lost."
b_2004nssc255.txt,"The defendant doctor in a personal injury case applied to set aside the Jury Notice filed by the plaintiff. Application dismissed; the evidence would not be so complex and scientific that the plaintiff's substantive right to a jury trial should be denied. Although the medical charts exceeded 1500 pages, the more relevant hospital records were less than 100 pages; the essence of the liability issue would be limited in time, in the most relevant anatomical area and in the number of medical personnel involved in the relevant interventions; the factual material did not appear to be in dispute; and the issues were no more complex than most causation issues presented in medical malpractice cases.","The plaintiff was injured in a single motor vehicle accident while riding in a vehicle operated by the defendant. The accident was substantially based on injuries he received in the accident and more specifically, on the treatment provided to him by the other respondent at the Cape Breton Regional Hospital. The plaintiff's wife died shortly after the plaintiff's operation to insert pressure clamps in the presence of an undetected disk hernia. Jurisdiction: the evidence will not be so complex and scientific that the applicant's substantive right to a trial by jury should be denied. The evidence will be limited in time and in the most relevant anatomical area (the thoracic vertebrae region of the spinal column). The medical experts will mainly focus on the interventions of the medical personnel at the medical centres at Neil's Harbour, Sydney and Halifax. However, the principal subject matter will be the medical condition of the plaintiff and his wife, who died after the defendant's operation. The applicant's wife's cross-claim against the doctor was dismissed by the Court Order dated March 21, 2001. HELD: The Court found that the evidence was not so complex as to warrant a trial. The Court ordered an expert report from an economist to be presented at trial to determine if the plaintiff’s dramatic result was caused by or contributed to by the surgery to insert pressures clamps into the spinal canal and the consequent disk herniation or other impingement into his neck. The court ordered an independent expert to be present at the trial to assess the complexity of the evidence and to consider the effect of her death on the action before taking any steps in response to this information."
b_2006skqb183.txt,"The plaintiffs seek damages arising from the alleged nuisance and negligence caused the defendants in the operation of the golf course. The plaintiffs also seek an injunction to prohibit the defendants from continuing to operate the golf course in a manner that causes errant golf balls to enter the plaintiffs' property. HELD: 1) The court looked at other jurisdictions for guidance as to what number of errant balls might constitute a nuisance. It would appear that anything from 200 golf balls and up over the span of a year is definitely an unreasonable interference with the use and enjoyment of one's own property. Over a span of 9 years, the plaintiffs have had approximately 1,000 golf balls per year enter their property. In this case, the number of golf balls being hit onto the adjacent properties from the defendant's golf course is far greater than the number cited in many of the cases put forward. There is no doubt then that the present operation of the ninth hole is a nuisance and continues to be a nuisance.  2) The wording of the Optionee's Indemnity clause is of little value to the defendants given the evidence of the parties. The evidence confirms that when the residential area was developed and the contract signed, no one, including the operator, anticipated the extent of the existing problem. Accordingly, the plaintiffs could not have agreed to save the defendant harmless from a problem of this magnitude. 3) The plaintiffs will be compensated for the extensive physical damaged to the plaintiffs' properties, but also for the loss of the use and enjoyment of their yards for 7 months of the year. 4) The plaintiffs are entitled to injunctive relief to put an end to the nuisance that has continued for the past 9 years. The defendants are enjoined from allowing golfers from hitting golf balls on the ninth hole so that they land anywhere near the plaintiffs' property.","The plaintiffs sued for damages arising from alleged nuisance and negligence caused by the defendants, Great Plains Leaseholds Ltd. and the Town of White City with respect to their operation of the golf course and for a permanent injunction to prohibit the defendants from continuing to operate the golfcourse in a manner that causes errant golf balls to enter the plaintiffs' property. The plaintiffs had acquired their lot in early 1997 and the plaintiffs, Bosenberg and Strassburg, bought their home from the previous owners in February 2003. They have had approximately 1,000 golf balls enter their property every year. Although fewer balls landed in the plaintiffs’ yards than in 2004, they have suffered extensive damage to their homes, windows and on other occasions the ball has narrowly missed hitting their vehicles. HELD: The plaintiffs are entitled to injunctive relief to put an end to the nuisance which has continued for the past nine years. 1) The defendant is liable to all of the plaintiffs in negligence for the failure over the past years to remedy or eliminate this hazardous and dangerous situation.  2) The plaintiff was awarded injunctions against the defendant and the defendants for injunctions to put a stop to the ongoing nuisance. 3) The defendants were ordered to pay $18,000 to the plaintiffs for the loss of use and enjoyment of their property over the course of the next 9 years. 4) The plaintiffs were ordered not to play golf on their property until the situation was remedied in accordance with the recommendations in the expert’s report. 5) There was no evidence that the plaintiffs anticipated the extent of the existing problem and the defendant could not have agreed to save the plaintiff harmless from a problem of this magnitude. 6) The court found that the plaintiff could only be responsible for those damages which arose since they became the owners of the course. 7) There were no expert or other evidence to support this conclusion. 8) The Court held that the defendant was negligent for the design and management of the Golf Course and for its failure to remedy the problem. 9) There are several factors that would cause golf balls being hit from the adjacent golf course to enter plaintiffs' yards. The defendant was liable to the plaintiff in negligence.  10) The evidence from the plaintiffs and the plaintiff confirmed that when the residential area was developed and the contract was signed, no one, including the operator (Great Plains), anticipated that extent of existing problem. The plaintiff could not agree to save him from a continuing nuisance."
b_2008skpc104.txt,"The accused was charged with resisting arrest contrary to s. 129(a) of the Criminal Code. The defence argued that there were insufficient grounds for the accused's arrest and he was therefore justified in resisting his detention. The Crown's position was that the police were justified in arresting the accused for being drunk in public. HELD: The Crown has proved beyond a reasonable doubt that the officers were engaged in the lawful execution of their duty when the accused resisted their efforts to arrest him pursuant to The Summary Offences Procedure Act. There was a complaint to police concerning the accused. He was heard and seen banging on the door of an apartment. He smelled of alcohol. He was slightly unsteady on his feet and he was yelling and swearing at the police. Given the complaint and the observations made by the attending constables, it was reasonable for them to believe that the accused was intoxicated due to the use of alcohol. He was causing a disturbance to others. Prior to his arrest, the accused began to yell at the officers in a parking lot which is, without any doubt, a public place. No one else was present who may have been capable and willing to take charge of the accused. The defence argued that in these circumstances the arresting officers should have questioned that accused as to where else he might go to sleep off his intoxication. The Crown submitted that in circumstances such as this, the police are not required to sit down and discuss with the accused where he might go. In the Court's view, s. 52(2) of The Summary Offences Procedure Act should be interpreted as meaning that there must be no other person present at the scene who is capable and willing to take care of the person who is subject to arrest. There was no such person in this case. The arrest was, on these facts, lawful.","The accused was charged with resisting arrest contrary to s. 129(a) of the Criminal Code.

b_2010skqb311.txt,"The accused was charged with having aftermarket tint on the side windows of his vehicle. He appealed on other grounds. The summary conviction appeal judge raised the issue of the sufficiency of the charge on its own motion. The face of the ticket purported to charge the accused with an offence under s. 66(3) of The Vehicle Equipment Regulations. HELD: The charge was declared a nullity because it was drafted so poorly that it did not give fair notice to the accused of the charge or the penalty to be imposed if breach was established. Section 66(3) of The Vehicle Equipment Regulations purports to make displaying aftermarket tint an offence, but the section is a charging offence and does not prescribe a penalty. The correct way to charge an accused with this offence is under s. 113 of The Traffic Safety Act which makes it an offence to operate a motor vehicle on a public highway that is not equipped in accordance with the regulations. The count could not be amended to cure the defect because the charge was a nullity and void ab initio. The conviction was quashed.","The appellant appealed his conviction for unlawful possession of sunscreen in front side windows contrary to the Motor Vehicle Equipment Regulations (VEDs). The charge, as drafted, was so palpably bad it did not give fair notice to the defendant of the nature of the charge nor the penalties that may be imposed if a breach was established. HELD: The appeal was allowed and the conviction was quashed. 1)It is not possible to amend the count so as to cure the defect. This is because the count is a nullity, and a void is not capable of amendment. 2)The appeal is allowed because the appeal is not necessary to cure this defect. The Crown did not exercise the right to amend its pleadings with meticulous care. 3)The Court invited both the Crown and the appellant to address the issue of the sufficiency of the charges."

The complainant was an off duty police officer who left his home and knocked on the passenger window. The accused exited the van and assaulted the complainant resulting in the complainant receiving a broken nose and ankle. The accused was charged with aggravated assault and assaulting a police officer. The accused asserted a defence of self-defence to the charge of assault and questioned whether the complainant was properly identified and acting as a police officer in the line of duty at the time of the incident. HELD: The accused was convicted of aggravated assault and acquitted of the charge of assaulting a peace officer. 1) Regardless of whether the complainant was acting in the course of his duties as a police officer, he had a lawful right to intervene to prevent the continuation of the breach of the peace he witnessed. Even if the original actions of the accused might be viewed as originally defensive in nature, he clearly used more force than was necessary to defend himself.  2) Although three of the Crown's witnesses identified that the complainant identified himself as a police officer, none of the versions of what occurred were consistent with the other. The Court was left with doubt as to whether the mens rea of assaulting police officer was proven, namely that the accused knew that the officer in question was in fact a police officer.",The accused was charged with aggravated assault and breach of a peace officer's undertaking. The accused was at large on his undertaking and was bound to comply with a curfew. The complainant was on his back on the boulevard beside the vehicle and was being assaulted by the accused. The assault was described as an assault and the complainant was injured. HELD: The Court was left with the issue of whether the accused was properly identified and properly acting as a police officer in the line of duty and whether he had a lawful right to intervene to prevent the continuation of the breach of the peace he witnessed. The Court found that the accused had committed aggravated assault on the complainant and that he was entitled to be acquitted on that charge. The court also considered the totality of the evidence without any reasonable doubt as to the accused's guilt on count #1. The Crown had invited the accused to dismiss that charge and do so.
b_2011skqb219.txt,"The applicant is a residential unit owner in the condominium corporation. He sought a declaration pursuant to Queen's Bench Rule 664 interpreting the bylaws of the condominium corporation with respect to the voting rights of the commercial unit owners. The condominium has 32 units with the three largest units being commercial units. The remaining 29 units are residential. The parties agreed that the commercial owners were entitled to nominate and vote for three positions on the Board of Directors. A dispute arose as to whether the commercial owners were entitled to vote on the election of the positions on the Board designated for representatives of the residential unit holders. The Board of Directors passed a resolution interpreting the bylaw such that the commercial owners were entitled to nominate up to three people for election to the Board, all owners were entitled to vote on all nominees, all the owners agreed to cast their votes so as to elect the commercial owners nominees and where that does not happen the commercial owners are entitled to vote as a class to elect their nominees and there is no restriction in the bylaw limiting the right of the commercial owners to vote on positions to the Board. HELD The appropriate standard of review is that of reasonableness and deference must be given to the Board of Directors with regard to its interpretation of the bylaw. There is no specific provision in the bylaws that would restrict the voting rights of the commercial owners. Prohibiting any owner from voting altogether would be contrary to s. 41 of The Condominium Property Act because the Act provides that all owners are to vote on all questions proposed at any meeting. The proper interpretation of the bylaws has nothing to do with the principles of contract interpretation. The application was dismissed. The interpretation of the bylaw by the Board of Directors was reasonable and that Court was not prepared to interfere with it.","The applicant, a residential unit owner, brought an application against the Condominium Corporation, its board of directors and the owners of three commercial units seeking relief pursuant to Rule 664 of The Queen's Bench Rules. The applicant sought to have the bylaws interpreted so that the commercial owners would only be permitted to vote for their own nominees and would be barred from voting for anyone nominated by the residential owners. Preliminary objections were made pursuant to Queen’s Bench Rule 319 by the condominium corporation and the commercial owner. HELD: The application was granted. The preliminary decision clarifying what the Court would disregard was provided to the parties prior to the argument of the merits of the application. The Court was not prepared to do so. 1)The respondent directors were elected to the Board on the basis of the vote. The respondent directors had the right to vote on all questions proposed at a meeting of the owners. 2)There was no specific provision in the bylaw that would allow such an interpretation resulting in such a restriction on commercial owners’ voting rights. 3)The Court reviewed all of the relevant bylaws and regulations and concluded that the following was the proper interpretation of the bylaws: the by-laws were in place for good reason and should be enforced. The Board was supported by the Court. 4)The court found that principles of contract interpretation have no place within the scope of the within application, being the interpretation of condominium bylaws. This process is not analogous to that of contract."
b_2012nssc225.txt,",  motion denied. The court considered Rule 37.02(c) and distinguished between the terms 'same' and 'similar' with respect to claims involving the 'same transaction' and determined the use of the term 'same' indicated it must involve the same transaction and not merely similar transactions. The court stated that there should be more than a single common question of law or question of fact except in the simplest of cases to grant a motion for consolidation. The more issues and facts in common, the more supportive those factors will be toward consolidation. The court found there was insufficient evidence of commonality between the actions and dismissed the applicants' motion for consolidation on the basis that the actions were based on similar transactions but not the same transactions. The court did not consider the applicant's request to have the matters heard sequentially because it was raised only during their reply oral submissions to the court. The court suggested that Rule 37.04, which would have allowed for common issues to be tried or heard together, would have been most applicable but was not relied upon by the applicants. The court dismissed the motion.","The applicants sought to consolidate their claim against the defendants, with three other actions, all involving the same defendants and allegations regarding the improper negligent conduct of an investment advisor. HELD: The motion was dismissed. 1) The Court found that the matters in question were not ordered to be heard together, but rather in sequence. 2) There was no evidence before the Court to establish that the series of transactions were all part of the same transaction as contemplated by the Rule. 3) The court found that in order for consolidation to be possible, it must be done in a manner consistent with the Rule 37.02(g) of the Judicature Act. 4) It is not possible at this juncture to determine the degree of commonality, in what the pleadings disclose as being four relatively complex actions. However, it is not impossible at this stage to determine that degree, either in what they describe as a four-stage action. 5) The pleadings and submissions of the applicants all support the idea that consolidation is mandatory. 6) There is a common law authority which states that authorities made under the 1972 Rules have continuing applicability. The abstract professional standards, such as the jurisdiction of the IDA over the Respondents, are not controversial and will take minimal time to establish. The more contentious questions of law, namely what professional and legal standards applied in the context of given relationship with each party, will turn on the unique circumstances and preferences of each party. 7) There are common legal issues and facts which must be considered. The Court will be asked to consider the common issues, such that the standard of care of a reasonable investment advisor and supervisor will need to be determined. The standard of conduct of a financial institution will depend upon the culpability of each individual not on the group as a whole. The court will be required to assess whether individual culpability is that important or not. 8) The application of the Rule 39.02 (dismissal) does not appear to have an application in the present case. 9) The facts are not relevant to the pleading and submissions to the Court. There is no evidence to support the motion to consolidate the actions. 10) The evidence is not relevant at this point. The common law authorities are not required to participate in the proceedings. The application for consolidation is not mandatory in order to successfully argue for consolidation that 'a decision in one case would dispose of the essential cause of action in the other case.'"

The damage is alleged to have been caused when the defendant's truck left the ramp leading onto the bridge and fell into an excavation pit. The defendant argues that the City should be added as a third party because the City did not take proper steps to clear snow from the ramp, which provided a surface for his vehicle to launch off of. HELD: The application to add the City of Saskatoon as a third party was granted. The applicant has made out a prima facie case against the proposed third party. There is no prejudice to the plaintiff because he has settled with his insurer and is requesting settlement with the defendant's insurer. There is a causal connection between the cause of action plead in the statement of claim and the third party notice.

The consent judgment provided that the husband should make an equalization payment of $105,000 to be composed of cash and/or a rollover of retirement funds. The husband wants to satisfy the judgment by paying the sum of $5,000 in cash and rolling over $100,000 in RRSPs, unreduced for tax. Applying a 25% discount for tax, the proposal is equivalent to $80,000. The husband argued that the consent order was not dispositive and that if the tax implications were a controlling factor they should have been specifically addressed in the judgment.HELD: The Court held that it is common practice in family property distributions to discount RRSPs to their after-tax value. The fact that that principle was not stated explicitly in the judgment was not fatal to the application. The evidence introduced at the hearing of the wife's position in pre-trial calculations clearly indicated that she expected the discount for tax on RRSPs. Therefore, the Court ordered that the judgment be satisfied by way of rollover of RRSPs in the amount of $111,600.","FIAT The issue is the interpretation of the consent judgment based on a negotiated family property settlement. Present counsel for the husband is new to the file, and was not involved in the settlement.

The wife's position that the husband was only informed of her position when he attempted to tender a payment of $105,000 to the respondent. He denies that he ever offered to pay $65,000 in cash.

The Court believed the testimony of the complainant.,"The accused was charged with two counts of sexual assault contrary to s. 271(1) of the Criminal Code and for sexual purposes touching a person under the age of 16 directly with part of his body, to wit his penis. The complainant testified that she did not get along with the accused prior to the alleged assault and that she no longer felt the same way about him. HELD: The accused was found guilty of both counts. The Court found that the accused's evidence when he told the Court that he remained in the basement of the house for most of the night and that he did not go to K.S.'s bedroom or to her sister's house because she was concerned about getting sexually transmitted disease, the accused was acquitted. The court found that there was no evidence that the complainant or any of the other witnesses were involved in the sexual assault. The evidence of the complainant as to what transpired in the bedroom was not supported by the evidence of her sister and she was not convinced beyond a reasonable doubt by that evidence of guilt of the accused."
b_2014skca82.txt,"The Crown did not meet the onus under s. 676(1)(a) of the Criminal Code, and therefore the appeal was dismissed. The Appeal Court found that the Crown must satisfy the court of two things: 1) that an error of law was made on the standard of correctness; and 2) that the error had a material bearing on the acquittal. The Court of Appeal dealt with the Crown’s arguments as follows: 1) while it is an error to mistake the elements of an offence the Court found that the trial judge did not do so. The trial judge did, unfortunately, state that the speed needed to be proved beyond a reasonable doubt but the trial judge did not confuse the factual speed issue with either the mens rea or actus reus; 2) the trial judge thoroughly reviewed each of the witnesses’ testimony. The trial judge did not have to refer to every piece of evidence or explain exactly how each piece of evidence was weighed or considered in the reasons; and 3) the trial judge did err in applying the criminal standard of proof beyond a reasonable doubt to the different pieces of evidence going to the vehicle’s speed. The trial judge concluded that the minimum speed must be accepted because the higher speeds were not proven beyond a reasonable doubt. The Court of Appeal concluded that the verdict would not have necessarily been different but for the error in law; speed was the only driving factor suggested to be dangerous. The Crown also questioned the admissibility of the analyst’s opinion evidence on appeal, although they did not at trial. The Crown was not allowed to raise arguments on appeal that were not raised at trial. The analyst was originally a Crown witness at the preliminary inquiry and then he was a defence witness at trial. Further, the Appeal Court declined to give an opinion on the weight that should have been given to the analyst’s testimony because that was a question of fact for the trial judge.","The Crown appeals the acquittal of the respondent from a charge of dangerous driving causing bodily harm contrary to s. 249(3) of the Criminal Code. The Crown was tried on this charge before a judge alone and was acquitted on October 10, 2013. For the reasons that follow, the Crown argues that the trial judge erred in law by subjecting individual pieces of evidence to the standard of proof beyond reasonable doubt. HELD: The appeal is dismissed. 1) The Crown has failed to overcome the heavy onus required to overturn appeals from acquittals under s. 676(1)(a). 2) The trial judge did not confuse the factual issue of the appellant's speed with either the mens rea or the actus reus. 3) The evidence has not established beyond a reasonable doubt that the appellant’s speed was anything more than 93 to 99 kilometres per hour or that it was objectively dangerous in the circumstances. The trial trial judge went beyond merely considering whether the appellant was in a construction zone and accepted as fact that there were no construction workers or equipment in the area."
b_2017skqb81.txt,"HELD: The issues were determined as follows: 1) the applicant applied pursuant to The Seizure of Criminal Property Act, 2009, as that version of the Act was in place at the time of the seizure. The respondent argued that s. 35.1 did not apply at the time of seizure, because it was not in the Act at the time of seizure. The respondent argued that the two-year limitation period pursuant to The Limitations Act applied to the application with the date of seizure being the date of discoverability. The respondent also argued that the 2009 Act did not have retrospective application. The court found that the applicant applied pursuant to the 2009 Act and therefore the matter was assessed from that perspective. Section 35.1 of the 2009 Act required applications for forfeiture to be made within two years from the director becoming satisfied that the property sought to be forfeited was proceeds of unlawful activity or an instrument of unlawful activity. The court found that the words “Notwithstanding The Limitations Act” at the beginning of s. 35.1 served to provide an intention to prioritize the content of s. 35.1 over The Limitations Act. An affidavit filed by the applicant indicated that the director became satisfied that the property was an instrument of unlawful activity after August 2016. The director’s application was brought four months later, well within the two-year limitation period. The court then considered whether the 2009 Act had retrospective application and found that B. had the same legal position and faced the same jeopardy regardless of the version of the legislation, and therefore, there was no retrospective problem;  2) s. 7 outlined the test to apply. The court accepted the expert’s evidence with regards to the significance of the factors evidencing drug trafficking and how common they were to the drug trafficking trade. The applicant’s evidence also showed that the person alleging to purchase the truck from the respondent was not the purchaser and the purchase price was $8,000, not $16,000. The court found it more likely than not that the money was proceeds of unlawful activity; and 3) B. did not provide evidence or argument to support the exception that forfeiture would clearly not be in the interests of justice. The property was found to be proceeds of unlawful activity and the forfeiture order was granted.","The Director applied for an order directing the forfeiture of $10,475.00 to the Crown in Saskatchewan pursuant to Part II.1 of the 2009 Act. The property had been seized by the Regina Police Service from William Ross Butler in 2008. Since the plaintiff filed notice of dispute in response to those proceedings, the Director applied to this Court for forfeiture order pursuant to s.35.1. HELD: The application was brought four months later and fell comfortably within the two year limitation window prescribed by s. 35.1, which is a two-year limitation period. The Director's application is not statute barred and there is no limitations issue. The Court found no retroactivity. The facts and circumstances of the property and its contents were not relevant to the purpose of the forfeiture application."
c_1992canlii4474.txt,"This was an application for an order prohibiting the law firm that represented the respondent bank from acting as counsel for the trustee of the bankrupt company's estate. The applicant argued that there were significant areas where the interests of the bank conflicted with interests of the creditors. The trustee, who must act in the best interest of all creditors, should not be advised by the bank's counsel. Granting the order. The court, applying its supervisory powers, found the trustee should not be represented by the bank's counsel. On Appeal.","This was an application by NsC Corporation Limited (NsC Corp) for an order prohibiting the law firms of Boyne, Clarke and Blake, Cassels & Graydon from acting as counsel for the Trustee of the estate of the bankrupt. The Trustee had been appointed by the bankrupt as custodian of its property. The bankrupt had relied on legal advice from counsel for its creditors but had obtained other counsel by the time the application proceeded. This conflict of interest was so blatant that it demanded the removal of present counsel. HELD: 1)The Trustee was not in a position where it could be influenced by the Bank in making that decision. 2)The Court was mindful of the fact that it assumed supervisory jurisdiction over the winding up process as well as over the estate solicitors. 3)It was important to note that the conflict between counsel for a bankrupt estate and the trustee is so blatant it demands removal of counsel for that estate."

c_1994canlii4958.txt,"The Plaintiff rented a paint sprayer from the Defendant. He accidentally injected one of his fingers with paint. The finger had to be amputated. He commenced these proceedings against the Defendant seeking damages for a failure to warn him of the danger associated with the use of the paint sprayer. HELD: Judgment for the Plaintiff.  1)The paint sprayer was of the 'airless' type. It operated at 2,500 lbs. pressure. This would not have been appreciated by the ordinarily prudent user. The Defendant therefore had a duty to warn. 2)The Defendant could not escape liability because the sprayer had been rented from a location owned and operated by an independent contractor. Where an enterprise or activity is inherently dangerous, the duty to warn can not be delegated. In such a situation the party who retains the independent contractor remains vicariously liable. 3)The waiver in the rental contract was ineffective. It was a standard form agreement signed on its face with the terms of the contract on the reverse. 4)The Plaintiff was awarded general damages of $10,000.00, $5,000.00 for loss of earning capacity and recovered $3,789.50 for SHSP. 5)The usual increase in general damages for inflation and pre-judgment interest were both reduced because the Plaintiff had not presecuted his action expeditiously.","HELD: The plaintiff's finger was amputated after he injected it with paint from sprayer rented from the defendant. The defendant's potential liability for failure to warn the plaintiff of the danger in using an airless paint sprayer was $10,000. The plaintiff was self-employed during 1988-89 but he was salaried worker before and after that. He operated a rental store out of his shop. He suffered a small injury to his finger which required surgery. He was unable to function for about 3 months after the amputation. He needed an extra man. The plaintiffs claim loss of income, past and future. HELD: 1)The defendant's waiver was ineffective. 2)The plaintiff was not entitled to the benefit of inflation for all the years 1989 to 1994 because there was noexcuse for dragging on this minimal damage action for six years. Had the claim been adjudicated in timely fashion, only a few years of inflation would have intervened. 3)Costs and pre-judgment interest were awarded."

c_1996canlii6728.txt,"Issues included the division of a pension, child and spousal support and whether to transfer or have sold the matrimonial home which had a small equity. The petitioner was an undischarged bankrupt and any funds in his possession belonged to the trustee. The only marital asset of any value was the petitioner's pension but lump sum payment was not available for five years as there was a liquidity problem. The parties had been 'spenders' not 'savers'. HELD: 1)The respondent was to pay child support for one child. 2)Spousal support was denied. 3)The matrimonial home was to be sold and proceeds were to be divided equally.  4)Three values were suggested for valuation and distribution of the pension plan. The retirement method of calculating the value of the pension yields the fairest value as opposed to the termination method. The practice by the plan administrator on marriage breakdown was to divide the pension on the basis of the commuted value only and excess contributions were not considered for the purpose of the lump sum transfer to a locked in spousal RRSP. The options were to leave the funds in the plan and defer payment until age 65 or have the commuted value transferred to a locked-in RRSP. The respondent was to make the choice between the only two options. If she wished to have the funds in her name immediately, she was to provide written notification otherwise there would be an order that the respondent is to receive a portion when the monthly pension benefit commences.","The parties were married for 24 years and had two children. The husband was employed throughout the marriage and continued to be so employed. The parties were'spenders' not'savers'. The wife had a car available to her and the children were primarily residing with the husband. The wife worked part-time at three separate institutions and then for several years until she retired in 1994. She earned $55,000 per year and had three children, Chad and Ryan, who were born in 1994 and 1995. She relied on her employment and earned a modest income. She was unable to work outside the home for a number of years due to a cerebral hemorrhage. She suffered memory loss and suffered from aphasia, dyslexia and seizures as a result of the marriage. She now sought spousal support from the Saskatchewan Police Pension Benefits Act. HELD: The husband's application for divorce was dismissed. The court ordered that the matrimonial home be sold and the proceeds divided equally between the parties. 1)The husband's pension from employment was in the form of an RRSP and was worth $71,000. He was ordered to pay child support of $260 per month for the 21 years of marriage and $331,000 for the wife's child support. 2)The wife was to have the commuted value of the pension transferred to a locked-in RRSP in her name or an 'if and when' order. 3)The court ordered the husband to pay $350 per month as child support for Chad and $260 for the 1st day of each month thereafter for so long as the child is a child within the meaning of the Act."

The respondent had served notice to lapse all of the caveats which were based on an agreement taken by Freeholders Oil from the registered owner of the minerals. The respondent sought an order directing the caveats be continued on the condition Home Oil commence an action within a reasonable time to determine their validity. At issue was whether the caveator or the challenger should be required to initiate an action. HELD: The caveats were to be continued until a further court order was filed in the Land Titles Office or until they were withdrawn. 1) Each of the agreements was prima facie still in existence as there had been no cancellation or rescission of the agreements and Home Oil was the valid successor of the interest of Freeholders. 2) Further documentation would be required by a trial judge to determine the issue of the validity of Home Oil's interest in the leases including whether Home Oil's lease violated the rule against perpetuities.  3) Home Oil was given its costs of the application.,"FIAT.

At issue was whether s5.3 of the Trade Union Act authorized the Board to make such an order. HELD: The appeal was dismissed with costs.  1)The Board recognized the question to be a jurisdictional question. The standard of review is whether the decision was correct rather than patently unreasonable. 2)The chambers judge arrived at the correct conclusion whether from the point of view of the plain meaning of the words of s5.3 or the context of the entire statute or a purposive approach.  3)S5.3 refers to the 'board' which is defined by s2(c) to be the LRB and accordingly referred to applications and orders of the LRB. The interim power is not only based on the final power but is also part of the final power and both are part of the same process. 4)S25(1), when read with ss(1.1) and (1.2) indicates an intention on the part of the legislators to grant exclusive jurisdiction to arbitration boards to deal with disputes arising out of the interpretation of collective agreements. 5)Whatever the scope of s42, it cannot be used to release the restrictions of a statutory provision the very purpose of which is to define the jurisdiction of the LRB to act in respect of such matters.","This appeal is from an order which quashed an interim order of the Labour Relations Board pending the determination of a grievance by an arbitration board, even though it had no power to make any final order respecting the proceedings before the arbitration board. HELD: The appeal is dismissed with costs in the usual way. Whether one approaches the question from the plain meaning of the words of s. 5.3, or from the context of the entire statute or from a purposive approach, the result is the same. The chambers judge arrived at a correct conclusion. The ordinary meaning of s5.3 require two conditions for the exercise of the power to be made interim orders: the existence of an application or complaint before the labour Relations Board, and the presence of power in the labour relations board to make final order in respect of the application. The section contains no words directly limiting the terms 'application or complaint' and 'final order or decision' and so treated it. Accordingly, the standard of review is whether the decision was correct, rather than whether it was patently unreasonable."

The notice arrived at the post office on a Friday, the day after the period expired and was picked up by the administrator the following Monday. The Appeals Committee refused to direct the board of revision to hear the appeal on the basis the company failed to give notice within the period prescribed by s303(1) and concluded that the board did not have the power to extend the time.

The board of revision was directed to hear and determine the assessment appeal. 1)The Committee did not err in deciding the prescribed time period for an appeal could not be extended.  2)The less formal expression 'to give notice to' as used in the Act is a less exacting term than 'to serve notice upon'.

c_1998canlii13533.txt,"FIAT. An application to vary maintenance for two children under the Federal Child Supprt Guidelines. At issue were the determination of the father's income and whether the expenses of the eldest child attending Grade 12 in Manitoba constituted extaordinary expenses for secondary school education pursuant to s7(1)(d). The father's reduced farm income was explained as due to poor crop yields. He anticipated being laid off from his work at the mine in October. He claimed significant vehicle expenses for his travel to work. The mother contested many of his expenses as being overstated. HELD: The respondent's child support obligation was $347 per month. 1)It was fair and reasonable to take an average of the 1997 and projected 1998 income. The preceeding years were not significant because the father's current income at the mine commenced in May 1997. Travelling expenses would not be considered in the absence of the accounting advice to explain the basis for the deduction and to establish the actual amount and where no deduction has been made in the past. No explanation was offered for why the claims for gas and repairs were significantly higher than in previous years. The capital payments for land and machinery and the costs of the stepchild's horse were excluded. In the circumstances the acquisition of equipment and capital cost allowance, in lieu of renting, was not patently unreasonable. The farm income was adjusted in 1997 and 1998 by adding back 25 percent of the capital cost allowance for the new truck. The acquisition of a $43,000 vehicle was an extravagance given his income bracket and his obligation to support his children. His allocation of one-half its cost to farming was questionable given the distances tavelled during his employment at the mine. 2)There was no evidence why the child attended high school in Manitoba, why the expense was necessary in relation to the child's best interest and whether the child had any means to contribute. Leave was given to return the matter to the Court with the appropriate supporting materials.  3)No order as to costs.","FIAT.

The defendants abandoned their alternate claim to be granted leave to file a statement of defence. The defendants, carrying on business as a hauling sub-contractor to Tri-Link, reported a cheque drawn on the plaintiff bank as lost. Tri-Link issued a replacement cheque. The first cheque was certified at a bank branch of the plaintiff in Alberta and deposited to the defendants' credit union account. Default judgments were obtained in January/March 1997 against the defendants who now sought to have them set aside pursuant to Queen's Bench Rules 346 and 173(a). The defendants claimed the statement of claim disclosed no cause of action as a certified cheque is irrevocable and as such any default judgment may be set aside ex debito justitiae, in which case delay in bringing the application is not factor. The plaintiff claims it has a cause of action in either conversion or mistake of fact/unjust enrichment. HELD: The defendants' motion was dismissed as the plaintiff's statement of claim adequately disclosed a cause of action in mistake of fact/unjust enrichment.  1)There are exceptions to the irrevocable nature of a certified cheque. The present case is one of those circumstances where the bank has an action in restitution against the holder of a certified cheque as payment did not satisfy a just debt. The defendants in this instance had already deposited the replacement cheque when the original cheque was presented for certification and subsequently deposited by the defendants. The cerified cheque did not satisfy a just debt. The defendants had already received payment for their services.  2)In recognizing exceptions to the irrevocable nature of certification the commercial utility of certification at the request of the payee is maintained while providing recourse to a bank where a payee seeks to unjustly enrich itself and then purport to seek refuge behind the 'irrevocable nature' of a certified cheque.","The defendants sought to set aside a default judgment entered by the plaintiff against them and have the plaintiff's claim struck out.

The certificate of incompetence issued in December 1998 was revoked (QBG No. 690/1999) on the basis the competency examination was obtained by subterfuge (other parties had asked the plaintiff to attend a physical examination for a fictitious purpose but conducted a competency examination); there was no record of the review panel hearing; no reasons were given for the decision to uphold the certificate. The plaintiff alleged the issuance of the certificate caused mental anguish, emotional suffering, and loss of liberty and alleged conspiracy, abuse of process, breach of fiduciary duty and negligence. HELD: The application was dismissed.  1)Our civil procedure does not contemplate the trial of an issue on a person's competence to bring a lawsuit. A certificate of incompetence issued pursuant to the Act had the same effect as a finding that the person is incapable of instructing counsel or understanding legal proceedings and would result in the appointment of a litigation guardian. This step was not deemed necessary based on the evidence presented. A stay was refused.  2)Costs incurred in defending a civil action against a person who is subsequently found to be incapable of managing his or her estate are recoverable from the estate. 3)Queen's Bench Act s.50 did not apply.  4)The plaintiff was entitled to his costs in any event of the cause.","FIAT. The applicant sought an order requiring the plaintiff to be examined by a qualified psychiatrist within 30 days and requiring a report from the said psychiatrist as to whether the plaintiff is mentally competent to instruct his solicitor. The court granted the application on the basis the competency examination had been obtained by the subterfuge of asking the applicant to attend medical examination in connection with a pension application he had made some time earlier and then administering to him mental competency exam. He took the position there was no record of the review panel hearing and no reasons given for its decision to uphold the certificate. HELD: The application was dismissed. 1)There is no need for the court to invoke its inherent jurisdiction if the remedy sought is readily available to the applicant by some other lawful means. The risk of bypassing or duplicating existing legal procedures or the rules is avoided. This is not a case where the Court feels obliged to take this step based on the evidence presented. 2)Costs should not be used to determine the plaintiff's mental competence. The Court should exercise its discretion to do so cautiously, only in clear cases, and only when the relief sought cannot reasonably and realistically be obtained. 3)The Court should not have to resort to a certificate of incompetence issued pursuant to s.38.3 of the Act. The Act has the same effect as a finding that the person is incapable of instructing or understanding the proceedings of trial for the simple reason that the issuance of a certificate would result in a litigation guardian being appointed."
c_2000canlii19597.txt,"The accused was charged with uttering threats to his 77 year old mother to cause death to her and his brothers contrary to s.264.1 of the Criminal Code. HELD: The accused was found guilty. 1)The words spoken by the accused were clearly meant to be taken seriously and implied menace to the listeners. The accused's evidence was disbelieved. His constructed story did not 'hang together'.  2) In a non-jury trial there is ordinarily no need for defence to formally make a Corbett application, requesting an order excluding evidence of convictions whose prejudicial effect outweighs their probative value. The judge must not infer from the record that the accused has a propensity to commit criminal offences. Given the age of the record and other factors considered including his present work and family life, it was concluded that all of the prior convictions should be disregarded as they relate to the accused's credibility. The only conclusion drawn was that the accused had been familiar with the workings of the criminal justice system which was not a negative inference.",The accused was charged with uttering a threat to cause death to three of his children contrary to s. 264.1 of the Criminal Code.

The mother of the accused had recently passed away and the family fight had developed over dealings with and entitlement to his rather substantial estate. The Accused had lived there for 64 years and the accused and his sister had lived with him for some of that time.

c_2002skqb47.txt,"FIAT. The defendant sought to have costs reduced because the plaintiff was unsuccessful in part of her claim for damages for the injury to her ankle and resulting pain disorder when she fell after stepping on a metal plate bolted to the floor at the mall entrance of the defendant's store. The plaintiff was awarded $77,406.15 plus special damages and pre-judgment interest for a total of $120,540.43. The offer to settle for $75,000 plus taxable costs had been refused. The defendant argued the plaintiff's bill of costs should be taxed at 50% as she only received about 13 and 1/3% of the amount claimed; the costs were disproportionate to the judgment and the offer to settle, made in good faith, was never formally responded to. The plaintiff argued extensive witness costs were incurred because the defendant declined to agree to the filing of medical reports. At issue was whether the success of each affects the amount of costs to be awarded to either; the amount to be awarded for expert witnesses; and level at which a second counsel fee should be taxed or allowed. HELD: 1)Taxable costs should not be based on either hardship or the degree of success. Solely because recovery falls short of the amount claimed is not a reason to deprive a successful party of costs. Although costs are in the discretion of the Court, they usually go to the successful party. 2)It was appropriate in this case to reduce by 50% the plaintiff's costs taxable under column 4 since over half of the plaintiff's witnesses who were called to testify and most of the trial time was dedicated to the pain disorder claim, which proved only minor non-pecuniary damages. 3)A great deal of the plaintiff's expert medical evidence was of marginal value. Great care must be taken by a party who obtains leave to call more than five expert witnesses to ensure their testimony will assist the case. Expenses of each was examined separately. In some cases, medical report charges or consultation and preparation time were not recoverable from the defendant as not being of value or too exorbitant. 4)A second counsel fee was allowed at 50% of first counsel fee. A second counsel fee is in the discretion of the Court and is limited to two-thirds of the fee paid for first counsel. The amount at risk and complexity of the pain disorder claim justified second counsel in this case. Although one lawyer could have handled the trial without difficulty as there was considerable down time, that could not be known in advance. 5)Costs of the four pre-trial conferences, unspecified number of management pre-trial conferences, pre-trial brief, medical reports for doctors who were not called as witnesses are matters for consideration by the taxing officer rather than the Court. It was recommended that no fee should be considered when there is simply an adjournment because the pre-trial conference is premature; there is no tariff item for a pre-trial brief and in most cases is included in the attendance charge; a charge of $50 for each management pre-trial conference be allowed to a total limit of $500; costs of transcripts be recovered from the defendant.

HELD: 1)Whether the success of each party affects the amount of costs to be awarded to either party; 2)The level at which a second counsel fee should be taxed or allowed. The amount expended by party for investigating or in gathering evidence to either advance a claim or defend it may actually exceed the value of the claim. Solely because recovery falls short of the amount claimed is not a reason to deprive a successful party of costs.  3)The plaintiff was entitled to recover $1,000.00 of the fees paid to the defendant for testimony and consultations, but no part of the payment for the locum tenens or his medical report."
c_2007skpc41.txt,"The accused was charged that he did drive while disqualified, contrary to s. 89(1) of The Highway Traffic Act, as it was then. The issues were as follows: 1) should the offence of driving while disqualified contrary to the provincial statute be regarded as a full mens rea offence? 2) is the evidence sufficiently credible for the court to conclude that the accused had knowingly operated a motor vehicle while subject to a driving disqualification? HELD: The accused is not guilty. 1) Driving while disqualified should be regarded as a full mens rea offence, rather than one of strict liability requiring the accused to establish due diligence on a balance of probabilities, given that the accused's liberty is jeopardized with the potential of incarceration. Likewise the automatic disqualification and surrender of a driver's license are serious sanctions. 2) The accused was adamant in asserting that he had no knowledge of his license suspension at the material time. Although he was not able to offer a compelling explanation for ignoring the admonition to him in a letter from Saskatchewan Government Insurance (S.G.I.) of July 11, 2005 that if he consumed any alcohol, an original driving suspension would be reinstated, the accused believed it was appropriate to rely instead on the advice of the peace officer on December 18, 2005 that it was only a 24 hour suspension, unless he heard further from S.G.I. Likewise, it did not appear that the accused had any further communication from S.G.I. subsequent to December 18, 2005, until shortly after the motor vehicle accident, roughly 2 months later. At that time, it was confirmed that the suspension had been extended to October 16, 2006, contrary to his earlier belief. Apparently it is an important part of the S.G.I. administration of driver's license suspensions that there be communication by letter, as has occurred here twice, with the purpose of attempting to ensure accused persons are advised in writing of changes in the legal status of their driving suspensions, with clarity and precision. As such, this accused should be able to rely on that procedure, even when that communication was not as timely as one would hope. Not having heard from S.G.I. in the interim, after December 18, 2005, it was reasonable for him to rely on the advice received from the peace officer. As such, the evidence is not sufficient to prove that the accused had knowingly operated a motor vehicle while disqualified as alleged, and he is not guilty.","The accused was charged with driving while disqualified contrary to s.89(1) of The Highway Traffic Act. HELD: The accused was found not guilty. 1) The evidence was not sufficient to prove that the accused had knowingly operated a motor vehicle while subject to a driving disqualification. The accused's liberty was jeopardized with the potential of incarceration. 2) The accused had not received any notice of suspension from S.G.I. between December 2005 and the date of the motor vehicle accident. He had participated in the Driving Without Impairment program and had previously participated in an addictions screening and an addiction screening program. He was acquitted. 3) The Court was guided by the principles of McKenzie and held that there is a presumption against strict liability offences, and in favour of some element of mens rea or criminal intent that must be established by the Crown."
c_2007skqb224.txt,"FIAT: The accused applicant brings an application for a change in venue in this matter pursuant to s. 599(1) of the Criminal Code. HELD: 1). The application for a change of venue is denied. 2) There is no evidence of a general prejudicial attitude in Saskatoon as a whole that would justify a change in venue. There has been significant pre-trial publicity in this case from media reports of the case and other similar cases involving knives, as well as ongoing memorial reports. However, the accused has not met the onus necessary to succeed on its application. In other cases the existence of some memorial fundraising and memorials in the victim's names led the courts in those instances to grant a change in venue. However, in allowing the application, the courts in those cases both referenced the relatively small size of the judicial centers in which the trials were to be held, thereby making it more than likely an impartial jury pool could not be found. Saskatoon is not a small judicial centre. It is more populated than the Prince Albert judicial district to where the accused requests the case be transferred and is much larger than the judicial district of Humboldt, which might also be considered.","FIAT: The applicant brought an application for a change of venue in this matter pursuant to s.599(1) of the Criminal Code of Canada. He also sought an order pursuant to ss. 119(1)(q) and the Youth Criminal Justice Act directing the Crown to disclose the names of any witnesses with criminal convictions registered under provisions of the Act, and particulars of the convictions. HELD: The application was denied. 1)The applicant had not met the onus of proof necessary to succeed on this application. 2)A properly instructed jury will be able to deal with the issues in the trial impartially and in accordance with the evidence presented, such that the accused will receive a fair trial. 3)The evidence from the victim's family and friends who had contributed to the fund confirmed that there was no general prejudicial attitude in Saskatoon as a whole that would justify a change in venue."
c_2007skqb269.txt,"FIAT: The applicants are residents of Wilcox and have children attending the Wilcox school. They seek an interlocutory mandatory injunction preventing the respondent Board of Education from acting upon a resolution that the Wilcox school be closed. HELD: Both with respect to the statutory breach of the 28-day notice period for the meeting to elect school community council members, and the ground of lack of procedural fairness, the Court concluded the applicants failed to meet the standard of a strong prima facie case. 1) A review of the facts and the law suggest that the applicant's submission on the fact that the notice for election of the school community council was 2 days short of the 28 days required by The Education Act does not meet the test of a strong prima facie case. The Act does not state that non-compliance with formalities will result in a nullity. There was no prejudice caused by the non-compliance with the 28-day notice period before the election of members to the school community council. There is no evidence or suggestion that a different school council would have been elected if the extra 2 days notice had been provided. No one complained at the time and the fact the matter is raised now amounts to a collateral attack on that election. The potential consequences of a Court finding of a nullity militate against such a finding. The relevance of the school community council in the closure of a school arises after the decision to close the school has been made. To nullify all of the process and consultation that went into the school closure on this collateral ground would have serious consequences of causing at least one year delay in the efficiencies or improvements in student education which motivated the decision, and result in a loss of time, energy and money expended in the process. 2) Taking into account the mandate of the Board under the Act with respect to school closures, the consultation process adopted by the Board, and the manner in which it conducted the consultation meetings does not lead to the conclusion the procedure was unfair. A review of the five factors identified by the Supreme Court in Baker v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) does not favour an overly stringent application of the procedural fairness rules in this matter.",FIAT: The applicants seek an interlocutory injunction preventing and restraining the respondent Board of Education from acting upon a resolution passed by the Wilcox school community council. HELD: A preliminary review of the facts and law do not suggest a strong prima facie case. The respondent Board failed to comply with the requirements of procedural fairness in passing its resolution for school closure. The court found that the respondent board provided inadequate notice of an election for the Wilco school community Council and it is alleged the election is nullity. The Court found that there was no evidence or suggestion a different school council would have been elected if the extra two days notice had been provided. The preliminary review did not suggest that a strong case was made. The applicant's position that the election took place two days short of the deadline was not supported by the facts. The fact that the notice for election was two days late was not a strong indicator of a serious question to be tried.

HELD: 1) A party to litigation cannot decline to answer questions on an examination for discovery that are intended to elicit the facts on which that party has based its pleading. A party is required to divulge the facts that it has now or admit that it has none if such is the case. The defendant is obligated to provide its responses to the undertakings before the examination for discovery of its proper officer is concluded so that he can be further examined on the responses. If the position of the defendant as set forth in those responses changes as a result of after acquired information, the defendant shall so inform the plaintiff by way of supplemental responses within 90 days following the completion of the defendant's examinations for discovery of the third parties. If it is necessary for the plaintiff to further examine for discovery on the defendant's responses or supplemental responses, the defendant's proper officer shall attend such examination for discovery. 2) The material filed satisfies the Court that PSAC documents relating to the PST issue are at least broadly relevant to the issues and that BJ Services likely has the power to obtain and produce them. The fact that BJ Services may intend to claim a litigation privilege over the documents, or that PSAC may not produce them, does not relieve BJ Services of the obligation to disclose their existence. BJ Services shall provide further and better disclosure of documents by providing a detailed list of documents referred to in the second part of the second schedule of its statement as to documents. If a claim for privilege is asserted over such documents, BJ Services shall identify the basis of such claim, the date of the documents, the name of the sender and the names of the recipients.","FIAT: The plaintiff applies for orders requiring the defendant and third parties to answer questions and respond to undertakings arising from the examinations for discovery in this action. The plaintiff engages in the business of oil and gas exploration and development in Saskatchewan and elsewhere in Canada. In the course of its business, the plaintiff engages contractors to drill oil and natural gas wells. The plaintiffs engage in the exploration business and engage in cementing services contractors, including the third party contractors, to cement casing in the well bores. During the examinations, the defendants gave undertakings to respond to certain questions, including those concerning the intention of the parties in entering into the contracts. The defendant denies all allegations made by the plaintiff and the defendant as a third party claimant and specifically denies that the plaintiff is entitled to judgment in any amount against the defendant. HELD: The defendant is obligated to provide its responses to the undertakings before the examination for discovery of its proper officer is concluded so that, if necessary, he can be further examined on the responses. If the defendant revises its position set forth in its initial response based on after acquired information, it may supplement its response. The court will decide the validity of any objections. 1)The scope of discovery is wide. Wide latitude is permitted. The examination may be searching and exploratory. Questions on discovery are relevant so long as they touch 'the matters in question' and fall within bounds that are reasonable. 2)If the position of the defendant is set forth, it must provide a description of those documents sufficient to enable the party receiving the statement to assess and challenge the claim of privilege. 3)The court will support any legislative framework which clarifies these relationships for Saskatchewan PST in a manner consistent with the findings of the above-mentioned court cases."
c_2009nssc180.txt,"At issue was retroactive maintenance for the now 16-year-old for a period of time pre-dating the mother's application (in 2007). Although the parties separated in 2001, there was no written agreement/order in place until 2009. The father paid support voluntarily, at an amount that was increased over the years. The mother said the father controlled the amount and knew it was below his table obligation under the Guidelines. She claimed she did not know his true income, and that every time she asked for additional assistance (such as a contribution to extraordinary expenses) he told her he could not afford it. The father said he was unaware of the correct table amount, and that he paid according to the mother's demands. Retroactive support awarded according to the table amount from 2005 onward. The father's hardship arguments rejected. He was aware from the outset that his child support obligation was related to his income. The dramatic increase to his income, and his failure to disclose it to the mother in 2005 constituted sufficient/effective notice that his payments were now deficient. Claim for retroactive s. 7 (extraordinary or special) expenses for the same time-period denied. The father did, on occasion voluntarily contribute to these expenses. During the relevant period of time, the parents spent some time trying to reconcile and acting as a family.","The only remaining issue was the retroactivity of child maintenance for the period from August 2001 to December 2007. Prior to the Consent Order, there was no written agreement or court order dealing with child maintenance since the couple separated in August 2001.

HELD: The respondent had 'effective notice' that his current payment was deficient. 1)The respondent's request for a retroactive award was denied. 2)The court found that the respondent's extraordinary increase in pay was in sufficient notice his child support obligation had been increased. 3)The Court found that Mr. Jeffrey's dramatic increases in salary were sufficient notice for the respondent to increase his monthly child maintenance.

c_2013skca113.txt,"HELD: The applicant’s first two grounds of appeal related to the evidence of the respondents’ and police. The Court of Appeal was not persuaded that questions of evidence were of sufficient importance to grant leave. The applicant’s third ground was that the Chambers judge failed to take into account the interests of the public, particularly, the need to deter the public and the need to remove profit from crime to compensate victims. The Court of Appeal did not grant leave on the third ground. The Chambers judge reviewed the relevant case law and did not fail to take those items into account. The last ground of appeal was the fact that the vehicle had already been held for 90 days. The Court of Appeal said that this ground did raise some interest but they were not convinced that this was the case to grant the leave to appeal.","The Director of the Seizure of Criminal Property Act sought leave to appeal a Queen's Bench Chambers decision which denied his application for the forfeiture of a vehicle registered to the respondent. The Director argued that the Chambers judge overlooked the interests of the public or failed to consider the need to deter crime, remove the profit from crime and so forth. HELD: The application was dismissed. The Chambers judge did not err in considering certain information about the respondent and her alleged involvement in the incidents. He also did not neglect the public's interest or fail to take into account the fact that the vehicle had been held by the Director for 90 days. He conducted a relatively thorough review of the case law in the course of establishing the framework governing his decision-making."
c_2013skpc94.txt,"A Child and Family Services agency applied for an order: 1) declaring that the foster parents of three children have sufficient interest pursuant to s. 23 of The Child and Family Services Act; and 2) granting the foster parents custody pursuant to s. 37(1)(b). The children's mother was deceased and their father indicated that he was unable to meet his children's needs. The foster parents intended to continue to allow the father parenting time with the children. They also indicated that they would care for the children until each is 18 or until the order was terminated. The father consented to a draft order agreeing the children should be in the custody of the Minister and that he have reasonable access. The agency amended their application for the custody order to be made in favour of the foster parents rather than the Minister. HELD: The children were in need of protection pursuant to s. 11(b). The Court found that the agency's amended application was appropriate and preferred to a temporary order in favour of the Minister. Also, the Court noted that s. 39 allows for amendments of orders if circumstances change. The Court, therefore, ordered that the foster parents have custody even though the father only indicated his consent to the order in favour of the Minister. The agency was required to ensure that a copy of the written decision was personally served on the father.","The agency applied for a long term order under s.37(3) of the Child and Family Services Act but had amended its application to now apply for an order that the current foster parents be declared persons having a sufficient interest in all three children under s23 of the Act, and an order for an extension of the order granted to the Minister. The Agency requested the additional information. HELD: The agency applied and was granted the additional Information. The agency requested the information. The children were identified by initials for the purposes of protecting their identity. The information provided by the foster parents indicated that the father was unable to care for the children. The father had consented to a long-term order and had agreed that he would have reasonable access on reasonable notice to each child within 15 days of receipt of it. The amended application was granted. The court found that each child was in need of protection pursuant to s.11(b). The Minister was to make the orders requested.

c_2013skqb180.txt,"The parties had a shared parenting arrangement since separation where each party parented their four-year-old child for equal times in a two-week cycle, the petitioner parenting in her home in Moose Jaw and the respondent parenting in his parent's home in Regina. The issue before the Court was to determine where the child should primarily reside and attend school. Each party saw the other as a competent and loving parent. The petitioner had another child, a half-brother to the parties' child, who was an infant at the time of the application. The petitioner was a stay-at-home mom on social assistance and the respondent was a student who worked part-time and lived with his parents. The respondent's parents were willing to assist the respondent financially and in the care of the child. The Court ordered custody/access report concluded that the child should primarily reside with the respondent, though the author noted that the decision was almost too close to make. HELD: The Court held that the best interests of the child would be best served by her primarily residing with the respondent and the parties having joint custody of the child. The Court first considered the quality of the child's relationship with each party and their families and concluded there was little difference between the parties but the child had a closer relationship with the respondent's extended family because she resided with them when she was with the respondent. The Court also determined that the child's economic needs could best be met residing with the respondent and his parents. The home environment of the respondent was found to outweigh that of the petitioner's. Further, the Court held that the child would have greater stability and continuity with the respondent, who has a concrete future plan. The petitioner's future plans were wavering and uncertain. The respondent was ordered to bear the responsibility for transporting the child to and from Moose Jaw and Regina. The respondent was also required to accommodate the petitioner and child by supporting Internet communications between them during the week, especially at bedtime. The petitioner was granted parenting time three consecutive weekends and the respondent on the fourth weekend. The second of the petitioner's weekends was extended to include another day as were any weekends with school or statutory holidays. The decision requires the child to miss one day of school every four weeks and the Court therefore left it to the parties to determine whether this can continue once the child begins grade two. The parties were ordered to each parent the child for half of Easter and Christmas breaks and they were to accommodate each other for Mother's and Father's Day each year. Further, the Court ordered that the child spend half of each summer holiday with each parent, suggesting that alternating weeks may be the best for the child, unless otherwise agreed to by the parties. Lastly, if the child has a school break longer than three clear days, the petitioner is to parent at least one-half of those days. The Court also urged the parties to collaborate and discuss the extra-curricular activities best suited for the child taking into account their affordability and disruption to the parenting arrangement.",HELD: The Court held that the Court could not proceed with a custody order as it was not in the best interests of the petitioner. The Court found that the petitioner had not demonstrated that she was capable of parenting and that there was no prospect of reconciling with her estranged parents. The court ordered that the child be placed in the primary care of her mother and that the primary residence of the respondent be in Moose Jaw. The petitioner was to have access to the child during the daytime and during school holidays. The child was to be at home with the mother and would not be exposed to more change and instability in adult relationships while in the mother's care. The respondent was to obtain a condominium. The mother was to provide the child with a stable home and the child would be at the primary school for the duration of the child's life. The father was to pay child support and the court ordered the child to have regular access with the child.
c_2014skqb31.txt,"Civil Procedure – Affidavits – Admissibility HELD: The Court could not locate any cases that suggested there was a duty to act fairly and in good faith by an insurance company because of an insurance policy where no claim was made against it. The Court found that it would be impossible for SMI to act fairly and in good faith to the plaintiffs and to concurrently act fairly and in good faith to the first defendants. SMI only had a duty to defend the first defendants pursuant to their policy of insurance. The Court noted the following in making its conclusion: 1) if SMI also had a duty to the plaintiffs, they could not use tactical or substantive errors of the plaintiffs to minimize their payment obligation. The insurer would not be able to vigorously defend the claim; and 2) the first defendant may be required to pay more if there was a duty by SMI to the plaintiffs. Many insurance policies have co-insurance provisions or require deductibles be paid by the insured. The Court held that the claim against SMI, and its employees and agents, had no reasonable chance of success. The Court also awarded costs against the plaintiffs for filing improper affidavit material. The improper material included information on settlement discussions.",FIAT MILLS: The plaintiffs brought an application pursuant to Queen's Bench Rule 173(a) of the former Queen’s Bench Rules to have the claim against SMI struck in its entirety. HELD: The application was granted. 1)The claim was struck because it was found to be in breach of a contract of insurance between SMI and the plaintiffs. 2)SMI was obliged to defend the interests of the first defendants under the policy of insurance. 3)It was also found to have a duty of good faith to the plaintiff in prosecution of the claim. 4)The court found that the claim was not in a conflict of interest because SMI was the insurer for the defendants and was involved in this claim by virtue of a policy of the defendants. 5)The Court found that SMI is obliged to act fairly and in good faith in the defence of its claim. 6)The application was dismissed.

It ordered the respondent to immediately proceed to complete an application to split the applicant’s CPP credits.,"FIAT The applicant/petitioner applied for variation of a consent Interim Order issued in August 2007. The provisions of the order addressed the applicant's child and spousal support obligations. It was based upon the petitioner's then income of $48,196 and the respondent's income $0. The respondent agreed to inextricably intertwine the payor's spousals and child support obligations to the total amount of child support. The applicant was a member of the Canadian Armed Forces. She had no income and suffered from at least two of the now longer list of medically disabling conditions set out in her affidavit. She continued to assert she was disabled and unable to engage in employment. HELD: The applicant's variation application was dismissed. 1)It may well be the case that from and after the date of his mandatory retirement, which is scarcely two years away, his circumstances including the substantial decrease in his income from the current level of approximately $67,000, may well constitute a material change in circumstance prompting yet another variation application. 2)The applicant was prepared to either apply for or agree to split his CPP credits or support her application to do so. She will reapply. 3)The respondent was not prepared to take reasonable steps and to diligently pursue a new CPP disability application which was denied because she did not have sufficient CPP credit. 4)The parties agreed to combine the respondent’s and the applicant’ s.5 and s.6 CPP Credits. The parties agreed that the respondent would pay child support of $150 per month for child support and $1,250 per month. 5)The petitioner was prepared and to pursue new applications. The appellant was prepared, in addition to the respondent, to pursue a different CPP application based upon her income. 6)The court reviewed the circumstances of the parties and concluded that voluntary early retirement, or for that matter, the choice of a payor to either leave the work force, stop working, go back to school or change jobs for lesser pay, all by choice as opposed to necessity, do not constitute a Material change of circumstance sufficient to support a variation application to eliminate or reduce a payer’S obligation to pay child or spousa benefits."

The mother had always been the primary caregiver and had custody since the separation in 1994. The father had exercised regular and frequent access. She was given exclusive possession of the matrimonial home under the terms of the consent judgment which contemplated the home would be listed for sale and the net proceeds divided between the parties. Subsequent to the consent judgment the applicant went through bankruptcy proceedings in which he transferred his interest in the home to the trustee who then sold that interest to the respondent such that the applicant no longer had any interest in the home.

He did not serve notice on the clerk of the municipality, but the board forwarded the notice to the Municipality. When such waiver occurs, the failure to comply with the provisions for service do not constitute bar to the Board's hearing the appeal. HELD: The appeal was dismissed with costs to each of the respondents, Warren and the municipality in the amount of Five Hundred Dollars plus disbursements to be paid by the appellant. 1)The requirements for service contained in s.63(6) do not go to the jurisdiction of the Board to hear an appeal from the Assessment Review Court. That jurisdiction is derived in the first instance in this case from s. 63(3). Because the matter is not one of jurisdiction, there is no question in our minds that a party for whose benefit the provisions of service set out in s63(7) have been enacted can waive compliance with those provisions. When a waiver occurs the failure of the person required to be served with the notice of appeal does not constitute a bar to that Board's proceeding. 2)The appeal is dismissed."

d_2001nssc18.txt,"The grievor was employed in the front desk department of a hotel and her hours of work were reduced when another employee from the same department returned from maternity leave. The latter had greater departmental seniority than the grievor but less hotel seniority. The grievor filed a grievance claiming that under the collective agreement any such reduction of hours of individual employees should be based on hotel seniority, rather than departmental seniority. The arbitrator upheld the grievance and the hotel applied for judicial review. Application allowed; the arbitrator's interpretation of the collective agreement was patently unreasonable and her award should be set aside. The court's focus must be on the existence of a rational basis for the decision of the tribunal and not on whether it agrees with the decision. Although there was evidentiary support for the arbitrator's essential findings of fact, no logical process could be ascertained by which the final conclusion drawn from the evidentiary foundation was made.","This was an application for judicial review of the decision of a labour arbitrator released on July 21, 2000 in respect of a grievance arbitration heard in Sydney, Nova Scotia. The arbitration involved the interpretation of certain seniority provisions of collective agreement between the parties which was effective in October 1999 and expires on September 30, 2002. The grievor was the first to experience reduction of work hours in the front desk department where she placed fourth on the departmental seniority list behind the other three employees. She also alleged that the reduction of her work hours based on departmental and hotel seniority constituted a violation of Article 9 of the collective agreement. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. The court found that the wording of Article 10 of the Collective Agreement was wide enough to encompass the situation and that any reduction in work hours should instead have been predicated on hotel. The fact that the grievor had less hotel than the other employees in her department did not disqualify her from working in the department. The appeal court ordered that the arbitrator's decision be set aside under s15(2) of the Arbitration Act."

He argued that he had a reasonable excuse to refuse based on his medical condition of anxiety attacks at the time of blowing. HELD: 1)This case is similar to the Alberta Court of Appeal decision in Topp which stated the accused must not conceal his reasons for refusing to give breath samples. The case has to be decided on the basis of what the police knew or could readily surmise, not on the hidden facts, which the accused had not disclosed. The New Brunswick case of R. v. Dunnett canvassed the law with respect to s.10(b) rights and cited four factors arising from recent SCC decisions concerning detained or arrested person's right to a lawyer. Granted the accused was charged with refusal 51 minutes after the demand for the breath tests, even though he was diligent in attempting to reach counsel, he was not diligent in pursuing his rights after he unsuccessfully tried to contact a lawyer three times. It is not a police officer's obligation to go further if the accused does not appreciate the advice of Legal Aid counsel. 2)His evidence was not believed as to the anxiety attacks. The intoxilyzer did not register because he was not breathing properly into the mouthpiece. He provided an adequate supply of air in the roadside screening device about an hour prior. The statement of law enunciated in Pederson out of the Yukon Territory Supreme Court was adopted. It could not be concluded on the evidence that his respiratory problems made it impossible to provide a sample. The doctor stated he could do so when his breathing returned to normal as did the accused. Further an accused who is aware of what triggers his anxiety attacks, for example a hard night of drinking the night before, and continues to drink alcohol and operate a motor vehicle cannot be later heard to say and hope to avoid conviction that the refusal was a result of a known medical condition. He should not drink and drive.","The 28 year member of the RCMP was charged with failure to comply with a demand made to him by a Peace Officer pursuant to s. 254(3) of the Criminal Code requiring him to provide then or a soon thereafter as is practicable such samples of his breath as in the opinion of a qualified technician are necessary to enable a proper analysis to be made in order to determine the concentration, if any, of alcohol in his blood.

He sought a fine and an order that she bring the child to Saskatoon for access visits. He applied to vary the terms of the access order. The Court raised jurisdiction, service and time issues.HELD: 1)To avoid adjournment counsel consented to the court's jurisdiction, the acknowledgement of service and the abridgement of time. 2)The mother was found to be in contempt of court for deliberately disobeying the order by repeatedly refusing, without lawful excuse, to comply with its terms. Almost without exception she refused to make the child available for the bi-weekly supervised access visits. She did not abduct the child. The mother was to purge her contempt by paying the father's solicitor and client costs respecting the two applications fixed at $1,500 and by obeying the access terms of this order.

The mother shall have reasonable telephone access.","FIAT The father applies for an order pursuant to s29(1)(a) of The Children's Law Act finding the respondent in contempt of court for deliberately disobeying the terms of an August 2002 access order respecting the child of the parties, [A.K.L.], born in 2000. Despite paying child support, the respondent has enjoyed virtually no access. He was required to bring an application and obtained the supervised access order in issue in 2000 but was only successful in obtaining supervised access visits on two occasions. The father applied for a fine of $1,500. The respondent applied for an adjustment in the access terms of that order. HELD: 1)The respondent deliberately disobeyed the court order by repeatedly refusing without lawful excuse to comply with the terms. Almost without exception, she refused to make the child available for the supervised visits that were ordered to take place every two weeks over a four-month period from August to December 2002. The petitioner was in contempt when she moved with the child to Brandon without prior notice to the petitioner. She purported to terminate access and refused to return the child for the remainder of the visits that had been ordered. The court was of the view that the respondent will not again disobey court orders so that fine is not called for in the circumstances. 2)The limited access proposal of the respondent was realistic because it virtually guarantees that the petitioner and his parents will never be able to develop any relationship with his son, child that the petition has been supporting financially on a voluntary basis since birth. Nor is the access proposal realistic because the respondent does not have the financial ability to bring the child here for access visits. The limited access offered by the respondent is not realistic because of the limited access that the parties will never develop. The only access proposal offered by her is that she refused without lawful reason to comply. Almost every access offer was made to make available the child by telephone during the four month period. She continued to be in contempt even under that order, he was only able to obtain supervised access.

d_2004nsfc13.txt,"The mother was unable to care for the child and the father, who had been convicted of sexual assault, was only entitled to supervised access. Both the paternal and maternal grandmothers presented plans of care to the court, with the paternal grandmother seeking custody and the maternal grandmother seeking care and control of the child. The child had a younger sibling who was in the maternal grandmother's custody and her daughter, the mother of the child, supported the plan of the maternal grandmother. The Agency supported the paternal grandmother. Custody granted to the paternal grandmother with reasonable access to the maternal grandmother and supervised access to the parents. The paternal grandmother was better able to care for the child financially and her circumstances were such that it was in the child's best interests to grant her custody. The issue of separation of siblings was only one factor in considering an alternative (relative) placement; the children were very young and there was no evidence of a bond between them.","The father was convicted of child abuse and sentenced to thirty-nine months in prison. The child was placed in the permanent care and custody of the paternal and maternal grandmother, who was also a convicted child abuser, but had been placed in an unsupervised situation. The father had been sentenced to 30-9 months for the conviction. The mother, who lived with the paternal grandmother, had been given custody by the court in the interim. The maternal grandmother was also given custody. The court granted leave to the mother to apply for custody and ordered that the child be placed in permanent care with the maternal grandmother and that the matter be dismissed pursuant to s. 42(1)(a) of the Children and Family Services Act. HELD: The child is in need of protection. The parents are in good standing. The evidence is not disputed. However, there is an indication that baby food was being fed to the child when she was not quite four months old and not ready for it. The paternal grandmother indicated she would move to a larger residence if she got custody. An order will issue under the Maintenance and Custody Act granting custody to the paternal grandparent who will be required to facilitate access amongst the various parties, some of which will be supervised within her discretion. The Court reviewed numerous custody cases. Considering all the evidence before the court, including the two plans of care, there was a bond between the paternal grandma and the child. She would facilitate access and protect the child from her own son whose access must always be supervised. She is better set up in her home to receive the child and she is more financially stable. She indicated that she would have to move to larger residence to take care of the child if she were to get custody."

d_2006skpc95.txt,"The Crown has applied pursuant to s. 753 of the Criminal Code to have the accused designated a dangerous offender. There is no question that the accused was convicted of a 'serious personal injury offence' as that term is defined in s. 752 of the Code. It is also clear that the accused's predicate offence and past behaviour lead to the conclusion that the requirements set out in s. 753(1) of the Code have been met. The sole issue left for the Court to determine is whether the evidence permits the Court to find that there is a reasonable possibility of eventual control of the risk the accused poses to the community so that he could be designated a long term offender rather than a dangerous offender. This is not a case where a definite term of imprisonment would be appropriate, as was conceded by defence counsel. HELD: The accused is a dangerous offender. He is sentenced to indeterminate detention. 1) The accused does not have significant gaps in his violent offending, except for one period of about 19 months beginning August 2000. While there is a significant time period between his offences concerning T.R. (1993) and those involving P.M. (2003) there are also the other violent offences concerning women which are of concern, both with respect to MZ, which is a third example of that type of controlling, violent behaviour and the incidents concerning F.B. and S.O. which denote more explosive violent behaviour. 2) The expert evidence supports a finding that the accused is not someone who can be treated so as to reduce the risk of re-offence he presents to the community to an acceptable level.  3) Although many of the accused's offences were committed while he was under the influence of drugs or alcohol, it is doubtful that the continuous beatings which he inflicted on his domestic partners can all be attributed to violence while under the influence of substances. 4) The accused does not pose a risk to just a single person. Any woman he has contact with either through family relationships, intimate relationships, or purely social relationships is at risk of his penchant to punch or kick them in the face. Those he is involved with in a domestic situation or intimate relationship are at grave risk of his controlling, violent and torture-like abusing behaviour over a lengthy period of time. It is unlikely that restrictions in his living arrangements would be effective in preventing him from being intimately involved with women, who would be at risk. 5) The Court was of the opinion that the accused has significant psychopathic features of his personality that are so entrenched as to be impervious to change such that the sentencing principle of public protection can only be achieved by an indeterminate sentence.","The Crown applied pursuant to s. 753 of the Criminal Code to have the accused designated a dangerous offender. The accused was found guilty of aggravated assault for which he received a sentence of 11 months secure custody plus probation for 2 years and a concurrent offence of assault for the predicate offence. The Crown argued that the accused should be designated a long-term offender. HELD: The Court held that the Court must now consider whether the subject of the application might be found a long term offender, despite the fact that the statutory criteria in Part XXIV of the Code have been interpreted recently by both the Supreme Court of Canada and the Appeal Court of Appeal. The Court also held that in order to achieve a reasonable possibility of control of the risk of harm in the community, a person must first demonstrate that he is capable of dealing with it in a reasonable manner. The court found that there was no evidence that the offender, who qualified as dangerous offender, might be able to do so. The evidence did not support this conclusion."
d_2006skqb251.txt,"Hayley is 7 years old. In this application each of her father, mother and maternal grandmother compete for some form of custody over her. The father seeks sole custody. The mother and grandmother seek joint custody with the father. The mother seeks to be designated as her daughter's primary caregiver. HELD: 1) The father and his wife Patricia have been the primary caregivers and psychological parents of Hayley for in excess of 2 years. The preservation of that important relationship when added to all other factors in this case tips the scales in favour of the father. 2) The family which has been Hayley's experience for the past 2 years, even if relocated to Calgary, is where the continuity, consistency and stability necessary to attain Hayley's best interests will be found. 3) The father must be the sole custodian of Hayley. He must consult with her mother. The evidence shows that the parties have not been able to maintain a functional parental relationship. Whether the mother establishes a new residence in Moose Jaw or Cold Lake, the distance relative to Calgary is significant. 4) A grandparent may be a person of sufficient interest if the relationship leads to the conclusion that such a relationship is beneficial to the child and consequently harmful if terminated. That is the first step. The second step arises only where the grandparent is found to be a person of sufficient interest. It proceeds with a review based on the best interest principle as enunciated by s. 9(1) of the Act. 5) The court was satisfied that the grandmother is a person of sufficient interest in Hayley's life and that if her relationship as grandmother to Hayley was thwarted by the actions of Hayley's parents, the result to Hayley would be harmful. There are situations, and this is one of them, where the court should curtail the tradition of access to a grandchild flowing from the parents who have the right to control the upbringing of their child and to determine what relationships the child shall be a party to. An independent right of access is needed to attain Hayley's best interests.

HELD: The Court found that the father was the primary caregiver for the child. The mother and grandmother independently sought joint custody. The father argued that the business opportunities were unlimited in Calgary whereas the same cannot be said about the opportunity to earn their livelihoods in Moose Jaw.

d_2006skqb35.txt,"FIAT: The plaintiffs apply for an order requiring the defendant doctor to answer the interrogatories and attend a further examination for discovery. The defendants seek an order striking portions of the statement of claim, and requiring the plaintiff to provide answers to undertakings given at his examination for discovery. HELD: 1) Rule 222 of The Queen's Bench Rules allows a party to a proceeding without order to examine for discovery, before trial, an adverse party touching matters at issue. If the plaintiffs are in effect seeking to obtain particulars of similar fact circumstances, the prejudicial effect of such evidence far outweighs any prohibitive value. At the same time, s. 60(2) of The Medical Profession Act, 1981 protects against disclosure of information or evidence given during proceedings conducted by the College of Physicians and Surgeons. Likewise, s. 35.1 of The Saskatchewan Medical Evidence Act grants a similar privilege relating to quality assurance committees that have evaluated care given to patients in hospitals. Insofar as the interrogatories relate to patients, surgical procedures or proceedings not related to the subject litigation, they are either not relevant or privileged. Since the statement of claim has twice been amended, the court was satisfied that special circumstances exist permitting further examination for discovery and/or interrogatories. Wide latitude is permitted at this stage of the proceedings. The trial judge will be in the best position to determine the admissibility of information obtained in relation to the doctor's skills, techniques, judgment and competency. The plaintiffs are entitled to responses to specific interrogatories. If further elaboration is required, the plaintiffs may at their own expense re-examine the doctor. Such examination should not include inquiries as to other patient names, hospitals involved or details of the surgical procedures or surgeries performed.  2) Pursuant to Rule 173(a) of the Rules of Court it must be plain and obvious that the paragraphs of the statement of claim disclose no reasonable cause of action. Punitive damages are awarded in situations where the defendant's misconduct is so malicious, oppressive and high-handed that it offends the court's sense of decency. Such damages are only awarded where the combined award of general and aggravated damages are insufficient to achieve punishment and deterrence. The defendant's misconduct does not have to be an independent actionable wrong to attract punitive damages. The breach of a duty that is owed will attract an award of punitive damages. It is not the degree of negligence but the mental element that accompanies the negligence that give rise to a claim for aggravated or punitive damages. The amended statement of claim alleges the doctor failed to inform one of the plaintiff of the risks associated with the surgery leading her to believe there were no risks involved. Such negligence, if proven, could lead a trier of fact to conclude that both aggravated and punitive damages are warranted against this doctor. It would be somewhat presumptuous at this stage to conclude that it is plain and obvious that the plaintiffs do not have a cause of action for aggravated or punitive damages against the doctor. In the courts view humiliation, indignity, degradation or shame could be the consequences of the wrongful behaviour pleaded. If those emotions must be specifically pleaded, the plaintiffs can apply for a further amendment of their claim. 3) The obligations of a party to comply with undertakings given at an examination for discovery are contained in Rule 231 of The Queen's Bench Rules. To the extent that the doctor has been required to respond to interrogatories relating to his skill and training and to the extent that any further cross-examination may show defects in his competency, the plaintiff's undertaking must be answered. If the plaintiffs have further or other facts, those facts must be provided. 4) The defendants are not entitled to know or to take advantage of or receive any credit for or accounting relating to trust funds gratuitously set up for the plaintiff. However, an accounting regarding the bank records and the records produced for the Public Trustee by the Trustee for the trust fund will be complied with as it may impact on the claim by him for loss of income as a result of being required to be in attendance to provide care for the plaintiff.","The plaintiffs sought an order compelling the defendant to respond to written interrogatories and an order permitting further oral examination for discovery of the plaintiff on issues arising from his responses to the written interrogations. The plaintiff suffered a heart attack and underwent tubal ligation surgery. She underwent emergency surgery to repair two millimeter bowel perforations and underwent partial bowel resection operation. She suffered brain and organ damage and was living in long-term care facility in Saskatoon. The defendant applied for an order pursuant to Queen's Bench Rule 173 striking out para. 33(b) of the plaintiffs' Amended Statement of Claim and ordering the plaintiff to provide the plaintiffs with the names of the deceased's roommate and the date of her surgery. The plaintiffs sought punitive damages. The order was granted and the plaintiffs were ordered to respond. HELD: 1)The plaintiffs did not have a cause of action for aggravated or punitive damages against the defendant. It would be somewhat presumptuous at this stage of the proceedings to conclude that it is plain and obvious pursuant to Rule 173(a) of The Queen’s Bench Rules that the plaintiffs do not have an adequate cause to take punitive or exemplary damages. 2)The Court found that the impugned paragraphs were not relevant or privileged. The court found that special circumstances existed permitting further examination for the discovery and/or interrogatories. 3)The plaintiff was entitled to responses from the defendant in relation to the approximate number of occasions that the plaintiff performed laparoscopic tubal surgery on patients prior to her discharge from the hospital and during subsequent care and treatment to repair the bowel.  4)The defendant was not entitled to compel the plaintiffs to provide particulars of quality assurance review in case not involving the plaintiff. 5)The court found the following: (a) an order requiring the plaintiff and her children to provide further particulars of their claim; (b)an order requiring them to provide a copy of the report of neurologist Dr. Vrbancic to counsel for the plaintiffs; and (c) an inquiry into the conduct of the defendant's medical staff during the course of the surgery performed on the plaintiff; (d)an inquiry into whether the plaintiff had undergone laparoscopies in the past; (e) an additional order requiring that the respondent respond to undertaking number 32 of Gayle Ann Almond during an examination for a discovery of March 8, 2001.

Saskatchewan applies for an order pursuant to Rule 166 and 168 of the Queen's Bench Rules disallowing the amendments to the statement of claim. The amended claim alleges that the Government and Saskatchewan funded and were responsible for the school in a supervisory and oversight capacity and that they are liable to the plaintiffs for physical and sexual abuse, loss of language and culture, failing to provide an adequate education and holding them against their will and the will of their parents. HELD: 1) This application is based on the proposition that s. 20 of The Limitations Act applies to the plaintiffs' amended claim.

The amended claim does not apply because no limitation period expired after the original claim was commenced and before the claim was amended to add Saskatchewan as a defendant.

The consent order provided that the parties would have joint custody of the children with the primary residence with the respondent. The order also provided that the respondent would have the final decision with respect to health and education matters, after consultation with the petitioner. The situation had evolved to the point that the petitioner had relocated to the same city as the respondent and children. For the past two and a half year, the petitioner had access to the children 50% of the time. The petitioner acknowledged that under the current arrangement, the respondent consulted him before making decisions regarding the welfare of the children. The consent order dealt with child support payable, provided that tax returns be exchanged annually and set out how child support should be calculated on an ongoing basis. The petitioner sought to have the child support arrangement varied so that his support obligation would not increase or decrease in the years to come. The petitioner cited increased personal costs to exercise access to the children. HELD: The petitioner had not established a material change in circumstances sufficient to justify a change to the parenting arrangement. The original consent order provides that the respondent must consult with the petitioner on issues of health and education and the current arrangement has worked well for the children. The petitioner also failed to establish a material change in circumstances sufficient to alter the agreed child support arrangement. The issue of increased costs for the petitioner to exercise access to the children was dealt with in the original consent order. The only change in circumstances is that the petitioner's income has increased. The petitioner's application to vary the parenting arrangement and child support order was dismissed. The respondent was awarded costs.","FIAT: The petitioner applies to vary the consent parenting judgment and the consent child support order. The respondent opposes the application and says there has been no material change of circumstances since the granting of the parenting judgment. HELD: The application is dismissed. 1) The petitioner has not satisfied the Court with its onus on him to establish that the three initial conditions have been met. 2) There has not been a material change in the circumstances of the petitioner since the birth of the twins. 3) The respondent has not managed to resolve the health or welfare issues pertaining to the petitioner. The petitioner's income for child support purposes is $77,060. The court ordered that the petitioner commence paying child support in the amount of $1,072 per month and continuing monthly thereafter until further order or agreement of the parties."

Of this amount, $562.13 represents utilities that the tenant had overpaid. The landlord states that he never agreed to pay the utilities.HELD: Pursuant to s. 72 of The residential Tenancies Act, the court is restricted to addressing questions of law or jurisdiction. The landlord's appeal relates to findings of fact made by the hearing officer. There was evidence to support the hearing officer's factual decision and all of her findings. It is not open to this court to overturn those findings of fact. The appeal is dismissed.","The landlord appealed a decision of a Hearing Officer which ordered the landlord to pay to the tenant $787.13 of which $562.13 represents utilities that the Hearing Officer found the tenant had overpaid and $225 to be paid as abatement of rent for the tenant's inconvenience of having to deal with the caretaker's threats of water being turned off and for repeated notes from the caretakers. The tenant had this property for about 30 years and had not paid the tenant. HELD: The landlord appealed. The court reviewed the facts of fact and found that the finding of facts was not disturbed on appeal. Only when there is no supporting evidence is the line between valid non-appealable finding of fact or invalid appealable finding crossed.

HELD: Bearing in mind the efficacy of the high school grapevine, particularly in an electronic age, publication of the factual accounts of the young persons in their affidavits will not cause further harm to them. The public, including fellow students, have the right to know their version of the facts. However, other portions of the affidavits that refer to the effects of the assault on the young men and their ramifications to others should be sealed because there is a real risk of further harm to the young persons and to others.","The defendant applies for an order sealing the affidavits of two young persons. The plaintiffs and their litigation guardian have been the subject of negative comments on social networking sites. HELD: The order is at the top of the range of protections which the court may afford individuals in our society and that the onus is on the applicant to establish on a continuing basis that this remedy is required. The affidavits speak to the effects of the assault on the two young people and ramifications to others. The evidence of Don Hoium, Director of Education and former educational psychologist, brings home the point that if the evidence of the Children were to be made public, it may provoke harassment and acts of retaliation against the Children and their families, possibly by other students. The public, including fellow students of the young persons, have the right to know their version of the facts. The affidavit of JP and JR, now in Grade 9, were victims of a brutal hazing assault conducted by senior students, including the plaintiffs, and that public disclosure of information in their affidavits would exacerbate the harm which has been done to them. The sealing order is in the range set out by the Supreme Court of Canada in Dagenais v. Canadian Broadcasting Corp., 1994 CanLII 39 and R. v. Mentuck, 2001 SCC 76 to determine whether restrictive publication should be ordered: the necessity to prevent serious risk to the proper administration of justice because reasonable alternative measures will not prevent the risk; and, the positive effects on the rights and interests of the parties and the public. Bearing in mind the efficacy of the high school grapevine in this electronic age, publication of the factual accounts of young persons in their affidavit will not cause further harm to them in my view.

d_2011skpc110.txt,"The accused was detained by a police officer at the scene following a motor vehicle accident. The police vehicle was not equipped with an approved screening device (ASD) and was requested at 3:02 a.m. Upon receiving the ASD, a demand was made for a breath sample at 3:10 a.m. and a 'fail' reading was obtained at 3:12 a.m. The accused unsuccessfully attempted to reach three different lawyers at the police station and ultimately spoke with Legal Aid duty counsel. The accused was charged with driving over .08. The defence argued that the ASD demand was not made forthwith and the ASD results were unlawfully obtained. The defence submitted the accused's rights under s. 8, s. 9, and s. 10(b) of the Charter were breached and sought exclusion of the Certificate of Analysis. HELD: 1) The accused's s. 10(b) Charter right was not infringed. While the police were obliged to afford the accused a reasonable opportunity to contact counsel and to facilitate that contact, they were not required to monitor the quality of the legal advice once contact was made. 2) Although the accused was arbitrarily detained for a period of 11 minutes from time of detention to making of the ASD demand contrary to s. 8 and s. 9 of the Charter, the officer acted in good faith by placing the accused in the police vehicle because it was cold outside, the accused had no jacket on, he was injured and his vehicle was seriously damaged. The detention was of relatively short duration and there was no evidence that the accused's bodily integrity or dignity were compromised. The admission of the Certificate of Analysis would not bring the administration of justice into disrepute.","The accused was charged with operating a motor vehicle while his blood alcohol content exceeded 80 milligrams of alcohol in 100 millilitres of blood, contrary to s. 253(1)(b) of the Criminal Code. The accused attempted unsuccessfully to reach three different lawyers but ultimately spoke with Legal Aid duty counsel. HELD: The accused's s. 10(b) Charter rights were not infringed. The admission of the Certificate of Analysis would not bring the administration of justice into disrepute. 1) The accused was arbitrarily detained for 11 minutes and a sample of his breath was obtained. However, the officer appeared to have acted in good faith. 2) There was a range in the potential impact upon an accused, from 'fleeting and technical to profoundly invasive'. The more serious the effect of the breach on the accused's right to be free of unreasonable search and seizure, the greater the risk that the admission of his evidence obtained as result of the breaches would bring the Administration of Justice into disarray. 3) The Court found that the accused was not given an opportunity to speak with legal counsel prior to the demand being made. The Certificate ofalyses was admitted into evidence. 4) It is my view that the Charter breaches were moderately serious. The Charter infringing conduct giving rise to the breaches was the officer's failure to make the demand 11 minutes earlier than he did. The Court held that the Court found the accused’s right to counsel was not infringered. 5) The admission was not made forthwith. The officer was unaware that he was unaware of his right to seek counsel prior thereto. The court found that there was nothing to indicate he could not have made the demand at that point. 6) The officer should have informed the accused why he was placed in the police vehicle and ought to have informed him of his rights under s. 24(2) and s. 7 of the Charter. 7) It was also found that because the officer had not advised of the reason for the detention, he was not afforded an opportunity for counsel of his choice. 8) The court held that it is not possible for the officer to make a demand of this nature 11 minutes prior to making the demand. 9) The certificate of analysis was admitted. 10) It would not be appropriate to exclude the Certificate if the accused had not been advised of his Charter rights."
d_2011skqb62.txt,"The Crown appealed the acquittal of the accused on a charge under s. 90 of the Criminal Code for carrying a concealed weapon. The accused was spotted at a recycling facility with a sword stuffed in the back of his pants. At trial, defence called evidence suggesting that a sword of that type could be purchased at a novelty store and had a blunt edge. The accused testified that he bought the sword with the intention of hanging it on the wall or putting it on his television. The trial judge found that the Crown had not established that the sword was a weapon or that the accused intended to use it as a weapon. The Crown appealed on the basis that the trial judge misapprehended evidence, ignored other evidence and improperly admitted opinion evidence. HELD: The evidence from the defence 'expert' indicated that he had particular experience that allowed him to recognize the sword and he was able to be of assistance to the Court because of his experience. No attempt was made by the Crown to contradict the evidence that the sword could be purchased at a novelty store and had a blunt edge. The Crown bore the burden of establishing that the sword was a weapon within s. 2 of the Criminal Code and the only evidence before the Court was that the accused probably bought it as a decorative item and that it likely came from a novelty store. On that basis, it was open to the trial judge to conclude that she had a reasonable doubt that the sword was designed to be used as a weapon. The trial judge properly considered the evidence in the context of the issues to be addressed. The Court held that a sword is not prima facie a weapon. The Crown appeal was dismissed.","The Crown appealed the acquittal of the accused on a charge of carrying a concealed weapon on the grounds that the learned trial judge misapprehended the evidence, ignored other evidence and improperly admitted opinion evidence. HELD: The Crown appeal was dismissed. 1)The trial judge was required to address s. 90 of the Criminal Code with respect to the definition of a weapon. There was evidence upon which she could conclude that the Crown had not proved beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused intended to use the sword as a weapon, or that the sword was designed to be used as a weapons. 2)The Crown had no reasonable doubt the accused used the sword for the purposes enumerated in s. 2 of the Code, notwithstanding that a knife, like a multitude of other things (e.g. baseball bats, hatchets, pipe wrenches and ice picks) can on occasion be used effectively in fighting offensively or defensively. The trial judge concluded that she had reasonable doubt. 3)A knife, being an instrument that is universally used for utilitarian, peaceful purposes is not prima facie a weapon in the same manner that a firearm, or brass knuckles or other inherently dangerous items are considered weapons. On this basis, the accused's evidence was properly the subject of expert evidence put in under the guise of opinion evidence and notwithstanding that the knife, which is not necessarily weapon, can on occasions be used in a fighting or defensively manner. 4)The accused's testimony was not supported by the Crown's evidence. The Crown argued that the trial judge erred in accepting the accused’s evidence that he probably bought it as a decorative item and (b) that it likely came from a novelty store. 5)The judge found that the evidence was relevant to the decision of the Court on the prima-facie basis. She found that it only had the appearance of a sword and that the only evidence before the judge was (a) that he had bought it for $10.00 at a convenience store and (c)that it was readily available in novelty stores. The switchblade affords useful contrast. 6)The Court reviewed the evidence in the context of the issues she had to address. It must start with the premise that a sword is a 'brilliant, decorative' weapon, that is to say, in warfare, fighting, or combat to overcome an enemy in attack or defence. The accused testified that he met a woman who had some bottles and he had to go take them in for her. The"
d_2013skca22.txt,"The prospective appellant applied to leave to appeal an order made in Chambers. The Merchant Law Group and the Crown had been involved in protracted negotiations regarding the manner in which Merchant would bill the Crown for legal fees regarding their representation of Indian residential school claimants. The parties eventually reached a 'Verification Agreement', respecting the verification of Merchant's legal fees and disbursements. In order to protect solicitor-client privilege, Merchant's software company was able to develop redacted electronic billing records with the privileged information removed. When Merchant did submit a bill, it was discovered that the electronic billing records were inaccurate. The parties then became involved in a dispute regarding the Merchant's obligations under the Agreement. They had each made an application to a Chambers judge acting in his capacity as an administrative judge for the purposes of the Agreement for directions. The judge ordered (see: 2012 SKQB 517) that Merchant should contact its former software company and arrange for them to re-create the redacted electronic billing records as a whole from the 'live data' in the appellant's present billing program. Before the software company would perform this task, the Court ordered Merchant to pay the outstanding fees. Merchant had disputed these fees and had refused to pay them. Merchant took the position that the administrative judge had exceeded his jurisdiction by requiring the law firm to make this payment: the judge had over-reached his authority. In addition, the judge had based his decision on emails that were not evidence.HELD: The Court noted that leave to appeal under Court of Appeal Rule 11 is granted in accordance with the criteria established in Rothmans, Benson &amp; Hedges Inc. v. Saskatchewan. Leave to appeal was denied. The order appealed from was simply a discretionary order designed to move the verification process along and ensure the process met its overall objective of determining if the amount of Merchant's fee was reasonable and equitable. The prospective appellant failed to establish that there was a matter of sufficient importance to the proceedings or to the field of practice, the state of law or the administration of justice to warrant a determination by the Court.","The appellant sought leave to appeal an order of Gabrielson J. in chambers dated December 11, 2012. The Chambers judge was acting in his capacity as an Administrative Judge appointed pursuant to the Court Administration Protocol (the CAP) established as part of the settlement of the Indian Residential Schools litigation. The appellant argued the respondent had agreed to the verification process and requested that the respondent supply the new information in form compatible with the redacted electronic billing records. The respondent appealed, arguing the Administrative Judge erred in requiring the respondent to provide the redacted records as whole from the 'live data' for the residential schools litigation. HELD: The appeal was denied. Contrary to the argument of the appellant, the Administrative judge did not err by requiring MLG to pay the alleged accounts of ESI without sufficient information and without due process. The order was simply a discretionary order designed to move the verification of the claim along and ensure the process meets its overall objective of determining if the amount of MLG's fee is reasonable and equitable. The court found that the Administrative Court erred by failing to require the respondent complete its report and order the report delivered to MLG. The Court found that this was an error in law, and the Court was open to giving further directions from time to time to ensure that the process was properly concluded. An appeal will unduly delay the proceedings and will unnecessarily add to the cost of proceedings."
d_2013skpc206.txt,"HELD: The Court concluded that the $1,000 loan did not exist, there was nothing on the books showing an advance of wages as submitted by the plaintiff. The Court was not satisfied that the defendant husband received a loan from the plaintiff in the amount of $5,000. There was no loan documentation, which would be expected given the money was advanced from the plaintiff corporation. The plaintiff never demanded any of the money be paid back until just before issuing the statement of claim. The Court also held that the $5,000 to the defendant wife was a gift. The counterclaim of $2,400 was not proven; there was no evidence that these payments were not made with consent. The $960 should not have been taken off of the defendant husband’s cheque because the $1,000 and $5,000 loans were not made out. The defendant husband was successful in this portion of his counterclaim. The Court found that $2,400 given to the plaintiff by the defendant wife was also by agreement. The defendant wife’s testimony with respect to her hours worked were favoured over the plaintiff’s. The defendant wife was overpaid for work in November so the plaintiff was only owed $32.32. The plaintiff filed an inaccurate Record of Employment knowing that the defendant wife was trying to obtain employment insurance. The amount of damages owing to the defendant wife was adjourned to allow her to make a new claim with Service Canada for employment insurance given the Court’s determination of her hours worked, which would be enough to qualify for employment insurance.","HELD: There was no loan of $1,000.00 to Christos as far as the $2,400.00 is concerned. The defendant claimed that the $5,000 was a loan, as there was no Loan documentation prepared and signed, which one would anticipate considering the plaintiff is a corporation. There was also no evidence to support that the refund of these monies was not by agreement by the defendant Lilia as there is no record of it, as the plaintiff could have made a loan to the defendant, in light of the Court's finding that she has worked 604 hours. There is no loan given to the plaintiff as faras the $1k000 is concerned as there's no loan documentation prepared, signed, and/or signed which would anticipate the plaintiff being a corporation if she now qualifies for payment from Service Canada. There are no damages incurred by the plaintiff if she becomes eligible for the special benefits from service Canada.  1) The $5k000 was never asked to be paid back until about a year later. The plaintiff could well have made an application for a loan from the defendant if she was able to do so. 2) There is nothing to indicate that matters were not amiable, between the defendant and the plaintiff. The defendants had the free use of the plaintiff's home and also the free access to the defendants' car whenever they needed it. The $1 million was never given to Lilia. 3) The defendant's counterclaim was not proven. There were no loan payments made to the applicant until about 1 year later, when the plaintiff filed a demand letter close to the time of issuing the Statement of Claim, but there was never a request to pay it back. 4) The plaintiff was entitled to damages as against the defendant for negligence in the filing of the Record of Employment for Lilia and the $500 cheque to the appellant. 5) As the amount of damages is not known at this time, and as the defendant may be able to now qualify and receive funds retroactively for special benefits, the issue of damages as to this aspect of the defendant's claim is adjourned to a date to be determined by the parties and the Court.  6) Lilia was awarded damages as well as interest on her cheque. 7) The amount of $400 was deducted from her wages when she stated the agreement was to be $500 per month. 8) The balance of probabilities were not satisfied.

d_2013skpc56.txt,"The accused was convicted after trial of trafficking cocaine and breach of probation. The issue was whether the accused could be sentenced to a custodial disposition under s. 39(1)(d) of the Youth Criminal Justice Act. HELD: The youth was sentenced to deferred custody. The amount of cocaine was significant, the accused was the only person involved in the offence, it was a fairly unsophisticated operation, the impact on the small northern community where the offence occurred was huge, it is aggravating that the drug being trafficked was cocaine, the accused has a previous criminal record for trafficking, the place where the offence was committed is a friendship centre and a popular gathering spot for youth in the area and the offence was committed for financial gain. The Court held that the most aggravating factor on sentence was that the accused was less than one month into a probation order imposed for trafficking cocaine and was to stay out of the province. The Court held that it was impossible to conclude that the probation order the accused had previously been placed on had in any way achieved its goal of rehabilitation and reintegration of the offender.","The accused was convicted of possession for the purposes of trafficking cocaine contrary to s. 137 of the Youth Criminal Justice Act, possession of cocaine for the purpose of trafficking and failure to attend a youth probation hearing contrary to ss. 137 and 138 of the Act. The accused had been on probation for a conviction for possession of a controlled substance in cocaine that had been entered only month before this particular incident. He had no previous criminal record and had been in custody for 30 days prior to this offence. The Court found that with this not being a violent offence and with his limited criminal record, the accused was not subject to custody under either s. 39(1)(d) or s. 38(c) of the YCJA. HELD: The accused was sentenced to 6 months deferred custody and supervision. 1)The accused had 76 grams of cocaine. The evidence seemed to indicate a fairly unsophisticated operation being conducted out of the back seat of a vehicle. Rather than reparation, the court found that the accused had re-offended in the same way. 2)The Court found the accused guilty of possession of the cocaine. He was only one month into a probation order after having been convicted for possession for purposes trafficking in cocaine. His previous sentence of probation as imposed by the Court had failed to promote his rehabilitation or his reintegration into society."
d_2013skqb59.txt,"The petitioner mother has entered into a new relationship and is pregnant. She wants to move with the parties' two children to live with her new spouse. The respondent father is currently in jail and will be incarcerated for the balance of the calendar year. The respondent opposes the move and wants access to his children at the jail. The mother had unilaterally moved with the children prior to making this application in the face of an existing court order. One of the reasons that respondent is in jail is because he assaulted the petitioner. HELD: The Court was of the view that this was an exceptional case that warranted permitting the move on an interim basis. The petitioner's new relationship and the impending birth of a new sibling for the children is a material change in circumstances. The move is justified because the petitioner is the only parent available to the children and it would defy common sense to deprive the children of a relationship with their new sibling, particularly when the respondent is unavailable as a parent and there is no reasonable basis to conclude that matters can be resolved in the father's favour. The respondent asked to have the issue of custody and access delayed until his release. This is not a realistic option. It was clear that the father had not truly considered the best interests of his children in opposing this application and that the mother's position would likely prevail at trial. With respect to access with the father in jail, there was no evidence that visiting the respondent in jail would be beneficial to these young children. The respondent was granted telephone access and, if it was possible to arrange with corrections officials, access via Skype or Face Time.","FIAT: The mother wants to change her residence and that of the two young children presently. The father has a significant history of criminal behaviour, is presently incarcerated and will be for at least the balance of this calendar year. HELD: The court ordered that the children have access with their father while he is incarcerated. 1) The mother's unilateral move was unfortunate. While she claims that she reversed this move and went back to Nokomis, the father harbours suspicions that she and the children actually remained in Kenaston. The mother has formed a new relationship with the father, and her pregnancy means a new sibling will be introduced into the lives of the children. While personal access to an incarcerated parent may be beneficial to children in some instances, it is only considered in an exceptional case and then where the reason is relevant to the parent's ability to meet the children's needs. This is such a case. 2) There has been a material change of circumstances affecting the children, which will be a material factor in their future development. Their mother's new relationship and her pregnant means a child will be introducing into their lives. The court has insufficient evidence to conclude, on a balance of probabilities, that these two children visiting their father in jail would benefit."

Although the accused was lawfully stopped, the roadside demand was valid and the accused declined to exercise his right to counsel on two occasions following his arrest, the observation period at the detachment was not conducted properly.

The observation at the detachment was not properly conducted. The police officer had his back turned and he actually went to another room for brief time leaving the accused unattended. The Crown cannot rely on the presumption of accuracy in s. 258(1)(c) of the Criminal Code. The evidence from the RCMP officer who stopped the accused for checking for driver's licence, registration and sobriety did not support a finding of guilt on count 2.

The sentences were consistent with the range the Appeal Court had approved in numerous judgments.","Appellant, 21, pled guilty to armed robbery and one year for weapons offences. He had prior record of several convictions, including dispositions entered by the Youth Court when the present offences occurred. He was on probation at the time of the offences. At trial, the Crown and the defence had informed the trial judge that the accused had used a gun in the robbery of a store in concert with another person. The accused was in the store when the armed robbery occurred and the masked person entered the store masked and carrying a hand gun. The Crown and defence made submissions to the court that the Crown had advanced the argument that the appellant was technically guilty of the two offences even though he was not actually the person who was holding the gun. HELD: Appeal dismissed from sentences to be served consecutively of 4 years (armed robbery) and 1 year (weapons) per reasons for judgment of the Court of Appeal. 1)The Court of Queen's Bench had previously imposed sentences of 4 and 5 years for armed robbery, and 1 and 1/2 years for weapons offence to be concurrently served consecutally. 2)The sentence imposed by the trial court was consistent with the range that this court has approved in many of its judgments where armed robbery has occurred.

The appellant issued a builder's risk policy to Fraser Brace but the policy was never required to carry builder's insurance. The trial judge found the building was never at the insured's risk; that the policy attached when the property became at the risk of the insured. He ordered the respondent to repay the advances with compound interest. Several issues had been raised on appeal. The appeal on the main issue ought to be dismissed. There was no evidence nor even suggestion that the fire caused the fire.

In addition, the applicant made a claim for s. 7 expenses. The respondent's income for 1994 for thepurposes of the guidelines was $36,517.38; for 1995 it is $31,322.97 and for 1996 it is$91,535.39. The average of these three years of income is $32,243.39 and the respondent's annual income is 32,243 (unreported income). 2)The guidelines require the court to use the most recent information. The financial evidence filed by the respondent with respect to 1997 was not sufficient nor unsubstantiated sufficiently to determine income. 3)The applicant has appropriately deducted expenses from her gross income as she has only deducted a portion of her home and vehicle expenses; that portion is attributable to her business. 4)Costs to be paid by the applicant are to be divided equally."

After 15 months she was dismissed. The trial judge in her action for wrongful dismissal and negligent misrepresentation did not find any negligent misrepresentation but awarded damages equivalent to five months notice for wrongful dismissal. The appellant appealed the dismissal of her claim for negligent misrepresentation and the notice period for her wrongful dismissal. The respondent cross-appealed the damage award, claiming the trial judge failed to take into account the appellant's failure to mitigate. Appeal and cross-appeal, that the evidence supports the trial judge's findings, and he did not make any errors in law.","The appellant sought damages for negligent misrepresentation and wrongful dismissal. The respondent cross-appealed, claiming the five-month notice period should be reduced due to the appellant's failure to mitigate her loss. HELD: Appeal dismissed. 1)The trial judge found that the misrepresentation related to the very existence of the job offered, not as to its length and, therefore, the contractual provision for notice did not bar an action in tort. 2)The appellant was induced to enter the employ of KPMG by the negligent misrepresentations of both defendants. The appellant appealed. The trial judge upheld the action against the appellant on the basis that he had not properly applied the principles of negligent misrepresentance as set out by the Supreme Court of Canada in Queen v. Cognos, [1993]1 S.C.R. 87. The Court of Appeal reversed the decision and dismissed the appeal. 3)The respondent cross applied for a reduction in the notice period for wrongful dismissal, claiming that the five months notice period was unnecessary. 4)KPMG, having extended the contract for three months beyond the one year period waived its right to terminate the contract on one month's notice as provided in clause 13. This finding is not on appeal. 5)HELD: The appeal was dismissed."
e_1999skqb106.txt,"FIAT. One of the nine plaintiffs, legal representatives of passengers killed in a helicopter crash in 1995, and two defendants sought better testimonial and documentary discovery. Objections to questions or to the production of documents at the examinations for discovery fell under relevance and privilege. The plaintiffs alleged the defendants carried on a negligent and reckless shuttle service to and from the work site and that the Cameco group could not avoid liability by reason of having hired the Kyrgyzstan National Airline as an independent contractor. HELD: 1)Relevancy. The plaintiffs were entitled to question officers of the corporations and receive production of all documents touching on the issues of why the helicopter and the airline were selected; who made these decisions and whether KOC was the alter ego or agent for Cameco in this respect; whether the airline was unsafe; if so, should any of the defendants have known it was unsafe; was it inherently dangerous; and if so, could the defendants rely on the independent contractor defence. Questions relating to availability, cost and reliability of alternative forms of transportation were logically relevant. Questions as to topography were relevant as background information and supported the allegation the shuttle was inherently dangerous. Whether the project was over budget was relevant but the budget itself was not. Although questions directed at whether insurance was arranged and by whom were to be answered, the information is not automatically admissible at trial. Questions relating to the e-mail system and when survival gear was placed on board were properly answerable. Records as to when the tickets were reserved and purchased were to be produced. Counsel is not required to justify why every particular question is asked. The relationship between Cameco and it various subsidiaries was in issue and the information as to when the president met certain people was broadly relevant. Leave was granted to reapply for direction. 2)Privilege:(a)The defendants were ordered to date any document for which privilege was claimed. The document must be sufficiently identified to allow the opposing party to assess whether the claim for privilege should be challenged. (b)The request for names of the persons who prepared documents was simply an attempt to investigate the investigation and was not permitted. The Rules of Court do not require the names of expert witnesses who prepared reports for which privilege is claimed. The same rationale applies to non- expert privileged memoranda. (c)Pre-accident observations disclosed to someone in the subsequent privileged investigation are disclosable. The plaintiff is entitled to ask the name of any employee who expressed safety concerns about the shuttle prior to the accident. While matters of opinion only, such concerns are disclosable. A reciprocal order with respect to the names of potential witnesses was made in favour of the defendants. (d)Litigation privilege attaches only until such time as party determines to utilize the document at trial. Under the Rules of Court party must disclose any such document and produce any existing expert reports prior to the pre-trial conference. (e)The report on safety equipment and survival gear prepared by the KOC Safety Superintendent was to be reviewed by the court to assess whether or to what extent it was privileged. It was not known whether the Report prepared after litigation included matters other than what the Superintendent was requested to report on prior to the accident. (f)It was ordered that information given by a former senior level KOC employee would not amount to a breach of the confidentiality agreement. The agreement not to disclose any proprietary information, including business information, was broad enough to include privileged investigations carried out by the employer. Counsel for KOC and Kilborn were permitted to be present at the interview. (g)The chronology document was privileged on the basis it represented the product of a privileged investigation. 3)The necessary criteria under Rule 222(a) was not established to justify examining for discovery the two former employees. The request to explore post accident conduct of senior executives was dismissed. Seeking to establish alternate forms of transportation was irrelevant to the issues. 4)Particulars of the statutes and regulations referred to in the statement of claim, sought under Rule 142, were to be supplied within 45 days. 5)The question asking the spouse if in her opinion her husband would have boarded an aircraft he felt was unsafe was improper as framed. The question was relevant only to character. Character evidence is limited to reputation in the community and does not allow for personal opinion. 6)There was no order as to costs as success was mixed.","HELD: The Court granted leave to reapply for direction. The Court found that the following questions were logically relevant to the action:1) Answers to all of the questions were necessary to establish whether insurance was obtained, and if so, who arranged and paid for the same. 2) Answers were not required to establish liability. 3) The Court did not require the defendant corporations to answer questions directed at whether insurance or not, but rather to establish who arranged, paid for, or arranged the same for the helicopter.  4) The court found that if the defendant corporation was in a position to determine when such survival gear was placed on board the helicopters, the question should be answered. 5) Answers should be given to all questions related to the mode of transportation of helicopter flights and the selection of Kyrgyzstan Air as the operator of such flights. 6) Answers must be drawn by the trier of fact to test the credibility of answers that may be provided by the corporate officers with respect to the reasons for the choices made. 7) The only relevance is whether cost entered into one or more of the defendants' choice to utilize Kyrgyza National Air as a shuttle service. If the defendant is in a situation to determine, if such a decision was made independently of Cameco, Cameco or the KOC, the questions should be asked. Answers should not be left to the corporate officer. The court ordered that the defendants answer all of these questions."
e_2002nssc20.txt,"The applicant operated commercial private billiards club with liquor licence and served bar food. The applicant applied to amend the liquor licence to another category to allow public access and slightly longer hours of operation. The Municipality refused to issue a letter to the effect that the premises were properly zoned for that purpose, arguing that the proposal would result in a change in use requiring a development agreement. The applicant applied for an order declaring that the land use by-law permitted the proposed use. Application granted; the proposal did not constitute a change in use as the essential use of the premises was the sale of liquor and food in a pool hall and that would not change. There was no evidence that the proposal would result in a nuisance or increased traffic, neither of which could be presumed.","This was an application for an order to declare that the Land Use By-law of the respondent permits the operation of a licensed billiard club open to the public. The applicant had established a private pool hall, which was subject to certain restrictions including the sale of liquor. The premises was located within an area of a respondent's jurisdiction and subject to the respondent's Land Use by-laws. HELD: 1) The applicant's present establishment falls within the definition of a 'drinking establishment' as that term is defined in the By-laws set forth above. 2) The change of the liquor license sought by the applicant will only have the effect of moving the applicant's use from one subcategory of drinking establishment to another. There is a change in use when one purpose of the employment or application is abandoned and another purpose substituted for it. 3) There is no 'decision' of the development officer which may be appealed to the Board. That position sets forth the crux of the question now before me. The question is what constitutes 'use'. It means holding or occupying property or the employment of property for enjoyment, revenue or profit without in any way affecting the development agreement process. If the present use is non-conforming, it will require a development agreement. 4) The application is considered to be a development application. 5) There are no 'changes in use' that the municipality could not have contemplated. The development agreement would therefore be required as that is a new use, and one that is significantly different from its former use as a store. 6) The municipality's position is that if the proposal does not constitute 'change in use', no application for development permit is necessary and the development process is not applicable. 7) The city takes the position that the delivery of the products to homes and the preparing of food on the premises are the factors which indicate 'change' use. The burden is on the city to prove change in using. The developer's position set forth in s.247 and s.250 of the Municipal Government Act, the relevant portions of which read: 8.7.1 PERMITTED USES No development permit shall be issued in the Village Core (C6) Zone except for one or more of the following uses. 8.8.1 Permissive Use. The municipality could only appeal refusal to issue a development permit on the grounds that the decision of a development officer does not comply with the land-use by-law or the municipal Government Act.

The accused was charged on July 3, 2003 with common assault contrary to s. 266 of the Criminal Code, threatening to use weapon contrary to s. 267(a) of the Code, and destroying property of value less than $5,000 contrary to s. 430(4) of the Code. On July 31, 2003, the accused first appeared in court. The information was adjourned until October 6, 2003 due to lack of Legal Aid resources. On November 3, 2003, not guilty plea was entered and trial was set for May 6, 2004. On May 6, 2004, the trial was adjourned on application by the Crown due to the non-attendance of the complainant and new trial date was set for October 7, 2004. HELD: There was no Charter breach and the application is dismissed. 1) The length of delay from the date of release to the date of trial is approximately 15 months. This is not a complicated case and the delay warrants an inquiry. 2) The Court did not accept the accused's submission that he suffered actual prejudice because the undertaking prevented him from accessing his children. There were no efforts by the accused to overcome this. 3) The restrictive condition in the undertakings prohibiting him from drinking alcohol has resulted in him being charged with and pleading guilty to offences of breaching his undertaking. As these offences all occurred within what could be considered a reasonable time for the matter to proceed to trial, there is no actual prejudice to the accused. 3) This is a charge that involves an offence of domestic violence and is so serious that it carries the heightened public interest that exists in offences of violence.","The accused was charged with three offences of assault contrary to s. 266 of the Criminal Code and threats to use a weapon contrary to ss. 267(a) and 267(b) of the Code.

The Crown applied for relief pursuant to the Charter on the basis of post-charge delay denying him the right to have his trial in a reasonable time. HELD: The application was dismissed. 1)There was no Charter breach and there was no basis for finding a charter breach. 2)The accused did not contribute to the remaining delay.

e_2006nssc364.txt,"The plaintiff, while working as security officer in mall, was run down in the parking lot as he was pursuing shoplifter. The van that struck him, driven by second individual, was being used as getaway vehicle. The issue before the court was whether the agreed-upon damages were to be paid by the liability insurer of the registered owner of the vehicle (who was not the driver) or by the plaintiff's Section D (uninsured motorist) insurer. As the first defendant remained the registered owner of the vehicle at the relevant time and failed to rebut the statutory presumption that it was being operated by the second defendant (who had now disappeared) with his consent at that time, the vehicle's insurer was responsible to pay the plaintiff's damages. The action against the plaintiff's Section D insurer is dismissed. The case turned on numerous credibility issues as the registered owner of the vehicle professed to have sold it few days prior to the incident (although he maintained insurance on the vehicle for several months afterwards), and it was argued that the second defendant (whom the plaintiff had detained for shoplifting earlier that day) was not the driver of the vehicle.","HELD: The Court found that the plaintiff was the owner of a van that had been involved in a shoplifting heist. The plaintiff had joined the action his own insurer, ING, under his Section (uninsured motorist) coverage. The Court also found that there was no evidence the plaintiff had sold the van to the shoplifter, and that the van was not in driveable condition at the time it was struck. The court ordered that the sum of $162,500 be paid by ING. The facts were very much in dispute which necessitates number of credibility findings to be made. The factual disputes essentially pertain to the identity of the vehicle which struck the plaintiff and the driver of that vehicle and whether the driver had the owner's consent to operate it when the incident occurred."
e_2006skqb519.txt,"The Bank presents a motion to the Court to determine the priority position of the Bank and the respondent corporation respecting assets leased by the respondent to Sweeprite. By agreed statement of facts and issue, the parties have agreed that the issue to be determined is whether the Bank has priority to, or entitlement to, the equipment subject to the Lease. This requires a determination of whether the Lease was a 'lease for a term of more than one year' as defined by s. 2(1)(y) of The Personal Property Security Act. HELD: The respondent was 'regularly engaged in the business of leasing', within the meaning of s. 2(1)(y)(iv) of the PPSA and therefore is not entitled to the exemption from registration requirements of s. 3 of the Act. The lease in question was therefore 'a lease for a term of more than one year' within the meaning of the Act and it required registration. Having failed to register its leasehold interest at the personal property registry, the respondent's claim to the equipment is subordinate to the registered and first priority claim of the Bank. 1) There is no evidence of any business activity at all that the respondent engaged in until May 2001 when it had transferred back to it Sweeprite's land, building and equipment. The respondent in turn rented back the building, land and equipment, none of which ever left Sweeprite's possession, to Sweeprite under the terms of non-written agreement. Sweeprite paid rental to the respondent. Ultimately the respondent and Sweeprite entered into the equipment lease for term of years. 2) In 2001 when the non-written lease/rental agreement first began, the respondent had no other business except the ownership and lease to and/or rental of the land, building and equipment to Sweeprite. It was not until December of 2001 when it obtained the research and development contract with Rite Way. 3) The business of leasing, which had started in the spring of 2001 under the non-written arrangement and which continued thereafter by virtue of the equipment lease until the bankruptcy of Sweeprite, was from May to December of 2001 the only business of the respondent and thereafter continued to be a significant part of the respondent's business.","The Bank of Montreal (the Bank) presented a motion to determine the priority position of the Bank and the respondent Patchrite (Patchrite) respecting assets leased by Patchrite to the Bank. The Bank had no other business except the ownership and lease to and rental of the land, building and equipment to Sweeprite. It was not until December of 2001 when it obtained the research and development contract with Rite Way that it commenced the business of leasing. It leased the land and buildings to the respondent for a term of more than one year. The lease in question was a lease for more than 1 year and it required registration. Having failed to register its leasehold interest at the personal property registry, the Bank was entitled to the exemption from registration requirements of s. 3."
e_2007skca122.txt,"This is an appeal from a decision of the trial judge who granted a motion to withdraw the case from the jury in an action for damages in negligence brought by the appellant plaintiff against the respondent defendants. The action arose out of burn suffered by the appellant while participating in demolition derby run by the defendants. The motion was granted on the premise there was no case to go to the jury because the appellant had failed to adduce sufficient evidence of the requisite causal connection between his injury and the alleged acts of negligence, and the standard of care required of the respondents. In consequence, the trial judge dismissed the action with costs to the respondents. The issue on appeal is whether the trial judge applied the test correctly in light of the evidence. HELD: Appeal dismissed. 1) Had the case been permitted to go to the jury on the theory of the appellant, the jury would have been asked to conclude on a balance of probabilities that, but for the actions of the flagman who failed to immediately halt the competition and alert the Fire Department to the condition he had observed, the appellant would have suffered less serious burns than he in fact suffered. Similarly, the jury would have been asked to conclude that, but for the failure of the volunteer fire fighters to take more effective action, the appellant would have suffered less serious burns. The jury could not have arrived at either conclusion, given the evidence of the duration the appellant was on fire, about 30 seconds, and the expert evidence that his injuries would have occurred virtually instantaneously or within 5 to 6 seconds of his having caught on fire while still in his vehicle. In the light of this evidence, and in the absence of further evidence of the standard of care required of each of the respondent, the Court is of the opinion the jury could not rationally have concluded that either of the respondents caused or materially contributed to the extend of the appellant's injury. On the basis of the expert evidence, the damage would have occurred just the same, fault or no fault on the part of the respondents. That being so, the damage could not be seen to have been caused or materially contributed to by the respondents. 2) There is no tenable basis for this Court to interfere with the trial judge's award of costs.","The appellant was participating in a demolition derby when he suffered burns to various parts of his body and arm. The fire department had responded to the call for assistance from a flagman who noticed the splash of liquid or gasoline in the interior of the appellant's vehicle and alerted the fire department to the condition he had observed. The flagman, who was also an experienced demolition derby participant, assisted by four-man pit crew, modified his vehicle to meet the required standards and safety, including the safety of an unconventional ignition system he had devised to give him an advantage in starting the vehicle whenever it stalled. The appellant brought an appeal, contending the trial judge erred in failing to adduce sufficient evidence of causal connection between his injuries and the alleged acts of negligence. HELD: Appeal dismissed. 1)There was no tenable basis to interfere with the decision of the Court. 2)The Court was of the opinion that the action was destined to fail because, based upon the evidence before the court and the theory advanced by the appellant, the jury could not have found the requisite causal connection. The Court could not reasonably have concluded that either of the respondents caused or contributed to the extent of his injury. On the basis of the expert evidence, the damage would have occurred within minutes of the competition stopped and the appellant remained in the vehicle for a period of time."
e_2007skqb174.txt,"The respondent father applied by way of notice of motion to vary a custody judgment that provided for joint custody of the child with shared parenting according to a specified schedule. The grounds for the application were that the mother had failed to abide by the terms of the original judgment and had refused to provide the father with any information as to the location of herself and the child since the date of that judgment. The mother had left Saskatoon, taking the child with her and, subsequent to police involvement and several Court orders to assist in locating the child, was arrested on Canada-wide warrant in Edmonton, Alberta and charged pursuant to ss. 281(1) and 283 of the Criminal Code of Canada with child abduction and contravention of custody order. The applicant submitted that the mother had placed the child at risk of harm and accordingly it was in the best interests of the child that the father be granted sole custody. The applicant also requested an order providing only supervised access to the child by the mother. The father filed a further application seeking an order allowing him to relocate the child to Whitehorse, Yukon, for residential purposes. The mother opposed the father's application for relocation, and prayed that she be granted less restrictive access to the child. The issues were as follows. 1) Should the father be granted sole custody of the child? 2) Should the father be allowed to relocate with the child to Whitehorse, Yukon? 3) What access to the child should be granted to the mother? HELD: Application allowed. The father shall have the costs of the trial on party and party basis. 1) The starting point for the Court's review is whether the father has demonstrated material change in the circumstances affecting the child. The Court is satisfied that there has been a material change in the circumstances that existed at the time of the original custody judgment when it was thought that the cooperation of the parties necessary for joint custody was possible. As the mother has demonstrated it was not, review of the order to determine whether change in custody or access order is in the best interests of the child, having regard to all of the circumstances of this case. Based on the original findings and the evidence at trial that the father has cared well for the child, as well as the mother's conduct in attempting to avoid shared parenting, the Court is satisfied that it is in the child's best interests to grant sole custody to the father. 2) The evidence at trial confirmed the seven points that the father outlined in support of the proposed relocation to Whitehorse. In reviewing each of seven factors set out in the case law and considering the best interests of the child, the Court approves the father's plan to relocate to Whitehorse. 3) It is in the child's best interests to continue the mother's existing access arrangements with the child until the child moves with the father to Yukon, at which time the new access arrangements set out in this decision will apply. Detailed orders are issued accordingly.","The respondent applied to vary the original Custody Judgment to allow the father to have sole custody of the child with shared parenting according to a specified schedule. HELD: 1) There had not been a material change in the circumstances at the time of the application for custody when it was thought that the cooperation of the parties, which would be necessary for joint custody, was possible. The mother had refused to provide the father with any information as to the location of herself or the child since the date of the original judgment. 2) There was no material change of the circumstances which existed at the point of the Original Custody judgment when the father's application for sole custody was made. There was, however, evidence that the mother had not acted in the best interests of her child and that the father had not shown that she was prepared to move with the child to Whitehorse. 3) The mother's evidence was not supported by the father’s evidence. The father had been granted sole custody in Saskatoon but had moved with the son to White Horse. The court reviewed each of the seven factors listed in Gordon v. Goertz, which that Court states should be considered and find. 4) The evidence at trial was that the child had been well adjusted socially and acted like an average five-year-old while in the father and the mother were living together. 5) The father was entitled to supervised telephone access twice per week for two hours every second week. The supervised personal access was in the presence of a member of a security firm hired to prevent the father from removing the child from the supervised access facility. 6) The child was well-adjusted socially and was meeting all the needs of the mother. The increased contact with her extended family in the Yukon provided an increased social network that would be beneficial to the child. 7) The Father was granted custody in Whitehorse but requested that he be allowed to relocate with the Child to Whitehead for residential purposes. 8) The Mother was granted interim custody in September 2006. She had not attended the trial. 9) The Court reviewed the seven other factors which had been suggested by the mother, including the father, the mother and the respondent. The Court found that there was a significant change in circumstances which had occurred prior to the father being granted sole or shared custody.

The grievance alleged that the University had interfered with faculty member's academic freedom. The allegation concerned the withdrawal of an invitation to that faculty member to be the keynote speaker at National Symposium on Post Secondary Education Policy and Funding that was held on campus, although the University was not directly involved. After one of the chief organizers examined the faculty member's thesis and determined it would not provide suitable foundation for the symposium's keynote address, the invitation was withdrawn. The faculty member sought to have the decision reversed, and requested the University's Board of Governors' intervention. When the faculty member's request came up at one of the Board's meetings, one of its members made some inappropriate comments and expressed personal animus towards the faculty member. No decision was reached at that meeting. The respondent Board of Arbitration found that, in failing in his obligation to refrain from interfering in and to defend the academic freedom of a faculty member, the Board member's comportment amounted to a violation of the collective agreement by the employer. The applicant argued that the Board of Arbitration exceeded its jurisdiction by entertaining a grievance that did not involve parties to the collective agreement. Further, it argued that the Board of Arbitration made a determination of an issue not raised in the grievance, namely, a finding that there was a violation of academic freedom. HELD: The application is dismissed with costs. The Board of Arbitration found that the member of the University's Board of Governors' comportment at the meeting did not accord with the requirements of certain articles of the collective agreement. The reasons of the Board of Arbitration support that finding and the decision meets the reasonableness test. The fact that the member of the Board of Governors was acting in his capacity as Chair brought the issue within the purview of the collective agreement. The Court disagrees with the applicant's contention that the Board of Arbitration made a determination of an issue not raised in the grievance directly.","This was an application for judicial review of a Board of Arbitration Award which held that the First Nations University of Canada had violated certain provisions of a Collective Agreement in force between the parties. The applicant had received his Ph.D. degree from the University of Regina in 2004 and was involved in the University's Board of Governors decision to withdraw an invitation to the applicant to be the keynote speaker at the National Symposium on Post Secondary Education Policy and Funding which was held in mid-March 2005. At the time, the applicant was employed by the Federation as Director of Higher Learning and Research. In that capacity, she was instrumental in the planning and organization of the symposium and it was the applicant who invited the applicant as a speaker. The Applicant brought the issue within the purview of the collective agreement. HELD: The application was dismissed with costs. 1)The applicant failed in his obligation to refrain from interfering in and defend the academic freedom of a faculty member. The reasons as a whole support that finding. 2)The respondent failed to abide by the Board's finding of fact that the alleged breach of the Collective Agreement occurred while the respondent was acting in his capacity as Chair of the Board and not as an officer of the Federation. With respect, the respondent did not agree with the decision. The respondent was disappointed at this turn of events and sought to have the decision reversed. The formal grievance specifically refers to interference with the academic independence of the faculty member and is harassing and intimidating actions against the applicant. In addition, the University has interfered with the student's academic freedom in addition to interfering with his right to present his research. In this respect, we find that the Employer violated the Collective agreement and we uphold the grievance in part. 3)The Applicant was not satisfied that the Board acted within its jurisdiction by entertaining a grievance which did not involve parties to the collective Agreement. The Board made a determination of an issue not raised in the grievance namely, a finding that there was a violation of academic freedom.

The petitioner seeks to increase access to the two children of the relationship and an order to address holiday periods not covered in the previous order. HELD: There shall be no change in the previously ordered access schedule.  The Court found no change in the material circumstances that would warrant a change in the petitioner's regular access schedule. Because of the petitioner's work schedule, the increased access is unlikely to result in any meaningful time with the children. The holiday access requested was in the nature of an extrapolation of the previous order and the Court ordered holiday access in such a fashion as to continue that order.","FIAT. The parties had two children born of a relationship between the respondent and the petitioner. The petitioner worked every day for two weeks followed by one week off. The respondent worked two weeks of 12 hour days, 8:45 a.m. to 8:30 p.m., overnight to Tuesday at 10:00 am. HELD: 1) The court found no evidence of any material change in circumstances that would warrant a change in the petitioner's regular access. 2) The petitioner sought an order that would enable him to exercise increased increased access to the two young children of the relationship born of his relationship with the respondent. The order in issue here is an interim one.  3) There was no evidence that there had been any change in any circumstances which would warrant an increase or supplementing of the regular access schedule.  4) The respondent resisted any order that increased or supplement the petitioner’s access. 5) The Court found no material change to the respondent's schedule or that altering the existing regular access would be in the best interests of the children. 6) The access provisions in paragraph [9](xvii) of the February 2007 fiat were followed in May 2008 but only for the weeks that the petitioner was not working at all.

e_2008skqb84.txt,"The appellant appeals his conviction for common assault under s. 266 of the Criminal Code on the basis that his non-lawyer agent, Richard Klassen, provided him with ineffective assistance resulting in a miscarriage of justice. HELD: The appeal is dismissed. 1) Klassen's lack of ability by itself is not a ground for determining that a miscarriage of justice occurred. There was no unfairness in the trial process. The appellant was entitled to have Klassen represent him. He made that decision freely based on information fully at hand that he consciously chose to rely on. There was no procedural unfairness to the appellant. He did not get the standard of representation that a competent lawyer could provide but that came as a result of the decisions he freely made. On appeal the appellant cannot rely on the fact that the standard of representation received was not equal to that of a competent lawyer. 2) The tactical decision to attack the credibility of the complainant through challenge to the audio tape was personally approved by the appellant. The appellant saw many lawyers in the assault case. He did not have confidence in them and pursued his original line of defence through Klassen. The Court cannot see a miscarriage of justice as a result of the tactics of the appellant and Klassen. The evidence at trial and the fresh evidence offered by the appellant's testimony and his affidavit to not establish a miscarriage of justice that may have occurred outside of the appellant's choice of agent, which is the test in R. v. Romanowicz (1999), 138 C.C.C. (3d) 225 (Ont. C.A.).","The appellant appeals his conviction for common assault under s. 266 of the Criminal Code on the grounds that his non-lawyer agent, Richard Klassen, provided him with ineffective assistance resulting in a miscarriage of justice. HELD: The appeal is dismissed. 1)There certainly was no procedural unfairness to the appellant as there was no miscarriage of the justice as a result of the tactics of Mr. Dubelt and Mr. Kassen. The appellant did not get the standard of representation that a competent lawyer could provide. The trial judge treated the litigant fairly and attempted to accommodate the unrepresented litigants' unfamiliarity with the process so as to permit them to present their case. The objective fairness of the trial has not been diminished because of this tactical decision. 2)The appellant's counsel did not argue any other basis for the appeal other than the incompetence of the Klassens. The reasoning in Romanowicz and Wolkins conclusively decides that the appellant cannot rely on the fact that the standards of representation received were not equal to that of the competent lawyer."
e_2010skpc130.txt,"Defence sought an adjournment of a preliminary hearing to call a police accident reconstructionist as a witness. Prior to the commencement of the hearing, defence counsel was aware that the Crown did not intend to call this person as part of its case. One month prior to the preliminary hearing, defence counsel requested that the accident reconstructionist be made available as witness. The Crown advised defence that the officer was out of the country on peace keeping mission. The officer was expected back within months of the commencement of the preliminary hearing. HELD: The defence request for an adjournment was granted. The Court could not be satisfied that the officer was not a material witness to the preliminary inquiry. The Court was not satisfied that defence was guilty of neglect in failing to procure the officer's attendance when they had been advised by the Crown that he was out of the country. The length of the adjournment would not be lengthy.","The accused was charged with two counts of assault and one count of dangerous driving. The accused had come before the Court for preliminary inquiry on both charges. The Crown had called all of their witnesses on the preliminary inquiry, asked Defence Counsel if they had any witnesses to call on the adjournment date, and requested that they call Sergeant Barbar as a witness. Defence Counsel declined. HELD: The accused was granted an adjournment to allow Defence Counsel to make the necessary arrangements to call the Sergeant as a witnesses. The Defence was not satisfied that the Defence was guilty of neglect in procuring the attendance of Sergeant Barbar. The defence was not entitled to an additional adjournment. The Court was satisfied that there was a reasonable expectation that the Sergeant could be called as witness at the preliminary hearing. The adjournment was relatively short in duration and the defence had no authority to force the defence to call a particular witness at a preliminary inquiry."
e_2011skqb30.txt,"The parties had obtained an interim order in August 2010 and applied to vary the order pertaining to access and child support. HELD: 1) The Court declined to vary the interim access order and ordered the matter to trial. 2) The respondent is intentionally under-employed and the Court imputed annual income to him of $130,294 and child support was varied accordingly. Section 7 childcare expenses are to be shared pro rata. 3) The Court declined to order interim spousal support as the Court was not satisfied that the respondent had the existing ability to pay it. 4) The issues regarding retroactive child support, ongoing child support, access and spousal support were directed to pre-trial conference. 5) Costs of $1,500 were awarded to the petitioner and payable no later than May 31, 2011.","This is a review of the issues of parenting and support as directed by the interim order of August 18, 2010. HELD: The court declined to order interim child support since it was not satisfied that the respondent had the existing ability to pay it. The respondent must immediately obtain employment and work to his earning potential. The issues of the respondent's income and the petitioner's entitlement to spousal support were also adjourned for review. Costs were awarded to the petitioner, payable no later than May 31, 2011. Considering the existing means and needs of the parties, the Court declined to award retroactive child support. However, it is in the best interests of the children to change the interim access order made last August, either by restricting access or by enlarging it."
e_2014skpc35.txt,"The Crown found the accused not guilty. With respect to the issue of identification, it held that the officer was empowered by s. 209.1(2)(a) of The Traffic Safety Act to require an operator of a motor vehicle to provide his name and address. The accused had admitted that the statement given was voluntary. Although there had been no identification in Court, the officer had seen the accused operating a motor vehicle and had properly obtained his name and date of birth. That person was arrested and released on an appearance notice. Counsel for the accused appeared on the scheduled date and entered a guilty plea and then appeared on the trial date and the accused was noted as present. All of these facts constituted prima facie proof of identity. Regarding the other issues, the Court held that notice under s. 260(6) of the Code can be given to counsel of record without proof that counsel consented to the receipt of such notice. However, the Crown had not established that proper notice was given either to the accused or his counsel as required by s. 260(5), either by way of viva voce or affidavit evidence from the person effecting service or an admission of counsel. Without such compliance with s. 260(6), the certificate was not admissible in evidence. There was no other evidence of disqualification and no evidence as to the nature of the disqualification on which the Court could conclude that a s. 259 offence had been committed.","The accused was charged with driving while disqualified contrary to s. 259(4) of the Criminal Code. The evidence was straightforward and uncontradicted. The officer observed an individual operating a motor vehicle and properly obtained his name and date of birth. The accused was arrested and read his rights to counsel. The matter was scheduled for trial and the accused was released on an Appearance Notice. Although there was no identification of the accused in court, the officer was clearly empowered by s. 209.1(2)(a) of The Traffic Safety Act to require the operator of a vehicle to provide his name, address and phone number. The Certificate of Disqualification or Prohibition was not admissible in evidence. The Court found that the accused admitted knowledge of his disqualification and that the person who was named on the Appearance Notice was the same person who had stood trial. The Crown failed to establish the accused's identity and the Court was found not guilty. The certificate was never tender to the accused and the Crown could not rely on its own process to establish identity. The court found that although the accused acknowledged receiving the notice and that he knew that he was prohibited from driving, there is no prima facie proof of identity and no basis from which the Court can conclude that a s 259 offence had been committed as opposed to a violation of the Traffic safety Act."
e_2017skqb99.txt,"HELD: The application was allowed in part and the balance of images found on the computer were excluded from the evidence at trial pursuant to s. 24(2) of the Charter. The court found that the evidence found through temporary Internet sites was admissible. The reason for obtaining the warrant was apparently abandoned by the police at the beginning of the search of the computer. The police had no authority to search the computer generally. They were only authorized to look at the Internet history. The search of the non-Internet history was a serious infringement of the accused’s s. 8 Charter right. The temporary files created as a result of the visits on the Internet was evidence of Internet history, and because of this connection, this evidence was not excluded.","The accused applied to exclude certain evidence discovered by the police during the execution of the search of his computer and cellular phone. The initial determination of whether there had been a violation of the accused's s. Charter rights occurred by the judgment of January 3, 2017. The issue of exclusion of evidence pursuant to s. 24(2) of the Charter was not determined at that time. HELD: The accused's application was dismissed. 1)The Court found that the accused had obtained a search warrant which authorized the search for and obtain, if available, evidence of child pornography. 2)There was no question but that the images of the complainant on his computer constituted child pornography and there was no request made in the warrant to search for that information. 3)The accused sought to exclude all of the images found on his laptop. In the alternative, the accused sought exclude those images not automatically cached by web browser during an internet search. The Court found the admission of the evidence was more likely to bring the administration of justice into disrepute."
