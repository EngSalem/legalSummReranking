1993canlii3174.txt,"This was an appeal from a decision varying the appellant's maintenance downwards. The parties had a traditional marriage, with the wife remaining at home and caring for their three children. Upon separation, they entered into a settlement agreement whereby maintenance was set al. $2000 monthly while the appellant remained in the matrimonial home. The agreement stipulated that the settlement was a full and final settlement on all corollary matters between the parties. The respondent subsequently remarried, underwent some difficult financial times and made the application which was the subject of this appeal. The appellant contended the terms of the agreement were final. Per Jones, J.A. and Chipman, J.A. (concurring for separate reasons), allowing the appeal and setting aside the lower court order, that while courts have ultimate jurisdiction in the matter of support, settlement agreements must be respected. There is no difference between an agreement which provides for long term maintenance and one that does not contain such a provision. The effect is to permanently settle the issue in both cases. To review the agreement, particularly after the lapse of a substantial period of time, could lead to grave injustices to one or both parties. Per Hallett, J.A., (dissenting), dismissing the appeal, that a settlement agreement which provides for periodic support payments indefinitely is very different than one which contains provisions for termination of support after a specified period. The causal connection test established in Pelech v. Pelech (1987), 38 D.L.R. (4th) 641, should not apply to payors of periodic support for an indefinite period. Such agreements do not have the degree of finality that was effected by the settlement agreement under consideration in the Pelech decision.","This was an appeal from a decision of Hall, L.J.S.C. which reduced the appellant's support from $2,000 to $1200 per month. HELD: The appeal was allowed without costs. The court found that the causal connection test established in Pelech should not apply in cases where payor spouse seeks a reduction of a consensual support obligation. There was truly finality to the financial relationship between the parties. The Court found that where the parties negotiated a final separation agreement incorporating maintenance provisions but also property distribution and the terms of that agreement are reflected in subsequent court orders, only a radical change in circumstances would allow for a review of that court order dealing with on-going maintenance."

The Court of Appeal had ordered the Crown to produce an itemized inventory of the information in its possession to enable the Queen's Bench to review the information the Crown should disclose to the defence. This fiat concerned several documents. The Crown had already disclosed the contents of each of these documents and the only matter remaining in issue was the name of the lawyer who released the information. This arose as a result of the action of a Regina lawyer who had improperly revealed information from two of his divorce clients with respect to the charges against LaPorte et al. The Crown quite properly disclosed these statements which had been conveyed to the investigating officer. HELD: It was not necessary to reveal the name of the solicitor and, therefore, unless the Crown intended to call the informant solicitor as a witness, his name was not to be disclosed.","FIAT. The only matters reserved were MMM, NNN, OOO, PPP, number and number 10. The Crown had already disclosed the contents of each of these blocks and the only matter remaining in issue was the name of the lawyer who released the information. HELD: 1)The privilege applies only to the client and his solicitor. It does not extend to third party who learns of the communication. The information already disclosed is to some extent hearsay and is only marginally relevant. 2)It is not necessary to reveal the solicitor and, unless the Crown intends to call him as a witness, his name is not to be disclosed."

Both the respondent and the appellant's employer were employers under the Workers' Compensation Act. The appellant received benefits under the act. She commenced the action against the respondent with the consent of the Workers' Compensation Board. The trial judge held the action barred pursuant to the act. Dismissing the appeal, that s. 18 of the Act bars actions against any employer to which Part I of the Act applies. It is not necessary that the employer be the appellant's employer.","This was an appeal from a decision of the Supreme Court which held that the action by the appellant was barred by s. 18 of the Workers' Compensation Act.

1994canlii4195.txt,"The defendants applied at the opening of the trial for dismissal alleging the plaintiffs had been misleading and had deliberately failed to disclose important information. Dismissing the application, that while the plaintiffs had failed to comply with Civil Procedure Rule 20.07, dismissal of the action was not warranted. The plaintiff was held liable for solicitor-client costs associated with the application and discoveries.","The plaintiff sought dismissal of the action pursuant to Rule 20.09 of the Civil Procedure Rules. The plaintiff alleged that the defendant had deprived its interest in a fishing vessel, Sealife III, and the contribution to overhead and profit margin which that vessel would have made to the plaintiff's seafood plant by its landings. The defendant argued that the weight of the fish received at the plant was not relevant to the calculation of compensation. HELD: The application was dismissed. The court found that the plaintiff had failed to make reasonable effort to produce documents and to give full discovery to the defendant. It was also found that there was a set of scribblers in which the defendant employees kept record of the number of fish they would have received. The discovery evidence showed that there were no records of the actual weight of fish received. This evidence crystallized the dichotomy between the parties as to the methods to be used in calculating damages."
1994canlii4661.txt,"A young offender was sentenced to 1 year closed custody on each of 2 armed robberies, the sentences to be consecutive to each other, but both being concurrent to the remainder of a sentence of 2 years closed custody which was already being served with respect to previous unrelated convictions when the accused escaped and committed the robberies. 18 months of the previous sentence remained to be served with the result that the total time in custody would only be increased by 6 months as a result of the 2 robbery convictions. The Crown appealed. HELD: Appeal allowed. The sentence neither reflected the seriousness of the offences nor provided adequate deterrence. The 2 new sentences totalling 2 years were made consecutive to the remaining term of 18 months as well as to each other.","This was an appeal by the Crown against a sentence imposed upon the respondent, a young offender as a result of his having committed two armed robberies. The two terms of closed custody, having been ordered to be served concurrently with the remainder of the previous term, did not constitute a fit sentence having regard for the seriousness of the offenses, the need for deterrence and the need to uphold public confidence in the administration of justice."
1996canlii6900.txt,"A decree nisi and an order granting custody to the mother was made in 1995. Upon appeal the Court of Appeal directed a new trial. Changes in circumstances included the fact that the child was developmentally delayed and required a special program. A pediatrician testified that inconsistency in parenting approaches would further delay the child's development. HELD: Custody was awarded to the father. 1)Each parent was a capable caregiver. However, the father was available to provide full-time care due to an employment disability and exhibited a strong desire to do so. The past physical abuse of his former spouse was not considered relevant as it did not affect his ability to parent the child. 2)The mother was to have weekly access on two non-consecutive days for eight hours and two hours on a third day. The child was to sleep in the same bed every night.","The parties met in British Columbia in 1991 and began living together in August 1991. During this time they engaged in the consumption of alcohol and used prohibited substances. Their relationship was not always harmonious. The parties moved to Saskatoon in 1993 and both parents immediately participated in her care and nurture. In 1994, they arrived at an agreement where each would have Sophie for four days intervals. Tracy breached the arrangement whereupon the matter of interim custody and access came before the Court of Appeal directed a new trial. HELD: 1)Because of his employment disability, he remains available to provide full-time care for Sophie and exhibits a very strong desire to do so.  2)Each parent is a capable caregiver. Both petitions were heard in 1995 and resulted in a decree nisi of divorce and an order granting Tracy custody of Sophie. Unfortunately, Sophie's special needs currently require that she be under the direction and in the care of one parent during alternative weeks. The custody order was granted in August 1994 and the custody order came before this Court. 3)The Court has consistently applied the principles outlined by Lord Simonds in McKee v. McKee. While parental conduct is of importance, ss.1(9) of the Act provides that the Court is only to take into consideration such conduct to the extent that it is relevant to the ability of a parent to act as a parent. Each parent is capable of providing additional teaching and intervention. 4)Although the past physical abuse of Tracy by Lorne is not acceptable, it is only relevant in the instant case if it affects his ability to parent Sophie."
1997canlii11078.txt,"The applicant sought to be appointed as property guardian for his uncle pursuant to s19 of the Dependent Adults Act. The proposed dependent adult resisted the application and attributed his previous difficulty managing his affairs to a severe drinking problem but indicated that he had not been drinking for six years. The uncle had never been declared incompetent to manage his affairs. He voluntarily transferred the land left to him by his father and had allowed the trust arrangement to continue since 1951. Over the years, the land was transferred from the original trustees to various other family members and was presently registered in the name of the applicant nephew. There was no dispute that the uncle was the beneficial owner.HELD: The land was vested directly in the name of Selwyn Hand. The conditional stay in place pending the resolution of this application for the appointment of a property guardian was lifted. 1)The proposed dependent adult was capable of managing a significant portion of his business affairs and matters relating to his estate and property. However he required significant independent assistance in the management of the land held for his benefit. His suggestions and proposal to sell the land and travel were reasonable and financially modest. 2)The criteria set forth in s18 for the appointment of a property guardian was met and the Public Trustee was appointed to administer the balance of the proceeds from the land sale remaining after the uncle pursued his financial commitments and his dreams.  3)Costs in the amount of $7,000 were to be paid to the applicant in the event the uncle chose to sell his land. 4)Any proposed sale would be subject to the approval of the Court upon application of Hand. One half of the proceeds were to be provided directly to Hand to be dealt with as he chooses and the remaining half were to be administered by the Public Trustee in his longer term best interests according to the normal powers and procedures of that office.","The applicant sought the appointment of a property guardian pursuant to s. 19 of The Dependent Adults Act. The applicant was a 76 year old gentleman who lived in the Biggar area of Saskatchewan and in 1994 moved to Estevan, where he established a relationship with the applicant's nephew. HELD: The application was granted. 1)The applicant met the criteria set forth in s. 18 for appointment as property guardian. 2)The application was in the best interests of the applicant. 3)The court found that the applicant was capable of managing some of his affairs. 4)The Court ordered that the land should firstly be vested directly in the name of Selwyn Hand. The court ordered that some of the proceeds from the land sale should be placed directly into his control to pursue his financial commitments and his day-to-day activities. The Public Trustee was to be his property guardian in the longer term best interests."
1998canlii13596.txt,"Administrative Law - Judicial Review - Bias/Institutional BiasAdministrative Law - Medical Care Insurance - Medical Fees - Repayment - AppealProfessions and Occupations - Physicians and Surgeons - Cardiologist - Medical Fees_____ A cardiologist appealed an order made against him by the Joint Medical Professional Review Committee for repayment of  $207,821.03 in medical fees he received over a fifteen month period from the Medical Care Insurance Branch (MCIB). Alleged errors of law included improperly placing the burden of proof on the doctor; failing to take into account all relevant factors including the doctor's statistical analysis; considering it beyond his mandate to provide cost effective services in keeping patients out of the hospital; by using and relying on the knowledge of the Committee in preference to the expert evidence; the orders made concerning various medical services were not reasonably supported by the evidence. The numerous grounds of appeal also included breach of the rules of natural justice by reason of a lack of institutional independence. The application under Part 52 of the Rules of Court for a judicial review was brought to determine whether there was a reasonable apprehension of bias raised by the statutory roles of the Committee and Director or lack of institutional impartiality of the Committee or its lack of independence from the Director or MCIB. _____ HELD: The judicial review application was dismissed. The appeal was allowed and the repayment orders were set aside except for the orders respecting surcharges. 1)Natural justice issues: A reasonable apprehension of bias or institutional bias were not proven. The Committee provided adequate written reasons for its decision. The chairman refuted the allegations that the Committee heard and relied on evidence outside the presence the appellant about which he was not advised. Neither the Director nor the Committee acted in a prosecutorial fashion. Examples included the adjournment granted when the appellant failed to attend and the concession to his request that no cardiologist be placed on the Committee. 2)Errors of law issues: The statistical evidence could be considered by the Committee as a prima facie case. It was then open for it to call on the doctor to rebut the presumed departure from an acceptable pattern of medical practice. This did not shift the overall burden of proof to the doctor nor did it require him to prove his pattern of medical practice was acceptable to the Committee. The Committee did not err in law in misconstruing its mandate or by ignoring the statistical analysis presented by the appellant whose definition of the mandate was much narrower than envisaged by the legislation. It was not agreed that the Committee is not bound to follow the rules of evidence and the proceedings were of an investigative nature. The phrase 'balance of probabilities' means 'more likely than not'. To hold otherwise would make nonsense of administrative law and would violate the rules of natural justice. The distinction between the pattern of the doctor's billings and the pattern of his medical practice was more a matter of semantics than substance. If economics were the only consideration the review process would be a useless exercise and the statistical comparative evidence would be conclusive of the issue. There was no credible evidence that the members of  the Committee misused their expertise and relied on it rather than determining the issues from the evidence presented. 3)The appellant established that for the most part the decision of the Committee was not reasonably supported by but was contrary to the evidence. The MCIB statistics were flawed as a reliable comparison tool and the appellant's adjusted statistics were more reliable even if based on estimates rather than substantiated data. The appellant's medical practice was unique in three respects. He did not have hospital privileges and  had staff and diagnostic equipment equivalent to a cardiac care unit in the hospital; he ordered more diagnostic tests and did more follow up than other cardiologists and had extended office hours. 4)The decision of the Committee was varied to quash all repayment orders except for $14,239.76. The appellant admitted that many of the surcharges had been billed because of his erroneous interpretation of the tariff.  5)Leave was granted to bring the issue of costs back for determination if necessary.","The cardiologist appeals an order made against him by the Joint Medical Professional Review Committee that he repay $207,821.03 in medical fees he received over a fifteen month period from the Medical Care Insurance Branch. HELD: The appeal is brought under s. 49.21(1) of The Saskatchewan Medical Care insurance Act. The Committee made the following errors: 1) improperly placing the burden of proof on the cardiologist; 2) failing to take into account all relevant factors in the assessment of the cardiologists' competency; 3) Ignoring the statistical analysis presented by the Committee that was more reliable than thestatistical analysis presented; 4) Using and relying on the knowledge of the Committee's members in preference to the uncontroverted expert evidence.  5) There was a reasonable apprehension of institutional bias raised by the committee's involvement in the hearing.  6) The Committee failed to provide adequate reasons for its decision to award the award. The Court was left with no personal income once he paid for the operating costs of his clinic."
1998canlii13992.txt,"The plaintiff's residence, a mobile home, was totally destroyed by fire in 1996. The insure denied liability on the policy alleging the plaintiff deliberately started the fire or caused it to be started. HELD: The plaintiff's claim was dismissed. 1)When the evidence of the three independant witnesses was considered, the defendant insurer met the onus referred to Grover Holdings and established that the fire was deliberately set. While there was no direct evidence to establish the plaintiff set the fire himself, the inference was drawn that he did or, in the alternative, caused someone else to do so.  2)Had the plaintiff been in the mobile home he should have been suffering to some degree from carbon monoxide poisoning, he should have been coughing, his hair should have been singed, he would have had soot on his face and his clothes would have smelled of smoke. 3)The plaintiff did not call evidence to rebut the fire investigator's opinion that a significant quantity of fire accelerant had been used nor was his brother called to confirm his testimony that he attempted to re-enter the mobile home after arranging for the fire department to be called.","The plaintiff's residence, mobile home and contents were insured with the defendant who had denied liability on the policy alleging that the plaintiff intentionally started the fire or caused it to be started. HELD: The defendant had met the onus referred to in the Grover Holding case and established that the fire was deliberately set. While there is no direct evidence to establish that the defendant set the fire himself, the smoke detector buzzed a few times and the plaintiff found the home already to be in flames and rushed to his grandparents' house to have them call the fire department. The plaintiff did not call evidence to rebut Mr. Heyerhoff's opinion nor was the brother called to confirm the plaintiff's testimony that he attempted to re- enter the mobile home after arranging for a fire department to be called. When the defendant called several witnesses, found their evidence to be suspect and their testimony has played no part in this decision. The more unlikely or improbable the allegation required to be proved, the more cogent is the evidence required to overcome the unlikelihood or improbability."
1998canlii3382.txt,"The appellant employer and the respondent union are parties to a collective agreement with effect from January 1, 1994 to December 31, 1996. The collective agreement established employee salaries for that period, with annual adjustments on January 1st of each year. Shortly before the agreement was signed, the Public Sector Compensation Act was passed, which rolled back and froze public sector salaries. In a letter to the union, the employer confirmed the wage increases provided for in the agreement would be paid to the employees as a lump sum following the expiration of the legislated wage freeze. After the expiration of the wage freeze, however, the employer refused to pay the lump sum on the grounds that it would contravene the Act. The union sued the employer in the Supreme Court, claiming the lump sum or, in the alternative, damages for negligent misrepresentation. The employer applied to strike the Statement of Claim on the grounds that the union's claims were within the exclusive jurisdiction of an arbitrator. The Chambers judge dismissed the application. The employer appealed. Allowing the appeal and staying the action pending submission to arbitration as provided for in the collective agreement, that the Chambers judge erred in allowing the action to continue. Where there is a doubt about the arbitrability of a dispute, that issue should generally be determined at arbitration. This reflects the central role of arbitration in collective bargaining labour relations, recognizes that arbitration is the forum best suited to conducting the necessary inquiry, and helps ensure that no one, absent sound reasons, will be left with rights but no effective remedy.","The appellant was an employer and the respondent union. By successorship, they are parties to a collective agreement signed in 1994 with effect from January 1, 1994 to December 31, 1996. The collective agreement establishes employee salaries for that period, with annual adjustments to January in each year. The employer sought to strike the respondent's statement of claim on the ground that the union's claims were within the exclusive jurisdiction of an arbitrator. The respondent appealed, seeking leave for this purpose. HELD: Appeal allowed. 1)There is an issue of whether the letter of July 22, 1994 is an ancillary document. There are four considerations that support the conclusion that, where there is doubt about the arbitrability of the dispute, that issue should generally be determined initially at arbitration. 2)The collective agreement does not set out the parties' rights exhaustively, and therefore exclude, court jurisdiction in all situations. The pre-eminent role of the arbitration process is not simply a product of particular provisions, but is central aspect of the overall scheme of collective bargaining labour relations. 3)There are several factual questions relevant to that issue which could not be explored on an application under Rule 14.25. 4)The arbitrator's power, granted in the collective agreement and confirmed by the Act, to determine whether a matter submitted to arbitration is arbitrable, that is, whether it is a difference concerning the interpretation, application and administration of the collective agreements. This is an important issue that the Court must be able to resolve."
1999skqb142.txt,"FIAT. The former registered representative of TFPG was terminated for selling unapproved investments in breach of a Shareholder Advisor Agreement which permitted the sale of TFPG's financial products and services only. TFPG sought an interim mandatory injunction requiring the respondent to return all materials and files respecting TFPG's clients, to cease any contact with its clients, and to make no attempt to solicit any current or prospective client. HELD: The respondent was ordered to immediately cease all contact with TFPG clients whose account the respondent, or anyone associated with him, had administered with a view to soliciting or directing a client, affiliate or associate away from TFPG. The restriction would not prevent a client or prospective client from engaging in any business with the respondent nor was he prevented from advertising his services. 1)It was agreed that the respondent should return all of TFPG's files and materials with a right to make and keep a copy.  2)TFPG abandoned the relief sought respecting solicitation of any business of any nature similar to that of TFPG from any TFPG client or prospective client. 3)The agreement merely set out the terms both parties agreed to for valuable consideration. It was not unconscionable nor against public policy. The respondent had warranted that he had an opportunity to seek independent legal advice prior to signing the agreement. The applicant met the test for injunctive relief but the relief as set out in the draft order was too restrictive and denied others freedom of choice as to which party they wished to deal with. 4)A contractual right to injunctive relief is only one factor. The applicant must establish that the right to interlocutory injunction is clear; there is a serious question to be tried and a strong prima facie case; that irreparable harm will result; if there is a doubt as to whether there is an adequate remedy in damages there must be a determination, on a balance of convenience, which party is likely to suffer a greater harm.","FIAT.

She also stated that just prior to this she was awakened by the feeling of someone touching her vagina. The accused was charged with sexual assault and sexual touching of the complainant., accused found not guilty; the complainant's testimony was internally inconsistent and her cross-examination revealed obvious errors which were never corrected to rehabilitate her credit. The evidence was more impressionistic than probative of the facts alleged and the accused's evidence raised reasonable doubts in the court's mind.","HELD: The Court found the accused not guilty as charged and the Court entered acquittals on the record. The Court held that when the complainant was asleep, she felt something inside her pyjamas, about her vaginal area, like someone touching her. However, the evidence was more impressionistic than probative of the facts alleged and it was reasonable to conclude that the complainant would not be conscious of her immediate surroundings. When asleep, the Court found that the accused's testimony was in harmony with the preponderance of the probabilities which a rational and informed person would readily recognize as reasonable."
2003skqb248.txt,"An appeal from conviction and sentence for theft of an electricity generator valued at under $5,000 contrary to Criminal Code s.334(b). On the first appearance in October, 2001, the Crown advised it would proceed by summary conviction. The appellant pled not guilty. Defence argued that, in the absence of evidence to the contrary, it should be inferred that the accused acquiesced or implicitly consented to proceeding by way of summary conviction. Counsel agreed pursuant to s.786(2) to proceed by way of summary conviction and invited the court to treat the agreement as having been in place when the trial began. Both preferred the appeal to be heard in this Court or in the Court of Appeal. The appellant sought to have the conviction set aside on the grounds the verdict was unreasonable and not supported by the evidence; the trial judge failed to properly apply the doctrine of recent possession and did not provide adequate reasons for his decision. HELD: The conviction appeal was dismissed.  1)This Court had jurisdiction to entertain the appeal. The Provincial Court judge had jurisdiction as the trial proceedings did not violate s.786(2). 2)The trial judge did not misconstrue nor misapplied the doctrine of recent possession. The unexplained recent possession of stolen goods standing alone will permit, but not necessarily require, an inference that the possessor was the person who stole the goods. The elements of recent possession must be strictly proven if possession is the only evidence connecting the accused with the theft. Otherwise possession should be considered circumstantial evidence and weighed accordingly. There was no palpable and manifest or overriding error made by the trial judge in weighing the evidence.  3)Criminal Code s.687 appears to permit this Court to set aside the 9 month suspended sentence and to grant a conditional or absolute discharge. However, there was no transcript of the sentencing proceedings except for a few lines. If the transcript is not available, this Court may be reconvened to address the applicability of s.687 and whether it would be appropriate to vacate the sentence and embark on the sentencing process afresh.","This is an appeal from conviction on February 6, 2002 by judge of the Provincial Court sitting at Watrous and from the sentence imposed on March 11, 2002 on the charge of theft where the value of what is alleged to have been stolen does not exceed $5,000. The Crown may in accordance with s. 334 of the Code proceed on indictment or by way of summary conviction. HELD: The appeal is dismissed.  1)There is no transcript of the sentencing proceedings except for a couple of lines and without being able to examine the sentencing judge's reasons it is as contended on behalf of the appellant that the conviction was not supported by the evidence and could not be supported without application of the doctrine of recent possession. 2)The sentence imposed by the trial judge is not unreasonable."
2005nsca64.txt,"The chambers judge refused to grant an adoption to a single mother of her own daughter as he determined that the child would not gain anything vis a vis the mother by such an adoption but would lose the potential for a relationship and support from her father. The evidence before the chambers judge was meagre but showed that the father had not seen the child for the past four years. The mother appealed., appeal dismissed; the chambers judge focused on the best interests of the child and did not fail to give appropriate consideration to the factors set out in the Act. He did not place too much emphasis on the child's loss of a potential relationship with and support from the father on the facts of this case.","The single mother appealed the November 2004 decision of the Children and Family Services Court refusing to grant her the adoption she sought with respect to her four year old daughter. The mother argued that the Court erred in failing to give adequate consideration to the factors he was required to consider, and by placing too much emphasis on irrelevant factors, in his determination of whether it was in the best interests of the child that the adoption be granted. The chambers judge refused to grant the adoption on the basis that it was not in the child's best interests to do so even though he found all of the technical requirements for the adoption had been complied with. It is not known if the child has lived with the father or anyone else or if there is contact between the child and the extended families of either parent. The father was not notified of the adoption application and has not consented. The only evidence before the chambers judge was the usual documentation provided to court with an application for an uncontested adoption."
2006skqb189.txt,"FIAT: The issues on this application are with respect to extraordinary expenses and the quantum of spousal support. HELD: 1) The petitioner's income is $73,000 versus $29,000 for the respondent. The parties cannot agree if any of the expenses fall into s. 7 of the Guidelines as being extraordinary: $975 for child care, $500 for dance, $350 for school activities, and $1,140 for asthma medication. 2) The court does not believe that the 'reasonable coverage' definition contained in the May 1, 2006 amendment is new law. At best, it is a single test now enunciated in legislative form which should provide for more consistency and predictability as opposed to the many attempts to articulate a definition of extraordinary which is found in the case law. What items claimed are necessary to attain the child's best interests and yet are reasonable given the economic circumstances of the child and her parents? Which items might be reasonably covered by the sum of the parent's income plus child support? 2) The child care costs and asthma medication costs are of sufficient amount and peculiar to this child as to be extraordinary or not expected to be reasonably covered from the table amount of child support and the respondent's income.  3) With respect to spousal support, neither counsel referred to the spousal support guidelines and the formula for spouses with children which measures the difference between the individual net disposable incomes of each former spouse. These guidelines suggest that an award of between 40% to 46% of that difference in individual net disposable income be paid by the spouse with the higher INDI to the former spouse with the lower INDI. These guidelines create a rough ballpark of $900 to $1,100 per month in this particular case. However, the petitioner is bearing the full responsibility for family debt repayment in the interim. In order to pay creditors in a timely fashion, the petitioner has taken this responsibility onto his shoulders. In the circumstances, it is ordered that the petitioner pay to the respondent interim spousal support of $700. The consequent reduction of family debt is therefore a factor of this particular interim spousal support order and should not cause confusion when addressing any property issue in the future.","FIAT: The respondent moves for an order granting to her, (1) joint custody and primary care (residence) of her daughter, d.o.b. with access to her former spouse. The parties agreed that the established status quo of shared parenting shall also be included in this order. The respondent is bearing the full responsibility for family debt repayment in the interim. The childcare costs and asthma medication costs are of sufficient amount and peculiar to the daughter as to be extraordinary or not expected to be reasonably covered from the table amount of child support and the respondent's income. The consequent reduction of family debt is a factor of this particular interim spousal support order and should not cause confusion when addressing any property issues in the future. The petitioner shall pay to the respondent 71% of those costs which is monthly sum of $125. In the likely event that the petitioner's health plan covers the residual cost of Keandra's asthma medication not paid for by the respondent, the petitioner shall bear 71% interest. HELD: The Court ordered the respondent to pay interim child support of $700 per month commencing April 1, 2006 and on the first day of each month hereafter until further order."

In those cases, the Court does not ask itself whether the results have been skewed, but rather has the organization acted in good faith and generally in accord with the concepts of natural justice? This does not mean that there must be an exacting legal process or an application of the full 'panoply' of procedural natural justice issues. The question is has the organization acted in a fashion that meets the legitimate expectations of a fair-minded observer? 2) No reasonable observer could conclude that the USC approached the post-vote process in good faith or in a fashion that is in harmony with the broad rules of natural justice. When faced with a result (rendered by a procedure which it had specifically established for the referendum) which was not consistent with its wishes, the USC simply ignored its own rules and imposed its own preordained outcome. Accordingly, the Court concluded that the USC breached its obligation to act in good faith and conducted itself in a fashion inconsistent with natural justice. The applicant is entitled to a portion of the relief he seeks. The referendum held by the USSU on the issue of whether it should join the CFS is of no force or effect.","FIAT The applicant applies under The Non-Profit Corporations Act, 1995, the net result of which would set aside the outcome of the referendum. HELD: 1) An order pursuant to s. 135(2)(b) of the Act seeking an order declaring the referendum to be of no force or effect.  2) In October 2005, a referendum was held within the student body of the University of Saskatchewan to determine if the university should join the Canadian Federation of Students and its related corporation, Students-Services. The result favoured joining the federation. It would be counterintuitive not to add CFS as a party to the application. 3) The applicant has another barrier which he cannot clear. To read the word 'election' in the section as anything other than referring to the election of director or auditor requires interpretive contortions beyond my ability. 4) There were inevitable applications by all the parties applying to strike portions of affidavits submitted on behalf of others because they were scandalous, argumentative or irrelevant. 5) The respondents also referred to Leroux v. Molgat, 1985 CanLII 229 (BC SC), [1985] B.C. SCC, [1986] BC SC, [1988 BC SC] where Justice McLachlin (as she then was) summarized the relevant legal principles with respect to the setting aside of the results of an election at para. 3: An election will be set aside only if substantial irregularity, calculated to affect the result, is established. This is somewhat anomalous as the USSU, as long-standing organization, had its own rules and procedures for referenda. The existence of two protocols for a referenda would prove to be an issue as events unfolded. The onus is on the party seeking the right to cross-examine to show the examination will assist in resolving the issue before the chambers judge. It is clear from the material that the debate was lively and active, at least from September 19 forward. The relief available to the applicant under s. 225 addresses an application by a complainant. The complainant is defined in s. 222 and can be former director. However, it is common ground, by all, that the applicant is former director of a security corporation. The fact that the ballot lacked reference to the requirement of an annual fee is part of the onus of establishing a proper referenda procedure of the corporation. In this jurisdiction such relief is discretionary. The court must first determine what approach it should take in the context of overturning a vote"
2006skqb536.txt,"The primary issue is whether the plaintiff, the owner of certain farm equipment consigned for sale at unreserved auction, has indirectly allowed another individual to bid on its behalf, or for its own benefit. The plaintiff corporation agreed to sell its entire inventory of farm equipment at unreserved auction for a guaranteed return of $577,500. The guarantee was given by the defendant corporate auctioneers (Ritchie). The auction was to be conducted by the defendant corporate auctioneers (LeBlanc), a newly formed division of Ritchie. After the auction sale was concluded, the defendant refused to pay the plaintiff the guaranteed price. The defendant declared the guarantee unenforceable under provisions of the 'Contract to Auction' and ultimately charged the plaintiff a commission of 14% on the gross proceeds. The defendant alleges that the plaintiff indirectly allowed another individual to bid on its behalf or for its own benefit. HELD: 1) Clause 3.07 of the Contract to Auction prohibits an owner from bidding directly or indirectly, and from allowing any other person to bid on his behalf. The issue here is whether the plaintiff allowed a family member to bid for the plaintiff's benefit. A family member can be a bona fide purchaser as well as anyone else, but the nature of an unreserved auction dictate that such relationships be disclosed to the public. The essence of the problem and the underlying purpose behind clause 3.07 is to protect bona fide bidders, and to ensure that there be no surreptitious bidding by another for the owner's benefit. 2) The plaintiff allowed Mr. Caruk to bid at the sale for the plaintiff's benefit. It went beyond the passive act of allowing him to bid. It actively facilitated bidding. Mr. Caruk acknowledged he had no money to buy equipment. The plaintiff lent him up to $100,000 for that express purpose. It is immaterial that the loan came from Mr. Tkachuk personally rather than from the plaintiff company he controls and directs. The plaintiff corporation benefited. It has leased all its cattle to Mr. Caruk and the equipment will be of significant value to the fulfillment of that contract. 'For the benefit of the owner' does not have to mean for the exclusive benefit of the owner. 3) The undisclosed arrangement between Mr. Tkatchuk and Mr. Caruk gave the nephew a significant advantage at auction. That advantage was magnified by the fact that he possessed insider information. He knew his uncle had a guaranteed price from Ritchie's for the equipment, because that information had been imparted to him by his uncle. All one needs to add is that Mr. Tkachuk would have profited very significantly had his arrangement with the nephew gone undiscovered. He would have secured a guaranteed price, while procuring the commercial advantages of having his cattle lease fulfilled using equipment the nephew could not otherwise have afforded to purchase. 4) In an area such as this where bona fides are of fundamental importance, and particularly where an owner has the advantage of a guaranteed price from the auctioneer, a deliberate non-disclosure of material information can have an impact every bit as significant as a deliberate and obvious misrepresentation. The plaintiff should have disclosed the arrangement with Mr. Caruk to the defendants. In not doing so, and in allowing and enabling Mr. Caruk to bid at the auction, the plaintiff breached clause 3.07.  5) The provision for a 14% commission on the gross proceeds of sale as a consequence of breach of a fundamental term of the contract is not extravagant or unconscionable and, as the defendants pointed out, they did not elect to exercise their conjunctive right in clause 4.05 to additional amounts as liquidated damages. The concluding paragraph would have entitled them, in addition to all other rights and remedies, to re-sell the property acquired by Mr. Caruk and to retain an amount equal to 20% of the proceeds realized. The provision for a 14% commission on the gross proceeds of sale does not constitute a penalty. 6) The defendants' claim solicitor and client costs pursuant to clause 4.03 of the contract. The defendants are prima facie entitled to costs on a solicitor and client basis, but in the circumstances there are issues whether they should be restricted to one set of costs, and other issues relating to appropriate quantum. The issue of costs will be assessed by this Court pursuant to Rule 565, with the defendants serving and filing a draft bill in the form required for a solicitor and client bill, an affidavit of disbursements, and written argument. The plaintiff shall have 14 days to reply. 7) The plaintiff will have a judgment against the defendants in the amount of $1,316.64 representing the power washing bill wrongfully deducted from the auction sale proceeds payable to the plaintiff. In all other respects, the plaintiff's action is dismissed with costs.","The plaintiff agreed to sell its entire inventory of farm equipment at an unreserved auction for a guaranteed return of $577,500. The guarantee was supplied by Ritchie Bros. Auctioneers (Canada) Ltd. The auction was to be conducted by LeBlanc Auction Services Ltd. and the plaintiff was to receive the first deliveries of cattle from the plaintiff. HELD: 1) While a number of issues require exploration in the present case, the preeminent question is whether the plaintiff, the owner of certain farm equipment consigned for sale at unreserved auctions, has indirectly allowed another individual to bid on its behalf, or for its own benefit. 2) In the early stages of the auction, the contractual negotiations between the plaintiff and the defendants generated two standard form agreements, preliminary 'LeBlanc' contract dated December 23, 2003 and subsequent 'Ritchie Bros.' contract dated March 28, 2004. After the auction sale was concluded, the defendants refused to pay the plaintiff the guaranteed price. The plaintiff declared its guarantee unenforceable under provisions of the Contract to Auction and charged the defendant a commission of 14% on the gross proceeds of sale. 3) The plaintiff was not aware of the contractual provisions in the contract, nor did he know that the guarantee was only available to the highest bidder. He was unaware that it was available to anyone else. 4) While there are some issues of breach of contract that need to be considered, none of them are central to the final analysis of this case. The issues in this case have much to do with the unique nature of 'unreserved auctions', where goods are sold to a highest bidder and the owner is precluded from affecting sale prices either by the use of reserve bids or through involvement, directly or indirectly in the bidding process. An open and level playing field is critical to the integrity of an unreserve auction. An honest honest person would not be expected to take a position that he was inescapably bound to contract with the defendants at any point in time. It might be inferred from this course of conduct that Mr. Tkachuk was continuing to explore more lucrative opportunities after December 2003, notwithstanding his assertion that the entire contract between the parties was formed on December 23. The defendant's justification for proceeding in that fashion is that the plaintiff had actually been paid in full, in that Ritchie's had included the full sale price of the plaintiff's equipment when it calculated its gross proceeds at auction, less 14% commission under clause 4.05."
2008nssc310.txt,"Despite the court's finding of no clear winner and that both parties had contributed to the circumstances that led to the trial, the plaintiff sought costs on the basis that the defendant had refused its offer to settle. Each party will bear their own costs; the court had no confidence that any offer made by either party, short of 100 per cent vindication, could have resolved the case in advance of trial.","This was one of those cases where there was no clear winner. Both parties contributed to the length of the trial, the complexities of the issues and the attitude of the parties leading up to, and during, the trial. The plaintiff felt greater entitlement to costs generally and double costs after trial. HELD: The Court held that it would not award costs and the parties would bear their own costs. 1) Rule 41A offers when assessing costs post trial. This includes disbursements and pre-judgment interest. 2) The Court reviewed the factors that led to the delay in the trial and found that both parties contributed significantly. The Court found that the plaintiff contributed to length of trial, complexities of issues and attitude of both parties leading to and during the trial; however, it would be impossible to conclude that one was more successful that the other."
2008skqb146.txt,"FIAT: The parties have three children, Jill born December 1981, Luke born May 1986 and Keegan born November 1989. The respondent states that he has paid child support pursuant to the court order of February 2000 but, when the children reached the age of majority, he reduced the amount of child support payable as the children became independent and moved out on their own. The petitioner takes issue with the respondent's unilateral reduction in child support and submits the children remained children within the meaning of the Divorce Act so long as they were attending university. The parties agree that given the age of the children there has been a change in circumstance sufficient to allow a review of the existing child support order. HELD: 1) The parties agree that Jill, age 26 is no longer a child of the marriage and that Luke, age 21 is not presently a child of the marriage but could once again become a child of the marriage if he attends university in the fall of 2008. The parties also agree Keegan is 18 and remains a child of the marriage by virtue of the fact that he is taking classes at the university. 2) While the respondent asks that he be allowed to pay child support directly to the children, there is nothing in the material filed which would indicate that the petitioner is not providing support to the child in an appropriate fashion. Further, the difficulties that would arise in respect to enforcement of the order if the child support payments were not made directly to the petitioner would mitigate against such a variation.","FIAT The parties filed an application for an order varying child support. The parties agreed that given the age of the children and the change in the amount of support they were receiving, that there had been a change in circumstances sufficient to allow a review of the existing child support order. HELD: 1) An order eliminating the applicant's child support arrears as at the time of the application.  2) In this case, the parties agree the applicant is no longer a child of the marriage within the meaning of the Divorce Act. The difficulties that could arise in respect to enforcement of the order if the child support payments were not made directly to the applicant would mitigate against such a variation. 3) The parties agree that given their age, the children's income, their current employment situation and the fact that they are attending university and working part-time, the Court has found that the Guideline amounts payable by the applicant for the support of the two children are $380 per month plus 33% of all s. expenses. 4) The Court of Appeal suggested a three-step process in dealing with support orders for children who have reached the age where support automatically terminates. Each case must be considered on its own facts. The guiding principle is reasonableness. It is well-settled that full time attendance in a post-secondary education program may result in a child over a majority qualifying as a child within the Meaning of the Act. However, this is not the case in this case. The court will remain financially responsible for a bona fide adult student until the child has obtained a degree or certificate that equips him or her for entry level employment in an appropriate field within a reasonable period of time. The length of time, level of education or number of degrees required to be supported by the parent will vary depending on the circumstances of each case. 5) As the sum of $500 per month has been paid in the interim pursuant to my order of December 17, 2007, any such payments made shall be applied firstly towards the ongoing child support for Keegan and then towards the arrear."

HELD: The plaintiff will have judgment against the defendant in the amount of $50. The defendant will have judgment against the plaintiff in the amount of $450 plus costs. Fault for this accident was attributed 10% to the defendant and 90% to the plaintiff. The defendant had indeed yielded properly but could have been more prudent in insuring that other motorist were aware that she yielded.

They were not habitually resident in Saskatchewan and had been here only 3 months. They were not living with their mother with the implied consent or acquiescence of their father.

2_2003skpc44.txt,"The plaintiff sought to recover the purchase price and repair and inspection costs of a used vehicle pursuant to the Consumer Protection Act s.57(1)(b). Mr. Russell sold the vehicle under consignment to the plaintiff for $1,600. The sales agreement indicated the vehicle was sold 'as is'. The purchaser returned the vehicle the next day because of a problem with the seat belt, a vibration or pulsation from the brakes and the 'check engine soon light' had come on. The plaintiff paid for the sensor replacement. Triple R absorbed the other costs of repair. The plaintiff's daughter continued to have problems with the car including with lower ball joints, exhaust system and motor mounts. At issue was whether or not a consignee is a 'retail seller' as defined in the Consumer Protection Act. HELD: The plaintiff was entitled to recover the $1,600 purchase price plus foreseeable damages which included costs of repairs and inspection totalling $242.35 and costs of $20 less a reduction of $1,542.35 for the 5,000 km it was driven. 1)A consignee is a retail seller within the meaning of the CPA and accordingly Triple R was deemed to have given the warranties set out in the CPA. If the legislature had intended that consignees were not to be considered retail sellers, it would have listed them in the excluded group. Persons may be considered retail sellers even though they have no contractual relationship to the purchaser in s.55. 2)While the plaintiff did not pay a large sum of money, he could still expect this vehicle to be safe to drive. It was not safe and accordingly was not of acceptable quality. The retail seller bears the burden of establishing the exceptions enumerated in the statutory warranty and failed to do so. The vehicle was unsafe from the outset and could not be considered suitable for the purpose of providing transportation. It was unnecessary to make a finding with respect to warranty s. 48(g) (durable for a reasonable period of time). 3)This auto was substantially unfit for all the usual purposes for which, to the knowledge of the retail seller, it was being bought and accordingly the breach was of a substantial character. 4)The plaintiff rejected the goods within a reasonable period. The commencement of the present action was treated as the rejection of the product. The bulk of delay was caused by the defendant's failure to pick up and look at the vehicle (and implication this would involve repair) as agreed.","This issue largely involved Part III of the Consumer Protection Act and inter alia, the question of whether or not a consignee is a'retail seller' as defined in that Part.

In the circumstances, the plaintiff did reject the goods within a reasonable period. Pursuant to s. 57(1)(b)(ii) the plaintiff is entitled to recover the purchase price of $1600 plus foreseeable damages. The costs incurred for repairs and inspection were properly recoverable.

The medical evidence did not indicate any inability to either instruct counsel or to represent him in Court. The trial judge had little choice but to do what she did. 2) The authorities cited by the appellant have no application to this case as they all deal with situations where someone did not appear at his trial.

2_2005skqb513.txt,"FIAT: The parties are the parents of a son born April 10, 2003. They are married and the family home is in Connecticut. The respondent mother is a Canadian citizen and has returned to Canada and now resides in Laird, Saskatchewan. The petitioner is an American citizen and continues to reside in Connecticut and brings an application under The International Child Abduction Act for an order directing the child to be returned to Connecticut. HELD: The respondent is directed to return the child to the State of Connecticut by January 8, 2006.  1) The child was born in Canada. He and his mother joined his father in Connecticut one month later in May 2003. In February 2004 the child and his mother returned to Canada for a planned one-month visit. It is clear that the petitioner did not consent to the prolonged absence of the respondent and the child. In about November 2004 the respondent and the child returned to Connecticut and resumed living with the petitioner. Reconciliation was attempted. The respondent and child left in December 2004 and have not returned. The crystallizing moment was in March 2004 when the respondent did not return from her trip to Canada. For the purposes of the Convention, circumstances should be examined to determine habitual residence. At this point the parties had adopted traditional roles. The respondent was at home raising the child and the petitioner was attending his duties in the navy. Through their conduct the parties had evidenced a settled intention to make their home in Connecticut. The respondent chose to unilaterally remove the child from that home. 2) The petitioner had obtained an interim order in February 2005 directing the child to be returned to Connecticut. He also pursued his case in the Superior Court in Connecticut and on October 2005 obtained an order dissolving the marriage, directing the respondent to return the child to Connecticut and granted the petitioner sole custody. The respondent now asks that any order directing her and the child to return should be conditional on the petitioner varying the order he obtained in October 2005, vacating the award of sole custody to the petitioner and replacing it with something in the nature of joint custody. The conditional return order proposed by the respondent is inappropriate. Having determined that an order for return is warranted under the Convention, it does not lie with a Saskatchewan Court to impose a revised starting point for the process of determining custody in Connecticut. This Court's role concludes upon the determination the petitioner has made out a case for an order for return.","FIAT: The parties are the parents of a child born in Canada. They were married and the family home was in Connecticut. The respondent mother, an American citizen, has returned to Canada and now resides in the Town of Laird, Saskatchewan. The petitioner father brings an application under The International Child Abduction Act for an order directing Joshua be returned to Connecticut. HELD: The application is granted. 1) More than a year has elapsed between the removal and the commencement of judicial proceedings and it can be demonstrated that the child is now settled into his new environment. 2) The Court has recognized that frequently an unqualified return order can be detrimental to the short term interests of the child in that it wrenches the child from its de facto primary caregiver. Given the preamble's statement that 'the interests of children are of paramount importance', courts of other jurisdictions have deemed themselves entitled to require undertakings of the requesting party provided that such undertakings are made within the spirit of the Convention. In this case, the petitioner father is applying to the New York Family Court to vary the existing sole temporary custody order to terms which reflect the status quo, and to determine habitual residence on that basis. 3) There is no suggestion that the exceptions under the Convention under Articles 12, 13 or 20 are applicable. Rather, the onus is on the parent who would resist the return order."
2_2006nsfc7.txt,"Although the mother initially had sole custody of the parties' two children, they were placed in the joint custody of both parents, with primary care and control with the father, when the mother was hospitalized due to mental health disturbances. When the children were not later returned to her care, the mother brought an application to vary the primary care arrangements, alleging that the children were not receiving suitable and appropriate parenting while in the father's care. The father, who lived close to the maternal grandparents and relied upon them extensively for the care of the children, questioned the mother's emotional and mental health and stability. The transfer of primary care of the children to the mother is conditional upon the fulfillment of several provisions and prohibitions, including the mother's disclosure to her mental health caregivers of any alcohol consumption and the recent harassing phone calls made by her; should the parents be unable or unwilling to cooperate with the court directives, the court will consider filing a report of neglect under the Children and Family Services Act; primary care and access will be reviewed by the court in six months time. The children were at considerable risk if placed in the primary care of either parent; the evidence showed that the father was unable to meet the children's needs on a daily basis; in addition to his questionable parenting judgment, his regular daily drug use in circumstances where the family lived in poverty and one child had an asthmatic medical condition showed that he placed a higher priority on his relationship with marijuana than his primary responsibility as protector of his children. Although the mother's parenting plan was well-conceived, the court questioned whether she could withstand the daily pressure of raising the children and noted her past habit of consuming alcohol while taking medication.","This is a request for variation of the primary care arrangements for two children. Pursuant to the Maintenance and Custody Act, the parties apply for a change in primary care and control in order to preserve the present arrangement vesting primary and daycare and control of the children with the mother. The father is currently employed as a roofer and is unable to drive a motor vehicle, having accumulated a myriad of driving infractions to add to his already lengthy criminal record. The mother continues to make harassing phone calls to him, his sister and other family members and friends. There are other examples ( boys missing school, etc. without a valid reason, at the whim of their father) described in the evidence which could be recounted here. HELD: 1) If a parent struggling at the poverty level is smoking drugs regularly, and financially supporting a drug habit, this will automatically divert from already meager funds available to adequately provide amenities for their children. In the present circumstances, the father is not presently providing the physical amenities of life for these two growing boys. His type of parenting, if one can call it parenting, falls very short of the expectations of the court. These concerns encapsulate a conglomerate of parental missteps and deficiencies. These parental deficiencies militate against permitting the children to remain in the physical care of the father.  2) The mother has made mistakes in the past as a parent and this may be her last time to ensure that she can consistently care for her children. This becomes an unfavorable factor for placement of them with their mother. 3) The father has been convicted of criminal charges and he is presently awaiting sentencing on at least one charge.  4) In addition to the mother's past habit of consuming alcohol while taking prescribed medication, there are other recent incidents which paint a picture of a parent who is incapable to meet the needs of his children on a daily basis."
2_2007nsca122.txt,"Two days after the wife commenced a divorce action in Nova Scotia, the husband commenced one in Texas. He successfully applied to have the wife's divorce petition set aside on the grounds that she had not been ordinarily resident in Nova Scotia for at least one year immediately prior to the commencement of the proceeding. The wife applied for a stay of execution pending her appeal of this decision. She argued irreparable harm to herself and the parties' child on the basis that if the stay was refused, she would be required to travel to take part in the Texas proceeding, leaving her law practice for an extended time and uprooting the child who was settled in school here. She also feared that she would be found in contempt for failing to obey the Texas custody orders and be imprisoned. Application for stay pending appeal dismissed; the irreparable harm claimed by the appellant was entirely speculative at this point as if the Texas court did grant custody to the father, under the Child Abduction Act, a Nova Scotia court would have jurisdiction to determine the child's habitual residence and whether the appellant was wrongfully detaining him here. Given that the Texas court would be free to continue its proceeding even if a stay was granted, until such time as the conflict of laws issue was resolved, it would be risky for the appellant not to participate in the process there. Furthermore, the order under appeal was not one that lent itself to being stayed under Rule 62.20.","The appellant appeals from and applies for a stay of execution of an order setting aside her petition for divorce made by the Supreme Court of Canada (Family Division). On an application by the respondent to set aside the divorce petition on the basis that Nova Scotia lacked jurisdiction, Justice Wilson determined that the appellant had not been ordinarily resident in Nova Scotia for at least one year prior to the filing of the petition, as required by s.3 of the Divorce Act. Pursuant to that statute, a Nova Scotia court would have jurisdiction to determine whether the appellant's habitual residence was in the province of Nova Scotia or Texas. Since Nova Scotia is not a reciprocating state pursuant to the Reciprocal Enforcement of Custody Orders Act, 1989, R.S.NS, c. 387, the Child Abduction Act and the Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child abduction would be applicable. HELD: The application for stay pending appeal was dismissed with costs in the cause. 1) While there is no comprehensive definition of what may constitute 'exceptional circumstances' which may justify a stay even if the applicant cannot meet the primary test, those exceptional circumstances must show that it is unjust to permit the immediate enforcement of such an order obtained after trial. 2) There are no precedents or precedents for this type of application. 3) There is no evidence that any order under appeal is not one which lends itself to being stayed in accordance with Rule 62.10 and that the application for this stay should be dismissed for that reason."
2_2007nssc235.txt,"The parties, divorced, had children, aged 23, 19, and 14 years, respectively. The wife applied to vary the Corollary Relief Judgment (CRJ) following the termination of spousal support. The termination had occurred pursuant to the terms of the CRJ which provided that support would terminate either twelve months after her graduation from the M.B.A. program in which she was enrolled, six months after she withdrew from the program, or when she found employment. The wife had graduated from the program later than expected and a further six months after her course work was completed. Both parties applied to vary child support. The oldest child had completed his first university degree and was currently attending law school. Pursuant to the father's employment, until the completion of their first degree, the children qualified for a program which reimbursed the father for 75 per cent of the child's educational expenses. The CRJ had provided that the father's responsibility to pay all of the oldest child's educational expenses was conditional upon compliance and eligibility for the education reimbursement policies. The middle child was attending university and lived in the wife's home over the summer months. Spousal support application denied; given the family history of an emphasis on education and the oldest child's career plans and apparent aptitudes, he remained a child of the marriage; the father is to pay $10,000 per year directly to the oldest child for the next two years. The father will pay 25 per cent of the core university costs which are not covered by the plan for the middle child as well as the difference in the Table amount of support for two children versus one child; the father shall pay the Table amount of support for one child to the wife for the youngest child as well as that child's expenses for private school; the wife will be responsible for any extra-curricular activities or tutoring outside the private school; the youngest child will be entitled to the same post-secondary benefits in the same fashion as the two older children; the CRJ is amended to provide that the two oldest children are in the joint care of their parents and will not include any other reference to custody or access; the husband is entitled to specified block access with the youngest child; if flight arrangements are made for this child and she does not fly (and there is no medical reason confirmed in writing by a doctor for that failure), the husband's block access shall be expanded for one week at the next access period and the cost of any penalty from the missed flight will be deducted dollar for dollar from the child support payable by the husband.","The parties brought a series of variation applications under the Divorce Act. They each brought a variation application under the Act, 1985. HELD: 1) The application to vary spousal support was dismissed.  2) The parties had made numerous cross-applications concerning child support. The Corollary Relief Judgment provided that the Husband shall pay base guideline child support of the three children of the marriage in the amount of $3,088.20 per month retroactive to December 20, 2003 and payable on the first day of each month until the children are no longer children.  3) The Husband's income was found to be $12,759.73 US per month which is an annual income of $153,116.76 US or $203,706.00 Can. (On current conversion rate of 1.3304) based on the financial information before the court at the time of the making of the order. There was no evidence of health problems that would impair her. The order contemplated her parenting the girls she was receiving significant amount of child support and funding for AWEDANS. However laudable this proposed organization may be there is no reason for her to fund its establishment."
2_2007nssc40.txt,"Following the collapse of the roofs of two buildings in Newfoundland, both of which were constructed with open web steel joists fabricated by the same company, the Nova Scotia government wrote to owners of buildings containing these joists, including the plaintiff mall owner, recommending that the joists be inspected by a qualified professional engineer. An inspection of the mall roof revealed that 10.5 per cent of the joists inspected had at least one panel point with a broken or missing weld and the same remediation scheme as that implemented by the Province for the government's own buildings was recommended. The plaintiff, concerned with safety issues arising from the report, followed the consultant's recommendations and undertook remediation of the mall and then claimed against the defendant, which was the parent company of the corporate entity which had fabricated the joists. The defendant's expert took the position that although the actual repairs to the welding and webs of the open steel joists was necessary, the reinforcing of the joists undertaken in the remediation was not required in order to mitigate the danger. Judgment for the plaintiff; there were defects in the open web steel joists at the mall which constituted a real and substantial danger to the occupants; this danger was caused by the defendant's negligence and the remediation program carried out at the mall was necessary to alleviate the real and substantial danger. There were internal problems with the welds which could not be discovered by non-destructive inspection and the lack of proper welding procedures and quality control issues at the company prevented one from having confidence in any welds fabricated by them, at least based on external observations.","HELD: The Court found that the defects in the open web steel joists manufactured by the defendant were real and substantial danger to the occupants of the mall. The remediation scheme was implemented by the Nova Scotia Department of Transportation and Public Works. Burnac Corporation, the owner of the Mayflower Mall, claimed against the respondent, of which Robb Engineering was a division, for the cost of the inspection and remediation of the Mall. The respondent claimed that the actual repairs were necessary, but the reinforcing of the joists undertaken in the remediation was not necessary to repair the danger. The respondents were concerned about the quality of the welds in the mall, which were found to be poor with cracks in the top and bottom chords, a broken or missing weld, and a cracked or non-welded joint. HELD: 1) The actual repairs to the welding and webs of the open-web steel joist were necessary. 2) In buildings that had satisfactorily performed for twenty years and had a failure rate of 1% or less, only failed welds or members would be repaired. 3) There was no standard way to pile joists for inspection. The joists were in pile which allowed an inspector to see either the top or bottom chord, depending on how the joist was placed on the pile. What the inspectors could not see was not inspected. 4) The evidence for all parties is that many of the cracks are not service related. The work set out in items a) and b) was not done. Items c) and d) were done and, with regard to item number two, the three end joints were deslagged and inspected on all joists. The MPI inspection was carried out. 5) The inspection was done in a pile. The pile was in the yard and could not be used to examine welds covered by the roof deck. 6) There were no standard inspection procedures in place. 7) The amount of work in the plant determined how much time and effort it would take the respondent to get to the bottom of the problem. 8) The respondent was not asked to determine the quality and age of the raw material. The average for buildings inspected in Nova Scotia containing Robb joists was 2.28%. The report set out a strict quality control program that was not implemented during the respondent's involvement with the company. The report recommended all joist inspections be performed to allow for routine inspection for weld quality and weld length."
2_2007skca24.txt,"The applicant seeks leave to intervene in this appeal. The application is made pursuant to Rule 17 of The Court of Appeal Rules. HELD: The application for intervention is allowed on condition that it meet the filing deadline, that its material not exceed 12 pages and that it may make oral argument only if requested to do so by the Court.  1) The intervenor is a non-profit corporation and its members are mutual fund dealers. Its stated purpose is to regulate the mutual fund distribution industry and its members contractually bind themselves to submit to regulation by the Association. It contends its purpose in bringing the application is to bring to the Court's attention 'some of the broader policy and contextual considerations that have informed the development of the Mutual Fund Dealers Association (MFDA) and the self-regulatory organizations (SROs) generally. 2) There is no prejudice to the respondent if the applicant's proposed arguments are presented to the Court on the appeal. The applicant's arguments should simply put the regulatory scheme in context and may assist the Court in its deliberations. The applicant's arguments are confined to a relatively narrow issue.","The Mutual Fund Dealers Association (MFDA) seeks leave to intervene in the stated appeal. The MFDA consents to the intervention while the respondents oppose the application. The central issue on the appeal is whether the appellant has jurisdiction to discipline former representatives of one of its member firms for acts done by the representatives prior to their resignation or termination. There is a second issue by way of cross-appeal raised by one respondent in regard to matters of delay and abuse of process. The proposed intervenor has additional arguments to make. However, the applicant's arguments are confined to a relatively narrow issue and the issues of delay, possible prejudice and the transformation of the court into a political arena are not factors that need be considered in this application."
2_2007skqb378.txt,"The outstanding issue is child support, past and future. The dispute largely centered on what monies were owed from the past. Central to this was the determination of the respondent's income. HELD: 1) The respondent is a farmer. His income tax returns for the years 2004, 2005 and 2006 have been filed, but certain adjustments must be made. The purpose of the capital cost allowance is to provide money to purchase replacement equipment. However, not all of the money is needed and is not used for that purpose. It is that unused portion which should be allocated as part of the respondent's income. In this case, 40% of the allowance should be treated as income for the purpose of calculating child support. The personal portion of the utility costs should be included as part of his income, an appropriate percentage is 25%. An amount of the legal and accounting costs should be attributed to the respondent personally and added to his income, in 2004 $1,000 is added, in 2005 $5,000 is added and in 2006 $1,000 is added. The respondent has taken advantage of the optional inventory adjustment and that must be factored back into his income using the methodology set out in Tamke v. Tamke, 2001 SKQB 528. As the respondent's income has undergone serious fluctuation over the years, it is therefore appropriate that his income for calculating child support be based on the average of his income in the years 2004 and 2005. 2) The respondent will not have to pay half of the cost of Stacey joining a school trip to Europe. This is because Stacey paid half of the cost herself and because the respondent was asked to contribute at the time but refused. The petitioner knew the respondent had refused to contribute and, when she elected to pay the balance, she did so unilaterally. It would be inappropriate to compel the respondent to contribute now. 3) The school fees paid by the petitioner are not extraordinary and should be encompassed in the basis child support. The health costs in the form of orthodontic treatments are extraordinary and the parties shall contribute equally as their incomes are presently comparable. 3) On five occasions the respondent failed to attend at the agreed meeting spot with the result that the petitioner had to make the entire trip to deliver the children to the respondent so he could exercise access. She will be compensated for the actual lost wages and fuel costs that she incurred on the respondent's behalf, but not for costs she would have incurred in any event.  4) The respondent shall pay costs of $1,200.","The parties have three children. The parties separated in 2003 and the usual relief was claimed, namely: divorce, joint custody, access, child support, spousal support and division of family property. Central to this was the determination of the respondent's income. HELD: The respondent was to pay child support of $4,237.16. 1) It would be inappropriate to now compel the respondent to contribute when he earlier expressed a contrary position. 2) It is fair and reasonable that an appropriate retroactive variation be effected."
2_2011skpc5.txt,"The accused was charged with impaired driving and driving over. 08. The sole issue to be determined was whether the accused was the person operating the vehicle at the time of the stop. The police testified that they had walked through the bar before closing time and then returned to the bar at closing time. The evidence was that the accused had been seen playing drinking games in the bar. The police observed the people they had seen in the bar get into a truck and back up. The police activated their emergency equipment and approached the vehicle. The accused was sitting in the driver's seat when the police approached the vehicle. The defence suggested that another individual had been driving the truck when it backed up but had gone inside the bar to purchase off sale before the police approached the truck. HELD: The accused was convicted of both counts and a judicial stay was entered on the impaired driving count. The Court found that the evidence of the accused was unreliable as a result of her alcohol consumption on the offence date. The evidence of the person that the defence suggested was the driver was inconsistent and caused the Court concern about its reliability. The Court found that at the time the individuals got into the truck, the accused was behind the wheel and that she was the one who backed the vehicle up and pulled it forward. The keys were in the vehicle and it was running when the police came to the driver's door. The accused's blood alcohol content at the time of driving as shown by the Certificate of Analysis was 150 milligrams of alcohol in 100 millilitres of blood.","The accused was charged with impaired driving and driving over.08. The defence had admitted all of the essential elements of each charge; the factual one of whether or not the accused was the person operating the vehicle; the defence evidence lacked reliability. The accused was polite and cooperative both in examination-in-chief and cross-examination; the evidence did not leave a state of reasonable doubt; the keys were in the ignition when the police arrived at the vehicle and had been in the vehicle since the time the group entered the vehicle. HELD: The defence evidence lacks reliability. 1)The defence evidence does not accept that evidence nor does it leave a reasonable doubt of the guilt of the accused. 2)The evidence of the officer who was driving the truck was found to be unreliable. 3)The police officer's evidence of impairment was not supported by the evidence of his evidence. 4)The officer was polite, unshaken and unrepentant. 5)There were a number of inconsistencies in the evidence. The police officer was very evasive in cross examination, tendency he did not exhibit in examination in-chief. The difference between the demeanour he exhibited during his testimony, based on who was asking him questions, and the reasons for rejecting the evidence caused considerable concern."

HELD: Appeal allowed and sentence varied to 6 months for the offence. 1)The appellant must be made to realize that he cannot mix drinking and driving. His prior record is anything but promising. While he recognized the respondent was charged with a serious offence from which the general public needs protection, he was not prepared to incarcerate the respondent and thereby take him out of the work force. 2)The Court reviewed the entire record and considered what the trial judge said. He decided to give the appellant one more chance."
3_1991canlii4569.txt,"The appellant appealed his conviction for sexual assault using a weapon and his sentence of eight years. The appellant contended that his counsel had failed to call the complainant's boyfriend as a witness even though he was in the courthouse under a defence subpoena. The appellant also raised on appeal the fact that he had lost his right to a jury trial. He had failed to appear at the jury trial scheduled and a bench warrant had been issued. The Crown had then applied for an order that the appellant was no longer entitled to a jury trial and the record showed that his counsel had agreed to forfeit the right to a jury trial. The appellant contended that his counsel and the Crown both advised him he had lost his right by failing to appear and that he was not told that he could avoid losing his right if he had a legitimate excuse for failing to appear. He put forth the excuse of having had no counsel at the time of the trial. Dismissing the appeal, (1) that there was nothing to show that the witness would have given relevant evidence bearing on a decisive issue in the trial and the appellant failed to meet the burden of showing that the evidence, if believed, could reasonably have been expected to affect the result of the trial when considered with all the other evidence; counsel's decision not to call the witness where the witness was hostile and counsel did not know what he would say was not inappropriate, and, the court noted, in the circumstances, seemed to have been the right decision; (2) the excuse of failing to appear because he did not have counsel was not a legitimate excuse within the meaning of s. 598(1)(a) of the Criminal Code; moreover, the appellant only raised this issue in his oral submissions and gave no notice to the Crown respecting this issue nor did he provide any supporting evidence by way of affidavit; it was seen by the Court as another unsupported and unjustified criticism of counsel and the Court concluded that the record showed that the appellant had agreed to forfeit his right to a jury trial; and (3) that an eight year sentence, although at the high end of the scale for sexual assault, was not manifestly excessive, having regard to deterrence, the circumstances of the offence, and the appellant's record which included three minor offences.","The appellant was convicted after trial of assault with a weapon contrary to s.253.2 of the Criminal Code. He now applies for leave to appeal and, if leave is granted, appeals against both conviction and sentence. The appellant agreed before Chief Justice Glube to forfeit his right to a jury trial. Although the sentence can be considered at the high end of the range for sexual assault, it is not manifestly excessive. It cannot be said that the eight years imprisonment was not a fit sentence."

Dismissing the appeal, that the police officers were not acting arbitrarily or in a random fashion when they detained the appellant, and had a reasonable basis for stopping his vehicle. The appellant's contention he consumed only two small bottles (1-1/2 ounces each) of rum, plus some cough syrup and mints, did not constitute evidence to the contrary to rebut the presumption of the breathalyzer offence. On Appeal.","The accused was arrested for impaired driving, read a breathalyser demand, and gave him the usual Charter of Rights warning. At trial, the accused was convicted of impaired driving. In the fact situation before the trial judge, it is clear that the police officers involved were not acting arbitrarily or in a random fashion. They, in fact, had advanced a reasonable basis and had an articulable cause for stopping the vehicle.

ISSUES: 1)Did Sedco register its interest in accordance with the PPSA Regulations? 2)If not, can the registration be cured under section 66 of the PPSA? HELD: 1)The personal registration did not comply with the PPSA Regulations. The registration against the trade name was proper. 2)This is a matter where section 66 should be applied.

The father's statement of assets filed in his divorce and matrimonial property action did not disclose it as an asset. HELD: 1)The unsigned handwritten memorandum evidenced a binding agreement for lease between the plaintiff and his father. He affirmed the lease in his discussions with a daughter. 2)The plaintiff neither repudiated the lease nor failed to complete his obligations under it.

HELD: The order of the Court of Queen's Bench was set aside and the matter was remitted to the Board of Inquiry appointed under the provisions of the Code. 1)The chambers judge correctly decided that the issue in this case is confined to a determination of the correct forum in which to bring the complaint of sexual harassment. 2)Human rights are fundamental, quasi-constitutional rights which embody fundamental values and public policy. Because human rights are not private rights, but public rights which constitute fundamental public policy, parties are not able to contract out of, alter, amend, or repeal or create exceptions to human rights provisions. To do otherwise would permit the denigration of the rights and obviate the protection of the rights the statute seeks to protect. 3)The mere fact that a collective agreement includes an article or clause which complies with the Code or a provision which covenants not to discriminate on the basis of the grounds set out in the Code, does not in and of itself transform the nature of the dispute from a human rights violation to a breach of the collective agreement. The ambit of the collective agreement does not affect the finding that the essential nature of the dispute is a human rights violation particularly when the public interest component and wide powers granted under the Code to redress a violation are taken into account. It is not in its essential character a complaint arising out of the employment relationship under the collective agreement.  4)The Commission was awarded its costs on double column V in this Court and on the appropriate Court of Queen's Bench tariff. No costs were requested by the intervenor.ADDENDUM: Paragraphs number 25 and 31 are substituted as follows: [25] This position was reinforced by Weber v. Ontario Hydro and New Brunswick v. O'Leary. The policy driving such decisions is that the dispute resolution process, established by the various labour statutes, should not be duplicated or undermined by concurrent common law actions in the courts. This also conforms to the theory of deference that courts accord decisions of specialized tribunals. For a complete discussion of the issue see Parr and Prince Albert District Health Board v. Saskatchewan Federation of Labour released concurrently with this judgment. The Ambit of the Collective Agreement [31] One must not lose sight of the fact that the terms of the collective agreement itself can play an important role in the determination of whether the jurisdiction of the court has been ousted in favour of an arbitrator. The fact that parties have included an anti-discrimination clause in the collective agreement does not alter the fundamental nature of the dispute or have the effect of extending the scope of the arbitrator's jurisdiction. It may play a role in determining whether the statutory tribunal would decide to hear the complaint, but it cannot affect the determination of the essential nature of the dispute or the question of jurisdiction. The essential issue is whether this complaint is a dispute between the parties with respect to the meaning, application or alleged violation of the collective agreement. To find that it is, with the result that the dispute must be arbitrated, would permit the parties to contract out of the Code, something they cannot do.","HELD: The appeal was allowed. The matter was remitted to the Board of Inquiry established under the Act in accordance with s. 29(2) of the Code. The policy driving such decisions is that the dispute resolution process, established by the various labour statutes, should not be duplicated or undermined by concurrent common law actions in the courts. The mere fact that a collective agreement includes an article or clause which complies with the Code or a provision which covenants not to discriminate on the basis of the grounds set out in the Code does not in and of itself transform the nature of the dispute from a human rights violation to a breach of the collective agreement. The act is of such a special nature that it cannot be contracted out of, altered, amended or repealed nor may exceptions be created to its provisions except by clear legislative intent and pronouncement. To adopt and apply any theory of implied repeal by later statutory enactment to legislation of this kind would be to rob it of its special nature and give scant protection to the rights it proclaims."
3_1999canlii12362.txt,"The appellant appeals his conviction of sexual assault causing bodily harm on the ground the trial judge erred in preventing cross-examination of the complainant. The trial judge prevented the cross-examination of the complainant in relation to a previous allegation she had made relating to this sexual assault. The offence is alleged to have taken place at home of the appellant's brother. The appellant was asked by his brother and sister-in-law to babysit their daughter. The allegation was that the appellant had entered her parent's bedroom where she was sleeping and sexually assaulted her. The appellant, who has no previous record, was convicted of the charge and sentenced to three years imprisonment. The appellant during cross-examination of the complainant attempted to question her regarding a previous allegation regarding the same sexual assault against another person. The trial judge did not permit this line of questioning as he held it pertained to her past sexual history. HELD: Appeal allowed. The failure of the trial judge to allow this cross-examination has prevented the appellant from having a fair trial as he has been denied the opportunity to make full answer and defence. It seems the question that should have been put to the trial judge on this occasion was whether this section was applicable to a situation involving non-consensual sex. The complainant was not being questioned about her consensual sexual activities but rather a previous complainant of a sexual assault. It is understood the intent was to indicate the complainant had implicated someone else as the assailant and after investigation the complaint had not been acted upon. That evidence could have placed in doubt the reliability of the complainant's identification of the person who assaulted her since the room was dark when the assault was alleged to have occurred. The relevance of such a question pertaining to the existence of another complaint made by the complainant in respect of the same assault is obvious. That question has a direct bearing on her credibility.","The appellant was found guilty of having sexually assaulted the complainant contrary to s. 272(c) of the Criminal Code. He appealed the conviction on the ground that the trial judge erroneously interpreted s. 276 of the Code to prevent proper cross-examination of the complainant in relation to a previous allegation she had made relating to this sexual assault. HELD: The appeal was allowed and a new trial ordered.  1) The trial judge failed to allow the cross-examined complainant to make a full answer and defence. 2) The relevance of such a question pertaining to the existence of another complaint made by the complainant was obvious. 3) The failure to allow this cross examination has prevented the appellant from having a fair trial as he has been denied the opportunity to make full answer & defence. This is not a case which calls for an analysis of extensive evidence, rather it is dependant entirely upon finding of credibility and reliance upon the testimony of one person recalling an incident which occurred nearly ten years earlier. One cannot accurately assess what the result would have been if the cross examination had been allowed, however, it would have had an effect on the complainant's credibility. 4) The respondent was not being questioned about her consensual sexual activities but rather about a previous complaint of a sexual assault and that question had a direct bearing on her credibility. The respondent should have simply been directed to respond to the question, not so as to permit an assessment of N.M.'s previous sexual conduct, but to clarify what previous complaint she may have made about this alleged assault. 5) The Crown contends that the intent of the section is to protect the privacy of any sexual activity of complainant and that right should just as appropriately extend to instances where that person is the victim of an assault. The Court reviewed R. v. Vanderest (1994), [1994] O.J. 2021 (QL) and found that the relevance of this section to a situation involving non-consensual sex is obvious. It does not raise the issue of the respondent having 'engaged in sexual activity' as it only requires the complainant to be open about those occasions when sexual assault has been alleged on another occasion. 6) It is not clear that the respondent has complied with the strict requirements of ss. 276.1.1 and s.170, 171, 172, 173, 271, 272 or 273. The relevance such information may have is illustrated by this case in which it bears either upon the identity of the alleged assailant or the propensity of complainant to makes such allegations or perhaps"

He was also required to pay half of the monthly dental expenses. Subsequently, the respondent filed a financial statement showing his income to be $50,064. HELD: The respondent's monthly child support payments are reduced according to the guidelines. The respondent is also required to maintain health and dental insurance for his children through his employer. The Court instructed the respondent on the procedure for submitting the children's health insurance claims. The provisional order was confirmed subject to these specified variations.","A provisional variation order was made by the Court of Queen's Bench for Alberta requiring the respondent to pay the petitioner the sum of $794 per month as basic child support for the two children. The provisional order also required that the respondent pay an additional $75 per month representing 50% of orthodontic and dental costs of the child. The total amount owing monthly was $794. The court based its provisional order on a finding that the petitioner's annual income for child support purposes was $55,000. The respondent was required to pay basic monthly maintenance of $661 for two children and to remit insurance re-imbursement cheques to the petitioner. HELD: The provisional variation ordered by the court in May 1998 was confirmed subject to the variations. 1)The provisional order in Medicine Hat on May 13, 1998 required the petitioner to pay a provisional order requiring the court to vary the monthly payment to reflect the provisional order. 2)The Court in Regina based its order on the finding that Mr. Holmes' annual income was $56,000 and the provisional orders were varied to reflect this amount. 3)The respondent had employer sponsored dental insurance available which will cover a significant portion of the orthodic and dental expenses of the children that are not covered by the plan maintained by their mother's employer. In lieu of payments of $75.00 per month, and pursuant to section 6 of the Guidelines, the respondent is required to obtain and maintain medical and dental insurance for the children to the extent available through his employer."

3_2001nssc117.txt,"The plaintiffs were Sergeants in the Town of Bedford Police Department. Following amalgamation and before any collective agreement was concluded, the Chief of the amalgamated force issued a department order declaring that all persons in the position of the plaintiffs would be referred to as a level two Sergeant which created a two-tier structure within the Sergeant rank. The bargaining agent for the union declined to process a grievance on behalf of the plaintiffs and agreed with the two-tiered structure which was eventually incorporated into the collective agreement. After unsuccessfully complaining to the Nova Scotia Police Commission and the Halifax Regional Board of Police Commissioners, the plaintiffs commenced an action alleging that the creation of the two-tiered structure was a violation of the Police Act and adversely affected their employment rights. The intervenor union brought an application to strike the plaintiffs' proceeding on the basis that the court lacked jurisdiction to hear the matter. Application granted; proceeding stayed pending submission to arbitration or any other form of proceeding that is permitted under the statutory enactments applicable; if no application is made to lift the stay within two years, the action will stand dismissed. Where there is a threshold question of whether the dispute is arbitrable, that decision should initially be made, absent very limited exceptions, by an arbitrator and not by the court. It is irrelevant if the plaintiffs have now lost their rights to initiate the arbitration process.","The Halifax Regional Municipality Act, effective as of April 1, 1996 provided for the amalgamation of the Cities of Halifax and Dartmouth, the Town of Bedford and the remainder of the County of Halifax into the Halifax Region. The amalgamation included the joining together of the various municipal police forces under one administration. The plaintiffs, other than Tim Mosher, were employed as police officers by the Bedford Police Department, each holding the rank of corporal. In February 1994, Bedford decided to eliminate the police rank of sergeant. In 1995, MAPP and MAPP signed collective agreement which incorporated the findings of the Interest Arbitration Award, including the classifications of Sergeant and Sergeant. MAPP had commenced collective agreement negotiations in January 1996 and prior to concluding an agreement agreed the sergeant rank would include the designations of Sergeant. However, no agreement was reached on the appropriate rates of pay for the designation and the matter was referred to an interest arbitration board. HELD: The decision of the Nova Scotia Court of Appeal in Pleau v. Canada (1999), 181 N.S.R. (2d) 365 is informative as to the appropriate approach to be taken when there is a threshold question of whether the limits of court jurisdiction can be understood in light of the breadth of arbitral jurisdiction."

Before filing a defence the appellants demanded particulars of the alleged lost profits. The plaintiff refused to provide particulars and the chambers judge dismissed the appellants' application for an order compelling particulars. ,appeal dismissed; the appellants had not challenged the sufficiency of the pleadings; no case was made out that the appellants required the particulars in order to file a proper defence to the action.  There were other rules available to the appellants which could be utilized to discover the underlying details of the damage claim.","This is an appeal from an interlocutory order dismissing the appellants' demand for particulars of general damage claim. Twin Mountain Construction (the respondent) claimed that they misrepresented the boundaries of a parcel of property that they sold to the respondent. Alternatively, the respondent claimed breach of contract. The appellants (defendants in the Supreme Court action) demanded better particulars of damages. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. 1)The absence of particulars sought by appellants compromise their ability to file a defence to this action.  2)Civil Procedure Rule 14.24 provides that particulars must only be pleaded where the demand is liquidated. An expectation claim which depends upon variable factors (here, factors such as the state of the economy, the price of sand, the cost of excavation) need not be particularized in the pleadings.  3)The respondent had specified the type of damages that it seeks. 4)The Court would dismiss the appeal with costs of $1500 inclusive of disbursements.  5)The appellants were entitled to know the amount of the claim for general damages based upon expected profit from the development of property and/or the excavation of the sand.

They appealed on the basis that the Crown's evidence was so insufficient that a verdict of guilty was unreasonable or was one which could not reasonably be supported on the evidence. HELD: Appeal dismissed. 1)No medical evidence was necessary to establish that the victim's injuries were caused by an assault, given the photographs admitted into evidence, the evidence of the police officer who was called to the scene of the assault and the evidence of the 7-11 clerk who was first approached by the victim for assistance. 2)Evidence of exclusive opportunity was unnecessary to sustain a conviction where there was other circumstantial evidence pointing to the identity of the accuseds. 3)Although a failure to permit an accused who calls no evidence to argue last in a jury trial might be a good ground of appeal, the failure to be permitted to argue last before a judge alone was merely a procedural error which could be cured under the curative provision contained in S.686(1)(b)(iv) of the Criminal Code.",The Crown called no evidence. The appellants alleged two insufficiencies in the evidence: (i) the absence of any expert evidence that the injuries sustained by the victim resulted from any blows such as kicks or punches and as such were the result of an assault. HELD: Appeal dismissed. 1)Circumstantial evidence of opportunity was sufficient to support a finding of identity beyond a reasonable doubt.  2)The Court found that the evidence adduced by the Crown was insufficient to such a degree that the trial judge's verdict of guilty ought to be found by this Court.  3)There was no direct evidence to implicate the appellants. There was strong circumstantial evidence. It was fair to infer that the victim received his injuries at the spot where the pool of blood was found at the southeast corner of the Enjoy Gardens building and next to the 7-Eleven store where the accused had been severely beaten.
4_1996canlii5334.txt,"Following three patient suicides at the Cape Breton Regional Hospital, the hospital, in response to concerns and questions from family members, retained two psychiatrists to review the cases, the roles and responsibilities of individuals involved in the cases, patient records and hospital policies and practices. At the end of the review they were to provide a written report to the hospital's Chief Executive Officer. The hospital staff participating in the investigation and review were advised that their information would be treated as part of a 'peer review' and therefore confidential. Upon receipt of the report the hospital, as a result, refused to disclose the report to the families.

The hospital decided to release the full report. The appellant employees appealed the decision of the hospital, claiming that they had been assured confidentiality. Allowing the appeal, that the disclosure of personal information consisting of personal recommendations or evaluations, character references, or personal evaluations by the appellants and other hospital staff are presumed under s. 20(3)(g) of the Act to be an unreasonable invasion of a third party's personal privacy. Under s. 20(1) the hospital is required to refuse to disclose this information. It necessarily follows that recommendations in the report founded upon such information is also presumed to be an unreasonable invasion of privacy and is likewise not to be disclosed.

HELD: 1)Section 258(7) has been judicially amended to mean 'true copy' which presumably, though not logically, means something more than 'copy'. It has grown to the point that an affidavit may be disregarded if the police do not provide supplemental evidence when challenged as to the manner in which they assured the accuracy of the copy. 2)The trial judge further advanced the law to a point where, even when not challenged, there is an obligation to provide supplemental evidence of comparison in order to buttress the evidence of the affidavit. This is an error of law. A challenge under s258(7) should be based upon a discovered difference as between the copy and the original. Otherwise the refusal to admit the certificate becomes merely a prize in a procedural game which can only bring the justice system into disrepute. 3)A new trial was ordered to determine whether the stop was justified.","The accused was charged with operating a motor vehicle while his blood alcohol level exceeded.08 contrary to s. 255(1) and s. 253(a) of the Criminal Code.

P. Weber was tendered in evidence establishing that a true copy of the certificate had been served upon the accused. HELD: The appellant was entitled to a new trial. 1)It would not be unreasonable to require that if there was a challenge under this subsection of the affidavit or of the copy supplied, it should be based upon a discovereddifference as between the copy and the original. 2)The refusal to admit the certificate becomes merely the prize in procedural game which can only bring the justice system into disrepute. The validity of the stop was not one of fact. The Court held this to be an error of law.  3)The Court was unable to infer that true copy was indeed served, failing the proof by the police officer by way of his testimony that he did compare the two. It was incumbent upon the officer, be it a carbon copy or indeed one of these new types of Certificates with the copies, he still is required to compare, because there are no other steps that he has taken."

HELD: Appeal allowed. 1)The sentence was varied by reducing the term of probation to one year and by deleting the provisions concerning possession and consumption alcohol, entry into premises where alcohol is sold and consumed, and submission to breath or blood testing. In these circumstances, while we agree a period of probation is an appropriate penalty for his offence, the inclusion of the term 'banner of alcohol' is inappropriate since it had no relation to the original recognizant and does not have, as far as we can see, any other purpose. 2)The terms of the probation, three years, were out of proportion to the nature of the offence."

4_2000canlii3136.txt,"In a trial of liability only, jury found defendants to be entirely responsible for causing motor vehicle accident. Plaintiff was found contributorily negligent and liability was apportioned 57.5% to defendant and 42.5% to plaintiff. Plaintiff suffered significant injuries and plaintiff and spouse applied for interim payment of damages. Application allowed in part; plaintiff awarded $250,000.00 as interim payment; spouse's application denied. Once court is satisfied plaintiff has met threshold requirement of a judgment or admission of liability, it must strive with evidence before it to determine what damages are likely to be recovered by plaintiff and may then order interim payment if it thinks just, within limitation that it not exceed a reasonable proportion of the projected amount. The greater the certainty of the final outcome of liability and the greater the strength of the evidence supporting the damages claim, the higher the proportion of damages that will be advanced. There is nothing which precludes interim payment from being substantial amount in a proper case but court must be cautious to avoid any influence on eventual outcome of damage assessment. Although there had not yet been discovery of plaintiff's doctors or an independent medical exam obtained, the plaintiff's injuries were largely demonstrated by clinically objective medical evidence and there was no evidence of any pre-existing condition. In such circumstances, a substantial sum could be ordered. Neither pre-judgment interest nor costs are to be considered by the court in such an application.

With a judicial assessment of damages several months away, the plaintiffs have now brought an application under Civil Procedure Rule 33.01(A) seeking an interim payments from them. The Court reviewed the state of the evidence before the plaintiffs and found that even though this medical evidence has not yet been tested by discovery examinations or an independent medical examination, it is likely, given the clinically objective nature of the medical findings to date, that the plaintiffs will recover substantial amounts of special damages which are acknowledged to be nearing the $300,000 mark subject, of course, to the reduction for contributory and any arguments of failure to mitigate that might be raised by the defendants, the court is satisfied that the plaintiff is likely to recover some measure of compensation for loss of future earnings."

He was sentenced to a fine of $1,500, placed on probation for 18 months and ordered to make restitution to the plaintiff for the cost of the dental work in the amount of $3,263.30. 2) The plaintiff suffered serious injuries and significant pain for a number of months after the assault. Extensive dental treatment was required and will be required at some point in the future. The plaintiff has minimal scarring. He is awarded general damages of $12,500. 3) The pleadings and the affidavit evidence do not support a substantial award for aggravated damages. However, the photographs graphically depict the extent to which his appearance was altered. Hurt feelings can reasonably be inferred from the fact that the plaintiff was rendered unconscious on the ground in a crowd of onlookers. These circumstances justify an award of aggravated damages in the sum of $2,000. 4) The plaintiff was awarded special damages in the amount of $1,911.70.","The plaintiff was standing with other patrons near the entrance to the pub when, without warning, the defendant punched him in the face and knocked him unconscious. The plaintiff claims damages for injuries sustained in the assault. Liability is admitted and the plaintiff now applies for summary judgment and an assessment of damages pursuant to Rule 485. HELD: The court found that the injuries sustained by the plaintiff as result of the defendant's assault were serious but not life threatening. Extensive dental treatment was required and further treatment will be required at some point in the future. Excluding any component for aggravated damages the court awarded a fair award for general damages of $12,500. 1) Aggravated damages are variety of non-pecuniary damages aimed at assuaging wounded feelings. The key factors are the nature of the hurt feelings and their impact on the plaintiff's lifestyle, together with their past and projected duration. The range of injured feelings will of course vary with the circumstances, but it often embraces such emotion as humiliation, indignity and humiliation, leaving the jury's verdict to rest upon a foundation incapable of supporting it. 2) The plaintiff suffered significant pain and suffering for a number of months after the assault resulting in extensive dental treatment and a permanent scarring and disfigurement but found that it was not significant. The defendant was ordered to pay the difference between full costs of required dental treatment less the amount reimbursed to him by the Provincial Court restitution order ($3,263.30) or the sum of $1,911.70 plus pre-judgment interest pursuant to the Prejudgment Interest Act, S.S. 1984-85-86, c. P22.3 and costs to be taxed."

4_2009skca44.txt,"The respondent Homeowners sued the respondents Sebastian and the TWC alleging negligence or breach of contract for failing to obtain the coverage for insurance as instructed by the Homeowners. Sebastian and TWC issued a third party claim against the appellant SGI and claimed SGI was negligent or in breach of contract or contributory negligence pursuant to the Contributory Negligence Act for failing to issue a policy of insurance in accordance with the application submitted to SGI by Sebastian on behalf of the Homeowners. The trial judge concluded Sebastian and TWC were negligent and liable for the loss suffered by the Homeowners. Further, the trial judge concluded that the insurer, SGI, owed a duty of care to both Sebastian and TWC and the Homeowners to properly underwrite and deal with the application for insurance. The trial judge concluded SGI contributed equally to the Homeowners' loss by 'their negligent acts' and was responsible to pay 50% of the judgment. The negligence of Sebastian and TWC is not disputed in this appeal. The Homeowners have been paid the amount owed under the judgment and advised they have no interest in the matter and did not participate in the appeal. SGI appeals and submits the trial judge erred in determining that SGI: (a) owed a duty of care to the insureds, Homeowners, and to the broker when it received an application for insurance in 'all the circumstances'; and (b) breached its duty of care. HELD: That portion of the judgment finding that SGI is liable for 50% of the damages payable to the Homeowners is set aside and the Third Party Claim is dismissed. Accordingly, the appeal is allowed with costs to the Appellant. The trial judge correctly placed the duty of care on the intermediary, Sebastian. It is clear the insurer relies on the broker to apply for the coverage in accordance with his clients' (i.e., the insureds') wishes and needs. There was no other evidence before the Court to establish the standard of care, the basis for imposing a duty at law where none has previously existed, or the subsequent breach of that duty by the insurer, SGI, in connection to the application for insurance submitted by Sebastian. The Court concluded there was nothing in this transaction which warrants the creation of a duty of care owed by the insurer to a broker applying for insurance on behalf of his clients.","HELD: Appeal allowed. The court found that SGI was negligent or in breach of contract or contributory negligence pursuant to the Contributory Negligence Act for failing to issue a policy of insurance in accordance with the application submitted to SGI by the appellant on behalf of the Homeowners. The appellant argued that the appellant did not publish the availability of this special insurance coverage which it had extended to the Draders under the McCallum Hill SGI policy. The trial judge concluded the appellant was negligent and liable because he failed to properly identify the nature and extent of the homeowners' existing insurance coverage, which he concluded SGI owed duty of care to the defendants (as well as to the plaintiffs) in respect of the [TWC] policy that expired the same date. SGI issued the standard 'comprehensive perils' home coverage policy with Fine Arts Rider for the Swarovski collection, which contained an exclusion for accidental damage to and breakage of fragile items. HELD: The appeal was allowed."

The mother's three older children had been apprehended with two other older children placed with a person of sufficient interest and the third child was made a permanent ward of the Ministry. The Minister argued that given the extensive past history of the three older children, the Minister properly apprehended the infant and the permanency planning committee was of the opinion that there was no use putting off the inevitable permanent order for the child. The mother and the child's father had separated with the father supporting the mother having the child returned to her care and the father having access to the child. HELD: There was no basis for the initial apprehension as the child was not in need of protection. The child shall be returned to the mother who is a person who has a right of custody of the child pursuant to s. 36(3) of the Child and Family Services Act. This shall be done on a transitional basis as determined by the Ministry with the child to be completely returned to the mother within 30 days of this order.

The parties were in a common law relationship and had two children, aged 9 and 12. After separation, the children resided with their mother, the respondent, in La Ronge and they had access with the petitioner on the weekends. In January 2011, the parties agreed to a weekly co-parenting arrangement. In April 2013 the petitioner was advised by the respondent that she and the children had moved to Melville. Up until that point the child had always resided in the La Ronge area and attended only one school. HELD: The Court found the co-parenting arrangement to be the de facto parenting arrangement and that there was no risk to the children with either parent. The Court ordered that the parties were joint custodians of the children and that preservation of the status quo was in their best interests. The Court ordered that the children primarily reside in La Ronge with the petitioner and attend school there. The Court also ordered specified access for the respondent.","FIAT.

There are two children of the relationship, namely: Justin and Sean, born May 31, 2001 and September 26, 2004. HELD: The interim order was granted. The court found on the evidence that the parties are to be joint custodial parents for the two boys and that the preservation of the status quo is in the best interests of the boys. The order also provided that the petitioner shall make appropriate arrangements for the supervision of the children so that they are supervised prior to their attendance at school and after school if he is unable to personally provide it.  1) The parties had verbal co-parenting arrangement with the children rotating weekly between the parents. This arrangement was a de facto co- parenting arrangement between the parties. 2) There is no risk for the children in the care of either the petitioner or the respondent."
4_2016skqb136.txt,"Family Law – Custody and Access – InterimThe petitioner and the respondent had four children during the course of their marriage. They separated in 2010 and the petitioner applied for interim orders, including arrangements for the parenting of the children. The court made an interim order that the parties would have joint custody with the primary residence of the children to be with the petitioner. The respondent would have access at reasonable times and on every other weekend. The parties reconciled for two years but then separated again. In 2012 the petitioner applied for an order enforcing the 2010 interim custody order. At that application, the court found that both parents were capable of parenting, but in the short term it confirmed terms of the 2010 order. A number of pre-trial conferences were held without resolving matters, and during that time, the parenting arrangements changed substantially. The oldest child began residing with the respondent in December 2014. In December 2015, the second oldest child began residing with the respondent. They stayed with the petitioner on alternate weekends. The applicant then brought this application for an order pursuant to ss. 23(1)(a) and (e) of The Children’s Law Act and pursuant to the 2012 court order, confirming the original interim order that the four children of the marriage have their interim primary residence with her and that the respondent have specified parenting time on one day each week and alternating weekends. The petitioner alleged that the respondent was attempting to influence the two youngest children to reside with him. HELD: The court ordered that the status quo parenting arrangement should remain in place until trial. In this case, the status quo was not the arrangements as they had been in 2010 and in 2012. The court found that the arrangements had evolved since the 2010 order by agreement of the parties and the changes had not occurred because the respondent was attempting to alienate the children from the petitioner.","The parties separated in July 2010. Since then they have had ongoing disputes about the parenting of the children, child and spousal support, exclusive possession of the family home and division of family property. There have been variety of applications to the court, court orders and unsuccessful pre-trial settlement conferences. HELD: The interim parenting order of September 28, 2010 was in effect. The children's primary interim residence was with the petitioner. The respondent's specified interim parenting time will be Wednesdays from 3:20 until 7:00 PM and alternating weekends. The petitioner is prohibited from entering the respondent's said home until further order. The parties have engaged in parental alienation with regard to the parenting arrangements in place for the children over the past three and one-half years. Each parent is loving and capable of making all of their children's education, including without limiting the generality of the foregoing when they are entitled to go on the school bus. There is no evidence that the children would be at any risk in the meantime."
4_2016skqb160.txt,"Criminal Law – Assault with a WeaponCriminal Law – Defences – Self-defence The accused was charged with assault by threatening to use a weapon, a butcher knife, contrary to s. 267(a) of the Criminal Code. The accused was panhandling outside a store when he and one of two security officers had a verbal confrontation. The accused walked towards the security officer with a butcher knife. The security officer ran to his vehicle and the accused followed him and slashed a tire on the security officer’s vehicle. The attending officer was directed to a yard where he located the accused. A knife was also located in the yard. A videotape from the store was entered as an exhibit and played for the court. The accused was considerably smaller than either of the security officers. The accused testified that he was homeless and had a lot to drink the day of the incident. He indicated that he “blacked out” and was in front of two security officers when he came to. He said that he offered them a cigarette for being in their personal space and one of the men told him that he would punch him out. The accused indicated that he got the knife out of the bag just to show the men that he was bigger than them. He said that he did not intend to stab them. At one point the accused admitted following the security officer to his vehicle and at another point said he did not. The accused said he then tried to get away from the area but was prevented from doing so by a large black vehicle. The accused said he eventually stabbed the vehicle’s tire because it was blocking his way and he went into panic mode. The accused raised the issue of self-defence. HELD: There was no question that the Crown established the offence beyond a reasonable doubt. The court found that the accused initiated the confrontation by walking up to the security officer and getting very close to him. The court found that the Crown witness’s evidence was preferred over the accused’s where it differed, namely the slashing of the vehicle tires. The court accepted the accused’s submission that the security officer told the accused to get out of his face or he would knock him out or something to that effect. The court considered the factors set out in s. 34(2) and concluded that the force or threat faced by the accused due to the size of the security officers and the words used by one of them did not warrant the action taken by the accused. The court offered numerous reasons for the conclusion: the accused initiated the confrontation; the security guard did not touch or further go after the accused; no physical force was used against the accused; and there was no history between the accused and security officer. The accused’s actions were out of proportion to any reasonable response to any threat. The court held that the Crown established, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the facts and circumstances of the case did not give rise to the defence of self-defence. The accused was found guilty as charged.","The accused was charged with assault with a weapon contrary to s. 267(a) of the Criminal Code. The accused left the area, went to the rear of the building and in close quarters, as the accused himself testified, threw a kitchen knife at the complainant. The complainant was injured in the confrontation with the accused and the complainant ran to his vehicle, where the accused pursued him to the vehicle and slashed one of the complainant's tires with the knife he was carrying. HELD: The accused was found guilty of assault. 1) When one considers the factors set out in s. 34 of the Code, it is concluded, in all of the circumstances, that the nature of the force or threat that was presented by the size of the respondent and the words used by the respondent were not of a nature that would warrant, as reasonable, the action subsequently taken by the complainant against the accused. 2) The Crown has established that the offence charged occurred on the date and at the location alleged in the indictment and that the butcher knife entered as Exhibit P1 is clearly a weapon as defined by s. 2.  3) The accused's actions were not reasonable in the circumstances and did not constitute lawful protection of himself from any use or threatened use of force against him by the defendant. There was no question that the accused threatened to apply force to the complainant but rather he grabbed the knife and used it to make himself bigger."

Quite apart from certification and voluntary recognition, the union could attain bargaining rights pursuant to Part II of the Trade Union Act, which allowed an employer in the construction industry to assign bargaining and negotiating rights to an 'accredited employers' association' such as the Construction Management Labour Bureau Ltd.

The parties were to bear their own costs on this application. Dismissing the application, that the provisions of Part II establish a scheme where there are only two methods by which a union can obtain bargaining rights for the employees, i.e. certification and voluntary recognition.

Contempt proceedings had been commenced against them but were adjourned sine die at the time the defendants were permitted to defend. The defendants resisted the application on the basis that they were now non-residents and not compellable by an appointment, and that the designated officer of the defendant corporation was no longer an officer.

HELD: The imposition of trust conditions on the disclosure of victim's statements and videotaped statements in cases of sexual assault does not prevent the accused from exercising his right to make full answer and defence as guaranteed by ss. 7 and 11 of the Charter. The obligation to disclose is not absolute.

He informed the court that some members of our Court have allowed this to be done, others have declined.

5_2004skqb417.txt,"Each party has applied for a variation of the judgment granted by Gunn J. in April 1999. The judgment incorporates the terms of an Interspousal Contract dated April 1999 that provides for basic child support to be paid by the petitioner in the amount of $1,411 per month. The calculation of child support in the Interspousal Contract was based on the petitioner earning $110,000. The petitioner seeks to have child support reduced for Kimberly and discontinued for Ashley. The petitioner has unilaterally terminated support for Ashley on the basis that she is over 18 years of age and not in full time attendance at school. The respondent seeks an upward variation of ongoing child support for Kimberly on the basis that the petitioner's income is significantly higher than $110,000. She also seeks a retroactive variation of support paid for both girls. HELD: 1) The parties agree that much of the petitioner's income since the separation has included significant amounts of non-recurring income in the form of capital gains, stock options and severance pay. In accordance with s. 16 of the Guidelines, a payor's income for child support purposes is determined based on total income, adjusted in accordance with Schedule III, as shown on his or her income tax return. The petitioner has provided no compelling reason to exclude any of his non-recurring income. To the contrary, it is the fairest way of proceeding. The petitioner's income since separation discloses that non-recurring income can realistically be anticipated in the future, as it has constituted a significant portion of his income in four of the last five years. The fairest way of determining the appropriate level of child support is by calculating it based on his income during the previous year. 2) The petitioner's line 150 income on his 2003 income tax return was $199,922. This includes $114,454 of non-recurring capital gain income from the sale of shares in Poplar Hill Resources. It does not include the non-taxable portion of that capital gain in the same amount. Pursuant to Clause 6 of Schedule III referred to in s. 16 of the Guidelines, this non-taxable amount is to be included as an adjustment to income. This results in the petitioner's 2003 income for child support purposes being $314,376. However, in examining documents provided by the petitioner regarding his previous year's income, it is apparent that he incurred net capital losses in 2002 of $65,424. The Court imputed $150,000 of income to the petitioner for the year 2002 despite this net capital loss and his line 150 income being only $2,410. It is therefore reasonable that this capital loss be deducted from the non-taxable portion of the capital gain he realized in 2003. This results in only $49,030 of the non-taxable portion of the 2003 capital gain being added to income for total income of $248,952. Based on the Guidelines, child support of $1,928 would be payable for Kimberly.  3) During the same year that the petitioner was enjoying income in excess of $248,000, the respondent's income for herself and the two children was only $24,345. It is self-evident that the petitioner has a substantially greater ability to provide financial support for Kimberly than does the respondent. In the circumstances it is appropriate that one-half of the Guideline amount for the petitioner's income in excess of $150,000 be payable as child support. Effective January 1, 2004, the petitioner shall pay monthly child support for Kimberly of $1,557.  4) Ashley did not complete grade 12 until June 2003. In the normal course, she would have graduated in June 2002, but she was short some classes. The required classes were not available in September 2002 so she did not return to school until the new semester in January 2003. Although Ashley was not in full time attendance in school during the last six months of 2002, she had not yet completed her basic education and had every intention of doing so. She was not in a position to withdraw from her parent's support. Considering the disparity in the ability of each of her parent to contribute to her support, it is appropriate that support for Ashley be the amount determined by applying the Guidelines as if she were a child under the age of majority.  5) A written request by the respondent for the petitioner to provide copies of his income tax returns is not required because the parties incorporated a positive obligation to exchange tax returns in their Interspousal Contract. Consistent with the objectives of the Guidelines and implicit in the Interspousal Contract the parties must have understood that the petitioner's child support obligation could change if his income changed. 6) This is clearly a case where a retroactive variation is warranted. No variation can be considered for 1999, the year of the Interspousal Contract and the judgment. Given the various sources of the petitioner's income and the significant annual fluctuations in his income, it is appropriate to use his previous year's income as the basis for calculation of his child support payable in the subsequent year. The Court went on to calculate the petitioner's income and the child support payable for each year. 7) In 2002 the petitioner's line 150 income was only $2,410. Given the pattern of the petitioner's income in the three preceding years, along with the fact that he disposed of capital assets in 2003 that generated undisclosed cash flow, and, some 2 years later, he nevertheless retains significant net assets, the Court imputed additional income to the petitioner of $150,000 for child support purposes. 8) The respondent was awarded costs set at $2,600.","The parties separated in 1997 and shortly thereafter Mr. Marzolf moved to Alberta. The 1999 judgment provided for basic child support to be paid by him in the amount of $1,411 per month. The parties commenced negotiations in November 2002 for an upward variation of support for Kimberly on the basis that she was significantly higher than $110,000. On the same basis she also sought a retroactive variation of child support paid for both girls. HELD: 1) Based on the Guidelines and an annual income of $248,000, the parties agreed that much of his income since separation has included significant amounts of non-recurring income in the form of capital gains, stock options and severance pay. It is self-evident that the amounts are non-urring. 2) Given the unpredictable, variable and to some degree speculative aspect of much of the respondent's post-separation income (including his 2003 income) it would be imprudent, even if the parties were together, to reduce child support. In these circumstances, she was not in a position to withdraw from her parents' support. 3) The Guideline amount or some other amount should be used to calculate child support on income in excess of $150,000 and to determine an amount determined by applying the Guidelines as if she were a child under the age of majority."
5_2005nssc172.txt,"The parents applied for leave to apply to terminate a permanent care and custody order respecting their three children. Proposed Notices of Adoption were filed for two of the children after the parents' application was filed but before it was heard. The order had been made due to, inter alia, issues of poor hygiene and nutrition; lack of supervision; domestic disputes; physical risk to the children due to inappropriate discipline; the mother's explosive temper and mental health; the father's anger; lack of insight, desire or inability to improve by the parents; inability to control themselves during access or exercise access meaningfully and an all-consuming anger and preoccupation with the Agency. Since the order was made, the mother was diagnosed with and now receiving medication for bipolar and obsessive compulsive disorders. Application for leave granted; access not ordered at the present time; supplemental affidavits and viva voce evidence were considered given that the parents had only obtained counsel after the application was filed and the nature of the issue at stake; the application could not be arrested simply because the Agency had taken steps to have the children adopted after the application was filed. Some of the factors leading to the permanent care order were being addressed by the parents, although they had not been fully dealt with; the main achievements so far appeared to be an improvement in the parents' relationship, the courses of counselling and parenting instruction they had embarked upon, an expressed willingness by the mother to undertake psychotherapy, the mother's diagnosis and medication and the parents' changed attitude towards cooperation with the Agency; these are significant building blocks on which to anchor intense parental counselling","The applicants applied for leave to terminate an order for permanent care and custody respecting their three children. The applicant had been diagnosed with bipolar disorder and obsessive compulsive disorder. Prior to January 2005 prospective adoptive parents for R and E.C.S. gave notice of proposed adoption. Counsel for the applicants indicated that they intended to proceed with the application for leave rather than the application to terminate. HELD: The application was granted. The Court found that the applicants had not made sufficient progress to justify granting leave to apply to terminate the order. There was no new evidence of parenting courses, marriage counselling, parenting counselling or parenting counselling. The Agency opposed the application. The applicants provided several affidavits, whose content will discuss below."
5_2005skqb219.txt,"The accused has been in custody since November 17, 2004. After show cause hearings, the court refused to release the accused from detention. The accused apply for a review of the detention orders. HELD: 1) A review of the detention orders would ordinarily be cursory and the applications dismissed. The reasons for the decisions to refuse to release the accused cannot seriously be questioned. 2) However, a factor that causes concern is that 6 months after their arrest, not only has a preliminary hearing not been conducted, no date for a preliminary hearing has been set. No preliminary hearing date will be set before May 2005. The preliminary hearing will take 2 to 3 weeks.  It seems unlikely that the trial of these individuals will take place within a year of the date of their arrest. 3) They are ordered released on terms and upon the filing of security in the amount of $1,000.","The accused were charged with a multitude of offences pursuant to the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act, S.S. 1996, c.19 and the Criminal Code, which include trafficking in cocaine and methamphetamine, conspiracy to do so with one another and several other individuals, and several Criminal Code offences, including possession of proceeds of crime. Both individuals were in custody since November 2004. After a show cause hearing, her Honour Judge refused to release the accused. HELD: The accused were released from detention. 1)It seems unlikely that the trial of these individuals, even from the most optimistic view point, will take place within a year of the date when the accused were arrested. 2)The accused have a significant youth court record; six convictions involving breaking and entering and theft, two assault causing bodily harm charges, possession of house breaking instrument charge, charge of mischief, and one charge of failing to attend court. The accused is alleged to have been the number two man in the Regina organization. 3)A review of the detention orders of Her Honour Judge McMurtry and Judge Snell would ordinarily be cursory but in this case the conclusion cannot be seriously questioned. 4)There will be an order releasing the accused upon entering into a recognizance containing the following conditions: 1)Keep the peace and be of good behaviour and, having regard to all the circumstances presented to her, the substantial likelihood that the accused would, if released from custody, commit a criminal offence. Her conclusion in that respect cannot be questioned. 5)Leave his place of residence between the hours of 10:00 p.m. and 7:00 a.m., and shall present himself to any peace officer checking such a curfew. 6) Abstain from the consumption of alcohol and non-prescription drugs and shall not enter any public premise which serves alcoholic beverages. 7) Not be in possession of any cellular telephones. 8)Have no contact with the accused except for the purpose of preparation for trial."
5_2006nssc353.txt,"The claimant flooring dealer had supplied and installed a large amount of flooring in the defendant's new home. Although the defendant had visited the claimant's store and selected the flooring, the actual purchase was made by the defendant's contractor who did not pay the claimant and had now declared bankruptcy. The adjudicator found that although the three criteria for an unjust enrichment claim had been met, there was no special relationship between the parties and thus, denied the claim. The claimant appealed. Appeal allowed; the absence of a special relationship will not automatically defeat a claim of unjust enrichment; the Small Claims Court has the equitable jurisdiction to determine unjust enrichment claims.","This was an appeal from a decision by an Adjudicator of the Small Claims Court. HELD: The Court dismissed the appeal. The Court held that there was a special relationship between the parties, frequently contractual at the outset, which relationship would have made it unjust for the defendant to retain the benefit conferred on him by the plaintiff benefit, that was not conferred 'officiously' and that such a relationship would not necessarily defeat a claim. The absence of a special bond would defeat the claim.  1)The Court did not err in suggesting that, in the absence of an unjust enrichment relationship, coupled with either request for or acquiescence in the receipt of the benefit, no recovery will be allowed. 2)The presence of a 'casual arrangement' will be persuasive but not necessarily conclusive in the fact-finder's analysis. 3)There was no unjust enrichment because there did not exist special relationship."
5_2009nspc10.txt,"The accused was arrested for possession of drugs and a weapon, and for breaching his probation. Police testified they saw him walking down the street at 10am and noticed a strong smell of marijuana. When approached, he was smoking a cigarette in front of the provincial courthouse. He said he had smoked marijuana on the street, but did not have any other drugs on him. After they spoke, he asked to leave, saying he was late for a court appointment. The police asked him to deal with this matter first, ran a CPIC check and discovered the accused was on probation and required to keep the peace and be of good behaviour. He was not cautioned/advised of his right to counsel until he was arrested on the basis of what the Crown claimed was a reasonable belief the accused possessed drugs. Police conducted a 'pat-down' search, and found drugs (marijuana and cocaine) and a weapon. The accused argued his Charter rights were violated (s. 8, 9 and 10(b)) and asked the court to exclude the evidence obtained in the search. He also argued his admission/statement was not voluntary and should be excluded on the basis that it was given in the context of a violation of his Charter rights. Motions to exclude the statement and evidence obtained in the search denied. The accused's s. 8 and 9 rights were not breached. While his s. 10(b) rights were violated when he asked to leave and the officers asked him to deal with this first (which amounted to detention), his admission/statement was made before the detention and was voluntary. Further, no evidence was obtained as a result of the breach since the search only took place after the arrest/cautioning. After reviewing the relevant jurisprudence, the court concluded: the Crown must prove the arresting officer subjectively believed they found an offence apparently being committed; that subjective belief must be objectively reasonable; police may rely on an inference in forming their belief (such as the inference that marijuana smokers typically carry a supply with them); and that inference must be objectively reasonable in light of the circumstances and facts of the case. Here, the officer's subjective belief that the accused was in possession of drugs was objectively reasonable. The court accepted her evidence that she had special training in identifying the smell of marijuana and distinguishing between a strong and faint smell of marijuana. The CPIC check showed he was on probation in relation to a drug charge. Since the officer had the authority to arrest under s. 495(1)(b) of the Criminal Code, the arrest was lawful. The search taking place incidental to the arrest was reasonable. In obiter, the court went on to say that, even if the accused's s. 8 and 9 Charter rights had been breached, an analysis under s. 24 would lead to a decision not to exclude the evidence: it was not conscriptive; the offence was serious; there was no bad faith on the part of police; and the accused could have lawfully been arrested for admitting to what was a breach of his probation.","The accused was charged with possession of marijuana for the purpose of trafficking and possession of cocaine for the purposes of trafficking. The accused was stopped by police on foot patrol on the sidewalk near the courthouse. The officers noted a strong smell of marijuana coming from the accused's person. They approached him and observed him smoking a cigarette. They asked him where his cigarette was and he told them he dropped it at the mall. The officer asked the accused where his friend had dropped the roach and he replied that he dropped the one gram of marijuana he had dropped at a mall. When the officer approached the accused, the accused appeared tired, was very quiet and appeared to be suffering from some symptoms of being under the influence of marijuana. Although there was no police caution, the officer smelled marijuana in the vehicle. The arrest was found to be unlawful and the cannabis marihuana excluded. The statement of the accused to the police occurred before the officer was detained and, therefore, before the triggering of a police duty to advise him of his rights. There was no section 10(b) violation prior to the officer's statement. The Court found that the accused had reasonable grounds to believe his statement was voluntary and that his statement had been proven free and voluntary."
5_2010nspc18.txt,"The on-site supervisor was convicted of two offences under the Fall Protection and Scaffolding Regulations (failing to ensure a guardrail was installed at the perimeter of the work area and failing to ensure that an intermediate or 'mid' guardrail was installed) after a mason was killed when he fell from scaffolding on the job site. Prior to the mason beginning work for the day and the supervisor temporarily leaving the site, he had told another employee to install a 'mid' guardrail but no such rail was in place when the mason fell. The court found that having decided to use guardrails, the defendant was required to make certain that those guardrails were, in fact, constructed in the manner prescribed in the regulations and to supervise and inspect the scaffolding before work was undertaken, no matter the experience level of his crew. In regard to the first count, what the supervisor thought might be a substitute for part of a proper guardrail system did not comply with the regulations. The defendant will donate $2,000 to the Public Education Trust Fund and make 18 presentations at various venues over the next 18 months; he will appear in court on a specified date to provide a status report on his progress in this regard. This was not a case of reckless disregard or deliberate indifference to the legislated safety measures and the defendant's degree of moral blameworthiness was at the lower end of the continuum as he neither created nor negligently left in place a hidden hazard. Both the actions of another workman and the deceased's own actions had contributed to the fall.","The defendant was found guilty of two breaches of the Fall Protection and Scaffolding Regulations of the Occupational Health and Safety Act. He failed to ensure a guardrail was installed at the perimeter or open side where a person was exposed to a hazard of falling contrary to s. 7(1) and 9(1)(b) of the Act and in both cases, he thereby committed an offence contrary to S. 74. HELD: The Court found that the defendant did not create or negligently leave in place a hidden hazard, which caused Mr. Myles to fall off the work platform. He suffered serious injuries and a short time later, he died as a result of his injuries. The Court also considered the factors of proportionality and parity in assessing the appropriate sentence."

The appellant is 38 years old and at the time of the offence was employed as a long distance trucker by Westcan Bulk Transport. He had no criminal record. Westcan is transporter of bulk cargo in the four western provinces and the western United States. His employer advised him that because of the nature of their business and uncertainty surrounding the appellant's ability to enter the United States as a driver of one of their trucks, they had no choice but to terminate his employment.

Such an appeal can be taken on the following grounds: (a)the committee exceeded its jurisdiction; (b)it failed to observe the rules of natural justice; (c)it made an error of law; (d)its findings can not be reasonably supported by the evidence which it was entitled to consider. 2) The Court found no error of jurisdiction or failure to observe the rules of natural justice. 3)The Court found no palpable or overriding error in the facts as determined by the Committee based on the evidence.","This was another appeal in a series of cases wherein a medical doctor has been reassessed and ordered to repay money for billings already received as a result of services provided to patients. The Saskatchewan Medical Care Insurance Act provides that a physician who is aggrieved by an order of the joint medical professional review committee may appeal to a judge of the Court of Queen's Bench. There is no further right of appeal. HELD: The Committee's decision was set aside on the merits. There was insufficient evidence before the Committee to constitute proof that Huerto's delivery of medical services was unacceptable from a medical perspective. The Committee exceeded its jurisdiction by abusing its discretion. The Court established the following as the grounds on which this court will interfere with the decision of the committee: 1)The Committee did not have the discretion vested in it by the legislation in conducting the review and hearing with respect to this matter and did not exceed its jurisdiction in undertaking the review. 2)There was no evidence to support the Committee's conclusion that the Committee misinterpreted the Act. 3)The committee did not abuse its discretion by placing significant emphasis on statistical comparisons when it said that such statistical comparisons were of little value when his approach to practice involves more extensive patient visits and testing procedures and no hospital care. 4)It did not exercise its unfettered discretion to determine the rate of payment for the same time period and to determine whether it was acceptable to the Committee. 5)There is no basis for setting aside the decision on this basis. 6)The Court reviewed the evidence and concluded that the respondent's practice was not acceptable. It gave undue consideration to the economic criteria, which is not directly related to the issue of medical care.

6_1997canlii9876.txt,"The respondent was hired as an account manager by the appellant. She did not reach her planned sales goals during her employment, and became depressed. She took six weeks off work on the advice of her doctor. When she returned from sick leave she was dismissed by the appellant, who had already decided to terminate her employment after concluding that she was not able to handle the job. She claimed damages for mental distress for the sudden and callous manner in which she had been dismissed. The jury awarded the respondent $20,000 in lieu of notice and $60,000 damages for mental distress. The appellant appealed the award for mental distress. Per Hallett, J.A., Roscoe, J.A., concurring, allowing the appeal, that the suddenness and callousness of a dismissal does not constitute conduct that gives rise to an actionable wrong separate and apart from the cause of action for the dismissal without notice. Per Freeman, J.A., dissenting, dismissing the appeal, that a degree of mental distress is always likely to accompany the termination of employment. However, when the employer's conduct aggravates the mental distress beyond the degree which can be remedied by agreement or reasonable notice, a right to further damages arises.","The appellant Healthvision Corporation, which sells computer systems including hardware and software to hospitals and other health care facilities, appealed a jury award of $60,000 damages for mental distress brought by the respondent. The appellant had no history of sales in the Atlantic Provinces and it was expected that she would take three or four years to develop the territory. Her office was stripped of everything but the desk and telephone and all files, including her notes, were removed to the Toronto office. She rejected the offer and brought action for wrongful dismissal. HELD: Appeal allowed. 1)While aggravated damages may be awarded in actions for breach of contract in appropriate cases, this is not case where they should be given. 2)While mental suffering would not have been in the reasonable contemplation of the parties at the time the dismissal was made, mental distress would have been a separate 'actionable wrong' from the breach itself."
6_1999skqb124.txt,"The plaintiff who had been employed by the defendant's predecessor for 23 years as office manager and bookkeeper until 1997, brought an action for damages against her new employers for dismissal without adequate notice. The plaintiff took stress leave and requested to be relieved of her duties as office manager in 1998. The action proceeded under the simplified procedure in Part Forty of the Queen's Bench Rules. HELD: 1)The conduct amounted to constructive dismissal entitling her to withdraw services without a reduction in the notice period. Although the defendant had numerous complaints the plaintiff was not dismissed for cause. Her termination of employment related only to her reduced position as bookkeeper which was for an indefinite period of time. Her employment had already been terminated by notice of nearly a year. She remained entitled to notice to March 31, 1999 at her salary at the time of termination and to medical expenses that would have been covered but without bonuses or extra payments for sick pay. 2)The defendant did not establish the plaintiff ought to have done more to mitigate her loss. There was no basis for punitive damages nor for an extension of the period of notice.  3)The net earnings between May 1998 and March 1999 were deducted after deducting $50 for the cost of qualifying for that employment. Amounts owing by the plaintiff to the defendant were to be deducted. 4)The plaintiff was entitled to interest in accordance with the Pre-judgment Interest Act. 5)The defendant could make no deduction for insurance benefit payments. Sections 45 and 46 of the Employment Insurance Act was drawn to their attention. 6)The plaintiff was awarded costs. Fees were to be taxed on column 2. 7)The plaintiff was to deliver a copy of the calculation of the judgment. Either could issue judgment with the other's consent as to form and content. An application for further directions could be made.","The plaintiff's action is for wrongful dismissal or, stating it more correctly, for damages for dismissal from her employment without adequate notice. The action was under the simplified procedure in Part Forty of The Queen's Bench Rules. At trial, the affidavits-in-chief of the plaintiff's witnesses were marked as plaintiff exhibits and the witnesses were then called for cross-examination by the defendant, followed by redirect questions from plaintiff's counsel. At the conclusion of the action, the plaintiff was given written warning listing grievances of the employer. The plaintiff carried on her duties in much the same way as she had done previously. These ways were not fully known to the new owners. The employer is entitled to the benefit of the services of its employee during the period of notice but acts which constitute constructive dismissal entitle the employee to withdraw her services without reduction of the time of notice. HELD: The conduct to which the plaintiff refers may be viewed as constructive dismissal and was accepted as such by the plaintiff by letter on May 25, 1998. But her employment had already been terminated by notice of nearly a year."
6_2000skqb94.txt,"A jury determined the plaintiff was constructively dismissed from his employment as park superintendent in 1997 and awarded damages for failure to give reasonable notice. The defendant claimed the contract of employment was all inclusive; that the plaintiff exaggerated the amount of time he spent on the job in winter; that the reduced winter hours were not in lieu of overtime pay as he was a manager within the meaning of s.4(2) of the LSA; the doctrine of estoppel or waiver applied as he never claimed a right to holiday pay for 10 years and the employer relied on his not doing so; if the plaintiff is entitled to holiday pay he should only recover back to April 1990 as he is limited by the Limitation of Actions Act; it should not be based on wages plus truck allowance as wages as defined in the LSA does not include allowances for costs. The claim for unpaid holiday pay claimed from April 1988 to October 1997, based on his wages plus one-half his truck expense allowance, was reserved pending a decision by the Court of Appeal as to whether the Court of Queen's Bench has jurisdiction to determine the issue of entitlement to holiday pay. HELD: The claim was dismissed with costs.  1)The Court of Appeal held in Kolodziejski v. Auto Electric Service that the Queens' Bench has jurisdiction to entertain a civil action for non-payment of holiday pay. 2)The plaintiff may rely on s.30(1) of the LSA to establish he is entitled to holidays and on s.33 to establish he entitled to pay in lieu of taking holidays. The onus then shifts to the defendant to prove it complied with some exception in the LSA. Section 75 prevents an employee from waiving his or her entitlement. Whether the plaintiff asserted his right to holiday pay or not, he remained entitled to his annual holidays in accordance with the LSA. 3)The plaintiff can claim for any holiday pay in lieu of time off that he can establish he was entitled to from April 1990 to his termination date. Section 3(1)(f)of the LAA states that a cause of action for recovery of money under a contract, express or implied, must be commenced within 6 years of the date on which the cause arose. 4)The plaintiff clearly indicated that a portion of the truck allowance was made to avoid paying tax. As such it would be contrary to public policy for the Court to appear to endorse the plaintiff's actions by calculating his holiday pay on the basis of his wage and this portion of his truck allowance.  5)The defendant's position that the contract included a component of holiday pay each month was inconsistent with its position that the plaintiff took these days off as holidays during the year. The contract of employment did not include a component of holiday pay in lieu of time off.  6)Failure by the defendant to keep records for the purpose of inspection by the minister does not result in a reverse onus. The onus remains on the plaintiff to establish what holidays he did not take. 7)The plaintiff admitted to taking time away from his duties for personal time and for city business as mayor. The plaintiff was not there in his capacity as superintendent. Section 31(1)(b) indicates that an employee shall be permitted to take holidays in one uninterrupted period. The defendant allowed the plaintiff to take days off in any manner he chose. It was inconsistent that the plaintiff's failure to comply with the notice requirement meant for the benefit of the employer could be used by an employee to disclaim that his days off were holidays. 8)The plaintiff was clearly a manager within the meaning of LSA. Even if he were not a manager, he failed to prove, on a balance of probabilities that he worked overtime hours in excess of the statutory minimum in order to qualify for overtime. Any days off taken by the plaintiff could not be considered taken in lieu of overtime. The days he was away were holidays as defined in s.30 of the LSA. 9)He did not establish he did 3 weeks holidays.","The plaintiff sued for damages from the defendant alleging he was constructively wrongfully dismissed from his employment with the defendant. The plaintiff elected to have the determination of liability and the assessment of damages determined by a civil jury. The jury determined that the plaintiff was constructally dismissed and awarded the plaintiff damages. HELD: The jury trial was to be held in front of myself as judge alone and would deal with the issues, both factual and legal, with respect to holiday pay. The defendant argued that the allowance was really a wage disguised for the purposes of avoiding paying income tax. It would be substantially prejudiced if the plaintiff were now allowed to assert that right. Further, the defendant claimed that if the court found that the defendant's holiday pay was not all-inclusive or that it did not exceed the minimum standards set out in the LSA, the plaintiff should only be entitled to recover back to April 1990 as the plaintiff is limited by the Limitation of Actions Act."
6_2001canlii365.txt,"The accused was charged with impaired driving (Criminal Code ss.255(1) and 253(a)) and with operating a motor vehicle while having a blood alcohol concentration exceeding .08 (Criminal Code ss.253(b) and 255(1)). Issues included whether the Court should enter a stay of proceedings and award costs, given the failure of the Crown to produce a standard alcohol solution (SAS); could mouth alcohol have invalidated the roadside screening test; did the arresting officer have reasonable and probable grounds to demand a breath sample; was the accused denied his right to counsel; was the breathalyzer test administered as soon as practicable; was there evidence to the contrary? HELD: The accused was found not guilty on count #2 (exceeding .08). Count #1 (impaired driving) was dismissed during the trial.  1)The court was cognizant of the burden of proof and had reviewed the decision of R. v. Lifchus concerning reasonable doubt. 2)The accused's testimony was rejected as not being credible. 3)The burden lies with the applicant on an application pursuant to ss.7 and 24(1) of the Charter in which the defence alleges the accused's right to make full answer and defence has been infringed. The question remained whether once the defence established it sought the SAS but it was not provided for whatever reason, had it discharged its burden or must it prove the failure to produce the SAS solution could have a meaningful outcome on the trial. 4)The accused's s.7 Charter right to make full answer and defence was infringed by the failure of the Crown to produce a sample of the SAS solution in this case. In light of the Bourget and Kalafut decisions, the Crown has had ample opportunity to establish a system for routinely saving the solution until after a case has been concluded. It would bring the administration of justice into disrepute were the Certificate of Analysis admitted into evidence. It was more appropriate to exclude the Certificate of Analysis than to grant a stay of proceedings.  5)Costs are rarely awarded in criminal proceedings. Given the evidence presented concerning the usefulness of testing a representative SAS ampule had it been produced, the court was not persuaded costs should be awarded. 6)There was no evidence that created a reasonable doubt as to the time that elapsed or that there may have been mouth alcohol which may have invalidated the roadside screening test. Both the subjective and objective tests were met. The arresting officer, who has no reason to believe an accused has consumed alcohol in the last 15 minutes, may administer the roadside screening test without delay, but to do so carries with it a certain risk that there may be subsequently evidence which will invalidate the results (affecting the objective element of the test). Further, the officer has no duty to routinely wait 15 minutes before administering the test nor to ask the accused whether or not alcohol has been consumed in the preceding 15 minutes. However, if there are circumstances which suggest the officer should have waited or inquired about alcohol consumption, this may affect the reasonableness of the officer's belief (the subjective test). 7)There was nothing in the evidence to support the submission that the speedometers need to be checked to support the officer's evidence. The officer was acting in the lawful execution of his duty in stopping the accused's vehicle. While doing so he detected an odour of alcohol on the accused's breath which gave rise to the demand for a roadside screening. 8)The informational component of the right to counsel was satisfied. There was no evidence the accused misunderstood his right nor that he was not given sufficient opportunity to contact counsel. He declined twice, giving a clear and unequivocal waiver. Absent special circumstance, the police cannot be expected to draw information out of the accused. 9)The samples were taken as soon as practicable. It was accepted that there was typically no one available at the detachment in the small community and was sufficient reason to not consider attending there given the proximity of the city. The officer tried the closest detachment but found no one there. It may have been more important to question the judgment of the officer to return to the Saskatoon detachment if the delay had been more significant. On the face of it, the delay of 27 minutes did not seem unreasonable. 10)The statutory presumption applied. There was no evidence to the contrary as the accused's evidence was rejected. The court reviewed R. v. Gibson and considered s.258(1)(c) and (d.1) of the Criminal Code.","The accused was charged with impaired driving and operating a motor vehicle contrary to s. 253(b) and s. 255(1) of the Criminal Code. The accused was stopped by the RCMP at 1:40 a.m. when he observed the accused driving his vehicle 70 km per hour in 40 km zone in the town of Martensville. Upon coming into contact with the accused, the officer noted a distinct smell of liquor and a slight redness in the accused's eyes. The officer asked the accused if he wished to contact a lawyer and the accused responded that he did not wish to. When asked if the accused had reasonable and probable grounds to demand a breath sample, the accused stated that he had not. He did not elaborate on the reasons for the delay in responding to the officer's letter of December 8, 1998 until May 1999, when he apologized but did not recollect seeing the letter until April 30, 1999. HELD: The accused's right to production and distribution of the standard alcohol solution was not infringed upon. The Court reviewed the decision of the Chief Justice of the Court of Queen's Bench written at the first level of appeal and found that it was the Court's usual approach to render a decision once all the evidence is before the Court; this avoids unnecessary splitting of the case. The defence argued that the accused should be produced only upon the accused establishing at trial some basis to question the suitability of the solution. This was not a case of inability to comply but rather the refusal by the Crown to produce the requested ampoules."

These parents demonstrate little understanding of the effects of conflict on child. The child is merely reacting to the idea that he has his mother's full permission to go. It is one reason both parents are often requested to share transportation of child for access when there is geographical separation.

The father now applied for interim sole custody, alleging that the ongoing extreme conflict between the parties was adversely affecting the children. An assessment recommended that the children live with the father and have access with the mother. Father granted interim sole care, custody and control of the children. The serious concerns raised by the assessment satisfied the threshold requirement of a material change in circumstances; the urgency of the concerns required immediate action.","This is an application by the respondent to vary the terms of the 2001 Corollary Relief Judgment respecting parenting arrangements.

The children are close to both parents but are more relaxed in the home of their father. There is a relaxed, casual nature to the children's intimacy with their father that allows for greater clarity of disclosure and discussion of needs, as well as sharing of day-to-day events. The ongoing conflict has adversely impacted on the children. An assessment report was completed in 2004 and 2005. There were thirteen recommendations and the most fundamental was that the children be placed in the primary care and custody of the father, Greg Patterson. All other recommendations were to be implemented at the very earliest opportunity."

The documents related to three separate occasions upon which the applicants sought the advice or assistance of a lawyer in relation to proposed transactions. The documents in issue were originally in the possession of their accounting firm. At issue was the extent to which solicitor-client privilege could be asserted in relation to communications with and documents prepared by third parties.

One letter appeared to be advice offered by the accountants to the applicants.  3)The applicants abandoned their claim for privilege with respect to handwritten notes summarizing share value and fair market value of assets which had been prepared by the accountants other than for the purpose of obtaining legal advice. The claim of privilege was abandoned for a declaration of gift and minutes of a director's meeting in 1991. 4)It has been clearly established in case law that even though a client may look to his/her accountant rather than a solicitor for advice in relation to the law of taxation, the applicants must show the documents were protected by solicitor-client privilege and not merely accountant-client privilege. 5)Although solicitor-client privilege is defined in s232(1)(e) of the ITA, the issue had to be resolved in light of the common law test for privilege. 6)Privilege may extend to accountant communications where the accountant is acting as agent or representative of the client for the purpose of seeking legal advice from a solicitor.

The accused was charged as the owner of the vehicle, not necessarily the driver. The offence was the result of a speed monitoring camera and the Act allows the Crown to complete their case without calling any witnesses. The accused testified that he did not speed past any highway workers or equipment. He said that he was following a pilot vehicle when he passed the workers and equipment and only sped up after the pilot vehicle turned around when there were no more workers or equipment. The picture of the accused’s vehicle from the speed monitoring camera did not show any highway workers or equipment. HELD: The person who tested and deployed the speed monitoring camera provided affidavit evidence that the picture was taken within a marked construction area but it did not say that the accused was speeding as he was passing highway workers or occupied highway equipment.

The court found that the offence under s. 203(1) of The Traffice Safety Act is a strict liability offence and that its documentary evidence proves every element of the offence. The only aspect of the Crown's case that the accused disputes is that he passed highway workers in a marked construction area, or when passing a highway equipment actually on the highway and with its warning lights operating. The accused is not charged as the driver of the vehicle but as its registered owner. Section 273 of The Traffic Safety Act makes the registered owner liable for the driver's misconduct when the vehicle is driven by anyone who has the owner's actual or implied consent to do so. The Court found the accused not guilty on the following grounds: 1) he observed the vehicle apparently travelling above the speed limit when it passed a highway worker or flag person and that he recorded the vehicle's speed immediately after it passed the workers or equipment, or 2) the speed monitoring device recorded its speed.  3) the Court found that there were highway workers and other highway equipment in the speed monitored zone in the area.

7_2014skqb116.txt,"Tax Law – Contract for Services – Payment of PST The plaintiff has the onus of proving it is not liable for the payment of PST on a balance of probabilities. Parties are entitled to structure their legal relationships as they see fit. The Court must determine whether the tax is payable based on the agreements as constructed between Husky and the third parties. There was no evidence that Saskatchewan Finance and the third party contractors entered into an agreement to alter the nature of the contracts so that Husky paid PST when it would not otherwise have been obligated to pay. The evidence established that Husky determined the way in which bids were submitted and the way Husky was invoiced. In each contract, Husky required that the bid include a price for service and price for materials. In each case, it was contemplated that PST was in addition to the price bid for the materials provided. The contracts between Husky and the third parties all contain provisions and terms that provide for the sale of materials to Husky. On the basis of the contracts, there was a sale of tangible property under the PST Act. Husky was the user or consumer of the cement. The third parties were providing materials and services to assist in the construction of the oil well. Husky has failed to establish that the contracts were supply and install contracts. Husky was the ultimate user and consumer of the tangible personal property. Husky is not entitled to rely on mistake of law. Husky has failed to establish on a balance of probabilities that it is entitled to a refund of the PST it paid on well cementing contracts between itself and third parties. The claim is dismissed.","HELD: The plaintiff sought a refund of the Saskatchewan Provincial Sales Tax it paid on well cementing contracts it had with the third parties. The Government of Saskatchewan had joined the cementing service contractors as third parties in this action. The plaintiff had received a refund in the amount of $393,289.73 from the third party contractors for the period 1996 to 2001. The second party, a cementing and reservoir stimulation service contractor, paid $179,765.67 as refund of PST which the plaintiff claimed it had paid in error for a period of January 1996 to September 2001 on materials supplied and installed by the contractors in the performance of oil and gas wells. The third party, Sanjel Corporation, based in Alberta, Canada, and based in Nova Scotia, brought an application to be allowed to defend the liability of the government of Saskatchewan to Husky at trial. An order was made, and third parties were allowed to defending the liability to the Government at the trial. At trial, the matters to be adjudicated on the pleadings are whether Husky is entitled to refund of its PST from the Saskatchewan Government, whether the amount to be refunded is to be reduced by virtue of the limitation period set forth in s. 56 of the Department of National Revenue Act, R.S.C. 1985, c. N-16. The manufacturing and processing cases are of significance in this proceeding. Even if Husky was not liable to pay the PST, the second party contractors owe the S.G. PST, in undetermined amounts, on materials they consumed in performance of their contracts with Husky. HELD: Husky Oil's claim for refund was barred by ss. 50(4) of The Revenue and Financial Services Act and s. 6 of The Limitations Act. 1) The plaintiff was the final user and consumer of the materials provided pursuant to the contracts between the parties. 2) The Government was not responsible for the payment of PST to the plaintiff. 3) The court found that the plaintiff was entitled to judgment against the defendant. 4) There was no mistake in the Government’s representations and interpretations in collecting and remitting the PST. The Court found that if the Government was liable to refund the PST the plaintiff would be entitled to a refund. The court also found that there was a mistake of law in the awarding of the PST by the Government. 5) The Court held that the court was not bound by s.50 of the Act or s.6."

Deputy rentalsman's decision on the landlord's application for possession was rendered May 13, 1994 showing the animosity which continued to exist between the landlord and tenant. The deputy rentalsmansman had a discretion to determine those cases where an abatement of rent is appropriate.

The sentencing judge relied solely on the principle of rehabilitation, essentially ignoring the other sentencing principles including the level of gravity, the principle of deterrence, the need to denounce such acts, the sentence imposed on the co-accused, and the need to protect the public. A sentencing circle was inappropriate given the level of violence, his risk to re-offend, his consistent ignoring or refusal to follow court orders, and the fact that a penitentiary term was called for in such circumstances.

She must have considered whether an express trust existed because that was exactly what the appellant's evidence suggested and exactly what the trial judge rejected in her findings of fact. Since the funds in question were not given to the appellant as a gift, and were not given to him in trust for the grandchildren, they must of necessity revert to the estate. In the case of the bank deposits, the funds would revert to the estate on the basis of a resulting trust. In the case of the RRIF, the funds would revert to the estate on a different basis. Since there was no gift to the appellant, and no trust in favour of the grandchildren, the monies must revert to the estate. 3) While the appellant characterized this issue as being one of mixed law and fact, it was essentially one of fact alone, the issue was what the deceased intended when she transferred the bank deposits and designated the payee of the RRIF. The standard of review in respect of such an issue is palpable and overriding error. The judge made no such error.  4) The appellant asked for relief pursuant to s. 57 of The Trustee Act in respect of the money paid by him to the grandchildren. The appellant says he paid the monies to the grandchildren in the honest belief that he was carrying out the wishes of the deceased. The appellant knew from the outset that his sisters disagreed with his position and intended to take proceedings against him. The appellant's actions in distributing the funds without at least getting directions from the Court were imprudent for a trustee. The circumstances do not justify, on any equitable basis, compelling the innocent respondents to bear the loss to them occasioned by the trustee's imprudence","The appellant argued that the trial judge erred in law in failing to consider the effect of section 75 of The Queen's Bench Act, 1998, c. Q-1.01 upon the respondent's claim to the RRIF. The respondent brought an action against the appellant claiming that the funds were a part of the residue of the estate and obtained a judgment to that effect as well a judgment against him for the amounts they, as residuary beneficiaries, should have received. The appellant appealed. Dismissing the appeal, that the appellant's actions in distributing the funds without at least getting directions from the court were imprudent for a trustee, notwithstanding that he made the distribution upon legal advice that he was entitled to do so. The circumstances simply did not justify, on any equitable basis, compelling the innocent respondents to bear the loss to them occasioned by the trustee's imprudence."
8_2005skca27.txt,"Fulltext of judgment follows:[1] It will not be necessary for us to hear from the respondent. The appellant has failed to persuade us that Mr. Justice Koch erred in any material respect. In other words, we see no tenable basis for interfering with his decision. [2] The debtor clearly committed an act of bankruptcy under ss. 42(1)(e) of the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act, R.S.C. 1985, c. B-3, as a result of the sheriff's return of nulla bona to the respondent's writ of execution against the debtor. [3] That left Justice Koch to consider whether to dismiss the petition pursuant to ss. 43(7) of the Act or to stay proceedings on the petition pursuant to ss. 43(11). [4] As for the first, the debtor did not satisfy Justice Koch that he was able to pay his debts or that there existed other sufficient cause to dismiss the petition. Based on the evidence adduced by the debtor, we are of the view there is no basis to conclude that Mr. Justice Koch should have been satisfied of these matters. [5] As for second, concerning ss. 43(11), we note that the subsection contains discretionary power to stay proceedings. That, of course, serves to narrow the basis for intervention on appeal. We cannot say Justice Koch erred in any requisite respect in the exercise of this discretionary power. [6] Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed, with costs on appeal to the respondent to be taxed in the usual way.","The debtor clearly committed an act of bankruptcy under s. 42(1)(e) of the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act as result of the sheriff's return of nulla bona to the respondent's writ of execution against the debtor.

8_2009nssc261.txt,"The Trustee opposed the bankrupt's application for a discharge on various grounds. The bankrupt supported four children and had been discharged from the military due to illness arising from her active service. The bankrupt will be entitled to an absolute discharge once certain conditions are met, including the payment of one month's rent, the value of the horses and surplus income for nine months to the Trustee. The bankrupt's disability pension from Veterans' Affairs was not included in the calculation of surplus income as the public policy reason behind the exemption for proceeds received due to personal injury and a soldier's danger pay applied to this disability pension. The Trustee had no claim to the insurance proceeds received by the bankrupt following the loss of her home by fire as it was a modest sum used to replace lost personal exempt assets; the three horses were found to be owned by the bankrupt as opposed to her children, for whom she had purchased them as pets and were included in the value of her estate; the court exercised its discretion in determining the amount of surplus income, noting that the administration of the estate had been unusually hostile and it was important that the bankrupt be able to stabilize her family finances.",HELD: The application was granted. The court held its discretion in determining surplus income. The respondent was entitled to an absolute discharge once the following were done: 1) the respondent resolved the matter of the horse trailer as provided in paragraph [13] above. 2) she paid the Trustee $500 for rent. 3) she provided the trustee with the VIN number on the 2007 Cobalt vehicle and with the information required to complete the income tax returns.  4) the trustee was not entitled to any compensation for the loss of household goods which under section 45 of the Judicature Act are exempt. 5) The respondent's evidence at the hearing was that she did not provide funds for the purchase of her present residence in Wilmot. 6) The trustee was asked whether the respondent first bought the horses as pets for her children and raised the question of whether she had amounts of undisclosed and undeclared cash assets at the time of her bankruptcy. The trustee did not object to the respondent's request for bank statements for twelve months prior to the bankruptcy. 7) In the circumstances it is appropriate that the respondent pay surplus income of $325 per month for the basic bankruptcy period of 9 months. In the present situation this pension should not be considered in calculating surplus income in the context of determining whether the compensation is one time damage award or periodic payments.
8_2010skqb467.txt,"Employees were entitled to wage adjustments under the collective bargaining agreement. The plaintiff union brought an application for an interlocutory injunction requiring the defendant to pay employees who were retiring in 2010 their wage adjustments in the current calendar year. This was an issue because it would affect pensions and retirement dates. In the alternative, the union argued the employer should pay the entitlements before the year end on a 'best approximation' basis or be required to proceed to an expedited arbitration. The defendant brought a motion to strike or dismiss the plaintiff's motion under Queen's Bench Rules 99 and 173 on the basis that the issues raised were terms and conditions of the employment contract and outside the jurisdiction of the Court according to the terms of the collective bargaining agreement. HELD: The defendant's application was dismissed because the Court has residual discretionary jurisdiction to grant relief not available under a statutory arbitration scheme. The plaintiff's application for an injunction was also dismissed. While there may be a serious issue to be tried, the pleadings do not set forth a strong prima facie case. While there might be some irreparable harm to some employees, in general terms the losses can be dealt with through damages. It would be impossible for the defendant to meet a deadline two weeks away because of the complexity of the calculations. It is not appropriate to grant an injunction requiring the defendant to make payment before the end of 2010 and it is not reasonable to make payments based on best approximation. The Court has no jurisdiction to force arbitration on the parties.","The plaintiff union, SEIU-West, represents approximately 11,000 health care workers employed by the four defendant regional health authorities and their affiliates. The current collective bargaining agreement covers the period April 1, 2008 to March 31, 2012. The tentative agreement was reached in August 2010 and ratified by the union membership on September 16, 2010. However the formal CBA, very lengthy and complex document, was not signed until October 2010. The plaintiffs have provided abundant evidence that in practical terms the imposition of a deadline less than two weeks from now cannot conceivably be met. HELD: The motion to strike was dismissed. The defendants' motion to compel the defendants to make the required retroactive adjustment payments is dismissed. 1)It is not appropriate for the court to grant an injunction requiring the defendants' to make retroactive assessment payments before the end of 2010. 2)There might be irreparable harm for some employees, an example of which was provided to me in the evidence submitted on behalf of the plaintiffs. There may well be a serious issue to be arbitrated but for the purposes of the present application I find that it is not adequately framed in the pleadings and evidence before me to meet the applicable test. 3)The court is without jurisdiction to determine the issue pleaded based on the CBA and the Weber principle. It then becomes necessary to determine whether the plaintiffs are entitled to mandatory injunctive relief."
8_2012skpc79.txt,"The accused's neighbour disliked the accused and alleged that the accused drove his vehicle into hers. The police arrested the accused and found a fob that operated the locks on the doors of the vehicle and the engine hood of the accused's vehicle was warm. The accused was charged with hit and run and impaired driving. HELD: The Court found the accused not guilty of both charges. The Court found that the police breaches of the accused's Charter rights were numerous. The approximate 11 minutes of investigative detention was not an infringement of his rights but the combination of the officers' failing to inform the accused of the reason for his arrest and not giving his rights to counsel without delay, coupled with the illegal search and seizure of the fob and keys were in total breaches serious enough to bring the administration of justice into disrepute. The Court excluded the evidence of the fob and keys which further weakened the circumstantial case against the accused to the extent that the Crown failed to prove the accused was the operator of the motor vehicle.","HELD: The Court found that the breaches were numerous and point to ignorance on the part of the police as to the distinction between their powers upon arrest and investigative detention. The accused was found not guilty of both charges. The Court excluded evidence of the fob and keys which was significant part of a circumstantial case against the accused. The exclusion of the evidence of that evidence further weakens the police's evidence to the extent that the Crown has failed to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused was the operator of the motor vehicle. As the accused fell to the ground, he was handcuffed and in the back of a patrol car. The police officer who conducted the search did not inform the accused of the reason for his detention and he did not advise him that he could consult counsel."
8_2013skqb403.txt,"HELD: The application was dismissed. With respect to the issues, the Court found: 1) that the board had not relied upon the clause in the Policy Statement but on the evidence before it. It was not necessary to decide then whether the Policy Statement was ultra vires; 2) that the board’s interpretation that the Act granted discretion to the board to refuse to reimburse a specific medical treatment was reasonable; 3) that the board’s conclusion was reasonable. The scientific studies did not definitively stated that medical marijuana was effective. In some situations where a patient’s only recourse would to be to use a non-clinically approved drug whose safety and efficacy was still questioned, a determination that the medical aid was not necessary or required might be unreasonable, but not in this case where the applicant declined to try Sativex; and 4) that there was no evidence that the board based its decision on irrelevant considerations such as the potential political ramifications of paying for medical marijuana.","HELD: The application was dismissed. Based on the wording of the Act and the context of the relevant provisions, the Board's interpretation that the Act granted the Board discretion to refuse to reimburse a specific medical treatment is reasonable. The Board's decision to decline reimbursement on the basis that medical marijuana is not proven and therefore not 'necessary' or'required' might be unreasonable but this is not the case here. Based upon the wording, the context and the evidence the Board reviewed the medical marijuana issue, it is reasonable to deny reimbursement for medical marijuana because medical marijuana has not been proven, effective treatment for a long time. This conclusion is supported by research and is all the more reasonable when one considers the availability of Sativex. 1) The Board found that it had authority to determine whether it will reimburse any worker for medications whose medical efficacy was not established, pursuant to its exclusive jurisdiction granted by s. 22(1) to determine all matters in questions arising under the Act. However, the board found that the Board did not have the power to decide whether medical marijuana was necessary or required in all cases. 2) It is not reasonable to conclude that the benefits and safety of medical marijuana have not been established to the point that it is necessary as a result of a work related injury under s. 106(1). There is a line of analysis that could'reasonably lead the tribunal from the evidence before it to the conclusion at which it arrived'. 3) In the end, the application is dismissed. It is reasonable and deference must be given to it."
8_2014skqb299.txt,"HELD: The application was dismissed. The court held that the standard of review of the arbitrator’s decision was one of reasonableness. Section 25 of The Trade Union Act states that the conclusions of arbitrators are final and therefore the court noted they should not be interfered with lightly. Further, the court noted that the decision of the arbitrator was not of significant importance to the general public. The court reviewed the history of collective bargaining at the university and found that tenure was not dependent on the president’s personal recommendation in the past. The court found that the arbitrator’s reasoning was transparent and intelligible throughout. To include the word tenure in the definition of appointment or promotion was not the only conclusion that could be drawn. The arbitrator’s decision was within the range of acceptable conclusions and was reasonable.","The parties agreed to a lengthy statement of facts and the admissibility of number of documents before the Arbitrator. The parties disagreed on the standard of review to be applied to the arbitrator's interpretation of s. 51 of the Act. The University's position was that the Act gives the president the authority to overrule the Renewals and Tenure Appeal Committee. The Act is one of general law, that is both of essential importance to the legal system as whole, and outside the adjudicator’s specialized area of expertise. It relies on the Rucker decision and the British Columbia legislation, which hold that existing legislation must be read in such a way as to harmonize with the Agreement unless the operation of the Agreement is clearly excluded by the statute. The Arbitrator concluded that an award of tenure is neither an appointment nor promotion as contemplated by the Act, the Saskatchewan Act and this collective agreement can more readily be harmonized. HELD: The arbitrator found the Act to have exceeded his jurisdiction, made an unreasonable decision, or committed an otherwise reviewable error by misinterpreting sections of the University Act and in particular Section 51. 2. He concluded that the legislature has, by default or design, chosen not to restrict the Board's ability to set up the appropriate process and to award tenure itself. The court found that legislation might regulate the awarding of tenure in the same way as promotions and appointments, but there were also reasons why it might be left to the Board to regulate for itself."
8_2017skqb53.txt,"The accused was charged with the commission of sexual assault, sexual touching in relation to a 16-year-old and possession of child pornography. The accused came to police attention via a report by the complainant. She reported that the accused was often viewing a pornographic website while in her presence. The police prepared an information to obtain a search warrant (ITO). The ITO stated that the search would provide evidence of the accused’s viewing of pornography in the presence of the complainant, bolstering the complainant’s credibility. The ITO did not reference possession of child pornography. The ITO sought only a search of the “search history on the computer”. The issued warrant authorized a search of the accused’s computer and related devices and media, as well as documents pertaining to occupancy of the home and control of computer equipment. The complainant subsequently alleged that the accused had taken photos of her in the shower. The police did not amend the ITO to include a search for photos. The police executed the search and seized, inter alia, a laptop, an iPhone and CDs. The police delivered the material to a computer forensic specialist at the RCMP and requested a complete forensic search of the computer and phone to obtain a general search of the Internet history, pictures of the complainant and messages between the complainant and the accused. The police knew that the search of pictures was not included on the search warrant. The RCMP did not review the terms of the warrant prior to completing the examination and examined the entire contents of the laptop and phone. The accused submitted that his s. 8 Charter rights had been violated by the search and applied for exclusion of evidence pursuant to s. 24(2). The application proceeded by voir dire. The evidence was apparently located on either the accused’s laptop or cell phone, but the nature of the evidence obtained was not disclosed at the voir dire. The following issues were raised: 1) What is the correct procedure to be used to challenge evidence seized pursuant to a search warrant; 2) Was the Crown able to call amplification evidence and have it considered in support of the search and seizure conducted; 3) Did the ITO set forth reasonable and probable grounds that the items sought were evidence with respect to the commission of an offence; 4) Did the ITO use boiler plate clauses; 5) Did the ITO establish reasonable and probable grounds that the items were likely to be found in the place to be searched; and 6) What was the extent of a search of a computer or computer device. | HELD: Evidence of the accused’s search history was validly obtained. Other evidence was beyond the scope of the search warrant and obtained by violation of the accused’s s. 8 rights. The court held: 1) There is a two-step inquiry to be made when real evidence is seized during a search. The first step is an inquiry into constitutionality, and the second is reached only after a constitutional infringement has been established. Both inquiries impose an onus on the person claiming infringement. The standard of proof is the balance of probabilities. Challenges to constitutionality of warranted searches may involve either or both a facial and a sub-facial attack on the authorizing warrant. The record examined on facial review is fixed: it is the ITO, not an amplified or enlarged record;  2) In attempting to enter evidence of the complainant’s allegation that the accused took pictures of her in the shower, the Crown relied on an argument that the ends justified the means. This amplification evidence sought to allege a whole new offence and area of search. It was not admitted; 3) The point of this voir dire was not to determine admissibility of evidence outside of the search warrant context. There was no requirement that evidence sought in support of allegations made be directly connected to a complainant or the actual subject matter of a complainant; 4) The ITO did not use impermissible boiler plate clauses when read in its entirety. However, it did not set forth reasonable and probable grounds that text messages were evidence with respect to the commission of an offence; 5) The ITO provided sufficient description. It was reasonable to infer that search history meant search history of the accused with respect to the websites defined in the ITO. Further argument was required on whether text messages could be included; and  6) Police are not entitled to rummage through entire contents of a device searching for other evidence. The ITO sought only the search history.","The accused applied for relief pursuant to s. 24(2) of the Charter to exclude evidence seized through the execution of a search warrant. The accused called no evidence. He disputed the facial validity of the search warrant and also argued his s. 8 Charter rights had been violated. HELD: The application proceeded by way of voir dire. The determination of whether any evidence seized should be excluded was dependent on the decision on the above captioned issues. 1) The evidence seized was not disclosed at the hearing. It is apparently located on either the accused's laptop computer or his cell phone. 2) There was no evidence to the effect that the accused was viewing these sites while in the presence of the complainant or that he was in a position of trust or authority toward a person aged 16 years or so for a sexual purpose. The admissibility of this evidence is in issue. 3) The scope of evidence at an amplification hearing is limited to correcting'some minor, technical error in the drafting of their affidavit material' or to 'exclude erroneous information' in the ITO. This information is not part of the evidence at trial unless the parties expressly agree to its incorporation. To allow the Crown to supplement the record with Sgt. Parisien's testimony would be to countenance subsequent validation.  4) The Court reviewed the evidence before the hearing and found that it was the same material seized at the time the search was conducted. The Court also found that the Crown could not call amplification evidence and have it considered in support of the searches conducted. 5) The court reviewed the use of the Internet child pornography to wit: possessing digital files of a person who is or depicted as being under the age of 18 years engaged in explicit sexual activity or the dominant characteristic of which is the depiction, for sexual purpose, of a sexual organ or the anal region of a a person under 18 years, contrary to section 271 of the Criminal Code. 6) The accused did not provide any evidence at the amplification hearing as he did not specifically state that he had in his possession child pornography. The evidence of the discussion between the complainant and the accused is sought to be entered to amplify what Cst. Howell actually swore. 7) The issue of amplification is not whether the reviewing court would itself have issued the warrant, but rather that their sole impact is to determine whether there continues to be any basis for the decision of the authorizing judge."

When the appellant refused to consent, the respondent applied to the municipality for proceedings under the Ditches and Water Courses Act, which failed to achieve agreement. The respondent then filed a requisition with the county clerk pursuant to s. 7(1) of the Act which allows for the appointment of a municipal engineer. The engineer filed a report in which he concluded the respondent was entitled to open a ditch on the appellant's land, subject to certain conditions. In this action, the appellant appealed pursuant to s. 12 of the Act. Allowing the appeal, that the Act appears to assume that landowners will agree that a ditch benefits their land and provides a mechanism for apportioning cost. However, it does not give an engineer authority to expropriate land or take any interest in it, nor does it provide a means by which the appellant is forced to accept the ditch. Further, the common law prohibits the use of another's property to solve one's drainage problems.","The applicant, a subdividing developer, commenced construction of a ditch and drain on the Haverstock Estate. The applicant sought to have the deed of the land transferred to the Department of Transportation and Communications for conveyance and responsibility of the roadways. Application dismissed; the applicant was awarded costs of $3,000.00.

9_1996canlii8701.txt,"The appellant appealed his conviction of distributing infringing copies of three computer programs. He argued that the Crown did not prove that he had distributed the copyrighted material, or that the distribution was to an extent that it prejudicially affected the owners of the copyrights. Dismissing the appeal, that by placing the copyrighted computer pro-grams on his computer bulletin board in a compressed format, for ease of transmission, and allowing access by modem to the programs, the appellant was distributing the programs to the prejudice of the owner's copyright.","This was an appeal by a young offender from convictions entered by Judge Atton on three counts of distributing infringing copies of computer software contrary to s. 42(1)(c) of the Copyright Act. The appellant refers to the definition of 'distribute' in Black's Law Dictionary and argues that the appellant did not distribute the copyrighted material by placing it in a restricted area of the bulletin board in a'scrambled' format. The evidence accepted by the trial judge was that they were 'packaged' or 'compressed' for efficient storage and 'ease of transmission'. The second and third points raised concern the appellant's knowledge of the licensing agreement and the copyright. Dismissing the appeal, that the Crown did not prove the appellant 'distributed' the copyrighted materials, that he had the requisite knowledge, or that the distribution was to an extent that it prejudicially affected the owners of the copyrights."
9_2001canlii390.txt,"The accused was charged with operating a motor vehicle while his ability to do so was impaired and while over .08 (breath sample readings were 160 and 150 mg) contrary to s. 253(a) and s.253(b) of the Criminal Code, respectively. Issues arising during the trial included whether there was a breach of his s.8 and s.9 Charter rights to be secure against unreasonable search or seizure, and not to be arbitrarily detained; if there was a breach, was there a remedy under s.24(2); whether the evidence was sufficient to prove the offence of impaired driving beyond a reasonable doubt. The police officer concluded that he had reasonable and probable grounds for the breath demand based upon the accused sleeping through two green traffic lights, a strong smell of alcohol, and his somewhat bloodshot or glassy eyes. HELD: The accused was acquitted of both charges. 1)The evidence was sufficient to establish breaches of s.8 and s.9 of the Charter. The Certificate of Analysis constituted conscriptive evidence which, on balance, would not have been discovered by alternative means. Its admission into evidence might render the trial unfair and bring the administration of justice into disrepute. In the absence of the Certificate of Analysis, the evidence was not sufficient to prove the offence under s.253(b) beyond a reasonable doubt. 2)The strong smell of alcohol and somewhat bloodshot or glassy eyes were not sufficient to conclude there were reasonable and probable grounds for the demand. The court is required to examine the evidence as a whole. Every case will depend a great deal on its individual circumstances. It was not reasonable for the officer to assume that the vehicle not moving at the lights was a reliable indicator of impairment for these purposes. The evidence of slurred speech was not reliable as there was nothing in the officer's notes regarding slurred speech, nor had it been included in the investigation documents. The accused did not have any problems with balance or manner of walk, was cooperative throughout, and did not have any difficulty understanding his rights and the breath demand read to him from a printed card. The officer did not ask the accused whether he had been drinking. 3)The nature and quality of the evidence of a strong smell of alcohol, and eyes which were somewhat glassy or bloodshot, in the context of Stellato, was so frail as to leave a reasonable doubt as to impairment. The 'classic' signs of impairment (erratic driving, strong odour of alcoholic beverage, glassy and bloodshot eyes, slurred speech and unsteadiness on one's feet) was not intended to be an all-encompassing list, and its application will very much depend on the circumstances of a given case.","The accused was charged with operating a motor vehicle while his ability to do so was impaired and while over.08 contrary to s. 253(a) and 253(b) of the Criminal Code. HELD: The evidence of a strong smell of alcohol, and eyes which were somewhat glassy or bloodshot, did not constitute reasonable and probable grounds for the breath demand. The accused was cooperative throughout and did not have any difficulty understanding his rights and breath demand, which were read to him from a printed card. The Court found that the Certificate of Analysis constituted conscriptive evidence which, on balance, would not have otherwise been discovered by alternative non-conscriptive means. The admission of it into evidence might well render the trial unfair, and bring the administration of justice into disrepute.  1) In the absence of the certificate of analysis, the evidence is not sufficient to prove the offence under s.253(a)) of the Code beyond a reasonable doubt, and the accused is not guilty.  2) The Court concluded that the evidence of the accused remaining asleep through the green lights to be a reliable indicator of impairment, given that the accused was immediately awakened when the officer grabbed him by the wrist and he appeared to fully comprehend the circumstances in which he was involved. 3) The officer did not ask the accused whether he had been drinking. He walked him back to the police vehicle, and he did not observe any problems with balance or manner of walk. As well, the accused's co-operative throughout was not having any difficulty with his rights. The evidence was not reliable. 4) The accused's eyes were glassy and glassy.

9_2002nssc264.txt,"The defendant had a 25 year lease in a shopping centre which provided that the defendant would only use the premises for the purposes of the business of the retail sale of a complete line of food products, as well as general merchandising, as carried out by the rest of the majority of its stores. The defendant proposed to open a pharmacy on the premises. Another tenant in the shopping centre already operated a drug store and their lease provided that no other tenant would operate a drug store in any part of their premises. The other tenant brought an application for a interim injunction against the defendant. The receiver of the shopping centre also brought an application for a declaration that the defendant could not operate a pharmacy on its premises. The defendant objected to the receiver's application on the basis that it involved controverted issues of fact requiring a trial. Application for interim injunction dismissed on the basis that the applicant had not established irreparable harm; the receiver's application could proceed as an application as the potential for a factual dispute was insubstantial; defendant provided with the option of either accepting an adjournment to allow time for further investigation, the conduct of discoveries and the presenting of any further evidence or moving for the court's further consideration.","The defendant applied by way of originating notice for a permanent injunction against the defendant on the basis that the disputed questions of fact and law were beyond the scope of a summary proceeding. The defendant opposed the application for an interim injunction on the grounds that the evidence did not establish grounds for permanent injunction at the required threshold, that the plaintiffs have not established that they will suffer harm not compensable in damages if their claim is right and if interim relief is not given, and that the balance of inconvenience is with Sobeys not the defendant. HELD: The application was dismissed. 1)The defendant had ample opportunity to make investigations, conduct necessary discoveries, acquire productions and present further evidence. The plaintiff should have time to make any necessary discoveries and acquire productions. 2)Sobeys did not have the advantage of full review of the facts and law, and the validity or enforceability of the covenant may not be upheld at trial. The court would not automatically engage in a prolonged examination of the merits just because a breach of a negative covenant is alleged. There are occasions for assessing the evidence for the cause of action or defence more closely than is usual with respect to interim remedies. 3)The plaintiffs relied upon Miller v. Toews, 1990 CanLII 2615 and Canada v. LeBlanc for the proposition that the enquiry into irreparable harm is less vigorous or less telling in cases of breach of negative covenants. Unencumbered by the standing issues, the factual complication of the defendant's case is to be assessed simply in light of the lease terms and the conduct which is alleged to be breach of those terms."

9_2005skca89.txt,"This appeal arises from proceedings under The Family Property Act. The couple had lived together for several years. She sought judgment distributing their property. The property included a house in Vancouver, which he had acquired some years earlier with the financial assistance of his parents. The trial judge found that the respondent had acquired the house after the commencement of the spousal relationship and then went to hold that the petitioner was entitled to an equal share of its value with no reduction owing to the gifts or loans from his parents. The respondent appealed. HELD: Appeal allowed by the majority. Lane J.A. wrote in dissent. Majority: 1) The Vancouver property was acquired after commencement of the spousal relationship. The value of the property did not qualify for exemption under s. 23(1)(a) of the Act. There are a number of facts that merit emphasis. The respondent received $125,000 from his mother before the spousal relationship started. He still had that amount on hand when the relationship commenced. He used the money as a down payment on the purchase of the Vancouver house shortly after the relationship commenced. By establishing these facts, the respondent established the requisite conditions for the grant of an exemption of the value of the Vancouver property to the extent of the $125,000. 2) The trial judge erred in declining to take into account the loans of $100,000 the appellant received from each of his parents for the purpose of purchasing the Vancouver property. There was insufficient evidence before the trial judge to enable him to find that the mortgage debts were statute-barred and he did not make a firm finding on this point. The trial judge's finding that the respondent will not have to repay the loans was incomplete. He did not assess the loans in light of s. 21(3)(e) of the Act. On the whole of the circumstances concerning the Vancouver property and the length of the spousal relationship, there is no tenable basis for not giving effect to s. 21(3)(e) of the Act and the contributions made by the respondent's parents on his behalf to the acquisition of the property. The petitioner is entitled to share in the build up of the equity in consequence of the pay-down of the mortgage. Minority: 1) The Vancouver home ought to be distributed in accordance with s. 22 of the Act. The gift of $125,000 was made by the respondent's mother with the full knowledge that the parties were living together. In this case, the contribution by a third party on behalf of a spouse to the acquisition of family property is one of the usual factors outlined in s. 21 of the Act and it would be inequitable to exempt the gift from distribution. 2) The trial judge did not err in failing to deduct from the family property the loans given by the appellant's parents. He made a finding the loans were statute-barred. The trial judge clearly considered the legislation and his interpretation of the legislation was not challenged by the respondent. He also made the finding the loans would likely never be repaid. He simply used less than precise language.","This appeal stems from proceedings under The Family Property Act, s.S.1997, c.F-6.3, initiated by a nurse against a doctor. The two lived together for several years. She sought judgment distributing their property or its value equally between them. The trial judge held that the value of the house was exempt from distribution because it was acquired before the commencement of the spousal relationship between the parties. Alternatively, he contended the gift and loans served to reduce the value available for distribution. HELD: The appeal was allowed. 1)The trial judge did not err in finding that the parties had become'spouses' within the meaning of the Act in late June 1994 and, having regard for the equitable considerations mentioned in s.21 and 23, he ordered the respondent to pay an equalization payment of $354,709.41. 2)The evidence supported by the evidence supported the finding of fact. 3)The respondent was unable in principle to claim any right, title, or interest in the house itself. This is so because the house constituted an immoveable situated outside Saskatchewan. The value of this property did not qualify for exemption under s.23(1)(a). 4)The Court considered the equivalent of Mitchell v. Mitchell and Vilcu v. Grams, 1999 CanLII 12231 (SK CA), 172 Sask. R. 201(Sask.C.A.)."

The respondent pled guilty to a charge of robbery, an offence contrary to s. 344(b) of the Criminal Code. The respondent was sentenced to 90 days secure custody, 45 days community supervision, 1 year probation and a 10 year firearms prohibition. HELD: Appeal allowed orally. The sentence is set aside and a sentence of 12 months closed custody, 6 months community supervision, 1 year probation and a 10 year firearms prohibition was imposed in addition to the 90 days closed custody already served at the time of the appeal.  1) It was clear that the primary concern of the sentencing judge was that, in the wake of the Supreme Court of Canada decision in R. v. B.W.P.; R. v. B.V.N. 2006 SCC 27, a custodial sentence might not be open to him at all. It is the Court's view that the sentencing judge's conclusion that the decision in B.W.P. virtually ruled out custodial sentences for young persons under the Youth Criminal Justice Act was unwarranted. The gist of that decision is that under the Act the principle of general deterrence is not a factor to be taken into account and cannot be used to justify a sentence harsher than the circumstances of the offender and the offence would warrant. Nor is specific deterrence to be considered as a separate factor. 2) It is the Court's view that a long custodial sentence is necessary to accomplish the task of bringing the seriousness of the offence to the respondent's attention, and provide meaningful consequences to reinforce societal values without negatively affecting the respondent's likelihood of rehabilitation.","This was an application for leave to appeal and, leave being granted, an appeal by the Crown from a sentence imposed against a young offender pursuant to the Youth Criminal Justice Act, S.C. 2002, c.1. The sentence was set aside and a sentence of 12 months closed custody, 6 months community supervision, 1 year probation and a 10 year firearms prohibition were imposed. The respondent was sentenced to 90 days secure custody, 45 days community supervision and one year probation in addition to the 90 days closed custody already served at the time of the appeal. HELD: Appeal allowed orally. 1)The sentence imposed by the sentencing judge was demonstrably unfit, failing to take into account the seriousness of the offence, the culpability of the offender, the criminal history and other circumstances of the respondent and the principles of sentencing set out in the Act. The principle of general deterrence is not a factor to be taken into account and cannot be used to justify a sentence harsher than the offender and the offence would warrant. Nor is specific deterrence to be considered as a separate factor.  2)The respondent had already served 45 days in custody on remand."

Following discovery examinations, the great niece, who was the alternative executor appointed under the will, applied to have the executor, the deceased's husband, removed on the basis that his discovery evidence raised grave concerns about his mental capacity to continue to act as executor. Application to remove the executor dismissed; there was no medical evidence submitted in support of the applicant's claim that the executor was not competent to administer the estate and although it was clear from the discovery evidence that he did not have a clear understanding of his duties as executor, given that he was the only beneficiary under the will, he was the only person whose interest was at risk if he failed to properly administer the estate.","The applicant seeks an order removing the executor of the estate. The executor is the husband of the testator and was designated as the sole executor in her will in December 2000. The applicant, a niece, is the alternate executor.

He has passed over control of all his affairs, including the executorship, to a third party. 3) The application to remove the present executor was dismissed.  4) There is no reason to believe that the applicant's mental competency to continue to act as executor requires a clear understanding of how they are dealt with.

9_2010skqb122.txt,"FIAT: This is an application for an order pursuant to s. 63(2) of The Personal Property Security Act requiring the respondents or those in possession to deliver to the applicant four pieces of construction equipment. The four pieces of equipment were rented by applicant, Inland, to respondents, Mike Dery Holdings Ltd. and Giants Head Excavating Ltd. pursuant to an equipment rental contract entered into at Penticton, British Columbia, between April 21, 2008 and August 6, 2008. Inland did not register any security interest in the equipment in British Columbia or Saskatchewan until October 20, 2009. In the fall of 2008, the equipment was transported to Saskatchewan by Mike Dery Holdings Ltd. and/or Giants Head. In February of 2009, respondent 101138096 purchased the equipment from Mike Dery Holdings Ltd. and Giants Head for valuable consideration. Searches were completed to establish no registrations against the equipment. In April of 2009, the equipment was leased to Giants Head and a security agreement registered in Saskatchewan on May 5, 2009 listing the equipment as general property but not specifically registering the equipment by serial number. The security agreement was taken by 101138096 to secure the rental payments owed to it under the lease by Giants Head who had possession of the equipment. Mike Dery Holdings Ltd. and Giants Head defaulted under their payments to Inland and Giants Head defaulted in its payments to 101138096. September 18, 2009, 101138096 seized the equipment leaving it in the possession of Giants Head. The equipment was subsequently removed from Giants Head's possession and stored at the farm of Bruce Bakken. On October 19, 2009, 101138096 forwarded a letter to Giants Head confirming that 101138096 had elected to retain the equipment as payment for the outstanding indebtedness. As of this date a Personal Property Security registry search in Saskatchewan disclosed no security interest other than that of 101138096 in the equipment. Inland subsequently registered both a British Columbia and Saskatchewan Personal Property registry interest by serial number respecting the equipment and its original agreements of 2008. The issue before the Court is whether Inland by virtue of its Personal Property Security registration by serial number on October 20, 2009 has priority over the interest of 101138096 which registered earlier as general security without serial numbers but who alleges to have taken possession of the equipment and elected to retain the equipment seized in satisfaction of Giants Head's indebtedness October 19, 2009. This occurred one day prior to the registration of the security interest by serial number of Inland. HELD: The application is dismissed with costs to the respondents. The respondent 101138096 had a general security registered and had actual possession of the equipment in early October 2009 which therefore perfected its security while it retained possession. As of October 19, 2009 when 101138096 elected to take the collateral as satisfaction of the debt the only party to whom notice was required was the debtor Giants Head and his notice is in compliance with s. 61(1) and s. 61(3) of the Act. When the applicant completed its registration on October 20, 2009 the collateral was no longer available because of 101138096's election on October 19, 2009. The respondent perfected its security interest in the equipment which is subject to this application by taking possession thereof. Electing to take the collateral as satisfaction of the obligation secured and providing the required notices prior to registration by the applicant, transferred title to the equipment to the respondent 101138096 free and clear of the claim of the applicant.","FIAT. This is an application by Inland for an order pursuant to s. 63(2) of The Personal Property Security Act, 1993, requiring the respondents, 101138096 Saskatchewan Ltd. or those in possession to deliver to the applicant four pieces of equipment, namely, a 1996 Ingersoll-Rand Roller, a 2005 Komatsu excavator and a 2008 Trailmax TRD. The respondent perfected its security interest in the equipment which is subject to this application by taking possession thereof. Electing to take the collateral as satisfaction of the obligation secured and providing the required notices prior to registration by the applicant, transferred title to the equipment to the respondent free and clear of the claim of the applicant. HELD: The applicant's application was dismissed with costs to Inland as registration number 300516894 be discharged. 1) The search does not reveal A's security interest. 2) It is not revealed whether A perfected his security interest by serial number of the equipment. 3) This is not a case where a security interest perfected by possession when the secured party seized or repossessed the collateral; nor will it have priority over other perfected security interests. 4) There is no evidence that A obtains security interest either in B's goods. sells his goods to who in turn offers to sell them to D. conducts a registry search based on C's name, being the only search criterion available to him/her.  5) There are no security interests other than that of A in this type of equipment.  6) The equipment was seized and stored at the farm of Bruce Bakken, an acquaintance of the owner of a friend of the friend's who purchased the equipment for value and without knowledge of the security interest (section 30(6) and (7)).  7) Inland did not register any security interest with respect to this equipment until October 2009. When “serial numbered goods” are held by the debtor as equipment or inventory, the secured parties have the option to describe the goods in general terms or specifically by a serial number. The choice of one method of registration over the other is not without consequence. The security interest will be priority over the interest of subsequent buyer of the goods who acquired her interest in sale out of the ordinary course of the debtor's business and priority over judgment creditor or trustee in bankruptcy of the creditor.

He applied to the Court for an order of certiorari to quash the decision of the Academic Appeals Committee and the University Bylaws Committee Council and an order reinstating him as a student at the College of Medicine pending resolution of his appeal. HELD: The Court found that the Bylaws Committee Council exceeded its jurisdiction by reviewing the previous decisions made and drawing the conclusion that they were made fairly and properly. The Bylaw Committee determined the merits of the applicant's appeal and determined that it was not necessary to convene a full appeal board. There is nothing in the University policy to suggest that the Bylaws Committee has that power. The Bylaws Committee has exceeded its jurisdiction in this regard and its decision is quashed. The matter is returned to the Bylaws Committee to determine whether the applicant's appeal falls within the policy on student appeals and academic matters. The portion of the application requesting reinstatement of the applicant as a student pending the resolution of his appeal is dismissed. The applicant has a marginal academic record and there are a limited number of placements in the College of Medicine.

HELD: The application was dismissed. 1) The court is not able to interfere in the applicant's academic assessment and that the applicant can only obtain relief from the court if the proper procedures were not followed. The university submits they were. 2) A full appeal board was not necessary.  3) There is nothing in the policy to suggest the Bylaw Committee has such power. In fact, if the power existed in the Committee to determine the appeals on the merits, there would be no need for it to operate as a vetting step and of course no need to establish an appeal board."

They filed a plea of justification as permitted under s.611(1) of the Code. The Crown denied the truth of the plea pursuant to s.611(4) and the matter proceeded to trial. At the opening of their trial the accuseds applied for an order declaring ss.300 and 301 of the Criminal Code to be of no force and effect on the basis that they constituted an unreasonable limitation on their rights and freedoms guaranteed under ss.2, 7 and 11 of the Charter. The Crown admitted that ss.300 and 301 limited an individual's right to freedom of expression as provided by s.2 of the Charter but argued that this infringement was justified under s.1 of the Charter. HELD: Application allowed in part.  1)The onus of justifying the limitation of a right or freedom is on the party seeking to uphold the limitation and the standard of proof is by a preponderance of probability. 2)The standards against which a limit on a right or freedom guaranteed by the Charter can be shown to be reasonable and demonstrably justified are those underlying values and principles essential to a free and democratic society. While the right of free speech is important in our society, it is not unrestricted. 3)In order to justify an infringement of this right, it must be shown that: (i)the impugned legislative provision has an objective of pressing and substantial concern and (ii)there is a proportionality to the legislation in that: (a)the measures must be fair and not arbitrary, carefully designed to achieve the objective in question and rationally connected to the objective; (b)the means should impair freedom of expression as little as possible; (c)there must be a proportionality between the effects of the limiting legislation and the objective. S.300 of the Code meets these tests, and is therefore a reasonable limit on free speech and is valid. 4)Ss.611 and 612 of the Code, which permit a plea of justification do not create a reverse onus on the accused. They are procedural and merely serve to put the Crown on notice as to the accused's defence. The Crown must still prove that the alleged defamatory libel is knowingly false beyond a reasonable doubt. 5)S.301 of the Code makes it an offence to publish a defamatory libel whether or not the accused believes it to be true.

HELD: 1)The respondent's supplementary allowances were taken into consideration in finding a gross salary of $53,000.00 per annum. Due to an injury he was no longer able to work overtime but was working full-time. Should a medical discharge become necessary an application to vary can be brought at that time. 2)The petitioner suffered a substantial economic disadvantage. The frequent moves due to the husband's employment had disrupted the petitioner's employment and university education. However, the court must also take into consideration the economic advantage enjoyed as a result of the marriage including the pension plan of the spouse. 3)If the petitioner did receive the greater share of the household goods it can be attributed to partial compensation for her economic disadvantage. Shares in joint names were divided equally. Other assets were divided equally. 4)Upon the granting of the divorce the petitioner will be disqualified from receiving the pension survivorship benefits. The fair solution was to use the enhanced value of the 'With Survivorship Benefits' column and the date of adjudication was used as the valuation date. The combination method of valuation was used in view of the 15 year marriage and given the economic disadvantage suffered by the petitioner. 5)The parties agreed that child support should be set in accordance with the Federal/Provincial/Territorial guidelines based on the respondent's gross yearly income. $600.00 per month per child was awarded.  6)The court must seek to promote the economic self-sufficiency of each spouse. The petitioner's future plans were realistic. $800 per month until June 1, 2001 was awarded for spousal support.  7)Costs including one-half of the cost of preparing reports and pension valuations were awarded to the petitioner.","The parties agreed on their divorce based on their separation in excess of one year and that Mary be granted custody of the children with reasonable access to John upon reasonable notice.

The respondent indicated that the costs of maintaining herself and the children were approximately $2,462 monthly, two thirds of which were attributed to the children. Given the relative income of the parties as well as current income tax implications and the economic disadvantage suffered by Mary, it was reasonable and fair to set the date of adjudication as the midpoint between the retirement and termination."
b_1999canlii12407.txt,"The defendant, who was to install sewer and water lines on four lots for the hamlet, was charged with seven violations of the Occupational Health and Safety Act and Regulations. It had been agreed that the offences were strict liability. The principle issue was whether the defendant had an obligation imposed by law with respect to the workers and if so whether he discharged it by exercising due diligence in the circumstances. The essential facts were not in dispute. HELD: The defendant was found guilty on all offences.  1)There is a legal duty on an employer under the Act to take steps to supervise and oversee excavations to ensure the usual protocols for safety are met. This requires at a minimum the presence of an experienced person on site. Any reasonable person with some knowledge of worksite safety would insist that the walls be properly sloped, that there be at a ladder or other method to get out of the trench and that first aid supplies were readily available. Supervision is essential particularly when the worker is inexperienced. The deceased had had no experience in sewer and water trenching. No inexperienced person should be allowed to work on such a potentially dangerous site without proper training and specific guidance and supervision. The Law is specific on the requirements to be met for safety of the workers on excavation and sewer and water hookups. 2)The remedial progress report was ruled inadmissible. There was no formal comment on the issue of admissibility. 3)The Act does not define due diligence but well established case authority defines it as taking reasonable care to avoid causing harm which is prohibited by law. 4)The Act does not apply to a contractor. The relationship had all the ordinary indicia of an employer/employee relationship. The defendant controlled the project, tools and materials and bore the risk of loss or profit, had the ultimate responsibility for the worksite, completion of the project and the payment of wages.","The defendant was charged with seven violations of the Occupational Health and Safety Act and Regulations. The defendant had obtained a contract from the Hamlet to install sewer and water lines on four lots in St. George's Hill. He arranged to hire an individual to do the backhoe work on the site without proper training and specificguidance and supervision. HELD: The defendant was guilty as charged on all offences. 1) The essential facts of this case are not in dispute and they are fairly straight-forward. 2) The defendant did not take any reasonable precautions to prevent death or injury to the workers whom he was responsible for on the worksite. Had he done this there at least would have been proper safety measures taken at the workite so that even with these inexperienced workers doing the job their safety could easily have been ensured by taking the simple and common sense steps mandated by the law embodied in the Act and regulations that govern workplace health and safety for example, properly sloping the trench).  3) There was no doubt in this case that the defendant had complete control of the two workers but that he chose not to supervise the work site because he was extremely busy with other business matter which had taken him to Laloche and then to Saskatoon when the trenching was being done. 4) The evidence of the remedial progress report was simply marked for identification pending the ruling of the court.  5) The court found that the uncontested facts were quite sufficient for the purpose of reaching a final judgement on the issues of admissibility.  6) No inexperienced person ought to be allowed to work on such a potentially dangerous site without the proper training, guidance and supervision by the defendant."

It was clear from the trial judge's acceptance of the evidence of the two paramedics who had noted the car parked in an unusual place and police officer who came along later, that he rejected the theory advanced by the appellant's counsel.

The appeal was dismissed. 1)The learned judge did not err in his assessment of whether the accused was caught by the presumption of care and control of his vehicle pursuant to s. 258(1) of the Criminal Code. He accepted the Crown's evidence that the accused occupied the seat normally occupied by the operator of the vehicle, it is presumed he is in care and controlling unless he can establish that he did not occupy the seat for the purpose of setting the vehicle in motion. The location of the ignition key was not relevant, given the fact it was located somewhere on the right side of the steering wheel. The learned judge, even though he appreciated the testimony of the ambulance attendants and the police officer over the accused’s version of what took place, did not accept the evidence over the other witness’ account. 2)It was clear from the learned trial that the evidence was accepted by the Crown and the Police officer who came along later that he rejected the theory that the appellant (notwithstanding that he had rebutted the presumption) was nevertheless in de facto control."
b_2000canlii4425.txt,"Plaintiff suffered soft tissue damage to knee when he tripped over a dolly cart in a building supply warehouse. Knee became swollen and infected and he was off work for 12 days. He claimed for pain and suffering, loss of income and loss of earning capacity. Plaintiff was found 60% responsible for injuries and defendant 40% responsible. Damages were assessed as follows: $8,500.00 for general damages, $5,000.00 as damages for loss of income and $1,000.00 for loss of ability to perform household tasks. The dolly cart out of view behind the counter was an 'unusual danger' which the defendant knew or ought to have known of and reasonable care was not used to prevent injury. However, the plaintiff failed to look at the floor as his attention was focused on the door. He assumed nothing had changed in the area from the time he entered the premises a few minutes previously. The plaintiff was in commercial premises and should have taken greater care to observe and avoid anything in his path. The plaintiff suffered an injury which restricted his activities for the first five months, to a lesser extent for the following year and to a very limited extent to the time of trial. There was no evidence to support a claim for diminishment of earning capacity.","The plaintiff injured his knee when he tripped over a 'dolly-cart' while attending at the premises of the defendant, J.D. Irving Limited, doing business under the firm name and style of Kent Building Supplies (herein 'Kent'). The plaintiff operated sole proprietorship known as Markham Contracting which is involved in house renovations through the winter period and landscaping in the summer. The physical activities required in the performance of his work necessitated his hiring employees for activities which he normally performed himself. However, the evidence does not support that all the difference in wages between 1995 as opposed to 1994 can be traced to the accident since, on the evidence, the plaintiff also sustained a broken wrist in May 1995. HELD: The plaintiff was awarded $5,000.00. The sum of $8,500.00 was more than reasonable in the circumstances and the sum was thereby awarded. 1)In the context of the present circumstances, the realization that some of the loss can be attributed to this accident and recognizing the need to provide fair and reasonable compensation, even where proof of actual amounts may be difficult or impossible, the sum is thereby awarded to the plaintiff. 2)The evidence as a whole was also clear that the presence of a 'cart' or a dolly' out of view would also be an 'unusual danger' notwithstanding knowledge of such dollies within the premises."
b_2001skca85.txt,"The Court of Appeal was required to determine the limits of its authority to change the application of the Rule against Perpetuities, an established common law principle, to a particular type of oil and gas lease. In 1950 Taylor entered a 'top' (head) lease for mineral rights with Freeholders Oil, effective upon the expiry of Imperial's interest in 1959. The new owner of the land recognized the assignment of the 1961 top lease sold to Tarragon in 1993. After reaching an agreement in 1993 in principle for a 'farmout' arrangement whereby Maxx agreed to drill the lands for Tarragon, Maxx concluded the top lease offended the Rule against Perpetuities and entered its own lease with the landowner. The trial judge held the 1950 Freeholders lease was void because it contravened the Rule against Perpetuities; although top leases do not offend the policy behind the rule, any modification of the rule is best left to the legislature; there was a breach of confidence. HELD: The appeal was allowed with costs on double column V. The action for a declaration that the top lease is void was dismissed with costs in Queen's Bench. 1)The top lease in question was not void as it did not offend the object and purpose of the Rule. The reasoning and approach of the Supreme Court of Canada in Salituro, Tolofson and Morguard was persuasive. The decision of the House of Lords in Arthur J S Hall demonstrates the need to re-examine archaic rules of common law which cannot be justified in modern society. The genius of the common law lies in its adaptiveness to changing times. Its basic principles are not meant to become rigid formulae. Common law rules may be tweaked to do justice between the parties when a rigid and mechanistic application of the rule would run counter to the object and purpose of the rule. Since the socio-economic and political conditions which gave rise to the creation of the Rule no longer exist, it was open to the Court to consider the application of the rule in the context of a commercial instrument such as the top lease in question.  2)Although top leases have been attacked on other grounds, this was the first case before the Saskatchewan Courts in which the Rule against Perpetuities has been advanced to void such a lease. The historical background and object and purpose of the rule were reviewed. The general purpose is to prevent the tying up of property to the detriment of society in general. The common law rule against perpetuities prevails over intention because it is not a rule of construction, but a rule of property. A mere possibility, or even a probability that the estate or interest may vest within the time is not enough. The 'wait and see' doctrine has been adopted by statute in some jurisdictions.DISSENT: The Court should not modify the Rule in the face of the significance of such a modification, the efforts of the legislature to legislate and the inability to deal with such issues as the retrospective operation of such a decision. The Rule against Perpetuities applies to this top lease. As there is no life in being in this case, the interest must vest within 21 years of its creation which would have been 1971. The Rule is not concerned with the duration of an interest but only that an interest may vest at a remote time in the future. The rule invalidates interests in land that vest too remotely.","The trial judge held that the lease was void because it breached the rule against perpetuities and allowed the respondents' action for declaration to that effect. He allowed the counterclaim by the appellant Tarragon against the respondent Maxx Petroleum for breach of confidence with consequent directions for an accounting and assessment of damages. The principal question on this appeal is whether the appellants' oil and gas 'top lease' with the late Harry Herbert Taylor should be rendered void. HELD: Appeal allowed. 1) Although the lease is in the public domain, it is only after the time of vesting has been ascertained, that determination can be made about whether that time is too remote and therefore in contravention of the rule. The policy behind the rule is not offended. 2) The court reviewed the history of the lease and concluded that it was intended by the parties to have a contingent relationship with future vesting as to the reversionary interest in the mines and minerals. As there was a possibility that the interest would not prevent the development and utilization of the lands, neither party had ever before experienced a situation where it was suggested the lease creating the interest was void. 3) The concept of 'top leases' is not unique or unusual in the Saskatchewan oil and natural gas industry. The evidence adduced at trial established that there are hundreds of such leases in this Province. The only thing that may be void is remorseless construction. In this case, the Court found that the phrase 'in the event' speaks to contingency and to the future. To ascribe to those words a definition equivalent to a way of describing reversionaries is to distort the words beyond recognition. The Court could not and decline to attempt to do so."

The Chambers judge found that such a claim was not available and the estate appealed. Appeal dismissed; the context of the legislation, its purpose and text all support the conclusion that the deceased's loss of prospective earnings is not an actual pecuniary loss to the estate.","Where a person is killed due to the fault of another, the person's estate may sue the wrongdoer for certain damages which have resulted in an actual pecuniary loss to the estate. HELD: Appeal dismissed. Where a person's life was shortened or that he had been killed by the defendant's tortious conduct, his estate could sue his executors for damages for loss of expectation of life. This is not an old statute that has been ignored by the Legislature in the many years since it was first enacted.

The defendant did not file affidavit evidence but opposed the application solely on the basis that recent amendments to the Queen's Bench Act precludes reference to minutes of settlement. HELD: The plaintiff was entitled to enter judgment for $15,000 plus costs of this application. A settlement agreement reduced to writing in no way offends the confidentiality required under s.28.1. The plaintiff is entitled to rely on the minutes of settlement and must be permitted to refer to them in his affidavit. Section 28.1 is not meant to apply to this situation. If a party to an action is unable to enforce a concluded settlement, the pre-trial process becomes meaningless. The legislation never intended such a result. There was no suggestion that there was non-disclosure, misrepresentation, duress or fraud in the execution of the minutes of settlement. Nor was it suggested the minutes were unclear or ambiguous.

Q-1.01 in accordance with minutes of settlement agreed to by the parties following a pre-trial conference on July 16, 2002. The defendant argues that the majority of the plaintiff's affidavit must be struck by reason of the fact the averments contravene s. 28.1 of the Queen’s Bench Act. HELD: 1) Once an agreement has been finalized and executed by parties there is no further requirement for such confidentiality with respect to the concluded agreement. If the parties had not reached settlement agreement any reference to such discussions, admissions, disclosures, concessions, negotiations or evidence arising from any such discussion in any subsequent proceeding would be prohibited. 2) The court should be hesitant in upsetting or rectifying minutes of a settlement unless of course there be something in the nature of fraud, incapacity of party or the minutes are too vague to enforce or are obviously incomplete. 3) There is no suggestion by the defendant that there was non-disclosure, misrepresentation, duress or fraud in the execution of the minutes of the settlement. There may, in certain circumstances, be exceptions where court will allow reference to be made to discussions, conversations and the like where such allegations are raised. However, this is not the case in this case. 4) There are no allegations that the settlement was amended or altered at that time.

His application was prompted by the relocation of the petitioner with one of their two children, Tyson. The sole issue on this variation application is the determination of the primary residence of Tyson. HELD: 1) The petitioner wants to move Tyson 5.5 hours away from the respondent. This also requires a change in access arrangements. These are changes in circumstances that are material.  2) The petitioner has developed a strong bond with Tyson. The respondent has developed a close relationship with the parties' other child Kailey. After Kailey went to live with the respondent, neither parent did much to facilitate the access of either child. Before the petitioner and Tyson moved, although a short distance apart, neither Kailey nor Tyson saw his or her non-custodial parent and sibling on a regular basis. Even telephone access has been sporadic. Both parents have established homes that accommodate only one child. 3) The petitioner's move must be considered in light of the circumstances that existed before the petitioner's relocation. The parties had already adopted a split custody arrangement without formalizing access or adjusting child support. 4) Permitting the petitioner to relocate is in the best interests of Tyson. It is important that Tyson continue to live in the home of the parent whose constant presence he has become accustomed to. The petitioner has always been Tyson's primary caregiver.

Shauna had foreclosed the option of returning to live with the petitioner.

b_2010skqb187.txt,"The plaintiff granted the defendant a mortgage over a parcel of land just outside the city limits. The defendant failed to make any payment. The plaintiff applied for foreclosure on the land and an order nisi for judicial sale. The defendant was a developer. He argued that the foreclosure action was void because the land was being used as farmland and was subject to protection under s. 9 and 11 of The Saskatchewan Farm Land Security Act. The other issues before the court were the appropriate period of redemption and whether the plaintiff could submit a bid that incorporated the value of the land as a 'credit' enabling the plaintiff to merely 'top up' the bid by the additional amount needed to reach the bid price. HELD: The Saskatchewan Farm Land Security Act (SFSA) did not apply. The undisputed evidence was that since the defendant acquired the land in 2007, their focus was to develop the land as an industrial park and they had undertaken a host of activities to achieve that purpose which clearly indicated that their intent was not to farm the land in the sense contemplated by the SFSA. There was no foundation to deviate from the usual redemption period of 90 days from the date of the decision. The bidding process in a judicial sale contemplates a level playing field for all participants. The fact that the plaintiff is likely to receive a significant cash payout from the judicial sale does not modify the desirability of obliging all bidders to pay into court the full bid price. Normal bidding rules shall apply. The plaintiff was entitled to costs.","HELD: The application was dismissed and the usual bidding rules applied. The court found that since the acquisition of the land in 2007, Alberta Ltd.'s focus and direction vis-à-vis the Land has been the undertaking of a host of activities designed to develop the Land into an industrial park. The Land was purchased by a developer for development; was being developed at the time this action was brought, and neither at that time nor since has there been any realistic involvement in farming so as to trigger the provisions of the SFSA and so engaged the plaintiff. The Court found that the purpose of the bidding process in a judicial sale remedy contemplates a level playing field for all participants. The fact that FMI is owed an amount on the mortgage and that it will likely receive a significant cash payout on sale does not modify the desirability and necessity of obliging all bidders to pay into court the full bid price. To do otherwise would be to pay heed to the financial strengths of one or more of the parties, or at least give preferred position to the entity seeking foreclosure. The purpose is more than simple accounting device and consequently, the fact that particular bidder will be receiving funds from the property should not enter into the judicial sale process."

b_2011nssc75.txt,"After a piece of family property was divided into two parcels, one of the brothers continued to use a driveway and maintain a garden on the other parcel. When this brother died, his son continued to use the driveway and garden, even after the second property changed hands many times. When the current owners of the second property refused to allow the continued use of their property, the son claimed that his use of the driveway was of right on the basis of expressed reservation or prescription. He argued that his uncle was incompetent when he executed a statutory declaration stating that the use of both the driveway and the garden had been with his express permission. Judgment for the defendants; there was no express reservation of the driveway in the deed to the second property and the plaintiff did not have a prescriptive right to use the driveway. Although the plaintiff and his father had used the driveway in a continuous, uninterrupted and peaceful manner for well in excess of 20 years, the statutory declaration showed that this use had been with the uncle's permission.",HELD: The Court found that the plaintiff had not shown that the reservation contained in the 1942 Eldard deed to the extent that it incorporated the Borden driveway. There was considerable and convincing evidence that the plaintiffs in the action had used the Bordens driveway for many years prior to it being blocked off by the Defendants. The Court also found that there was no expressed reservation shown by the plaintiff. The plaintiff was not satisfied on the basis of the Statutory Declaration or on the totality of the evidence that either of the parties in this case had used or incorporated the 'Borden driveway' prior to the deed being executed.

The court ordered that the child should be placed in the custody of J.A.’s mother as a person of sufficient interest for a period of four months pursuant to s. 37(1)(b) of the Act.

The plan was to return the infant to the parents' care in the same location as on November 23, 2015 with the support of grandmother TK and a friend and neighbour of BA's. The mother was not a person of sufficient interest at the time of the apprehension.

b_2016skqb162.txt,"HELD: The application was dismissed. The court held that pursuant to s. 39(9), it ordered that the transcript should be allowed to be filed and the appeal to proceed. The appellant had done everything required of it pursuant to the Act. The provisions of s. 39 did not require the appellant to follow up with the local registrar’s office to see if the transcript had been filed. In a case such as this, s. 39(9) of the Act provides the court with the ability to exercise its discretion to remedy the problem and ensure that justice is achieved where a transcript could not be filed within the six-month period.","The respondent argued the appeal must be dismissed based on s. 39(5) of The Small Claims Act. The transcript was not filed within the six month period set forth in ss.39(5). HELD: The transcript could now be filed and this appeal shall proceed to be argued and determined on its merits. The setting of the appeal date was confirmed. There will be no order as to costs in the circumstances.  1) The Act provides wide discretion to justice, always acting judicially, to do that which is required to be done to ensure justice is achieved between the parties. 2) The Court of Appeal in Ballantyne Saskatchewan Government Insurance, 2015 SKCA 38 (CanLII), 457 Sask 254 has recently provided guidance with respect to proper statutory interpretation. The respondent rests his argument on the provisions of ss. 39 of the Act. It appears for an appellant to “file the transcript” there is no action required beyond the request to Transcript Services. That agency then prepares the transcript and files it with the court. In that case, the court may make any order that the judge considers appropriate. 3) The transcript may be filed without the appellant having done anything incorrectly. There is no order on the part of the Court of Queen’s Bench that will not lead to absurdities. 4) In the circumstances where a flaw occurs through no fault of the appellant, the legislation provides this Court with the ability to exercise a discretionary remedy to fix that flaw and ensure justice was done as between the party. This discretionary remedy is consistent with intention of the s39(9). That subsection provides for remedy in the event transcript cannot be provided for the appeal. This is part of s39 and therefore must refer both to the absence of transcript and the failure to file within the 6 month provision, through a no faulte. The appeal is deemed to be dismissed pursuant to the provisions. 5) It would be an affront to the administration of justice to allow the transcript to be filed. 6) The court has determined that pursuant to ss.40(9) of the Small Claims Code, the transcript is filed and is to be given a broad and purposive interpretation. It must also be interpreted in a manner that will be reasonable to justify the departure from ordinary meaning. 7) It is an interpretation allowed by the wording used in the section. It avoids an absurd and unintended consequence. The appellant plays no role in the physical filing of the transcript."

The court found with respect to each issue that: 1) the presumption of competent trial representation had not been displaced. The trial lawyer’s decision not to cross-examine the complainant was a tactical one. She was very young and had difficulty expressing herself in the courtroom whereas she had given clear, coherent statements to the police shortly after the offence. The lawyer determined that it was not beneficial to the appellant’s position to highlight those statements by raising certain inconsistences between them and the complainant’s testimony;  2) the trial judge’s assessment of credibility was entitled to deference. He correctly identified R v W.(D.) as the guiding legal principle in the circumstances and his credibility findings were supportable on the evidence; and 3) the sentence was unfit because denunciation and deterrence are secondary factors in sentencing young offenders and are to be considered in a fashion consistent with the principle of “diminished moral blameworthiness” described in s. 3 the YCJA. The court acknowledged that this offence, committed against an 11-year-old and causing her serious psychological harm, might warrant a custodial sentence but for the appellant’s exemplary conduct since the offence and the almost four years that had elapsed between the offence in 2012 and his sentencing in 2016. Under s. 3(1)(b)(iv) and (v) of the YCJA, the delay in this case offended the concept of timely justice. To impose a custodial sentence on the appellant in this case would be contrary to the purposes of the YCJA as it would impede the appellant’s rehabilitation and reintegration into society. The court decided that a fit sentence in this case would be 12 months of probation.","The appellant was convicted after trial of sexually assaulting his 11-year-old niece contrary to s. 271 of the Criminal Code. The appellant argued the trial judge made errors in assessing the credibility of the witnesses and that he received ineffective trial representation. He also submitted the sentence was unfit as it contradicts the principles, purpose and provisions of the Youth Criminal Justice Act. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. 1) The appellant had the onus of establishing that his counsel's professional judgment was unreasonable in the circumstances and that this unreasonable professional judgment caused a miscarriage of justice. 2) The trial judge properly instructed himself pursuant to the Preamble, its Declaration of Principle and the detailed sentencing principles in s. 38 that he was convinced beyond a reasonable doubt of the appellant's guilt. 3) It is well understood that an appellate court must show 'great deference' to a trial judge's assessment of witness credibility. It is clear that the appellant failed to show great deference to the trial Judge's assessment. 4) The evidence satisfies the threshold for admission as set out in Worm. The Court found no basis to interfere with the conviction. The sentence appeal was allowed and the sentence imposed was varied to 12 months probation."

In this case, the court found that the judge had not erred in his decisions regarding the first and the third requests for adjournment but had in the second request by failing to provide sufficient reasons for his denial. Amongst many factors it considered, the court found that most importantly, the appellant had not caused his counsel to withdraw for the purpose of delaying trial. It concluded that the error resulted in a miscarriage of justice based upon the appellant’s poor conduct of his own defence and lack of understanding of trial process.","HELD: The appeal was allowed and a new trial ordered. The court found that there was no tenable basis for interfering with the trial judge's discretion in refusing to grant the adjournments and the consequent verdict. The Court applied the framework for review from Barrette The Queen to Ironchild, where the accused's counsel had unsuccessfully sought an adjournment to obtain counsel for the sentencing hearing. The trial judge had stepped down for ten minutes to consider the request. When he returned, he advised that the next available trial date was almost a year away. The judge checked to see if another judicial centre could offer an earlier trial date. He denied the adjournment request. The appellant appealed. Appeal allowed. The decision was based on reasons well-founded in the law."
c_1993canlii4474.txt,"The parties lived together for 14 years and had three children, aged eight, 13 and 14. The petitioner always worked and eventually became a successful stockbroker. The respondent was employed part-time doing minimum wage jobs and was responsible for the household duties and raising their children. The petitioner's annual income was $50,000 at the time of separation, but escalated to $200,000 in 1992 and was prone to great fluctuation. The respondent was to have custody of the children. She sought spousal and child support and an unequal division of assets. Ordering support and an unequal division of assets. The court extensively reviewed the case of Moge v. Moge (1992), 43 R.F.L.(3d) 345 (S.C.C.) and found that marriage and child care responsibilities hinder a wife's role in the workplace. The court awarded $4500 per month as spousal and child support, plus an additional $500 while the wife retrained. The court considered this an appropriate case for an unequal division of matrimonial assets in the respondent's favour. Finding that the awards were still not sufficient to satisfy the respondent's needs, a lump sum award of $18,000 was ordered. On appeal.","The respondent was seeking equitable division of matrimonial assets and compensatory support or a lump sum award. HELD: The Court found that the Court was satisfied that the ground had been proven and granted the petition for divorce. The Court held that there was no possibility of reconciliation. The respondent's application for compensatory and spousal support was dismissed.  1)The Court did not have jurisdiction to order the wife to work more than she has agreed to do in the Partial Minutes of Settlement. 2)The court found that it would be unlikely in many situations for the dependent spouse, often the wife, to have the skills or opportunity to enter the work force at level she would have gained but for leaving the workforce and altering her career curve. It was also of the view that the support model of self-sufficiency which Mr. Moge urges the court to apply, cannot be supported as a matter of statutory interpretation considering the diversity of objectives set out in the Act."

To do so it must be shown that a solicitor client relationship existed. There must not be a danger of the confidential information coming back to haunt the client. The court found that such a relationship did not exist in this instance. In addition, the applicant must demonstrate that the solicitor received information which is relevant to the matter at hand. The court found no such evidence of this possibility. It is no bar to representation by a solicitor that some former partners at a previous firm will be examined for discovery or called to testify.",Fulltext of judgment follows: There is no conflict of interest requiring that a solicitor not be permitted to act for a particular client. There is a strong inference that lawyers who work together share confidences. This is the overriding policy that applies and must inform the court in answering the question: Is there a disqualifying conflict of interests? The applicants have suggested that a number of former partners of the plaintiff firm may be either subject to discovery or may become witnesses during trial.

He contended the trial judge erred by permitting the complainant to testify behind a screen without first conducting a voir dire and by relying on Crown's submission the girl would be uncomfortable without the screen.

At issue was whether the screening measures taken ensured that no disclosure would occur and satisfied the evidentiary burden imposed on the law firm. HELD: The solicitor and the law firm were disqualified from acting for the petitioner in the action. Because two years had lapsed further examinations were appropriate and an order issued for the petitioner to attend a further examination.

c_1996canlii6986.txt,"A Director was charged with professional misconduct for coercing the resignation of two principals in his school division. The Discipline Committee found the appellant guilty of misrepresenting the school process report involving the first principal and of threatening the other principal that if he did not apply for a transfer and resign the matter would be dealt with at the board table and that 'it could get ugly'. The Executive Committee of LEADS issued a reprimand to be placed on his file for five years and a fine of $2,500. At issue was whether the Discipline Committee erred in its findings of fact and the burden of proof, whether the facts, if true, constituted professional misconduct and whether the penalty imposed was excessive. HELD: Appeal dismissed.  1)The legislation does not appear to call for a change in the traditional approach. The fact that an appellate judge can substitute his or her decision for that of the Discipline Committee or order of an executive does not mean that the appellate court's view of the facts and credibility of witnesses supercedes in any way the role of the Discipline Committee unless it finds there were inappropriate inferences drawn, conclusions reached which were not supported by the evidence, or a misdirection on a point of law. None were found in either case. The Discipline Committee did not err in its interpretation of 'professional misconduct' or its application to the facts.  2)Section 52 of the LEADS Act and s62 of the Medical Profession Act, 1981 are virtually the same except for minor changes in wording and format. The jurisprudence under the Medical Profession Act was applicable to the standard of review in this case. 3)The penalty imposed was not wrong or unjustified. Section 47 of the LEADS Act gives the Executive Committee wide latitude in the nature of punishment that it may impose upon a person found guilty of professional misconduct. The Executive is not bound by the recommendations of the Discipline Committee. They are only guidelines. 4)The Act is silent as to who shall bear costs of providing the documents filed pursuant to s51(2) of the Act. If the legislature had intended the statutorily mandated costs to be costs in the cause it would have said so. LEADS should bear the costs in this case. In any event pursuant to the court's inherent jurisdiction and pursuant to s52 of the Act the costs of providing the materials were to be borne by the respondent. 5)Subject to the above the respondent was entitled to costs of and incidental to the appeal.ADDENDUM to TWL QB96220. The concluding paragraph was amended to read: Subject to what has been stated in the immediately preceding paragraph hereof, the respondent will be entitled to recover its costs of, and incidental to this appeal, from the appellant, to be taxed on Column 3.","This was an appeal pursuant to s. 51 of The League of Educational Administrators, Directors and Superintendents Act from the decisions of the Discipline Committee and Executive Committee of the League.

The appellant received a reprimand (to be placed on his file for a period of 5 years) and a fine of $2,500. This was a finding of credibility and the Court was slow to substitute its opinion on the evidence for that of the Committee. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. 1)The Discipline Committee's decision was against the law, the evidence and the weight of evidence. 2)The Committee erred in its application of the burden of proof as alleged in ground number 7 of the notice of appeal.

c_1998canlii14058.txt,"FIAT. An application pursuant to Rule 188 for a determination of whether the defendant was liable pursuant to s86(1) of the Highway Traffic Act for the personal injuries of the infant plaintiff or was immune from liability by virtue of s228 [now s232] of the Education Act. The second point of law to be determined was whether the co-defendant as car owner was liable if the driver was found to be immune from liability. The motor vehicle accident occurred while the infant plaintiff was being transported during a field trip, approved by the defendant school board, and the defendant was the teacher. HELD: 1)The teacher/driver was acting within the scope of her duties and was immune from liability by virtue of the Education Act. 2)The owner was only liable to the same extent as the driver. The reasoning in Neault was directly on point. Just as the Workers' Compensation Act and the Highway Traffic Act prevent the injured worker from suing the owner of the vehicle because he is prevented from suing the driver, the Education Act extends the same immunity to the owner as it does to the driver by operation of s86(1) of the Highway Traffic Act. 3)There was no apparent conflict between the statutes. When read together, the legislation provides that a negligent teacher is granted immunity from liability if the teacher has acted within the scope of the Education Act. The Traffic Act is the general statute, governing liability of all drivers. The Court did not agree with the School Board's analysis that the Education Act was the general statute. 4)The injured plaintiff was not denied a party to sue for negligent operation of a vehicle as he had recourse against the school board and its insurer. The immunity under the Education Act only applies to teachers and principals.","FIAT: An application pursuant to Rule 188 of The Queen's Bench Rules of Court for a determination of these points of law. HELD: 1)The Education Act is the general statute dealing with teacher's liability and immunity in a general way. Oppositely, the Highway Traffic Act is specifically directed to liability arising from motor vehicle negligence. Therefore, the specific creates an exception to the general, and negligent teacher/driver, even acting within the scope of s. 228 of The Education Act, is liable for the injury to the plaintiff pupil. 2)The teacher's immunity under the Education Act extends to the owner of the motor vehicle, the co-defendant is immune from liability if the teacher has acted within the s. 86(1) of the Act. 3)The school board was asked to consider the Thompson case, supra, and McKay v. Board of Govan School and Molesky (1967), 1967 CanLII 430 (SK CA), 60 W.W.R. 513 (Sask. C.A.) as authority for maintaining liability against the employer of a motor vehicle involved in the accident. The school board argued that, in this case, the education act is the General statute dealingwith teacher and immunity and that the teacher is not liable, even though the teacher might be immune. 4)There is no apparent conflict between the statutes. When they are read together, the legislation provides that a negligent teacher is granted immunity if the owner is the same as the driver. Even if there were an apparent conflict with the two statutes, careful analysis would lead one to conclude that the provisions of the special statute are not construed as repealing the general law but as providing an exception."
c_2001skqb39.txt,"The defendants brought an application to compel responses to a large number of questions objected to at examinations for discovery of the proper officer for SPMC, and sought an order requiring SPMC to comply with numerous undertakings. The objections were categorized as the questions sought to elicit the plaintiff's manner of investigation or expert opinions; it should have been asked of another witness better suited to answer or third parties as the questions relate to issues between the defendant and the third parties; it was irrelevant or improper. HELD: 1)The plaintiffs were not required to answer questions which would require them to accept or reject an opinion of another party to the action. 2)The plaintiffs should answer what cellulose fibre insulation was present at the time of the fire. 3)The affidavit answered whether Miner was a participant in the investigation notwithstanding the defendants are not entitled to the names of possible expert witnesses at the discovery stage. 4)Any meeting between the plaintiff's investigators and the fire marshal clearly related to its investigation and is privileged. The defendants could obtain the information directly from the fire marshal. 5)The question of whether there was any liaison between the city fire investigator and SIAST was improper as it relates to the manner of investigation. Questions can be asked of the city. 6)Details of the plaintiff's investigation, including an engineer's report, was protected by litigation privilege. 7)The question regarding what observations were made of the damage was too vague. The plaintiff's claim was in excess of $7 million. A proper foundation must be laid in the context of specific questions and answers given or not given (Hill v. Arcola School Division). The defendants are not entitled to expert opinion. 8)Whether SPMC's insurer's investigation team participated related to manner of investigation and was therefore privileged. 9)The defendant will be able to examine the city in the third party claim with respect to documents from the fire department. 10)All discussions at mediation proceedings are strictly confidential. The name of the plaintiff's expert, who prepared the drawings in contemplation of litigation, is privileged. 11)The facts and observations upon which expert opinions are based must be disclosed including any photographs.  12)Whether any pattern on the wood would indicate contact by propane flame required expert opinion. 13)Questions concerning what material first ignited could only be answered by having experts reconstruct what in their opinion occurred at the time the fire started. 14)If the plaintiffs do not have a position (on whether there was a fire stop in the 1967 construction of the tower), there is no rule the court is aware of requiring them to adopt a position. They can be required to give an undertaking to provide a position if they adopt one at a later date. Whether they believed the building was built in accordance with the 1960 fire code when constructed in 1967 was information obtainable by the defendants. 15)If the party being examined had no control over or greater access to a witness than the examining party, it need only disclose the evidence known to it. There is no obligation to seek information from third parties when the defendants are capable of obtaining that information. 16)An undertaking was given to advise if and when the plaintiffs develop a position on whether the parapet roof was constructed in accordance with the detail set out in FC and whether the detail in the sketch of the Tower parapet was correct. 17)If the request for the proposal related to Kelsey, the document should be produced, but if it only related to the Regina campus, the document was not relevant. 18)Whether it was considered anytime that Hagblom would be a sub-consultant was a legal question. The trial judge will interpret the terms of the agreement. 19)Any information required could be obtained directly from the architects who had been added as third parties by the defendants.  20)The plaintiffs gave undertakings to answer the other questions and did not object to answering them. 21)The 36 objections (less 3 that were withdrawn) failed. It would be an abuse of process for the defendants to ask the same question of a second officer hoping to obtain a different answer. The same question can be put if the first did not answer it. The fact there were three separate officers does not restrict the defendants to only asking certain questions of each. The reason for having three officers, each with a different expertise in a certain area, was to prevent the plaintiffs from having to give endless undertakings. Having all three present during each examination would have saved time and unnecessary legal fees. 22)The exhibit was not before the court to determine how complicated the question was. Defence counsel was to break it down. 23)There were 200 undertakings. As a general rule examinations for discovery should be completed before the party being examined is required to comply with the undertakings. It would lead to endless delay if the examining party were allowed to simply adjourn and demand the undertakings be complied with. There were no exceptional circumstances.  24)Costs were left to the trial judge.","The defendants brought this application to compel responses to a large number of questions that were objected to at examinations for discovery of the proper officers on behalf of Saskatchewan Property Management Corporation (SPMC). They also sought an order requiring SPMC to comply with numerous undertakings. HELD: The Court granted relief of a general nature that the meaning of the order is uncertain. 1) The Court failed to see why a party to an action should be required to accept or reject an opinion of another party to the action. 2) There must be some reasonable degree of specificity to a question of this nature when reference is made to document. 3) The respondents were not required to answer the questions asked. 4) There was no obligation on the plaintiffs to seek the names of possible expert witnesses when the defendants are as capable of obtaining that information as the plaintiffs. 5) The question asked was 'what observations were made of the damage post fire, the damage to the roof and its... and the attic that would connect the point of breakout to the point where Hagblom were operating or were working?' The question posed a direct question as to whether the plaintiffs had any position on the matter. The Court was not entitled at the discovery stage to that information. 6) The plaintiffs were entitled to know what was observable to anybody looking at the wall where the Soprema was being applied not to an expert's interpretation of what is observable, for example what chemical change took place. That is exactly the sort of information that litigation privilege is designed to protect. Objection No. 6-P. 297, Line 2 to P. 461, Line 3-12 The Court found that the plaintiffs were not entitled to ask the question referred to at the examination for discovery for the name of the adjuster who interviewed potential witnesses and prepared report, and the names and the witnesses described the burn marks. It was also found that there was no evidence that the plaintiff's insurer's investigation team participated in the investigation with the City of Saskatoon fire department. It would be another matter if the plaintiffs' expert may have relied upon the testimony of a third party. The court found that it would be improper to require the plaintiff to supply the facts contained in the investigator's reports, the information obtained from each plaintiff and the information from the defendant's subcontractor to be privileged."
c_2003skqb46.txt,"The Attorney General applied to strike out the plaintiff's claims on the grounds they are statute-barred by virtue of the LAA s.3 and that all the claims except for trespass to person are not exempted by s.3(3.1); by POPA s.2; alternatively, the Court has no jurisdiction over any cause of action relating to intentional torts committed by a Crown servant or employee prior to May 14, 1953; all claims arising from the conduct of two deceased Sisters who died in 1988 and 1993 are barred by the TA and SAA. The plaintiff claimed he was physically assaulted by employees and staff and suffered the loss of his traditional language and culture between 1944 and 1952 while attending the Qu'Appelle Residential School. The AG acknowledged the plaintiff attended the school from 1946 until 1949. The AG in a previous application was granted leave to amend its statement of defence and third party claim to plead and rely upon the Crown Liability and Proceedings Act; Limitations of Actions Act ss.31(d),(h) and (j); Public Officers' Protection Act; Trustee Act s.59, or its predecessor legislation Survival of Actions Act s.10; Crown Liability Act s.3(1)(a) and the Exchequer Court Act s.19. A third party claim against the Oblats alleging they controlled and operated the residential school at all material times, was not relevant on this application. HELD: 1)The claim based on physical assault by the Sisters was struck. The Court has no jurisdiction over any cause of action relating to intentional torts committed by a Crown servant or employee prior to May 14, 1953. The Crown remains immune from claims for trespass, assault and battery committed by servants and officers before the enactment of the Crown Liability Act in 1953 (renamed the Crown Liability and Proceedings Act in 1990), which did not operate retroactively. The LAA s.3(3.1) does not create a cause of action but simply removes statutory time limitation periods barring otherwise existing actions. Before May 14, 1953 the Crown was subject to claims for negligence pursuant to the Exchequer Court Act s.19(c). The Dyson procedure is available in Canada in every jurisdiction except New Brunswick and Nova Scotia. 2)The claim based on negligence is subject to the two year time limitation prescribed by LAA s.3(1)(d) which must calculated having regard to the principles of discoverability. 3)The claims of breach of trust and breach of fiduciary duty are equitable claims subject to the six year time limitation in LAA ss.3(1)(h) which explicitly begins to run from the discovery of the cause of action (PG v. AG Canada). Relevant factual issues are to be dealt with at trial. 4)Even though the claim in trespass is based on acts alleged to have occurred over 50 years ago, it clearly falls within the class of actions contemplated by LAA s.3(3.1)(b)(ii). As such it is also exempted from any limitation period against others liable for the conduct. 5)The argument that the 12 month limitation period in POPA s.2(1)(a) should be applied in priority to the more general provisions of the LAAA was rejected in RJG v. AG Canada. 6)Claims based on direct liability of the Crown for negligence, breach of trust and fiduciary duty are not affected by time limitation periods applicable to the deceased Sister Greyeyes and her estate. The time limitation periods are abrogated by LAA s.3(3.2). Since there is no limitation period barring an action against the Sister or her estate, there can be no provincial limitation period available to the Federal Crown under CLPA s.24. 7)The other claims made directly against the Federal Crown are not affected by limitation periods applicable to Sister Elle or her estate. SAA ss.5 and 10(1),(3) and (4) do not bar the claims against her.  LAA s.3(3.2) abrogates the time limitation in SAA s.10(3)(b).","The Attorney General applies to strike out the plaintiff's claims on the grounds that they are barred by certain statutes, or alternatively that the Court has no jurisdiction over any cause of action relating to an alleged intentional tort committed by a Crown servant or employee prior to May 14, 1953. HELD: 1) The plaintiff cannot pursue a claim against the Federal Crown for the intentional tort of trespass, assault and battery of its officers and servants occurring prior to June 1953.  2) The law is clear that any claims arising from acts or omissions that predate May14, 1953 cannot succeed in this court under the Crown Liability and Proceedings Act. 3) There is no agreement on the facts and the Attorney General does not argue that the claims should be struck on the basis of the plaintiff’s own pleadings. It should be left to the trial judge to determine whether the plaintiff can satisfy the requirements of discoverability.  3) Even if the time limitation period in the POPA applies to claims other than those described in s. 3(3.1) of the Exchequer Court Act or its successor legislation, time begins to run under s. 2(1)(a) of that Act only when the alleged injury or damage ceases. There is a factual matter to be dealt with at trial."

She also claimed that periodic maintenance was not appropriate because of the difficulty of enforcement when she is living abroad and referenced two occasions when the husband was paying periodic support that she had to seek the assistance of Maintenance Enforcement. The husband opposed paying any more spousal support but expressed a preference for lump sum support if he was required to pay more, as it would allow him to move on with his life with his new family. Husband ordered to pay a lump sum award of $10,000 to wife; when the parties moved to Nova Scotia, the husband was able to improve his financial situation, while the wife's position deteriorated.","The parties were married in 1996 having previously been married in Sweden and then divorced in 1993. There are no children of their relationship and the only contested issue on this hearing is the respondent’s claim for lump sum spousal support. The parties agreed that all property had been divided to their respective mutual satisfaction and an outstanding debt of approximately 34,000 krona was their joint responsibility. Following separation, the parties consented to a Family Court Order wherein the respondent was ordered to pay as spousa $600 per month for twelve months. The respondent testified that she wanted to purchase an air ticket for her and her dog to travel to Sweden and to finance her living expenses for eight months. She estimated that the major contract held by his company was not being renewed and that all he could afford was $5,000 by way of lump sum support. HELD: The respondent was awarded $10,000. The court found that the amount suggested by the respondent in the amount of $20,000 was preferable to periodic payments. The Court found that there was a need on the part of the respondent, she was entitled to support and there was capacity in the Petitioner to pay support."

The Respondent objected to the respondent's cross-examination of the applicant's estranged spouse. The respondent argued that the respondent was negligent in the execution of an order that granted interim exclusive possession of a matrimonial home to the estranged spouse of the respondent. HELD: The respondent's motion for recusal was granted. 1) The respondent admitted that she was overbilled. 2) There was a reasonable apprehension of bias on the part of the appellant. 3) Although the respondent had previously appeared before the same judge and adverse findings of credibility were previously found with respect to that person, such does not by itself require recusal. There was no indication whatsoever of overbilling. 4) The time available to the appellant to cross-examine her was limited to 15 minutes. The appellant freely admitted (without any prompting) that the appellant was convicted of the criminal charges laid against her. Those convictions obviously impact negatively on the appellant's credibility. The trial judge's evidence regarding her Crownside appearance was more than sufficient for the respondent to conclude that to limit her cross‑examination in this manner would constitute breach of natural justice."
c_2009skca53.txt,"The three respondents pled guilty to three offences: trafficking in cocaine for the benefit of, or at the direction of, or in association with a criminal organization contrary to s. 467.12 of the Criminal Code; conspiring together and with others to traffic in cocaine contrary to s. 5(1) of the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act and s. 465(1)(c) of the Criminal Code; and trafficking in cocaine contrary to s. 5(1) of the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act. On the last two counts, each was sentenced to 1 year less a day to be served in the community on each count, to be served concurrently, plus a 10 year fire arms prohibition. On the first count, each was sentenced to serve 1 year, in the community, consecutive to the sentences for the other counts. They were also subjected to DNA orders and there was an order of forfeiture of a vehicle belonging to a third party. The Crown appealed these sentences on the grounds that the sentencing judge failed to give proper effect to the gravity of these offences. The Court weighed all the evidence and circumstances of the accused, and found the sentencing judge was clearly moved by the personal circumstances of the accused and while they are mitigating and would normally justify a sentence at the low end of the range, it was the Court's view that the sentencing judge gave them undue weight in comparison to the principles of denunciation and general deterrence, which must play a significant role in offences of this nature. The Court further stated the 1 year sentence for the trafficking offence, to be served in the community, was demonstrably unfit given the range of sentences established in other cases of trafficking offences, even after taking into account the mitigating personal circumstances of these offenders. The Court found the sentences must be set aside. The Court found that an appropriate sentence for each of the respondents, taking into account the seriousness of the offences, the personal circumstances of the respondents, and the aggravating nature of the offences pursuant to s. 467.12, would be 18 months, concurrent, for each of the last two counts, and 1 year consecutive for the criminal organization offence, for a total of 30 months imprisonment. HELD: The total sentence in each case is 30 months, 5 months having already been served.","The Crown appealed the sentences on the grounds that the sentencing judge failed to give proper effect to the gravity of the offences, particularly in light of the volume of trafficking and lengthy period of time over which it had taken place, the highly dangerous nature of the substances sold, the fact that they were working for a criminal organization and their motivation was financial gain. HELD: The appeal was allowed. 1)The sentence of one year was demonstrably unfit, even after taking into account the mitigating factors of the offenders.  2)The Court of Appeal had repeatedly said that the range of sentencing for trafficking in cocaine is 18 months to 4 years and that the personal circumstances of an accused, while not to be ignored, are secondary considerations to the issues of deterrence and denunciation. It is an error in principle to over-emphasize these personal circumstances to the exclusion of an examination of other sentencing factors.  3)The sentences imposed in this case were 18 months concurrent for each of the last two counts and 1 year consecutive for the criminal organization offence, for a total of 30 months imprisonment.  4)Considerations of parity alone would have warranted a sentence of years on the trafficking charge alone in the circumstances of this case.  5)In our view, the sentence of 1 year for the offences of trafficking for the benefit of, at the direction of, or in association with a criminal organisation, to be served concurrently, plus a 10 year fire arms prohibition.  6)The respondents all worked as street level cocaine dealers, selling crack cocaine in gram, gram, and gram (8-ball) amounts for criminal gang based in Edmonton known as the 'Crazy Dragons' in Edmonton. The Crazy Dragons expanded into Saskatoon in 2005 to set up a business in the crack cocaine trade. During the last 60 days of that period the police recorded on wiretap in excess of 600 drug deals made by the respondents. This would have involved minimums of 300 grams and a maximum of 2.1 kilograms for proceeds of between $36,000 and $180,000. The respondents worked 12 hours a day and rotated their shifts so that the 'deal' phone and delivery car were being operated twenty four hours per day, seven days per week. The Court allowed the appeal from the bench, substituting more lengthy term of incarceration for the conditional sentences originally imposed."
c_2012nsca78.txt,", motion denied. While the province has an arguable appeal, it does not concern a summary judgment motion that would result in the claims being dismissed outright. If the certification order is struck, the province will still face individual claims. The AG has not shown that defending individual actions will cost less than defending one class proceeding. There is no evidence to estimate how it may incur significantly higher expenses as a result of how the points at issue in the appeal are resolved. The matter has been ongoing for some time and it is reasonable to expect the province has already spent time and money to prepare the defence they will eventually file. To succeed on this basis, the court would require a reliable indication of what remains to be done during the stay period, what component of that residue would be wasted if the appeal is allowed, and some estimate of that cost.","The plaintiffs sought certification of the class proceeding under s. 7(1), naming of two classes: property owner and residential. They sued in tort and for breach of fiduciary duty, and sought damages for their own exposure and for injury to their property and their value. In October 2010, the plaintiffs filed an amended motion for certification, that proposed class boundaries with a reduced area but extended a 7 year habitation requirement for the residential class. The defendants counter-claimed that the certification would cause them irreparable harm. HELD: The motion for stay was dismissed with costs of $1,000 in the cause of the appeal. 1) This appeal does not involve a summary judgment motion that would dismiss the claims outright, in any form, against the defendant. Rather, the court shall make an order setting out when and by what means notice is to be given under this section. 2) There is no evidence to estimate the costs of the plaintiffs' appeal that would be significantly higher because of points that are in issue on the appeal than there is on the first claim. The Court will not analyse the fine points of the Province's submissions or the respondents' reply. The court will not decide whether the appeal is arguable on their face. 3) The Court of Appeal has not yet fixed a date for implementation of the Notice Program under para 15 of the Order. The issues on appeal are the likelihood that the plaintiffs would not be in position to pay for the litigation leading up to the common issues trial, and the confusion that the public might feel if the litigation proceeds to a new issues trial or significantly reduce the scope of the litigation. 4) The court has not established the prerequisites for stay of an enforceable order of the Supreme Court. It is premature to comment on the merits of the third assumption. The point is not capable of proof by the Province at this stage. There is a low bar for arguability."
c_2012nssc46.txt,"The parties agreed on discovery dates and the order in which witnesses would be discovered. As a result of an honest error, the defendant wasn't able to attend the original dates. The plaintiff became frustrated and concerned about further delays. While the defendant was making good faith efforts to resolve the discovery issues (including whether its witnesses should be excluded from attending discovery of the plaintiff's witnesses), the plaintiff's lawyer issued discovery subpoenas to compel the defendant's witnesses to appear, making the exclusion issue moot. The defendant moved to have the subpoenas dismissed, and sought solicitor and client costs on the motion. The defendant argued the subpoenas were improper and an abuse of process, and accused the plaintiff's lawyer of making unwarranted attacks against the defendant's lawyer in his pre-hearing brief. The motion was heard over approximately one-half day. Motion granted. The plaintiff will pay total costs of $2,550 (plus disbursements) to the defendant, consisting of $1,500 in party and party costs under Tariff C and $1,050 in solicitor and client costs. The tariff amount of $1,000 is increased by $500 to reflect the fact the issuance of the subpoenas was an improper step, albeit one falling short of an abuse of process. It required the defendant to bring this motion to strike. The plaintiff was given a chance to withdraw the subpoenas and chose not to. Solicitor and client costs were warranted especially in light of the defendant's lawyer's language, which was unduly harsh and unnecessarily strong. His allegations added a layer of complexity and seriousness to the case, which caused the defendant to spend extra time preparing a response. Lawyers are officers of the court and the court must encourage them to use courtesy, respect and professionalism.","The Defendant filed a motion to dismiss discovery subpoenas issued to the Defendant's witnesses. The motion was allowed and the order granted included a direction as to the manner of discovery. The Defendant sought an award of costs on a solicitor/client basis against the Plaintiff. HELD: The Court found that the circumstances and factual findings justified an increase in the tariff, for party/party costs. The Court reviewed the various factors in determining costs and concluded that the defendant took no position on exclusion of witnesses, as that was not what it was seeking. The court found that there was an implicit agreement regarding the discovery in July including the order of witnesses. When this agreement fell through, the Plaintiff became frustrated and became concerned about further delay resulting in the issuance of the subpoenas. The defendant sought to increase the tariff on the basis of the factual findings. The Plaintiff argued that the use of subpoenas in this matter should be frowned upon, as well as the inappropriate and offensive comments made by the Defendant during negotiations to reach an agreement on Discovery. Therefore, the Court awarded costs in the amount of $3,500 to the Plaintiff and $1,500 in total for the parties. The parties agreed initially that Rule 18.16 was applicable. However, if the Plaintiff's position was not contrary to the Trans Canada case, that had discretion pursuant to Rule 94 and Rule 8.04 to grant the order to strike the subpoenaas and to direct that the plaintiff's witnesses be discovered first by the defendant."
c_2012skqb426.txt,"The Crown applied under Part XXIV of the Criminal Code to have the accused declared a dangerous offender after he pled guilty to committing an aggravated assault on his common-law spouse contrary to s. 268 of the Code. The application is based on the Code provisions in effect before the danger offender legislation set forth in The Tackling Violent Crime Act was passed. The accused is 52 years old and in poor health. He has a significant criminal record thatreveals a history of violence and an inability to abide by court orders. The offences occurred between the time he was 40 and ended in 2006 with his last conviction, the predicate offence. Two psychologists prepared psychological assessments both of which concluded that the offender should not be declared a dangerous offender because his risk to re-offend could be reasonably managed by supervision in the community. The issues before the Court were: 1) whether the predicate offence is a serious personal injury offence as defined by s. 752 of the Code; 2) whether the offender is a threat of the kind contemplated by s. 753 of the Code and thus a danger to society; 3) if so, whether the Court should exercise its residual discretion an impose a fixed-term sentence or resort to long-term offender provisions, even though the statutory criteria for declaring the accused a dangerous offender have been met; and if a long-term offender designation is warranted, what determinate sentence and long-term supervision order should be imposed? HELD: 1) The Court held that the aggravated assault committed by the offender was a serious personal injury offence because it was an indictable offence involving the use of violence against his spouse. 2) The Court found that the Crown had proven the criteria required that the offender clearly fits within the definition set forth in ss. 753(1)(a)(i) and (ii), in that this offender had shown a repetitive and persistent pattern of aggressive behavior, especially against women. 3) The Court decided to exercise its residual discretion not to designate the offender as a dangerous offender and found that the he met the long-term offender criteria and that his risk to re-offend could be managed within the meaning of s. 753.1(1)(c). The offender has never been imprisoned in a penitentiary and thus had never had the benefit of programming offered in that system. The appropriate sentence should be 7 years. As the offender has spent approximately 3 years and 4 months in pre-sentence custody, the Court gave him credit in that amount on a one-to-one basis. The Court ordered that the appropriate length of time for a long term supervision order is the maximum of 10 years since the offender needs to learn alternative ways to express his frustration and address his issues with alcohol.","The offender pled guilty to committing an aggravated assault on his common-law partner contrary to s.268 of the Criminal Code. The Crown applied under Part XXIV of the Code to have him declared a dangerous offender. The offender is 52 years old and has a significant criminal record. The Court entered the conviction of the offender and prior to him being sentenced, he had accumulated several violence related convictions and concluded that his risk to re-offend violently in the future was mitigated only if he conscientiously applies himself to learning alternative ways of venting his frustration and anger. HELD: The Court had jurisdiction to entertain the dangerous offender application because it is both the court and is superior court of criminal jurisdiction. 1)The offender is a high risk to return violently and sexually violently to his former girlfriend. He appears to be in denial regarding his potential to abuse alcohol and does not appear to have seriously addressed the role alcohol plays in his life and also, in his potential for violent crimes. 2)What circumstances might exacerbate the individual's risk for violence? The Court reviewed the offender’s criminal history and found that the offender was a high-risk to reoffender violently and this risk would be mitigated if he applied himself to learn alternative ways to vent his anger. If he continues to deny his culpability and sabotage his attendance in programming, his risk of perpetrate crimes of violence in the community will continue to be high. However, it is an absolute necessity that he seriously addresses his apparent alcohol abuse problem and makes a commitment to sobriety for the remainder of his life. 3)The Court had the benefit of two assessment reports together with testimony of the authors of the reports. The first was from a forensic assessment report. The second was from the Forensic Assessment Report. The third was from an assessment report prepared by Dr. Holden (who was also a forensic accountant) and was based on the forensic assessment reports. 4)The court reviewed the circumstances of the predicate offence that precipitated the within dangerous offender applications. The accused was a 52-year-old male with significant criminal history. He was raised in Vancouver, British Columbia, and has one sibling. His parents are both deceased. The forensic report indicated that he was born to a stable 'traditional Austrian family... where no drugs, alcohol or violence were prevalent'. The Court was not at all sanguine regarding the accused’ potential for success in such programming given his apparent denial of his responsibility and lack of interest."

It found that the accused was not capable of representing himself but that the accused had not shown that he was indigent.,"HELD: The application for court appointed counsel was dismissed. The court found that the accused had not demonstrated the necessary financial acumen to proceed with a trial on the noted offence and that his court appointed court appointment had expired. The Court found that in circumstances where an accused's fair trial interests are impaired for want of legal representation, that an appropriate remedy is a stay of proceedings under s.24(1) of the Charter in the event the prosecution insists on proceeding with trial in breach of the accused's Charter right to fair trial. The subtle but critical issue of the difference between possession of substance for the purposes of a trial and possession of a weapon for a serious offence was also addressed."
c_2014skqb284.txt,HELD: The court dismissed both applications. The respondent’s voluntary decision to significantly reduce his income was insufficient grounds to vary his child support application. The court found that there had not been a material change in the circumstances with regard to the petitioner’s application.,"The respondent father applied to reduce his child support obligation and to extinguish arrears of child support as a result of him quitting his job and embarking on an apprenticeship program to become an electrician. The petitioner mother applied to become the sole custodian parent of the parties' two daughters. Both parties sought to vary the existing court order regarding support and parenting. HELD: The application to vary child support was granted. The respondent father was found to be earning $75,000 per year. His hourly wage went from $36.50 to $14.00. He deposed that he was earning $29,000 a year and that any increases would be small for the next period of time. He was in excess of $10,000 in arrearars of his support obligation. The application was dismissed. The court found that there had been a material change in circumstances as required by the previous order and that the respondent had not been exercising access and had little involvement in the lives of the children."
c_2016skqb293.txt,"HELD: The appeal was granted on the basis of the first two grounds as well as others. The court quashed the tribunal’s decision and reinstated the appellant’s hospital privileges. The court reviewed the transcript of the tribunal’s hearing and its written decision. With regard to the first two issues, it found that the tribunal had erred in law in the following ways: 1) by failing to conduct a de novo hearing as required. It did not refer to the expert opinion submitted by the appellant as new evidence at the hearing; and 2) by failing to explain its decision. It did not refer to the new evidence nor did it state how it had reconciled the conflicting expert opinion evidence offered by the appellant and the respondent. It merely accepted the evidence of the SMO’s experts.","HELD: The judgment was based on a statute-based appeal brought by the appellant against decision of an administrative tribunal. The appellant had his hospital privileges suspended by the senior medical officer (SMO) of the respondent Health Authority. The respondent placed numerous policies and clinical guidelines before the appellant, which the appellant and his counsel saw for the first time at that hearing and had not been disclosed to the appellant prior to that hearing. The SMO did not review the matter, only the SMO did so. The result of the SRO's review of the appellant's interpretation of fetal heart rate tracings was that the appellant met the standard of care and that ultimately the Tribunal made fatal errors when dealing with this matter pursuant to the statutory appeal. The s. 45 appeal to tribunal is a de novo hearing. It is not an appeal on the record. Curial deference is not owed and the tribunal may (indeed, must) take its own view of the evidence put before it and is not bound by the views of the Board."
c_2017skqb144.txt,"HELD: The application was granted. The court ordered that the property be sold and the proceeds of sale take into account the amount necessary to protect the respondent father’s claim. The Partition Act, 1868 applies in the province. It did not allow the equitable principles of unjust enrichment and constructive trust to operate to create a proprietary interest. The court found that s. 4 of the Act applied, which provides a monetary remedy so that if the respondent father could establish entitlement to some amount for his maintenance and improvement costs, he would be protected for that amount for his costs.","The sisters apply to have the partition and sale of a lake front recreational property partitioned by the parties. Each of the parties owns an undivided one quarter interest as tenants in common in the property. The parties inherited the property from their mother after her death in 1996. They are now separated and may have to sell the property to realize on its capital value. HELD: The application will be allowed. 1) The court has discretion to refuse partition under s. and a broader discretion exists. This necessitates determining whether it is s. or s. which operates in these circumstances. 2) When applying the Act the equities that might result in an unequal division of the sale proceeds are taken into account after the sale and are not used to determine the ownership interest of the title holder opposing partition or sale. In either case the remedy of constructive or resulting trust will give the respondents collectively an interest in the Property greater than 50%. 3) There are numerous authorities for the proposition that a joint tenant has a prima facie right to partition or a sale at any time. The Court can look to all of the circumstances of the transaction in order to determine whether there is another reason to deny recovery. 4) In seeking partition, it is hard to see how resulting trust can arise from contributions made over time to the improvement of an existing asset, or contributions in kind over time for its maintenance. This opens the door to consider the manner in which the parties organized their relationship and whether an injustice has arisen that without equity cannot be remedied. 5) In Kerr the court was clear that the law of unjust enrichment and the remedies flowing from it would not be applied differently in different areas of law."

The Crown and counsel for the accused agreed that a fine and probation would be appropriate. The trial judge sentenced him to 1 year in prison and 1 year's probation. He appealed his sentence. HELD: Appeal allowed. 1)The force applied was minimal and the child was not injured physically. 2)The sentence imposed would result in the accused losing his employment which would harm his dependents. 3)The Court reduced his sentence to 60 days intermittent.,"The appellant pleaded guilty to the charge of assault contrary to s. 266 of the Criminal Code. He was sentenced to one year imprisonment and one year's probation. The evidence indicated that the assault consisted of cuffing the eight year old stepdaughter rather frequently as a disciplinary measure. There was also an incident where a small paddle was employed and she had been struck with a cookie box. No injury had ever resulted from the assaults. HELD: The appeal was allowed and a sentence of 60 days intermittent be substituted for the sentence of 1 year. The probation order was to remain unchanged except to substitute the word 'approved' for'supervised' in the first condition.  1)One year under these circumstances, even with the record of the appellant, is excessive. In addition, it will mean the appellant would lose his current employment upon which the family is reliant. 2)The trial judge must have been influenced to a substantial degree by the lack of parenting skills displayed by the appellant in the way he mistreated and verbally abused the young girl in the manner he did. As offensive as that conduct was, a lack of parental skill does not constitute a criminal offence and the only thing that the appellant pleaded to was an assault which was not severe and produced no injury."

His counsel made no suggestion that the plaintiff had a moral claim, it was purely an attempt to secure by legal means that which he had previously agreed to forego. This is a court of equity as well as a court of law and as such it is repugnant that the court be called upon to vest in an applicant an interest which he has heretofore freely recognized to be the property of another, both before and after receiving his transfer under The Land Titles Act. 3)It was apparent that there was no intention that the rent charge would be merged since it was recognized and allowed to continue for 15 years.","The plaintiff sold his farm to his son in 1968.

The appellant was a businessman living in Port Hawkesbury and the numbered company was owned by him and he was the vehicle used by him to acquire ABM. The Court found that the trial judge had measured the loss on the footing that the respondent should be put in the position he would be had the financial statements been correct. This, being the test for measuring damages for breach of a contractual warranty, is not the correct test."

The appellant had his appeal denied on the grounds that the decision of the Hearing Officer was not patently unreasonable. Allowing the appeal and remitting the matter for re-hearing, that an appeal from a Hearing Officer to the Tribunal is a statutory appeal. It is not a judicial review, and the standard of review is therefore one of correctness not whether or not the Hearing Officer's decision was patently unreasonable. The deference that the Tribunal must show is only with respect to the advantages the Hearing Officer may have in the fact finding process of a particular case.","This was an appeal for leave granted from a Worker's Compensation Appeals Tribunal decision dated October 25, 1996. It is limited to a question as to the jurisdiction of the Tribunal. The matter is remitted to the Tribunal as an appeal from the hearing officer. The basis for dismissing the appellant's appeal was the Tribunal's conclusion that the Hearing Officer did not arrive at a decision which was patently unreasonable. It was not a judicial review."
d_1999canlii12581.txt,"In issue was whether the Bank breached its lending contract, its fiduciary duty or duty of confidentiality; and if so, what damages, if any, should be awarded. The defendant's bank loans fell into default after SGI disability benefits were terminated. The Bank reported the particulars of the loan defaults to a credit reporting agency (Equifax). The defendant declined to give an assignment of any accident injury settlement he might receive from SGI and requested the bank direct Equifax to eliminate any references to his default or delinquency upon the bank loans. The bank offered to put an explanatory note on their credit report confirming the arrears were the result of the defendant's automobile accident and that he had undertaken to pay the bank from the proceeds of the accident settlement. The bank commenced this action for payment. The Compains sought general, punitive, exemplary and aggravated damages in a counterclaim for breach of the bank's duty of good faith, duty of confidentiality and breach of contract. HELD: The counterclaims were dismissed with taxed costs to the bank for both the claim and counterclaims. The bank's claim was admitted at trial. 1)Compain expressly waived any contractual rights which he had to confidentiality of his credit information by the provisions of paragraph 8 of the Personal Credit Line Agreement. The principles outlined by the English Court of appeal in Tournier enumerated four exceptions to a bank's confidentiality obligation to its customers. 2)The analogy between the insurance cases and a bank and borrowing customer was not complete or appropriate. Assuming, without deciding, that banks do have a duty of good faith and fair dealing towards their customers, the bank did not breach such duties in their dealings in this case. 3)The characterization of the accounts as collection accounts was fair, reasonable and accurate in the circumstances and were not out of the normal course of business.","The plaintiff banked with the defendant, Royal Bank of Canada (Royal Bank), and at the time of the accident the Compain's were indebted to the Royal Bank under Royal Bank Credit Line and Visa credit card account (the ""Bank Loans""). The Royal Bank agreed to defer commencement of any action with respect to the defaulted Bank Loans until such time as Mr. Compain received an accident injury settlement from SGI. HELD: The plaintiff's claim against the defendant was dismissed. 1)The Royal Bank acted fairly and reasonably throughout consistent with its obligations to the plaintiff and its general banking practices including its report to Equifax as a credit reporting agency. 2)There was no evidence lead to suggest that the characterization of these loans, as they appeared in the Equifax reports, were out of the normal course of business. It is fair and reasonable inference to be drawn, from all of the facts and circumstances, that persons using and relying upon the equifax statements would be familiar with the various codes and classifications used to generate the credit report. 3)In conclusion none of the counter-claimant's claims are upheld and they are dismissed in total."
d_2000nsca117.txt,"Liability was admitted for a very mild rear end collision. The trial judge found the plaintiff's evidence to be lacking in credibility and found that the collision did not contribute materially to the plaintiff's poor health. It only caused a mild aggravation of her pre-existing and major back problem. The trial judge assessed general damages at $25,000. The plaintiff's costs were reduced on the basis that she refused a formal offer to settle for slightly less than what she was awarded and refused a second offer which was increased before trial to an amount in excess of what she was awarded. The plaintiff appealed and the defendant cross-appealed. Appeal and cross-appeal dismissed. No strong and cogent reasons were advanced to warrant interference with the trial judge's findings on credibility. There was ample evidence to support the conclusion that the accident only caused a mild aggravation of the pre-existing condition and thus no basis upon which court could interfere with that conclusion or adjust upwards general damage assessment. Trial judge applied no wrong principle in exercising discretion to reduce plaintiff's costs. Award of $25,000 was not so far outside range of damages for like cases as to be considered wholly erroneous estimate of damages.","The appellant cross appeals claiming that the trial judge's award of $25,000, as general damages, is excessive and should be reduced. The trial judge described the rear end of the appellant's vehicle as a very mild rear end collision. The appeal and cross appeal both dismissed without costs as per oral reasons. At the heart of this appeal is the finding that the accident did not contribute materially to the appellant’s present poor health, and that it caused only a mild aggravation of his pre-existing, and major, back problem. In our opinion, and in the circumstances of this case, that award cannot be said to be so far outside the range of damages for like cases as to be considered a wholly erroneous estimate of damages. HELD: The appeal was both dismissed and the cross appeal was also dismissed. 1) There was ample medical evidence to support the trial trial judge, who testified before that trial judge (see Travelers Indemnity Co. v. Kehoe (1985), 66 N.S.R. (2d) 434). 2) There would take strong and cogent reasons for this court to interfere with a trial judge whose findings are subject to law upon which we can interfere with that conclusion. 3) The appellant is essentially asking this court that to set aside the credibility findings against him, to take a different view of the medical evidence, and to attribute a larger percentage of his present health problems to the accident in question, with correspondingly higher assessment of damages against the respondent. This court has repeatedly stated that the credibility of witnesses is matter peculiarly within the province of the judge. 4) There is no basis, in law, upon which a judge can interfere. No such reasons are advanced."

HELD: A sentence of 5 years of imprisonment was imposed. The sentence was set aside because it did not comply with the fundamental principle of sentencing that it be proportionate to the gravity of the offence nor achieved the objective of denunciation of crimes of this nature. The manslaughter resulted from a common criminal enterprise, planned in advance, and was expected to be violent.

HELD: The appeal was allowed. The sentence imposed by the trial judge was set aside and a sentence of 5 years imprisonment was imposed in lieu of the sentence. 1)The appellant did not participate in the actual physical beating and stabbing of the victims and intervened to stop the beating of the robbers, albeit only after she seemed satisfied that he had nothing to give the robbers. The appellant was doing well in all programs in prison. The following factors mandate a lesser sentence for Ms. Thorne: (a) she had no criminal record; (b) she didn't participate in any actual physical or stabbing of Prodanovic and Kulas, and was at large on bail awaiting trial on other charges; and (c) she seems to be doing well. The Court was of the view that a 5 year sentence is five years imprisonment and that five years is imposed on the offender."

d_2003nssc223.txt,"The testator had prepared his own Will on a pre-printed form and left his assets to his children, whom he then proceeded to name. One of the children predeceased the testator and an application was made for an interpretation of the Will. the gift to the deceased child did not lapse; her estate is entitled to it. The general rule that a lapsed gift falls into the residue is expressly subject to any contrary intention appearing in the will; a class gift always expresses such a contrary intention. Where the gift is to a class of close relatives (e.g. to children), if this is a class gift it does not fall under this statutory exception. In such a case, the gift falls to the surviving members of the class. This case satisfied two of the exceptions to the class rule, namely, that the number of beneficiaries was given and that the names of such were given. The gift was not a class gift but rather a separate bequest to each individual child and no contrary intention was discernible in the Will.","This was an application for the interpretation of the Last Will and Testament of the testator and specifically to determine the entitlement of the Estate of Jane Mitchell under the Will pursuant to s. 31 of the Wills Act. HELD: 1) The testator intended to make a separate bequest to each individual child. The Court was unable to discern a 'contrary intention' in J.D.'s Will.  2) Clause 11 does not describe a contrary intention. The only exception is that the gift falls to the surviving members of the class. 3) The Court must be careful in determining what is relevant to be considered if it becomes necessary to put itself into the 'armchair' of a testator.  4) There is no need to resort to the rules of construction and assess the words of the Will in light of the surrounding circumstances. 5) The intention is clear from the Will itself. There is a very material difference that a very slight difference in wording of will may make under the rule thus established. If testator by his will makes a gift to all his children, naming them, and some of them die in his lifetime, leaving children who survive him, the share that those so dying would have taken goes to their representatives under s. 37. 6) The court must ascertain the ordinary meaning of the words used by the Will. In such a case, the gift fell to their surviving members.  6) In considering what is contrary intention expressed in a will, the Court must consider whether testator has expressed contrary intention so as to form a class gift. 7) The Act makes the general rule that a lapsed gift falls into the residue expressly subject to contrary intention (e.g. to a 'class gift' which does not fall under this statutory exception).

Spousal support to continue at the rate set out in the separation agreement for a period of fifteen months from the date of the decision at which time all support shall terminate, unless, prior to the termination date, the wife commences an application which results in her showing cause why spousal support should continue; the husband has complied with his obligations with respect to the provision of an automobile. The wife's financial means and needs required support, the husband had made an agreement to provide such support and the evidence did not support a conclusion that it was agreed to be for only one year.

As the price rose, the plaintiff would have profited by $36.50 per tonne. That is the loss of profit that the plaintiff's claim is based on multiplied by 297.957 and totals $10,875.43. 3) The part performance involving the sale under the contract of 2.043 tonnes is sufficient to meet the requirements of The Sale of Goods Act.","The plaintiff farmer was in the business of buying and selling grain.

The only evidence that might suggest that this transaction was a loan to either of the defendants was that some of the payments made by the defendant to the plaintiff were in the amount of $1,500, the amount that the plaintiff asserts was the monthly amount to be repaid by the defendant for the loan. However, there was no evidence as to when the agreement to pay $1,500 was made.

The defendant agreed to repay the loan in the amount of $1,500 per month but in the end an amount of approximately $61,000 was still outstanding. The defendants deny that this transaction was a loan to either of them and argue that in fact it was an investment by the plaintiff and her husband into the auto broking business. HELD: The action was dismissed. The only evidence that might suggest that a transaction was loan to one of the defendants was that the plaintiff's husband had said that they should invest some more money into Kelly's business so that he could buy more vehicles. The evidence from the plaintiff that she felt she received a profit from the first transaction was that she chose to pay for another vehicle instead of deducting that amount from what was owed. There was no written contracts or other written evidence of any agreement between the plaintiff, the defendant, and/or the numbered company defendant evidencing the nature of this transaction.

It is necessary so that the matter can properly be assessed by the court.  1) Based on the evidence and the conflict in the evidence, and the law, the issue of an undue influence can't be resolved with a trial. The issue of this kind of interference with a testator's ability to provide the required services cannot, in this case, be resolved. 2) The court recognized the difficulty of proving coercion which is part undue influence and also recognized the legitimacy of drawing inferences from undue influence from suspicious circumstances. 3) It is unlikely that any deliberate and overt act of coercion will ever occur in the presence of eye witnesses."

The court would admit fresh evidence limited to the portions of the appellant's affidavit addressing her efforts to secure counsel for the adoption hearing and the affidavit of Charlene Moore. 1) The due diligence requirement is not applicable here. It is in the child's best interests that her birth mother's wish to have access be determined on the application to adopt. The right to be heard is principle of natural justice.

The parties agreed to Gabrielson J. receiving the report and neither party sought to cross-examine the writer of the report. HELD: Leave denied. Even if there was a scintilla of merit to the argument, the Court would not grant leave to appeal on the basis that to grant leave to appeal on an extremely technical ground would cause delay that is manifestly not in the best interest of the child in the circumstances of this case. The issue is not of sufficient significance either to the parties or to the wider public to warrant an appeal.","The Minister of Social Services applied for leave to appeal an order granted on appeal from an order of the Child and Family Services Tribunal in relation to the child K.W. The child had been apprehended at birth due to the drug abuse of the mother. When the child was approximately 18 months old, the minister sought a permanent order pursuant to s. 37(2) of the Act. The matter came back before the Minister on appeal with the psychological report into evidence. Neither party sought to cross-examine the writer of the report. HELD: The application was dismissed. 1)There was no merit to either of the proposed grounds of appeal. The order clearly provides for a supervision period of only 1 year after the child resumes custody of R.S. Section 27 applies to protection hearings. There would be a transition period for a maximum of 6 months, to comprise parental visits at the ministry office followed by day visits and then overnight visits in the parental home prior to returning K.'W. to the care of the father. This period is subject to a number of conditions reflecting the recommendations in the report and is not material to this application. 2)The Minister was sitting on appeal. While the judge on appeal had jurisdiction to make an order subject to conditions (see s. 63(4)(c) and 37(5)(a)), this power is not 'broad enough"" to permit the judge to make such an order that both returns the child to the custody of the parent and has the child remain in the mother's custody for a temporary period, pursuant to the order of Gabrielson J. (subject to conditions). 3)The applicant was unsuccessful in his application on the first ground. The second ground was that the order was fraught with ambiguity. It was unclear whether the minister retains status as parent until the transition is complete and the child is returned to his father's care.

HELD: SGI has correctly calculated the appellant's IRB when it made the requisite deductions as set out in s. 137 to find the appellant's net income, and then reduced the net income to 90% to determine his IRB. It would be neither a rational nor fair interpretation to reduce a full-time earner's IRB by 90% and not the other types of earners. It would be neither a rational nor fair interpretation to deduct income tax, employment insurance premiums and Canada Pension contributions from only full-time earners. All earners are subject to these payments being deducted from their income but for their inability to earn an income because of an automobile accident. The further deductions to obtain the non- earner's IRB are in keeping with his earning reality.","The respondent's IRB for the 181st and subsequent days following an accident was not less than the IRB calculated for the first 180 days after the accident. It would be neither a rational nor fair interpretation to deduct income tax, employment insurance premiums and Canada Pension contributions from only full-time earners, such as Montgrand. HELD: 1) The hearing judge correctly calculated the respondent’s IRB when it made the requisite deductions as set out in s. 137 and then reduced the net income to 90% to determine his IRB. 2) SGI was correct in applying Regulation 102 which states that interest payable pursuant to Part VIII of the Act is to be calculated in accordance with the Pre-judgment Interest Act. The Act is intended to correlate the non-earner’ s. 2 income replacement benefit against which s. 117(4) is designed to be measured is that of 'weighted average' calculation. 3) The Court of Appeal reviewed the matter of determination and found that SGI had correctly calculated Montgrand’S IRB and reduced his net income by 90% and not the other types of earners. 4) The parties brought the matter back for further determination because SGI is paying Montgrand an amount less than that. SGI took the position, which he abandoned at this hearing, that the disability benefits pursuant to the Canada Pension Plan should not be deducted from their income but for their inability to earn an income because of an automobile accident. The legislation attempts to find his earning reality. 5) The respondent was not entitled to any more costs from SGI. 6) The court found that the phrase “subject to the other provisions of this Division” as meaning “governed by” or “affected by the rest of the Division,” is a too restrictive definition of the phrase. 7) It would not be a rational and fair interpretation for SGI to deduct Income Tax, Employment Insurance premiums and CPP contributions from the amount Montgrand received pursuant to s. 116(1) of the act. The court also found that it would be not a rational or fair interpretation of deducting the income replacement benefits payable for the post 180 day period from the amounts Montgrand was receiving pursuant to S. 116. 8) The appellant appealed SGI's calculation of interest on monies owed to Montgrand on the basis of pre-judgement interest. 9) The phrase,'subject to', may mean'subservient to' or'subordinate to"

There was a serious issue to be tried. The Plaintiff's business risked irreparable harm. The balance of convenience favored the plaintiff. Interim injunction granted. The plaintiff was facing a serious threat to its business and it had reasonable argument that this Court should examine the situation and perhaps intervene. The Interlocutory Injunction motion was dismissed. The court did not compromise the Justice who would ultimately hear the motion by giving an opinion as to whether or not that should be so.
d_2012skqb513.txt,"In the original judgment, the manner in which certain calculations should be made with respect to the amount owing to the plaintiff was left to the parties, with the provision that the judge remained seized if they could not reach an agreement. After judgment, the defendants appealed the judgment.  The plaintiffs then submitted detailed calculations of the final judgment for the trial judge's review. The defendants objected to the finalization of the judgment on the ground that, pursuant to Court of Appeal Rule 15, the notice of appeal had stayed the execution of the judgment until the disposition of the appeal. The plaintiff submitted that the calculation of the judgment was not acting on it. HELD: The defendant misconstrued the scope of Rule 15 as it does not stay proceedings. The appeal does not affect the ability of the Court to finalize the judgment. In fact, to do so will avoid costs and delay, and will hopefully be of some of assistance to the Court of Appeal.","HELD: The judgment was granted in favour of the defendants in the amount of the Admin Fees charged and paid by SGI to the individual claimants. There was no objective evidence that the Admin Fee is reasonable under the doctrine of quantum meruit. Therefore, the Court of Appeal was not functus officio respecting the matter of costs. In the event the parties were unable to reach an agreement on what the judgment amounts to from the above formula, they were to contact the registrar in order to arrange a time for argument on any points in debate. There were no costs of this application. The court of appeal was to determine the judgment owing to the date of the appeal."
d_2013skqb90.txt,"The appellants appealed a small claims judgment. The judgment had found the appellants liable for damages after the respondent, who had purchased a house from the appellants, discovered that water was entering his basement. When the respondent investigated the source of the water, he removed the interior wall of the basement and discovered that there was a second wall behind the first one. He also discovered that a large chunk of the concrete footing and concrete grade beam were broken and had slid into the space between the interior basement wall. The respondent obtained a professional opinion that suggested that the problem had been there for a significant period of time and that the wooden beam that sat on the concrete grade beam was rotten and would have to be replaced. The respondent was awarded judgment in the amount of the repair. The appellant appealed on the basis that the trial judge should not have considered the respondent's expert's opinion about the age of the defect, that the trial judge had crossed a line in assisting the self-represented plaintiff at the trial and that the trial judge erred in calculating damages. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. The respondent's expert was qualified as an expert concerning foundation repair and had the necessary experience to give expert evidence on the type of structural repair and the need for structural repair. Once qualified as an expert in the area of foundations and structural repair, he could testify on the nature of the foundation's problems, including the wooden beam. The witness was also the person who actually carried out the repair to the foundation and was entitled to give evidence on what he saw and did. The witness was properly qualified by virtue of his years of experience and the trial judge was entitled to accept his evidence as to the state of the foundation and how long it had been in such a state. The trial judge's intervention and comments to the appellant's lawyer at the trial did not go beyond the nature of a legitimate attempt to ensure that all of the evidence regarding the matters at issue was before the Court with sufficient clarity to allow the trial judge to understand it. The cause of action in this case was negligent misrepresentation. The trial judge found that the appellants were aware of the structural defect and had covered it up. The proper measure of damages is the amount of money required to put the plaintiff in the position he would have occupied if the negligent misrepresentation had not been made. In this case, the judge made no palpable or overriding error in calculating damages at the amount it cost to fix the foundation.","This is an appeal from a Small Claims Court judgment dated August 20, 2012. HELD: This appeal is dismissed with costs of the appeal to the respondent. 1) The trial judge erred in failing to weigh necessity and qualification before determining the admissibility of certain opinion evidence tendered on behalf of the plaintiff. 2) There is a strong presumption of impartiality on the part of trial judge. He made no palpable and overriding error regarding the calculation of damages. 3) He did not err in the admission of expert evidence. 4) The evidence must be given by witness who is shown to have acquired special or peculiar knowledge concerning the impartiality of the tribunal. These questions are to be answered upon an examination of the proceedings as whole."

Section 7(2) indicates that whenever the legislature confers jurisdiction on the Court of Queen’s Bench, and is silent with respect to an appeal from that Court, an appeal lies from it. The Psychologists Act does not state that there is no appeal from a decision of the Court of Queen’s Bench.","This application concerns the jurisdiction of this Court to hear an appeal from decision of the Court of Queen's Bench when the latter exercises jurisdiction under statute that is silent as to the right to appeal to this Court. The Psychologists Act does not state that there is no appeal from a decision of that Court. HELD: The application was dismissed.  1) The psychologists Act is a clear expression of legislative intent establishing the general rule that an appeal lies to the court from a Queen’s Bench decision. 2) There is a need to obtain leave for 'interlocutory appeals' and is not relevant to the resolution of the issues in this application.  3) There are two ways to determine the exact limits of appellate jurisdiction in legislation like The Court of Appeal Act, 2000: the legislature could provide that the court has no jurisdiction unless it is specifically granted to the Court by an enactment or a legislature could spell out the general jurisdiction of the court, subject to an expression of contrary legislative intention in any enactment, but it requires more than silence in the other enactment to take away the general right."
d_2017skqb42.txt,"HELD: The action was allowed. The defendants had defamed the plaintiff and he was entitled to damages in the amount of $100,000. The court found the following with respect to each issue: 1) it would substitute Postmedia as a defendant pursuant to Queen’s Bench rule 3-84(2) as it was the successor to Canwest and was aware of the plaintiff’s claim when it purchased the Star Phoenix and it would not be prejudiced. It would not deprive Postmedia of a defence under s. 5 of The Limitations Act because the articles remained on Postmedia’s websites and were republished whenever they were viewed or downloaded; 2) after reviewing each of the articles and assessing the words complained of, it found that the words constituted defamation; 3) all of the defendants were found to be joint tortfeasors with Purdy because they participated in the publication of a libel and were jointly and severally liable in defamation to the plaintiff; and 3) an appropriate award for general damages was $50,000. The court allowed the claim for aggravated damages as the defendants were found to be motivated by actual or express malice because Purdy did not simply report the jury’s verdict in her articles but indicated that she believed that the jury had not reached the proper verdict in the trial. She deliberately chose to report the stories of people who had made complaints about the surgical care provided to them by the plaintiff without verifying it or seeking comment from the plaintiff. As she was acting in the course of her employment, Purdy’s malice was attributed to all the defendants. The plaintiff was awarded $50,000 in aggravated damages.","HELD: The Court found that the defendants, acting alone or in concert, published defamatory comments about Dr. Graham in series of articles in the Star Phoenix newspaper and on websites owned and operated by the newspaper and Canwest Publishing Inc. The plaintiff suffered loss and damage to his professional and civic reputation. The defendants did not publish any retraction or apology nor did they remove the alleged offensive articles. The court found that there was no malice, deliberate calculation or recklessness in the statements of claim made by the plaintiff and that the newspaper was aware of the existence of the claim and that it was calculated to ignore the rights and complaints of the plaintiff."

The lottery money was spent on household finances and lost in husband's small business venture. Husband 'spent more money on alcohol than he should have'. HELD: This did not amount to dissipation of matrimonial property within the meaning of the Act. Husband's mismanagement of the family's financial affairs was grounds for unequal division of the property:","The applicant sought a division of matrimonial property pursuant to the provisions of The Matrimonial Property Act and maintenance for the two youngest children pursuant to The Deserted Wives and Children's Maintenance Act. The parties were married in 1964 and shortly thereafter moved to Saskatchewan. They owned modest home and equity in the said home of approximately $16,000. The family took more holidays and did more travelling. The respondent abused alcohol and spent more money on alcohol than he should have. He was in charge of the family finances and the $100,000 he won in a lottery. In 1977, the parties bought a house, a mini-motor home and some of the respondent's tools. In 1981, the trenching equipment was repossessed, the matrimonial home had to be sold and the mini motor home was gone. The applicant was entitled to keep his 1977 Mercury motor vehicle and his tools and household goods. The father was in arrears of maintenance for his work and was on unemployment insurance benefits."

Basically, it is a claim in professional negligence for the losses sustained by the defendant for the alleged negligence of the defendant. HELD: The action was dismissed with costs to the defendant to be taxed. 1)The defendant was not a party to the agreement between the plaintiff and the plaintiff. 2)The plaintiff was the legal agent, through R. MacLeod Rogers, for this specific transaction. He must therefore be in the same position as the principal insofar as liability in this transaction. The doctrine of estoppel is doctrine of fairness. It would be patently unfair for FCC to lull the plaintiff into a sense of security by renegotiating the deal with the Langilles and then, several years later, hold Gillis responsible under the original deal. 3)There were other circumstances which militated against the plaintiff in this case. Between the time the mortgage deal was made in 1979 and the foreclosure action several things occurred. FCC renegotiated new security for the mortgage and gave up the original security. There is a serious question that some of the surrendered security was of substantially greater value than that taken up. These actions were taken without any regard to the impact on the legal rights of the plaintiff's legal rights."

Dismissing the appeal, that the trial judge applied the correct test for impairment. The Criminal Code does not prescribe special tests for determining impairment. The trial judge must receive sufficient evidence to satisfy him or herself beyond reasonable doubt that the accused's ability to operate motor vehicle was impaired by alcohol. On Appeal.","This was an appeal from a decision of the Honourable Judge Anne E. Crawford, who convicted the appellant of driving a motor vehicle while his ability to operate was impaired by alcohol. The appellant appealed. Dismissing the appeal, that the trial judge erred in law in that she failed to direct herself in law as to the appropriate burden of proof in a criminal case. HELD: The appeal was dismissed with costs. 1)The trial judge applied the correct test for impairment. She did not err.  2)The test is simply the test that the Crown must meet in any case on any issue. The standard of proof is neither more nor less than that required for any other element of criminal offence. Before he can convict, trial judge must receive sufficient evidence to satisfy himself beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused's ability to operating motor vehicle was impaired. It is not an offence to drive motor vehicle after having consumed some alcohol as long as it has not impaired the ability to drive. However, person who drives while his or her ability to do so is impaired is guilty of an offence regardless of whether his ability is greatly or only slightly impaired. Courts must therefore take care when determining the issue not to apply tests which assume or imply tolerance that does not exist in law. Trial judges constantly have to keep in mind that it is an offence in motor vehicle. If them is sufficient evidence before the court to prove that he's impaired, the Judge must find him guilty. 3)The words 'impaired by alcohol' in the Criminal Code raises an issue for the trier of fact in each case. would resist any attempt to further define these words, but do reject the proposition that by the use of such plain and simply words, parliament intended to adopt some standard involving a marked departure from the norm or other graduated standards."" The above statements set forth the law to be applied in this case. In the case before us the judge carefully reviewed the evidence relating to the appellant's condition on the evening in question. She found as fact the appellant ability to drink was impaired and therefore fell into error. When one considers the fact there was a rear end collision on the 103 Highway; that the appellant walked unsteadily while holding on to his van; that his speech was slightly slurred; that he was swaying on his feet and that his pupils were dilated; and that he thought this other car pulled out in front of him when in fact she was making right hand turn off the highway, there was ample evidence."

The respondent counter-petitioned for similar relief, including divorce, joint custody and an equal division of the property. HELD: 1)Sole custody was awarded to the mother with access on the same terms as contained in the interim order. Two reasons for not awarding joint custody were the obvious acrimony between the parties and the respondent's reluctance to support his children. Three weeks after his application for sale of the home was rejected, he applied for a leave of absence from his job. It was inferred that he was trying to avoid complying with the order for interim support. 2)The mother re-entered the workforce after many years' absence.

The motorcycle was disregarded as there had not been a significant increase in value.

HELD: The application was dismissed. 1)It was assumed that the evidence led by the applicants was true in order to determine issues (iii) and (iv) which dispose of the application. Issues (i), (ii) and (vi) could not be dealt with summarily because of the conflicting affidavits. 2)Notwithstanding Queen's Bench Rule 13(1), the term action in s11 includes summary application by way of notice of motion.

They were not the sole tenant in stand alone building of the kind in Chatham Empire Theatre. The relief sought would unfairly affect the landlord. As the applicants expressed no interest in taking over the whole head lease premises on the terms of the head lease, there was no need for a conditional order of the nature of London Bridge. 4)The only memoranda consisted of the original head lease and subleases and the unsigned fax messages. The fax messages did not meet the essential requirements for a valid lease. The actions and performance by VIP and the applicant fell short of constituting part performance for the purposes of s.4 regardless of a narrow or broad interpretation of the doctrine. In any case the Court would not have exercised its discretion by binding Bennett with leases which comprised less than 15% of the head premises in the absence of evidence that clearly demonstrated the owner's ability to rent out the balance of the head lease premises was not impaired economically or physically.

The plaintiffs stated they only became aware of the damage to their home and possible health problems over period of time. Leave to appeal the June fiat was denied. The defendant plead limitation period defence to the amendment and argued that if the City had received notice of any ongoing problems it would have investigated and possibly taken steps to minimize any damage; that evidence had been lost; it may be too late to determine the causes. HELD: The amendments were allowed. 1)The limitation period in s.314(1) applies from the time damages were sustained, not from the date of the occurrence which led to the damage. The facts were uncertain. It was uncertain when the limitation period commenced. If the date the applicant should have discovered the additional damage was the date they received the geotechnical and structural engineering report, the amended claim was brought within the 1 year limitation period. 2)Inexcusable delay was not established. 3)It was not accepted that the defendant suffered actual prejudice. If it was prejudiced it was through its own inaction. No evidence had been lost. The basement was available for inspection. It had the benefit of the reports provided by the applicants. 4)The requirements of s.44(11) were met and judicial discretion was exercised to allow the amendments. The fact that the joint owner of the property was not included was due to inadvertence rather than any deliberate choice. It was also appropriate to join the new plaintiff.

The new onus on the applicant is: (1) to show that the claim asserted by the amendment or by or against the new party arose out of the same transaction or occurrence as the original claim; (2) to satisfy the court that no party will suffer actual prejudice as result of the enactment.  3) The Court was not in a position to take into account the defence position of inexcusable delay and actual prejudice.  4) The amendments were allowed. 5) The court was not able to conclude that when the delay is maximum of little over 3 years as in this case (October 23, 1995 December 7, 1998) the defendant could experience actual legal prejudice in the absence of unusual circumstances that are not present in the case.  6) The applicant was not entitled to the costs of the application. 7) As there is no legal impediment to making the amendments requested, the judge under the new enactment has an unfettered (original emphasis) discretion to grant the application once the twofold threshold onus is met.

The logical conclusion was that the address in the city of Minneapolis was a business address.

The accused agreed that the presumption of non-provocation set out in s.135.2(1) of the UMA applied and that presumption had not been displaced. HELD: 1)A $200 fine was imposed along with conditions. The dog must be kept within an enclosed continuous fence and chained to a post. There must be a gate preventing exiting except while on a leash and muzzled. The owner must display a sign stating Guard Dog on Duty. 2)If dog is territorial or protective, and the facts show the human has, by intruding, been in law provocative, the offence may not be proven beyond reasonable doubt. On the evidence there was no intrusion sufficient to justify an attack or which could be considered provocation. 3)There were seven specific pieces of evidence which supported the conclusion that the owner did not take reasonable steps to ensure his dog did not attack someone in the fashion prohibited by s.135.3(3). It is irrelevant at law that after dog attacks it responds to its owner's commands. The dog escaped the yard, was off leash and was not sufficiently restrained or enclosed. logging chain affixed to post is substantial way of tethering dog.

Once on the street, they again confronted the police officers. Their combined actions clearly affected the work of the police officers in the execution of their duty. There were reasonable and probable grounds to believe the plaintiff was obstructing the police officers in the course of their duty. 3) On the facts in this matter, the same conclusion is arrived at based solely on the plaintiff's individual actions. The plaintiff's officious interference consisted of verbal abuse, excessive criticism and undue pertinacity in his discussion and questioning and provided reasonable and probable grounds to believe he was obstructing police officers in the execution of their duty. The action for wrongful arrest is dismissed. 4) The cut to the plaintiff's head is a minor one, not requiring stitches or immediate medical attention. The plaintiff experienced headaches for several weeks. He also had stiff neck and sleep disturbance. There were no long term effects. Corrigendum received January 25, 2005 and added to fulltext.","The plaintiff sought damages for unlawful arrest and assault, including aggravated or punitive damages, arising out of events which resulted in his arrest and a charge of obstruction in the early morning of May 16, 2001. During the course of his arrest, the plaintiff received a cut to his scalp just inside the hairline above his left eye. He remained in custody until 7:30 a.m. that morning when the police officers arrested him and removed him from the premises, he refused to go with them. The police officer who arrested the plaintiff was not involved in the arrest and the actions of the defendant outside of the lounge were in dispute. The plaintiff was convicted of remaining in licensed premises after being required to leave contrary to s. 122(2)(a) of The Police Act, 1990, S.S. 1990-91, c. P-15.01."
e_2005skqb549.txt,"There is no dispute between the parties as to the nature of the plaintiff's investment in the defendant corporation. The real issue between the parties is whether the plaintiff is entitled to the summary relief, which she now seeks pursuant to Rules 129 and 133 of The Queen's Bench Rules. It is the position of the plaintiff that the cross- examination of the defendant on his affidavit discloses that the corporation is profitable company and that s. 34(2) of The Business Corporation Act does not provide any defence to the defendants against the requested relief sought. The parties are in disagreement over the issue of the amount of dividend payments that have been made by the corporation to the plaintiff pursuant to her investment in the corporation. HELD: 1) The plaintiff's application for summary judgment does not require the corporation to redeem any redeemable shares. Rather, the plaintiff's application is one seeking summary judgment. The corporate defendant is not making payment to redeem shares, but rather following judgment however and whenever obtained, it would be subject to the normal judgment process, including execution. Such execution or enforcement of judgment is not tantamount to redemption of shares. The plaintiff provided notice in writing to the corporation that she wished to redeem all her Class E preferred shares effective March 2005. The principal amount of her shares is $214,600. It is this amount that she seeks as the substance of her summary judgment. Section 34(2) of the Act does not serve to prevent the plaintiff seeking summary judgment from the court. The effect of granting judgment, if it is otherwise appropriate to do so, does not place the corporation in a position of breaching the prohibitions contained in s. 34(2) of the Act. 2) The defendants have not demonstrated that there is real insolvency on the part of the corporation. The defendants have failed to provide responses to the undertakings. Further, the defendants have not provided any professional analysis or evidence in support of their position that s. 34(2) is applicable. 3) The amount sought to be recovered by the plaintiff does represent debt or liquidated demand as contemplated by Rule 129. The plaintiff is entitled to summary judgment against the defendant corporation for the sum of $214,600 pursuant to Rule 129. Further the plaintiff is entitled to interest at the rate of 16% from March 2005 in accordance with the Share Agreement. 4) The plaintiff has not demonstrated an appropriate basis for summary judgment against the individual defendants. 5) The plaintiff is entitled to costs.","The plaintiff commenced an action against the defendants seeking various items of specific relief and costs on solicitor-client basis. Thereafter, the plaintiff brought notice of motion seeking an order that the defendants provide an accounting in relation to specified items. The defendants deny that they have any obligation to redeem the plaintiff's preferred shares, as asked for by the plaintiff in paragraph 38 of the Statement of Claim. The plaintiff also seeks an order pursuant to Queen's Bench Rules 217, 173(e) and the inherent jurisdiction of the Court striking the statement of defence of all the defendants. HELD: 1) The plaintiff's motion does not require the defendants to make any payment to purchase or redeem any redeemable shares. The effect of granting a judgment, if it is otherwise appropriate to do so, does not place the corporation in a position of breaching the prohibitions contained in s34(2) of the Business Corporations Act.  2) There is no evidence before the Court to suggest any grounds for believing that the corporation is or would be insolvent as required by s. 34(2). 3) There are no impediments or justification for not allowing the amendment to proceed, and accordingly, the application for summary judgment is granted in favour of the plaintiff.  4) The court is of the view that s.34(1) does not serve to prevent the plaintiff seeking summary judgment from the Court. It is the position of the defendant that the cross-examination of Donald Beveridge on his affidavit discloses that Peak Enterprises Inc. is not making payment to redeem shares in essence but rather, following judgment however and whenever obtained, it would be subject to the normal judgment process, including execution. Such execution or enforcement is not tantamount to redemption of shares."

The plaintiff claims she told the Town Office to shut off her water supply and the failure to do so let to the damages being sustained. HELD: The claim is dismissed. 1) There is no evidence that the plaintiff gave clear instructions to the town to shut off her water. 2) The proximate cause of the damage was turning off the heat and power without ensuring that water line, toilets, and the water tank had been properly drained. 3) The plaintiff sustained no damages herself. She admits she negotiated the sale price of $50,000 with her daughter prior to any damage being sustained to the property. No adjustment had to be made to her daughter thereafter for any 'loss' occasioned. Any claim would have to be made by her daughter not her.","The plaintiff brought an action for water damage sustained to her former residence when frozen pipes burst. She alleged that she instructed the Town Office to shut off her water supply and the failure to do so led to the damages being sustained. HELD: The action was dismissed. The Court found that the plaintiff's action could not succeed for the following reasons: 1) the action cannot succeed because clear instructions were given to the plaintiff to disconnect the water service. To the contrary, the form executed by the plaintiff clearly indicates request for final billing. This however cannot be construed as negligence in the circumstances by the town nor does the fact that specific forms are now utilized for disconnect purposes, elevate the matter on the facts before the Court, to negligence by the defendant.  2) the Court found the plaintiff’s action could succeed because of a misunderstanding at best between what the plaintiff believed she was requesting and what in fact she did instruct."

Section 228 of the Workers’ Compensation Act does not limit the retroactive payment of chronic pain benefit stemming from injury between March 23, 1990 and February 1, 1996. The Chronic Pain Regulations did not come into effect until 2004. There was no issue of recalculation here. The November 26 date chosen by the Board as the effective day for when the recalculated award is to take effect. The recalculation of the date is one choices (sic) under that section for the recalculation in this case.

There is no authority which prevents the payment of benefits for chronic pain for period prior to that date."
e_2009nssm47.txt,"The claimants live on property abutting the defendant Burrow's property. The defendant Renouf is Burrows' friend. As favour, Renouf attended the property while Burrows was away and cut down some trees that he was asked to cut. He went on to cut down several others that he felt were diseased/damaged. eventually realizing he had crossed the property line and cut down more than 17 of the claimants' trees. The claimants sued for the cost of replacing the trees with a comparable number of mature trees, the cost of removing the felled trees and to recoup for anticipated damage to their septic field. At issue was: 1. whether Renouf trespassed; 2. whether Burrows was liable for Renouf's actions (for 'hiring' Renouf or because they were engaged in a joint enterprise); and 3. damages. The claimants did not want Burrows helping with the tree removal, even if doing so would save money. 1. Renouf trespassed on the claimants' land and is liable for damages. That it was an honest mistake is irrelevant since trespass does not require bad faith or improper purpose. 2. Burrows is not liable. He was not Renouf's employer, nor were Renouf's actions foreseeable. It was a favour and Renouf went way beyond the scope of what he was asked to do. Burrows is not responsible for everything that flowed from their limited enterprise. The case law requires a degree of blameworthiness (a neglectful or unlawful enterprise) which creates a foreseeable risk of harm. 3. Renouf to pay the claimants: $3,750 to replace the trees with young, native trees (half the amount sought by the claimants), $2,000 for tree removal (half the quote submitted by the claimants since they refused to mitigate the damage by allowing Burrows to help). While Burrows had counterclaimed for damages arising from a confrontation between the claimants and his son, he did not seriously pursue it and it was dismissed. Costs of $1,234 awarded to the claimants (including $960.77 for disbursements). While the amount seems high, the case was large one and the counterclaim, although not seriously pursued, hung over the claimants' heads as they prepared for trial.","HELD: The claim was dismissed. The Court found that there was a degree of blameworthiness which caused liability to attach. It could be because the enterprise was itself unlawful, or because there was neglect on the part of one of the parties which created a foreseeable risk of harm. The defendant was clearly liable for a trespass. The Claimants were allowed their costs in the amount of $174.13 for the issuance of the claim plus $100.00 for service on the two defendants for a total of $3,750.00.  1)There was no evidence that the defendant would stray so far from the area discussed that a neighbour's property might be breached. There was no reasonable foreseeability that the tree cutting would damage the Claimants' septic field. 2)The Court dismissed the counterclaim and allowed the action against the Defendant Renouf, either because he was 'hired' by Burrows or because the two were involved in a joint enterprise. The court awarded damages against the defendant for the actions of the defendant Renouf.  3)The court did not consider the Counterclaim to have been established and it will be dismissed."
e_2009skpc9.txt,"The plaintiff claims against the defendant for water damage sustained to their belongings while in transit from Edmonton to Nipawin in a one ton, 17 foot cube van owned by the defendants. The issues are whether the plaintiffs are precluded from recovery against the defendant by virtue of the contractual term acknowledging the equipment to be water resistant only as well as the posted disclaimers to this effect. HELD: The plaintiff shall have judgment for $250 plus costs of issuing the claim and service. 1) Notwithstanding that the plaintiff signed the rental contract acknowledging that the equipment was not waterproof and only water resistant, it appears from the last three sentences of the inspection report that water was entering at the corners of the door by virtue of the door not sitting flat at the corners. This defect would have permitted excess water to enter prior to being cleaned. Perfection could not be expected since it was acknowledged that the rental unit was not waterproof and some seepage may be expected even after the door had been fixed. Nonetheless, the sealing problem would have taken it beyond the acknowledgment of the unit being only water resistant. 2) The plaintiff acknowledges that the truck remained parked outside in heavy rainfall for two days and nights prior to being unloaded. This exacerbated the scope of the damage claimed since the water would have continued to seep in unabated for roughly six times as long as the trip itself took. The Court concludes that the defendant is only 20% responsible for the damages sustained to the plaintiff's possessions.","The Plaintiffs claim $6,700.77 against the Defendant for water damage sustained while in transit from Edmonton to Nipawin, Saskatchewan in a one ton, 17 foot cube van owned by the Defendant. HELD: 1) Whether the Plaintiffs are precluded from recovery by virtue of the contractual term acknowledging the equipment to be water resistant only as well as the posted disclaimers to this effect. The Court also questions the quantum of damages sustained and puts mitigation of damages in issue.  2) Quantum of damages and mitigation. The plaintiffs were awarded damages totalling $1,250.77. Even if the goods were transported in heavy rain conditions as the evidence disclosed, the plaintiffs are nonetheless the authors of their own misfortune by permitting the loaded truck to sit for an additional two days after reaching their destination in steady rain prior to its unloading. The Defendant denies responsibility relying upon term of the rental contract which stated '... understand that the equipment rented is water resistant and not water proof'. The Court notes that the disclaimers are located in several locations inside the truck box. The court concludes that in all the circumstances the Defendant to be only 20 responsible for the damages sustained to the plaintiffs' possessions. Quantum of damage and mitigation are: a) the number of items that were water damaged. The number of people who suffered water damage in the event of heavy rain and the fact that the truck remained parked outside in heavy rainfall for two days and nights prior to being unloaded. This undoubtedly exacerbated the scope of the damage claimed since the water would have continued to seep in unabated for roughly six times as long as the trip itself took.

e_2011skqb467.txt,"The complainant and the accused were in relationship and came to Regina where they stayed in hotel, drank, consumed cocaine and shopped. An argument ensued about missing shopping bag. The accused was charged with two counts of uttering death threats to the complainant; unlawfully confining the complainant; assault causing bodily harm on the complainant; committing sexual assault on the complainant; breach of recognizance in having contact with the complainant. At trial, both the complainant and the accused testified as to what transpired during the argument that resulted in the charges. HELD: 1) The accused was found not guilty of sexual assault. 2) The accused was found guilty of unlawful confinement. 3) The accused was found guilty of assault causing bodily harm. The Court did not accept the accused's invoking of self-defence pursuant to s. 34(1) of the Criminal Code. The accused admitted to striking the complainant with a closed fist five times as hard as he could and the force used was excessive. 4) The accused was found guilty of threatening to kill the complainant at the hotel. 5) The accused was found guilty of uttering death threats and breach of recognizance by contacting the complainant. The Court did not accept his testimony and denial.","HELD: The defendant was found not guilty of sexual assault, assault causing bodily harm, unlawful confinement and uttering death threats. The elements required for self defence were not present. The complainant swore she tried to flee several times after the melee in the hotel room and the defendant threatened to kill her. While there was no requirement that the defendant measure his force to a nicety, here the force used was excessive. The Crown had proven each required element of this offence beyond a reasonable doubt and found the defendant guilty of unlawful confinement."
e_2012nssc101.txt,"The accused was charged with sexual assault and various other sexual offences with respect to his niece (who had spent weekends and summers with her father, who lived with his sister and the accused) when she was between the ages of 12 to 15. The accused denied the allegations, suggesting that, since the niece had not disclosed any of these matters until she was 17 years old, she had made up generalized allegation against him to stop her boyfriend from breaking up with her and then found it necessary to maintain the lie, tell her friends, her mother and the police and get more specific when pressed for details. He also argued that she was not credible because her testimony in court was inconsistent with that in the preliminary inquiry and although there were numerous persons she could have confided in at the time, she never told anybody about the alleged incidents but kept going back to visit her father. Accused found guilty of all counts. Although she was at times frustrated and unable to recall precisely, the niece's demeanour was consistent with a young person doing her best to be truthful and accurate in intimidating and embarrassing circumstances. Her evidence was both consistent with that of other witnesses and internally consistent and the inconsistencies with her previous statements were minor. The court found she had no motive to lie initially or during her trial testimony and the reality was that by making these allegations, she knew her father would be forced to move and would become estranged from his sister, her family would be fractured and the 'sister'-like relationship she had with the accused's daughter would end.",HELD: The Court found that the accused was guilty of four counts of sexual assault. The Court held that the Crown had proved beyond a reasonable doubt that he was guilty. The accused had acted in a manner that violated the victim's sexual integrity. The court also held that there was some confusion between the evidence of the witnesses about where the accused lived and when he moved in with them.

The Court had earlier acquitted the accused on the charge of driving while disqualified as there was no evidence regarding the status of the accused's driver's licence. At issue was whether the GiO cycle or moped which the accused was operating was a motor vehicle as defined by the Criminal Code. The accused asserted that his GiO bike was operated that night by pedaling it as the electric motor was not working and asserted that driver's licence was not required to operate the GiO bike nor was he required to put licence plate on it. HELD: The accused was found not guilty of the charges before the Court. There was no evidence that the electric motor on the GiO bike was operational that evening and the officer testified that he observed the accused dragging his feet while driving the moped.,"The accused was charged with impaired driving and failure to provide samples of his breath for analysis contrary to s. 253(1)(a) of the Criminal Code. The issue before the court was whether the GiO cycle which the accused was operating was a motor vehicle as defined by the Code. HELD: The accused was found not guilty of the charges.  1)The accused had been a member of the Regina Police Service for four and one half years. He had been on general patrol duty in his police vehicle which was proceeding westbound on Saskatchewan Drive. As the police vehicle approached the intersection of Broad Street and Broad Street against red light, the accused noticed a driver on a moped that was operating an electric motor under the seat. The accused indicated that he was dragging his feet while driving the moped. The officer testified that he observed the accused pedaling the bike with both of his feet being close to the ground rather than resting on the floor board as the electric motor powered the bike. 2)The Crown failed to prove that the accused's motor vehicle was motor vehicle. The Crown must prove on February 26, 2010 that his GiO bike was an electric bicycle. The offence was committed when the accused blew into the approved screening device twice. His first breath lacked sufficient pressure to activate the device. His second breath registered a fail result. The defence did not cross examine the accused. 3)The court found the accused guilty of all charges, including impaired driving, driving while disqualified and refusal to provide breath sample."
e_2013skqb390.txt,"HELD: The Court sentenced the accused pursuant to s. 742.1 of the Criminal Code in force at the time of the offence that precluded the use of conditional sentence order for a serious personal injury offence, which included sexual assault. The Court found that the offences fell on the low end of the sexual assault spectrum as there was no skin to skin contact, the contact was brief and without violence or threats. The aggravating factors were that the accused had two previous convictions for sexual offences and that one of the victims had some cognitive disability. The accused was sentenced to a term of one year imprisonment for each count, followed by a term of probation of two years. The sentences were to be served concurrently.","HELD: The accused was found guilty of two counts of sexual assault contrary to s. 271 of the Criminal Code.  1)The relevant provisions of the Code in force at the time of the offences do not allow a conditional sentence. The accused presented a low risk to re-offend, as he had two previous convictions of sexual interference on children. Aggravating factors included the abuse of person under 18. However, there was no abuse of trust. The respondent used physical force which distinguishes this case from the cases of fleeting touching. 2)The accused was 61 years old. He was born in Labrador and lived in Labrador until 1980 when he moved to Regina. He had a Grade to education level and a drinking problem. He is divorced and lives alone. The Court of Appeal set aside the sentence and imposed a sentence of imprisonment of less than 2 years and is satisfied the service of the sentence in the community would not endanger the safety of the community and the accused's previous criminal record prevent him from gaining employment. 3)The court found that in major sexual assaults involving adult offenders and victims, three years would be a starting point from which a sentencing judge should start, increasing or decreasing the term according the aggravating and mitigating factors."
e_2013skqb434.txt,HELD: The Court granted the application. It held that: 1) a solicitor-client relationship was created between the applicants and the defendants based on the evidence; and 2) that the applicants had not rebutted the presumption that they had received confidential information during the meeting that was relevant to the plaintiff’s action against the defendants. That finding was sufficient to disqualify them for acting for the plaintiff.,"The sole issue presented by this application is whether the Phillips and Holgates and the lawyers with Phillips Co. should be disqualified from continuing to act for the plaintiff because of a conflict of interest. At its core, the action between Pearce-Ell and Holgate pertains to the terms of the agreement for sale, which is the same matter, or at the very least, a related matter to the original retainer. That alone is sufficient to justify their disqualification. The same result is achieved by applying the Martin principles and presumptions. As Mr. Phillips possessed relevant confidential information from a former client which could prejudice them in the within action, disqualification is generally automatic."
e_2014skqb265.txt,The determination of whether the trial judge’s conclusion regarding the officer’s suspicion was reasonable was question of law subject to the correctness standard. The respondent conceded that the officer had the requisite subjective belief that he had alcohol in his body so the appeal centered on whether the objective test had been met. The appeal court did not find any basis to disturb the trial judge’s finding of fact as to the factors the officer based his suspicion of alcohol consumption on. The court noted the trouble with the fact that the respondent admitted to drinking alcohol that “evening” but the stop was at 5:00 am in the morning. The trial judge disregarded the respondent’s admission to drinking because there was no smell of alcohol and the trial judge said there should be if the consumption was recent. The court concluded that the trial judge erred in dismissing the alcohol consumption admission. A reasonable person would have assumed that the officer’s question was with respect to recent consumption of alcohol not an earlier irrelevant time. It was also found reasonable for the officer to believe the consumption was recent. The court concluded that a reasonable person standing in the officer’s place would reasonably suspect that the respondent had alcohol in his body. An answer by an accused person that they have been drinking was found to be stronger support for a suspicion than the smell of alcohol. Because the respondent’s Charter rights were not breached a new trial was ordered.,"HELD: The appeal was allowed. The trial judge specifically found that the appellant relied only on three factors in forming his suspicion. This was a finding of fact. There was no basis for disturbing this finding of facts. The Court reviewed the meaning of the s. 24(2) Charter remedy and found that Cst. Kowalenko, through haste or carelessness, did not carry out his responsibilities and should have done further investigation before 'leaping straight to demand that the accused provide incriminating evidence against himself'. The Court classified the breaches as'somewhat serious' and concluded that the trial judge erred in excluding the Certificate of Qualified Technician."
e_2014skqb344.txt,"The court gave leave to counsel for the plaintiff to file an amended draft order nisi. It made the following recommendations regarding the draft order: 1) the sale should be held under the direction of a solicitor other than the plaintiff’s solicitor; 2) that relying upon a partial appraisal and in the absence of information on the condition of the property, setting the reserve bid at $100,000 might not reflect the best price. Fairness demanded the reserve bid be set at $125,000 but the court set the bid at $115,000. If the property could not be sold at that price, the plaintiff was given leave to apply to the court for a lower reserve bid; and 3) Queen’s Bench rule 10-47(2) required that purchase monies are to be paid into court to the credit of the cause to be applied as directed by the court, including costs. Only after an application and service upon the defendant and after the court had assessed solicitor client costs could monies be disbursed to the plaintiff. Monies owed under the mortgage must be set out by the court on application. All of these matters may be addressed in one final proceeding, in the application to confirm the sale, if the judicial sale proved successful.","The plaintiff applied for an order nisi for judicial sale of the property owned by the defendants. The Limitation of Civil Rights Act does not preclude the plaintiff from suing on the covenant because this is not a purchase-money mortgage. However, a judicial sale is required so that the plaintiff may apply to have the amount of deficiency in the judgment set by the court. Otherwise, as provided by s. of the LCRA, foreclosure of the mortgage operates as full satisfaction of that debt. The plaintiff has leave to return the matter to court to seek a lower reserve bid, based upon evidence to support its position. Therefore, the reserve bid (or minimum selling price) is $115,000."
e_2016skca29.txt,"HELD: The majority of the court granted leave to appeal and restored the conviction entered by the trial judge. The parties and court agreed that the provisions of s. 34(1) as they read prior to May 2012 were applicable. The issues were determined as follows: 1) the appeal court judge erred by misunderstanding the applicable test and inappropriately focusing on the respondent’s belief. The appeal court judge reviewed cases that led him to focus on the doctrine of mistake of fact, which was not argued by the respondent at trial and were not part of his grounds of appeal; 2) the trial judge accepted some but not all of the expert’s evidence, as he was entitled to do. The trial judge also reinterpreted the video evidence, which was found to be an error by the Court of Appeal. The trial judge considered the factors without weighing the use of force to a nicety. He was determining the objective reasonableness of the force based on the factors; and 3) the appeal court judge properly instructed himself on the standard of review but failed to analyze the decision of the trial judge based on that standard, namely, whether the evidence was reasonably capable of supporting the trial judge’s conclusion based on the evidence as a whole. The dissenting judge would have granted leave to appeal but then would have dismissed the appeal. The dissenting judge of the Court of Appeal found that the appeal court judge erred in his approach but reached the right conclusion that the trial judge erred. The trial judge ignored the fact that the encounter was only three seconds long and he mischaracterized the thrust-kick as extreme force. The respondent had to react quickly. The trial judge also erred in questioning whether the respondent honestly believed he was in danger of harm.","The Crown applied for leave to appeal the decision of the summary conviction appeal court pursuant to s. 839 of the Criminal Code. The Crown argued that the trial judge erred in the approach he took to measure the appellant's use of force, and in disregarding the evidence of Mr. Stonechild. HELD: The appeal was allowed and the conviction of Constable Power entered in the Provincial Court was reinstated. 1) The trial judge properly focused on the only issue to be decided, i.e., whether the force used by the appellant was no more than necessary to defend himself under s. 34(1) of the Code or effect the arrest of the accused. 2) The Court reviewed the jurisprudence regarding s. 25(1), the Code, and the principles to be applied are well established and the law allows a flexible or tolerant approach to the objective measure of whether force is proportionate in all the circumstances. 3) The court found that the appellant erred by taking too much of an approach that was not in keeping with the training provided to police officers. The Court also found that in assessing whether there is an air of reality to the proportionality requirement, that is whether the officer was justified in kicking the victim in the abdomen, driving him backwards and causing him to fall backwards and injure his head. 4) The appeal court judge failed to take into account certain factors in his analysis of whether the level of force was necessary, namely, the nature and extent of the assault or threatened assault the accused faced (the “threat assessment”); and the nature of the responsive force the accused actually used. 5) The Crown failed to show that the Court had discharged the burden of proving, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the option used was not one that a reasonable person in the position of the appellant might be expected to employ. It necessarily follows that verdict of not guilty must be entered. 6) Appeal allowed."
e_2016skpc106.txt,"HELD: The accused was found not guilty. The court found that the accused’s s. 8 Charter rights were breached. Pursuant to a Grant analysis, the court excluded the evidence obtained after the illegal entry of the accused’s home. The court found that the accused had not consented to the entry by the officer and the complainant and it was therefore a warrantless search. The officer did not have the lawful authority to enter the home on the basis of arresting the father as he was not in hot pursuit. The complainant had not obtained a warrant under s. 13.1 of The Child and Family Services Act to enter the accused’s home and therefore had no lawful authority to enter the home. There were no exigent circumstances to justify the search such as preventing the destruction of evidence as they already established that the person they sought was not in the house. The unlawful entry and search of the accused’s home was a severe breach of the accused’s Charter rights. The impact upon her was severe as the complainant gathered evidence and apprehended her children. The accused’s assault on the complainant was minor in nature and although not excusable, her offence was a reaction to a significant breach of her rights. The administration of justice was served by excluding the evidence.","The accused was charged with assault contrary to s. 266 of The Child and Family Services Act. The accused was also charged with breach of probation by failing to keep the peace and good behaviour. HELD: The Court found that the accused did not have any lawful authority to enter the complainant's apartment suite to apprehend the father of the children. The Court also concluded that she had no such warrant and had never utilized a warrant before.  1) The Court was not satisfied that the Court was of the opinion that contact between child and another person would cause the child to be in need of protection. There was no basis for the Court to conclude that this was the case. 2) The accused had no authority under s. 13.1 of the child and family services Act. He was not exercising criminal law power and his entrance to the suite will be contrary to her section rights, unless that entrance and search is determined to be lawful under some other legal authority. 3) The defence admitted the identity of the accused and the jurisdiction of the court. It was very similar to Meier, 2009 SKPC 30 (CanLII). In that case, the police informed the complainant that they had to allow them in to investigate regarding the children and they did so. The complainant did not immediately grant them entry. She did so because she thought the accused was in hot pursuit of an individual, and he was attempting to make the arrest. The fact that the worker had directed that the officer was not to have contact with the complainant does not alter that situation. 4) The court was also of the view that it was open to the Crown and the Ministry to establish that any contact between a child protection worker and a third person was harmful to the children, and that he was not attempting to act under the Charter. 5) There was some debate as to the status of a simple directive from the officer when no order was made. The order that the complainant and the police enter a residence to investigate whether or not the accused has a warrant for the arrest of the father does not establish grounds for apprehension. The court found that there was no breach of the respondent's s. 16(1) order. The respondent was specifically asked whether she had a warrant under s13.1 or s. 14.1 allowing her to enter her home. She testified that she did not believe he had authority under the Criminal Code to act, and she was not aware that he had contact with her in the past. She stated that the police had given them permission"
e_2016skpc157.txt,"HELD: The court found with respect to the following issues: 1) it would not permit the defence to argue the s. 8 violation at the conclusion of the trial because it had not mentioned it in its Charter notice. The Crown disclosed the video-taped interaction between the officer and the accused to the defence at the outset and it was clearly pertinent to the issue of reasonable suspicion, but the defence failed to raise it; and 2) there were two periods of delay and the court was satisfied that the 77 minutes between arrival at the station and the taking of the second sample was satisfactorily explained. However, the court found that first period of 35 minutes between the arrest to the time of departure was not satisfactorily explained. The officer did not act expeditiously and the delay may have prejudiced the accused because when, as here, the readings are slightly above the legal limit, the tests need to be taken as soon as practicable to ensure that the accused’s blood alcohol content at the time of driving is determined accurately. The Crown was not entitled to rely on the presumption in s. 259(1)(c) of the Code.","The accused was charged with impaired driving and care of motor vehicle contrary to s. 255(1) and s. 253(1)(a) of the Criminal Code. While her ability to operate a motor vehicle was impaired by alcohol or drug, she had the care or control of a vehicle. The accused was arrested within seconds of encountering the accused that he had reasonable suspicion for an ASD demand. He had no opportunity to observe the accused. He made the demand before asking the accused if she consumed any liquor. He failed to articulate the grounds for reasonable suspicion. The officer's explanation for not being able to leave the scene till some thirty-five minutes after he arrested the accused was not satisfactory. The delay may have prejudiced the accused, as the delay was unreasonable. A rudimentary, or even a perfunctory perusal of the disclosed material would have shown the video-taped interaction between the accused and the accused at the outset."
