The original mortgage executed by the plaintiff was for $191,000 of which $176,000 was advanced to purchase her condominium and $15,000, eight per cent of the total, was advanced for other purchases. The property sold for $156,000 pursuant to a judicial sale. The sale proceeds were distributed to pay outstanding property taxes, commission, and the principal and interest due under the mortgage in the amount of $141,945 and the net sale proceeds were to be distributed pro rata. As at November 1, 2017, the principal and interest owing on the non-purchase money portion of the mortgage was $21,250. The plaintiff requested judgment for the deficiency in the amount of $9,900 with interest to the date of judgment. It claimed it was entitled to solicitor-client costs and other costs accrued by it under the mortgage. The issue was whether such costs should be subject to the pro rata calculation for the nonpurchase portion of the mortgage, that is, 8 percent of the total costs incurred.  HELD: The application was granted. The court found that the plaintiff was entitled to a deficiency judgment for principal and interest owed under the mortgage in the amount requested. It was also entitled to judgment against the mortgagee for eight percent of the solicitor-client costs, condominium fees and property management charges.","The plaintiff applies by notice of application for a deficiency judgment pertaining to the non-purchase money portion of the outstanding indebtedness to the defendant, Doreen Pearl Partridge [Partridge], pertaining to her non-Purchpee Money portion of her indebtedness pursuant to her mortgage. RBC also applies to have its lawyers' costs assessed on a solicitor-client basis. The issue is whether the pro rata distribution applies solely to the indebtedness of principal and accrued interest or applies to all costs under the mortgage. HELD: The plaintiff is entitled to a deficiency judgement for principal and interest owed under the Mortgage in the amount of $4,500.  1) The plaintiff applies for taxable disbursements of $121.47, non-taxable disbursement of $180.00 and the applicable GST and PST. 2) The pro-rata calculation of the non‑purch money mortgage is 8% of the total outstanding mortgage amount. 3) The court finds that RBC is entitled in the amounts of $9,901.23 with interest from November 1, 2017 to the date of judgment at the rate of 2.79 per annum representing the deficiency against Partridge. The amount of solicitor‑client costs, condominium fees and property management charges is added to the deficiency judgment along with the prorated principal and Interest due. R.B. claims it was entitled to solicitor-admissions costs and other costs accrued by RBC under its mortgage. The issues are whether such costs should be subject to the pro-rate calculation in the calculation of its non-payment money mortgage. 4) The respondent is awarded costs of the judgment payable by the court in the sum of $1,528.90 for arrears of condominiums. The condominium fee paid by the plaintiff is assessments levied against the mortgagor's land and are recoverable under the terms of the mortgage and the GST are not. 5) RBC claims it is awarded solicitor-custodial costs, real estate commission and the principal and interests due under the mortgages. The Issue is whether this matter should be subjected to pro- rata in the manner that was conducted in smooth and timely fashion. The pro rat calculation of non-payments of purchase, purchase and sale proceeds is the same as that used by the defendant in that it is permitted by s. 8(1) of the Condominium Property Act.

e_2016skca29.txt,"HELD: The majority of the court granted leave to appeal and restored the conviction entered by the trial judge. The parties and court agreed that the provisions of s. 34(1) as they read prior to May 2012 were applicable. The issues were determined as follows: 1) the appeal court judge erred by misunderstanding the applicable test and inappropriately focusing on the respondent’s belief. The appeal court judge reviewed cases that led him to focus on the doctrine of mistake of fact, which was not argued by the respondent at trial and were not part of his grounds of appeal; 2) the trial judge accepted some but not all of the expert’s evidence, as he was entitled to do. The trial judge also reinterpreted the video evidence, which was found to be an error by the Court of Appeal. The trial judge considered the factors without weighing the use of force to a nicety. He was determining the objective reasonableness of the force based on the factors; and 3) the appeal court judge properly instructed himself on the standard of review but failed to analyze the decision of the trial judge based on that standard, namely, whether the evidence was reasonably capable of supporting the trial judge’s conclusion based on the evidence as a whole. The dissenting judge would have granted leave to appeal but then would have dismissed the appeal. The dissenting judge of the Court of Appeal found that the appeal court judge erred in his approach but reached the right conclusion that the trial judge erred. The trial judge ignored the fact that the encounter was only three seconds long and he mischaracterized the thrust-kick as extreme force. The respondent had to react quickly. The trial judge also erred in questioning whether the respondent honestly believed he was in danger of harm.","The Crown appealed the conviction of the respondent member of the Regina City Police Service who pushed the victim of a sexual assault to the ground and kicked him in the abdomen. The Summary Conviction Appeal Court judge determined that the trial judge had erred in finding the respondent guilty, set aside the conviction and entered an acquittal. The Crown applies for leave to appeal the decision of the summary conviction appeal court pursuant to s. 839 of the Criminal Code. HELD: The appeal is allowed and the conviction is entered in the Provincial Court. 1) The trial judge did not err in concluding that the respondent's subjective belief in the force used was not reasonable in all of the circumstances. Rather, he engaged in a modified objective inquiry, which in this case involved a disregard for the evidence and the trial decision. 2) In assessing whether there is an air of reality to the proportionality requirement, that is whether the responsive force was no more than necessary in all the circumstances, the Court ordered himself to disregard the evidence of the Crown's expert and to measure the force use to nicety. 3) The Court found that the appellant was not guilty of assault causing bodily harm as it concluded that the Crown had discharged the burden of proving, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the option used by the respondent was not one that reasonable person in the position of the appellant might be expected to employ. It necessarily follows that a verdict of not guilty must be entered."
8_2012skpc79.txt,"The accused's neighbour disliked the accused and alleged that the accused drove his vehicle into hers. The police arrested the accused and found a fob that operated the locks on the doors of the vehicle and the engine hood of the accused's vehicle was warm. The accused was charged with hit and run and impaired driving. HELD: The Court found the accused not guilty of both charges. The Court found that the police breaches of the accused's Charter rights were numerous. The approximate 11 minutes of investigative detention was not an infringement of his rights but the combination of the officers' failing to inform the accused of the reason for his arrest and not giving his rights to counsel without delay, coupled with the illegal search and seizure of the fob and keys were in total breaches serious enough to bring the administration of justice into disrepute. The Court excluded the evidence of the fob and keys which further weakened the circumstantial case against the accused to the extent that the Crown failed to prove the accused was the operator of the motor vehicle.","The accused was charged with two counts of driving over the legal limit. The evidence was led on the trial proper and on voir dire pursuant to an application under s. 24(2) of the Charter to exclude evidence allegedly because of breach of the accused's rights under the Charter. The primary defence was that the police failed to inform the accused of the reason for his detention and that they had unlawfully searched his vehicle. HELD: The accused was found not guilty of both charges.  1) The police had the requisite subjective and objective grounds to detain the accused. However, they did not have the means to detain him. The police officer who detained the accused did not inform him of the reasons for the detention nor did he advise him that he could consult counsel. 2) The exclusion of the evidence of the fob and keys further weakens the circumstantial case against the accused to the extent that the Crown has failed to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused was the operator of the motor vehicle."
d_2013skqb90.txt,"The appellants appealed a small claims judgment. The judgment had found the appellants liable for damages after the respondent, who had purchased a house from the appellants, discovered that water was entering his basement. When the respondent investigated the source of the water, he removed the interior wall of the basement and discovered that there was a second wall behind the first one. He also discovered that a large chunk of the concrete footing and concrete grade beam were broken and had slid into the space between the interior basement wall. The respondent obtained a professional opinion that suggested that the problem had been there for a significant period of time and that the wooden beam that sat on the concrete grade beam was rotten and would have to be replaced. The respondent was awarded judgment in the amount of the repair. The appellant appealed on the basis that the trial judge should not have considered the respondent's expert's opinion about the age of the defect, that the trial judge had crossed a line in assisting the self-represented plaintiff at the trial and that the trial judge erred in calculating damages. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. The respondent's expert was qualified as an expert concerning foundation repair and had the necessary experience to give expert evidence on the type of structural repair and the need for structural repair. Once qualified as an expert in the area of foundations and structural repair, he could testify on the nature of the foundation's problems, including the wooden beam. The witness was also the person who actually carried out the repair to the foundation and was entitled to give evidence on what he saw and did. The witness was properly qualified by virtue of his years of experience and the trial judge was entitled to accept his evidence as to the state of the foundation and how long it had been in such a state. The trial judge's intervention and comments to the appellant's lawyer at the trial did not go beyond the nature of a legitimate attempt to ensure that all of the evidence regarding the matters at issue was before the Court with sufficient clarity to allow the trial judge to understand it. The cause of action in this case was negligent misrepresentation. The trial judge found that the appellants were aware of the structural defect and had covered it up. The proper measure of damages is the amount of money required to put the plaintiff in the position he would have occupied if the negligent misrepresentation had not been made. In this case, the judge made no palpable or overriding error in calculating damages at the amount it cost to fix the foundation.","HELD: The appeal was dismissed. The trial judge made no palpable and overriding error in the calculation of damages. The court found that the trial judge erred by failing to weigh necessity and qualification before determining the admissibility of certain opinion evidence tendered on behalf of the plaintiff. The damages awarded were much higher than the damages awarded for the triple-ply beam notwithstanding that liability as to the concrete grade beam was not established at trial. The appellant had been self-represented and had not proven that the wooden beam was rotten or that it was not in place at the trial. There was no evidence that the appellant's allegations of negligent misrepresentation raised a reasonable apprehension of bias on the part of the trial court judge. The evidence of the defendant's failure to prove liability for a damaged concrete grade beams was found to have been concealed by the exterior wall of the respondent's house. Although there was uncertainty about the timing of the broken concrete grade, which included not only the rotten wooden beam but also the cracks in the foundation, could have been discovered by the respondent or his property inspector. The respondent may then have elected not to proceed with the purchase contract or alternatively remedied the defect before the wall collapsed inward. There is no suggestion that the amount of work done was not necessary to repair the damage done when the foundation caved in and water entered the basement."
4_1994canlii4625.txt,"At trial in Provincial Court, the accuseds called no evidence and were convicted. They appealed on the basis that the Crown's evidence was so insufficient that a verdict of guilty was unreasonable or was one which could not reasonably be supported on the evidence. HELD: Appeal dismissed. 1)No medical evidence was necessary to establish that the victim's injuries were caused by an assault, given the photographs admitted into evidence, the evidence of the police officer who was called to the scene of the assault and the evidence of the 7-11 clerk who was first approached by the victim for assistance. 2)Evidence of exclusive opportunity was unnecessary to sustain a conviction where there was other circumstantial evidence pointing to the identity of the accuseds. 3)Although a failure to permit an accused who calls no evidence to argue last in a jury trial might be a good ground of appeal, the failure to be permitted to argue last before a judge alone was merely a procedural error which could be cured under the curative provision contained in S.686(1)(b)(iv) of the Criminal Code.","Appeal from Provincial Court. The question was whether the evidence adduced by the Crown - the defence called no evidence - was insufficient to such a degree that a trial judge's verdict of guilty ought to be found by this Court either unreasonable or one that cannot be supported by the evidence. HELD: Appeal dismissed. 1)The procedural point raised by the appellants had no merit. It was readily resolved by examining the circumstances immediately preceding the infliction of the injuries by looking at the photographs of the victim taken the following day by the opinions of both the counterman at the 7-Eleven store who saw the victim shortly after the injuries were inflicted and called the police, and of the investigating officer who saw him shortly after that. 2)There was sufficient evidence for the trial judge to reach a conclusion respecting the cause of the injury beyond a reasonable doubt without resorting to medical opinion.  3)The issue of identity was also raised. The trial judge relied on s.651(3) of the Code which provides: 651(2)Where no witnesses are examined for an accused, he or his counsel is entitled to address the jury last but otherwise counsel for the prosecution is entitled only to address that jury last. 4)The substantive issue was whether there was enough evidence to present a'reasonable verdict'. In either case the Circumstantial evidence of opportunity was sufficient to sustain a finding of identity beyond areasonable doubt.  5)The Court of Appeal was of the view that the procedural issue was not supported by substantive evidence contained in the provision of s686(1)(a)(i). The procedural issue, which was not addressed in the traditional sense, was dismissed without a substantive curbing of the right to address a jury last without a procedural error of law."
c_1993canlii4474.txt,"The parties lived together for 14 years and had three children, aged eight, 13 and 14. The petitioner always worked and eventually became a successful stockbroker. The respondent was employed part-time doing minimum wage jobs and was responsible for the household duties and raising their children. The petitioner's annual income was $50,000 at the time of separation, but escalated to $200,000 in 1992 and was prone to great fluctuation. The respondent was to have custody of the children. She sought spousal and child support and an unequal division of assets. Ordering support and an unequal division of assets. The court extensively reviewed the case of Moge v. Moge (1992), 43 R.F.L.(3d) 345 (S.C.C.) and found that marriage and child care responsibilities hinder a wife's role in the workplace. The court awarded $4500 per month as spousal and child support, plus an additional $500 while the wife retrained. The court considered this an appropriate case for an unequal division of matrimonial assets in the respondent's favour. Finding that the awards were still not sufficient to satisfy the respondent's needs, a lump sum award of $18,000 was ordered. On appeal.","The parties, along with their mother, decided to buy a coffee franchise. Although the parties had agreed on the valuation and physical division of the matrimonial assets and debts, the physical division represented an unequal division in favour of the respondent to the extent of $16,868. The respondent sought an order specifying the terms and conditions of a deferral of the business loan, including an interest rate or return on investment, and sought an equal division or claim for compensatory support or a lump sum award. HELD: 1)The court was satisfied that the ground had been proven and granted the divorce. There was no possibility of reconciliation between the parties. 2)The trial judge was left with exercising her or her discretion to determine the effect of the marriage in impairing or improving each spouse's future economic prospects and attempting to achieve an equitable sharing of the economic consequences of their marriage breakdown. In exercising her discretion, the court will consider the specific circumstances of the case before the court."" 3)The respondent was to continue working at the franchise until she was retraining. She was to take a nine month tourism course to learn how to work with the equipment.  4)The courts were of the view that the 'needs and means' test is not exclusive to the 1985 Divorce Act. The principles of support espoused in Heinenann were not altered. The court reviewed the diverse set of objectives set out in the Act and found that the case law applicable to the respondent was different from the trilogy cases Pelech v. Peleech, 1987 CanLII 57 (SCC), [1987] S.C.R. 801 and Richardson v. Richardson (3d) 345."

He was required to discontinue his studies for failure to meet academic standards for promotion. The applicant appealed his dismissal and was unsuccessful throughout. He applied to the Court for an order of certiorari to quash the decision of the Academic Appeals Committee and the University Bylaws Committee Council and an order reinstating him as a student at the College of Medicine pending resolution of his appeal. HELD: The Court found that the Bylaws Committee Council exceeded its jurisdiction by reviewing the previous decisions made and drawing the conclusion that they were made fairly and properly. The Bylaw Committee determined the merits of the applicant's appeal and determined that it was not necessary to convene a full appeal board. There is nothing in the University policy to suggest that the Bylaws Committee has that power. The Bylaws Committee has exceeded its jurisdiction in this regard and its decision is quashed. The matter is returned to the Bylaws Committee to determine whether the applicant's appeal falls within the policy on student appeals and academic matters. The portion of the application requesting reinstatement of the applicant as a student pending the resolution of his appeal is dismissed. The applicant has a marginal academic record and there are a limited number of placements in the College of Medicine. It does not make sense to displace another student or require the College of Medicine to train a marginal student on a potentially temporary basis.,"The applicant was required to discontinue his studies for failure to meet the academic standards for promotion. He applied to quash a decision of the College of Medicine Academic Appeals Committee and of the University Bylaws Committee of Council. HELD: The certiorari application was dismissed. The applicant had followed the appeal procedures found in the College and was unsuccessful throughout. He brought this application to the appeal board pursuant to Part V of the university's policy on student appeals and claimed that a full appeal board was not necessary. On the assumption that his applications will be successful, he seeks an order reinstating him as a student at the college of medicine pending resolution of his appeal. 1) The applicant has been given an opportunity to present his case. The Committee reviewed the substance of the appeal and found that there was no evidence of procedural irregularity, unfairness or discrimination in the constitution or proceedings of the Academic Appeal Committee or the Dean in accepting their finding and upholding the original ruling. 2) There is nothing in the policy to suggest the Committee has such power as the University has. It was not appropriate to usurp the function of the Board of Directors and review the material to determine if in opinion, the matter should be remitted to the Appeal Board under Part V, para. 3. The matter is returned to the Bylaw Committee for a decision according to law that is whether the applicant's appeal falls within Part VI of Part VI. 3) The last relief sought is for interim relief that the applicant be reinstated to his studies.

8_1994canlii4691.txt,"The landlord applied for possession of residential premises after his tenants refused to vacate in response to a written notice to vacate. The deputy rentalsman ordered that the landlord should have possession, but also ordered that the last two months rent would abate in order to assist the tenants with their moving costs. The landlord appealed the abatement of rent and a chambers judge reversed the deputy rentalsman. The tenants sought and were granted leave to appeal the chambers judge and this appeal resulted. HELD: Appeal allowed. 1)The chambers judge could only reverse the deputy rentalsman if he exceeded his jurisdiction or erred in law. 2)The deputy rentalsman had jurisdiction to order an abatement of rent pursuant to S.47(4) of the Act. 3)The jurisdiction is a discretionary one. The court will therefore show some deference to a decision of the rentalsman involving this jurisdiction. In this case the deputy rentalsman made no reversible error.","Issues in this case began long before the notice of termination of tenancy (which ultimately prompted this Court's involvement) and stem from a number of complaints made by both the tenants and the landlord. The landlord began leasing his premises to the tenants in August 1994. The tenants applied first to the Rentalsman's Office for an order directing the landlord to remove a stove, replace a refrigerator and make appropriate repairs to floor tiles, fence and gate. The deputy rentalsman heard the tenants' complaints and had access to the landlord's written judgment. He then directed the landlord in a separate hearing to consider his claim for possession of the premises. The Deputy rentalsman's decision to abate rent was upheld. The Court held that although it had jurisdiction under s. 47(2) of the Act, it was restricted to finding an error of law or jurisdiction in the rentalman's decisions. As neither the landlord nor the tenant was represented by counsel, there was no order as to costs."

The first ground of appeal alleged that the trial judge was in error by permitting the complainant to testify behind a screen without first conducting a voir dire and by relying solely upon the representations of the Crown counsel to the effect that she would be uncomfortable without a screen. The defence counsel originally suggested that she read it over. The Crown appealed the sentence, alleging that the judge interfered with the trial and created an impression of unfairness by posing questions to the complainant and another witness during the course of their testimony.

c_2014skqb284.txt,HELD: The court dismissed both applications. The respondent’s voluntary decision to significantly reduce his income was insufficient grounds to vary his child support application. The court found that there had not been a material change in the circumstances with regard to the petitioner’s application.,"The respondent father has applied to reduce his child support obligation and to extinguish arrears of child support as a result of him quitting his job and embarking on an apprenticeship program to become an electrician. Both parties have two children who are now eight and nine years of age. The children reside with the respondent and the respondent is to have reasonable access on reasonable notice. The respondent advised the court he needed to change his employment to continue earning the same or similar level of income. He advised the respondent that he did not apply for any other positions to continue making the same level of pay and instead decided to embark upon a change in career with significant financial consequences to his children. HELD: The application to vary child support by the respondent was dismissed and the petitioner's application to become sole custodian parent of the parties' two daughters was dismissed. 1) This final order for child support is sought to be varied pursuant to s. 10 of The Family Maintenance Act, 1997 in which there must be material change in circumstances to warrant variation of the child support order. The preliminary question is therefore whether voluntary change constitutes a material change. For voluntary change to be a material form of change it must be reasonable in the circumstances. 2) The respondent's voluntary decision to significantly reduce his income is found to be insufficient grounds to vary his support obligation. It is apparent he is capable of earning considerably higher income and has taken no steps to test the job market. However, this does not appear to be an appropriate case for the Court to exercise its discretion in this way."

Such an appeal can be taken on the following grounds: (a)the committee exceeded its jurisdiction; (b)it failed to observe the rules of natural justice; (c)it made an error of law; (d)its findings can not be reasonably supported by the evidence which it was entitled to consider. 2) The Court found no error of jurisdiction or failure to observe the rules of natural justice. 3)The Court found no palpable or overriding error in the facts as determined by the Committee based on the evidence.",A medical doctor was reassessed and ordered to repay money for billings already received as a result of services provided to patients. The medical doctor argued that the Committee did not have jurisdiction to enter into the investigation of his practice because the physician had reasonable apprehension of bias. HELD: The Committee's decision was set aside on the merits. 1)The Committee exceeded its jurisdiction by basing its decision on irrelevant considerations and thereby abused its discretion and acted on inadequate materials. There was no evidence to support the decision of the Committee on this merits. 2)There was insufficient evidence before the Committee to constitute proof that the doctor's delivery of medical services was unacceptable from a medical perspective. The Committee committed an error in law by undertaking a review at the request of the College of Physicians and Surgeons and not the Director of the Medical Professional Review Committee. 3)The committee did not exceed its jurisdiction in undertaking the review of the billing pattern. There is no factual foundation to support this allegation and the Committee was properly entitled to decline its jurisdiction. 4)There is no evidence of an error of law or of natural justice.

9_2010skqb122.txt,"FIAT: This is an application for an order pursuant to s. 63(2) of The Personal Property Security Act requiring the respondents or those in possession to deliver to the applicant four pieces of construction equipment. The four pieces of equipment were rented by applicant, Inland, to respondents, Mike Dery Holdings Ltd. and Giants Head Excavating Ltd. pursuant to an equipment rental contract entered into at Penticton, British Columbia, between April 21, 2008 and August 6, 2008. Inland did not register any security interest in the equipment in British Columbia or Saskatchewan until October 20, 2009. In the fall of 2008, the equipment was transported to Saskatchewan by Mike Dery Holdings Ltd. and/or Giants Head. In February of 2009, respondent 101138096 purchased the equipment from Mike Dery Holdings Ltd. and Giants Head for valuable consideration. Searches were completed to establish no registrations against the equipment. In April of 2009, the equipment was leased to Giants Head and a security agreement registered in Saskatchewan on May 5, 2009 listing the equipment as general property but not specifically registering the equipment by serial number. The security agreement was taken by 101138096 to secure the rental payments owed to it under the lease by Giants Head who had possession of the equipment. Mike Dery Holdings Ltd. and Giants Head defaulted under their payments to Inland and Giants Head defaulted in its payments to 101138096. September 18, 2009, 101138096 seized the equipment leaving it in the possession of Giants Head. The equipment was subsequently removed from Giants Head's possession and stored at the farm of Bruce Bakken. On October 19, 2009, 101138096 forwarded a letter to Giants Head confirming that 101138096 had elected to retain the equipment as payment for the outstanding indebtedness. As of this date a Personal Property Security registry search in Saskatchewan disclosed no security interest other than that of 101138096 in the equipment. Inland subsequently registered both a British Columbia and Saskatchewan Personal Property registry interest by serial number respecting the equipment and its original agreements of 2008. The issue before the Court is whether Inland by virtue of its Personal Property Security registration by serial number on October 20, 2009 has priority over the interest of 101138096 which registered earlier as general security without serial numbers but who alleges to have taken possession of the equipment and elected to retain the equipment seized in satisfaction of Giants Head's indebtedness October 19, 2009. This occurred one day prior to the registration of the security interest by serial number of Inland. HELD: The application is dismissed with costs to the respondents. The respondent 101138096 had a general security registered and had actual possession of the equipment in early October 2009 which therefore perfected its security while it retained possession. As of October 19, 2009 when 101138096 elected to take the collateral as satisfaction of the debt the only party to whom notice was required was the debtor Giants Head and his notice is in compliance with s. 61(1) and s. 61(3) of the Act. When the applicant completed its registration on October 20, 2009 the collateral was no longer available because of 101138096's election on October 19, 2009. The respondent perfected its security interest in the equipment which is subject to this application by taking possession thereof. Electing to take the collateral as satisfaction of the obligation secured and providing the required notices prior to registration by the applicant, transferred title to the equipment to the respondent 101138096 free and clear of the claim of the applicant.","FIAT: The application by Inland for an order pursuant to s. 63(2) of The Personal Property Security Act, 1993, requiring the respondents to deliver four pieces of equipment.

Any ongoing obligation was terminated in view of the mother's letter to the Alberta Maintenance Enforcement Office and her representations to the court that she was no longer seeking support.","The husband applied to vary the court's maintenance order from January 12, 1993 to the present by eliminating any further obligation to pay maintenance for his children. The parties had one child, born April 9, 1975. The divorce judgment required that the non-custodial parent pay maintenance of $175 per month per child for the two children. This agreement was confirmed in September 1992. At the time of the agreement, the husband earned $48,000. By 1993, the first year in which he was required to pay a total of $4,200, his income was only 42% of his 1992 income. However, he actually paid little in excess of his required payment that year. HELD: 1)The husband was in arrears from January to September 1992 and 1993 to present. 2)The wife had signed a separation agreement in 1993 which agreed to joint custody of the children and in the event both children were living with one of the parties that the 'uncustodian' parent pay a maintenance of of approximately $175.00 per child to the 'protodial' parent. 3)The children had significant student loans and the husband had improved his earning ability during the relevant years by substantially increasing his income. He paid little support during the period in question. The wife's circumstances changed significantly from the time he earned $50,000 per year and he had dropped to $9,000 or less."
b_1996canlii6818.txt,"At issue was the determination of the quantum of spousal and child support and division of matrimonial property. HELD: 1)The respondent's supplementary allowances were taken into consideration in finding a gross salary of $53,000.00 per annum. Due to an injury he was no longer able to work overtime but was working full-time. Should a medical discharge become necessary an application to vary can be brought at that time. 2)The petitioner suffered a substantial economic disadvantage. The frequent moves due to the husband's employment had disrupted the petitioner's employment and university education. However, the court must also take into consideration the economic advantage enjoyed as a result of the marriage including the pension plan of the spouse. 3)If the petitioner did receive the greater share of the household goods it can be attributed to partial compensation for her economic disadvantage. Shares in joint names were divided equally. Other assets were divided equally. 4)Upon the granting of the divorce the petitioner will be disqualified from receiving the pension survivorship benefits. The fair solution was to use the enhanced value of the 'With Survivorship Benefits' column and the date of adjudication was used as the valuation date. The combination method of valuation was used in view of the 15 year marriage and given the economic disadvantage suffered by the petitioner. 5)The parties agreed that child support should be set in accordance with the Federal/Provincial/Territorial guidelines based on the respondent's gross yearly income. $600.00 per month per child was awarded.  6)The court must seek to promote the economic self-sufficiency of each spouse. The petitioner's future plans were realistic. $800 per month until June 1, 2001 was awarded for spousal support.  7)Costs including one-half of the cost of preparing reports and pension valuations were awarded to the petitioner.","In addition to the dissolution of the marriage, the petitioner claimed custody of the children, spousal and child support, and equal division of matrimonial property. HELD: 1)The parties were agreed on their divorce based on their separation in excess of 1 year and that Mary be granted custody of them with reasonable access to John upon reasonable notice. Although the liability of the respondent to pay maintenance for the children is not disputed, the parties were not able to agree on the quantum thereof, which required determination of the deceased's income. 2)The respondent was to pay $600 per month per child for support for the duration of 15 years, to be paid in accordance with the Federal/Provincial/Territorial Guidelines. 3)Spousal support was to be divided equally.  4)The reasonable and realistic figure to use for the determination of maintenance was a gross salary of $53,000 per annum. If indeed Mary did receive the greater share, it was of sufficient significance to offset her economic disadvantage."

HELD: The application was dismissed. Costs in the cause. 1)The relief sought did not fall within any of the wording of s63(2) of the Personal Property Security Act and therefore there was no jurisdiction to grant the relief requested. The application was simply an attempt to end run the action commenced by the respondent. 2)The applicant was not seeking to remedy a wrong with respect to the seizure or preservation of the collateral but was seeking a remedy pursuant to the Limitations of Civil Rights Act.

3_1999canlii12362.txt,"The appellant appeals his conviction of sexual assault causing bodily harm on the ground the trial judge erred in preventing cross-examination of the complainant. The trial judge prevented the cross-examination of the complainant in relation to a previous allegation she had made relating to this sexual assault. The offence is alleged to have taken place at home of the appellant's brother. The appellant was asked by his brother and sister-in-law to babysit their daughter. The allegation was that the appellant had entered her parent's bedroom where she was sleeping and sexually assaulted her. The appellant, who has no previous record, was convicted of the charge and sentenced to three years imprisonment. The appellant during cross-examination of the complainant attempted to question her regarding a previous allegation regarding the same sexual assault against another person. The trial judge did not permit this line of questioning as he held it pertained to her past sexual history. HELD: Appeal allowed. The failure of the trial judge to allow this cross-examination has prevented the appellant from having a fair trial as he has been denied the opportunity to make full answer and defence. It seems the question that should have been put to the trial judge on this occasion was whether this section was applicable to a situation involving non-consensual sex. The complainant was not being questioned about her consensual sexual activities but rather a previous complainant of a sexual assault. It is understood the intent was to indicate the complainant had implicated someone else as the assailant and after investigation the complaint had not been acted upon. That evidence could have placed in doubt the reliability of the complainant's identification of the person who assaulted her since the room was dark when the assault was alleged to have occurred. The relevance of such a question pertaining to the existence of another complaint made by the complainant in respect of the same assault is obvious. That question has a direct bearing on her credibility.",The appellant was found guilty of having sexually assaulted the complainant contrary to s. 272(c) of the Criminal Code. He appealed the conviction on the ground that the trial judge erroneously interpreted s. 276 of the Code to prevent proper cross-examination of the complainant in relation to a previous allegation she had made relating to this sexual assault. HELD: The appeal was allowed and a new trial ordered.  1)The trial judge failed to consider whether s. 277 of The Criminal Code should be interpreted as having application beyond the incidence of consensual sex. 2)The complainant was not being questioned about her consensual sexual activities but rather about a previous complaint of a sexual assault which was understood to have been made about another man. It is understood the intent was to indicate the complaintant had implicated someone else as the assailant and after investigation the complaint had not been acted upon. 3)The question that should have been put to the judge was whether this protection to the complainant was intended to extend to incidents of non-consensual sex. The relevance of such a question pertaining to the existence of another complaint in respect of the same assault is obvious. It does not raise the issue of the sexual activity involved. That question had a direct bearing on the complainant's credibility.

6_2001canlii365.txt,"The accused was charged with impaired driving (Criminal Code ss.255(1) and 253(a)) and with operating a motor vehicle while having a blood alcohol concentration exceeding .08 (Criminal Code ss.253(b) and 255(1)). Issues included whether the Court should enter a stay of proceedings and award costs, given the failure of the Crown to produce a standard alcohol solution (SAS); could mouth alcohol have invalidated the roadside screening test; did the arresting officer have reasonable and probable grounds to demand a breath sample; was the accused denied his right to counsel; was the breathalyzer test administered as soon as practicable; was there evidence to the contrary? HELD: The accused was found not guilty on count #2 (exceeding .08). Count #1 (impaired driving) was dismissed during the trial.  1)The court was cognizant of the burden of proof and had reviewed the decision of R. v. Lifchus concerning reasonable doubt. 2)The accused's testimony was rejected as not being credible. 3)The burden lies with the applicant on an application pursuant to ss.7 and 24(1) of the Charter in which the defence alleges the accused's right to make full answer and defence has been infringed. The question remained whether once the defence established it sought the SAS but it was not provided for whatever reason, had it discharged its burden or must it prove the failure to produce the SAS solution could have a meaningful outcome on the trial. 4)The accused's s.7 Charter right to make full answer and defence was infringed by the failure of the Crown to produce a sample of the SAS solution in this case. In light of the Bourget and Kalafut decisions, the Crown has had ample opportunity to establish a system for routinely saving the solution until after a case has been concluded. It would bring the administration of justice into disrepute were the Certificate of Analysis admitted into evidence. It was more appropriate to exclude the Certificate of Analysis than to grant a stay of proceedings.  5)Costs are rarely awarded in criminal proceedings. Given the evidence presented concerning the usefulness of testing a representative SAS ampule had it been produced, the court was not persuaded costs should be awarded. 6)There was no evidence that created a reasonable doubt as to the time that elapsed or that there may have been mouth alcohol which may have invalidated the roadside screening test. Both the subjective and objective tests were met. The arresting officer, who has no reason to believe an accused has consumed alcohol in the last 15 minutes, may administer the roadside screening test without delay, but to do so carries with it a certain risk that there may be subsequently evidence which will invalidate the results (affecting the objective element of the test). Further, the officer has no duty to routinely wait 15 minutes before administering the test nor to ask the accused whether or not alcohol has been consumed in the preceding 15 minutes. However, if there are circumstances which suggest the officer should have waited or inquired about alcohol consumption, this may affect the reasonableness of the officer's belief (the subjective test). 7)There was nothing in the evidence to support the submission that the speedometers need to be checked to support the officer's evidence. The officer was acting in the lawful execution of his duty in stopping the accused's vehicle. While doing so he detected an odour of alcohol on the accused's breath which gave rise to the demand for a roadside screening. 8)The informational component of the right to counsel was satisfied. There was no evidence the accused misunderstood his right nor that he was not given sufficient opportunity to contact counsel. He declined twice, giving a clear and unequivocal waiver. Absent special circumstance, the police cannot be expected to draw information out of the accused. 9)The samples were taken as soon as practicable. It was accepted that there was typically no one available at the detachment in the small community and was sufficient reason to not consider attending there given the proximity of the city. The officer tried the closest detachment but found no one there. It may have been more important to question the judgment of the officer to return to the Saskatoon detachment if the delay had been more significant. On the face of it, the delay of 27 minutes did not seem unreasonable. 10)The statutory presumption applied. There was no evidence to the contrary as the accused's evidence was rejected. The court reviewed R. v. Gibson and considered s.258(1)(c) and (d.1) of the Criminal Code.","The accused was charged with impaired driving contrary to s. 255(1) and s. 253(a) of the Criminal Code and operating a motor vehicle while over.08 contrary to ss.253(b) and 253(1). The accused was stopped by the RCMP at 1:40 a.m. on a roadside screening test. The officer noted a smell of liquor and blood alcohol coming from the accused. At the roadside screening, the accused failed the test. As result, the officer made a demand for the accused's assistance in providing a breath sample. The accused refused, stating that he preferred that someone else administer the test when he was the arresting officer and that he did not go to either location. HELD: The accused's application to be discharged was dismissed. 1)The accused's credibility was at issue. The request for production of representative ampoules was made in timely fashion, not for purposes of delay or with a genuine desire to have the appropriate tests conducted. The defence had available and called as an expert at trial. 2)There was no evidence to support the defence's claim that the accused was denied his right to counsel once the Certificate of Analysis was filed. 3)The Court was not impressed with the accused and rejected it. There was no reason to believe that he should have been denied counsel sooner or later. 4)The defence had no other explanation for the delay in responding to the officer's letter. It was clear that the officer had no idea what was being asked of him. He offered no information about the ability of others in his company to observe his drinking and driving behaviour. He said that he was with several others at the shop, he had a passenger in his vehicle that night and he met and spoke to his girlfriend. 5)The court was not satisfied with the defence' argument that the failure of the Crown to produce representative ampounles to the accused constituted a violation of s. 8 of the Charter. It held that if the accused had not been advised of the procedure by the police, they would have had to wait at least 15 or 20 minutes to receive the sample."
3_1991canlii4569.txt,"The appellant appealed his conviction for sexual assault using a weapon and his sentence of eight years. The appellant contended that his counsel had failed to call the complainant's boyfriend as a witness even though he was in the courthouse under a defence subpoena. The appellant also raised on appeal the fact that he had lost his right to a jury trial. He had failed to appear at the jury trial scheduled and a bench warrant had been issued. The Crown had then applied for an order that the appellant was no longer entitled to a jury trial and the record showed that his counsel had agreed to forfeit the right to a jury trial. The appellant contended that his counsel and the Crown both advised him he had lost his right by failing to appear and that he was not told that he could avoid losing his right if he had a legitimate excuse for failing to appear. He put forth the excuse of having had no counsel at the time of the trial. Dismissing the appeal, (1) that there was nothing to show that the witness would have given relevant evidence bearing on a decisive issue in the trial and the appellant failed to meet the burden of showing that the evidence, if believed, could reasonably have been expected to affect the result of the trial when considered with all the other evidence; counsel's decision not to call the witness where the witness was hostile and counsel did not know what he would say was not inappropriate, and, the court noted, in the circumstances, seemed to have been the right decision; (2) the excuse of failing to appear because he did not have counsel was not a legitimate excuse within the meaning of s. 598(1)(a) of the Criminal Code; moreover, the appellant only raised this issue in his oral submissions and gave no notice to the Crown respecting this issue nor did he provide any supporting evidence by way of affidavit; it was seen by the Court as another unsupported and unjustified criticism of counsel and the Court concluded that the record showed that the appellant had agreed to forfeit his right to a jury trial; and (3) that an eight year sentence, although at the high end of the scale for sexual assault, was not manifestly excessive, having regard to deterrence, the circumstances of the offence, and the appellant's record which included three minor offences.","The appellant was convicted after trial of assault with a weapon. He applied for leave to appeal against the sentence he was sentenced to, and sought the return of his right to a jury trial.

b_1995canlii6027.txt,"The accused appealed her conviction on a charge of impaired driving. The grounds of her appeal were that the trial judge erred in determining that she was impaired, and that the trial judge otherwise misconstrued and misapplied the evidence. HELD: Appeal dismissed.  1)Both grounds of appeal raised questions of fact. Findings of fact are not to be reversed on appeal unless it can be established that the trial judge has made some palpable and overriding error which affected her assessment of the facts. 2)The Court's task is not to retry the case or substitute its own decision. A trial judge's findings of fact can only be overturned if they are so clearly wrong as to make the decision unreasonable. 3)The Court was unable to say that an error of that kind was made by the trial judge in this case.",The appellant appealed her 1993 conviction for operating a motor vehicle while impaired contrary to s. 253(a) of the Criminal Code.

4_2009skca44.txt,"The respondent Homeowners sued the respondents Sebastian and the TWC alleging negligence or breach of contract for failing to obtain the coverage for insurance as instructed by the Homeowners. Sebastian and TWC issued a third party claim against the appellant SGI and claimed SGI was negligent or in breach of contract or contributory negligence pursuant to the Contributory Negligence Act for failing to issue a policy of insurance in accordance with the application submitted to SGI by Sebastian on behalf of the Homeowners. The trial judge concluded Sebastian and TWC were negligent and liable for the loss suffered by the Homeowners. Further, the trial judge concluded that the insurer, SGI, owed a duty of care to both Sebastian and TWC and the Homeowners to properly underwrite and deal with the application for insurance. The trial judge concluded SGI contributed equally to the Homeowners' loss by 'their negligent acts' and was responsible to pay 50% of the judgment. The negligence of Sebastian and TWC is not disputed in this appeal. The Homeowners have been paid the amount owed under the judgment and advised they have no interest in the matter and did not participate in the appeal. SGI appeals and submits the trial judge erred in determining that SGI: (a) owed a duty of care to the insureds, Homeowners, and to the broker when it received an application for insurance in 'all the circumstances'; and (b) breached its duty of care. HELD: That portion of the judgment finding that SGI is liable for 50% of the damages payable to the Homeowners is set aside and the Third Party Claim is dismissed. Accordingly, the appeal is allowed with costs to the Appellant. The trial judge correctly placed the duty of care on the intermediary, Sebastian. It is clear the insurer relies on the broker to apply for the coverage in accordance with his clients' (i.e., the insureds') wishes and needs. There was no other evidence before the Court to establish the standard of care, the basis for imposing a duty at law where none has previously existed, or the subsequent breach of that duty by the insurer, SGI, in connection to the application for insurance submitted by Sebastian. The Court concluded there was nothing in this transaction which warrants the creation of a duty of care owed by the insurer to a broker applying for insurance on behalf of his clients.","The applicant prepared a HomePak Application on behalf of the respondents. The Homeowners signed and he submitted to SGI the standard 'comprehensive perils' home coverage policy with Fine Arts Rider for the Swarovski collection with an estimated value of approximately $9,950. The trial judge concluded that the applicant was in breach of his duty of care because he failed to properly identify the nature and extent of the Homeowners' existing insurance coverage, which he could easily have done by carefully reviewing the support file. SGI denied coverage on the basis of the exclusion in the policy; the loss was due to an accidental breakage, which did not constitute 'listed peril' as defined in the coverage policy. The appellant was found liable for failing to apply for the coverage as instructed by the homeowners and for his actions which constituted negligence at law. Appeal allowed; the trial judge's conclusion that SGI had not published the availability of this special insurance coverage was not supported by the evidence; there was no general duty on the insurer to issue the coverage to the respondents as it was not published in any of the materials distributed to its agents. The insurer was liable to indemnify the appellant and contribute to the amount payable to the Homeowner on the Contributory Negligence Act."
8_2010skqb467.txt,"Employees were entitled to wage adjustments under the collective bargaining agreement. The plaintiff union brought an application for an interlocutory injunction requiring the defendant to pay employees who were retiring in 2010 their wage adjustments in the current calendar year. This was an issue because it would affect pensions and retirement dates. In the alternative, the union argued the employer should pay the entitlements before the year end on a 'best approximation' basis or be required to proceed to an expedited arbitration. The defendant brought a motion to strike or dismiss the plaintiff's motion under Queen's Bench Rules 99 and 173 on the basis that the issues raised were terms and conditions of the employment contract and outside the jurisdiction of the Court according to the terms of the collective bargaining agreement. HELD: The defendant's application was dismissed because the Court has residual discretionary jurisdiction to grant relief not available under a statutory arbitration scheme. The plaintiff's application for an injunction was also dismissed. While there may be a serious issue to be tried, the pleadings do not set forth a strong prima facie case. While there might be some irreparable harm to some employees, in general terms the losses can be dealt with through damages. It would be impossible for the defendant to meet a deadline two weeks away because of the complexity of the calculations. It is not appropriate to grant an injunction requiring the defendant to make payment before the end of 2010 and it is not reasonable to make payments based on best approximation. The Court has no jurisdiction to force arbitration on the parties.","The plaintiff union represents approximately 11,000 health care workers employed by the four defendant regional health authorities. The current collective bargaining agreement (CBA) covers the period April 1, 2008 to March 31, 2012. The formal CBA was not signed until October 2010. As the CBA provides for wage adjustments going back to 2008, it requires a substantial lump-sum adjustment payment for many of the employees. The plaintiffs concede that the court is without jurisdiction to determine the issue pleaded based on the principles of CBA and the Weber principle. HELD: The motion to strike was dismissed. It is not appropriate for the court to grant an injunction requiring the defendants to make the required retroactive assessment payments before the end of 2010. Neither do I see any reasonable prospect of a solution to the problem by making payments on a 'best approximation' of entitlement. That is a viable solution. In the long run the results of such solution are likely to be troublesome and chaotic. The court was without jurisdiction in the alternative of directing an expedited arbitration and appointing an arbitrator to conduct it."
7_2010skqb33.txt,"The accused was convicted of common assault, break and enter and commit assault and assault causing bodily harm and his former common law spouse was the complainant in each instance. The accused also entered guilty pleas to three charges stemming from breaches of no-contact conditions with the same complainant plus two charges of obstruction of justice by attempting to dissuade the same complainant from giving evidence. The RCMP had to execute a Feeney warrant to locate the complainant in the accused basement. The Crown sought an order declaring the accused a dangerous offender. HELD: The accused was designated a dangerous offender and was sentenced to imprisonment in a penitentiary for an indeterminate period on the conviction pursuant to s. 267(b) of the Criminal Code and received time served on the remaining eight charges. The evidence is conclusive that the offence for which the accused was convicted was a serious personal injury offence. The evidence was conclusive that the accused constitutes a threat to other persons because of his pattern of repetitive behaviour and persistent aggressive behaviour. The accused's First Nation would provide support for the accused but its support system is presently non-existent. The Court rejected the expert opinions recommending a long term offender order as being appropriate.","HELD: The accused was convicted of assault causing bodily harm contrary to s. 753(a)(i) of the Criminal Code and of obstructing justice by dissuading or attempting to dissuade the complainant from testifying against him. He was sentenced to 10 years imprisonment. The court found that the accused had a pattern of repetitive behaviours showing failure to restrain his behaviour, likelihood of causing death or injury to other persons, and likelihoods of causing more than death to others. There was no evidence that he was a threat to the safety or physical or mental well-being of other persons. The evidence did not support the allegation that he had been assaulted. The accused had stated in his application for judicial stay that the Gladue factors must be considered in determining whether the accused should be declared a dangerous offender. HELD: 1) The accused is a long-term offender. The Gladue factor does not apply here. 2) The facts of this offence leave no doubt that the Crown has proved that the indictable offence under s. 267(b) involved the use of violence against the complainant. This offence attracts a sentence of ten years. 3) There can be no burden of proof on the Crown to negate the third criterion contained in s753(1)(a). The Court found that it is only required to prove the pattern of behaviour as defined by s752(i) or (ii). The pattern does not depend upon the number of offences but on the repetitive nature of the offender’s behaviour. The sentencing principles articulated in R. v. Lemaigre are often referred to as the “Gladue factors”. 4) If the accused is found to be neither dangerous offender nor long term offender, Part XXIV of the Code does notapply. 5) The Court held that the trial judge failed to meet the requirements set out in the Gladues. The judge was required to consider the factors of sentencing under s754.1 in determining if the accused was a dangerous or long- term offender."
b_2000canlii4425.txt,"Plaintiff suffered soft tissue damage to knee when he tripped over a dolly cart in a building supply warehouse. Knee became swollen and infected and he was off work for 12 days. He claimed for pain and suffering, loss of income and loss of earning capacity. Plaintiff was found 60% responsible for injuries and defendant 40% responsible. Damages were assessed as follows: $8,500.00 for general damages, $5,000.00 as damages for loss of income and $1,000.00 for loss of ability to perform household tasks. The dolly cart out of view behind the counter was an 'unusual danger' which the defendant knew or ought to have known of and reasonable care was not used to prevent injury. However, the plaintiff failed to look at the floor as his attention was focused on the door. He assumed nothing had changed in the area from the time he entered the premises a few minutes previously. The plaintiff was in commercial premises and should have taken greater care to observe and avoid anything in his path. The plaintiff suffered an injury which restricted his activities for the first five months, to a lesser extent for the following year and to a very limited extent to the time of trial. There was no evidence to support a claim for diminishment of earning capacity.","The plaintiff injured his knee when he tripped over a 'dolly-cart' while attending at the premises of the defendant. The plaintiff was attending to clear lumber for a job at the defendant's warehouse when he fell while attempting to enter the premises. The defendant advised the plaintiff that it would be appropriate to have the cart placed in the appropriate position for him to conduct his business. He did not observe the cart being moved, nor did he observe any obstruction by the glass doors. The court awarded the plaintiff $8,500 by way of general damages. Given the circumstances, it is clear that the defendant used reasonable care for his own safety. The evidence does not support that all the difference in wages between 1995 and 1994 can be traced to the accident since the plaintiff's attention was focused on the business and not on the doors. Furthermore, the defendant premises were described as commercial premises and the plaintiff should have taken greater care to observe and avoid anything in his path as he proceeded towards the glass door."

To do so it must be shown that a solicitor client relationship existed. There must not be a danger of the confidential information coming back to haunt the client. The court found that such a relationship did not exist in this instance. In addition, the applicant must demonstrate that the solicitor received information which is relevant to the matter at hand. The court found no such evidence of this possibility. It is no bar to representation by a solicitor that some former partners at a previous firm will be examined for discovery or called to testify.","The Court found that the defendant, a former partner of the plaintiff's (former President and Chief Executive Officer of the defendant company), had a conflict of interest. The Court substituted the words 'plaintiffs and employees' with 'applicants'. The Court held that the plaintiff had acted in the best interests of its pension plan beneficiaries, and that there was no evidence of a solicitor-and-client relationship between the plaintiff and the defendant. The court found that it was not necessary to establish a conflict between the defendant's former employee and the plaintiff. The defendant was permitted to continue to act."

The other tenant brought an application for a interim injunction against the defendant. The receiver of the shopping centre also brought an application for a declaration that the defendant could not operate a pharmacy on its premises. The defendant objected to the receiver's application on the basis that it involved controverted issues of fact requiring a trial. Application for interim injunction dismissed on the basis that the applicant had not established irreparable harm; the receiver's application could proceed as an application as the potential for a factual dispute was insubstantial; defendant provided with the option of either accepting an adjournment to allow time for further investigation, the conduct of discoveries and the presenting of any further evidence or moving for the court's further consideration.","The plaintiff company applied for a permanent injunction against Sobeys and a temporary injunction restraining its operations in the Shoppers Drug Mart shopping centre. The latter had a twenty-five year lease expiring in 2005 for 22,000 square feet. The lease provided that the lessee would use the premises only for the purposes of the retail sale of complete line of food products, as well as general retail merchandising, as carried on by the rest of the stores. There was no factual dispute concerning the legal formation of the lease. It was entered into effectively and it is to be enforced according to its terms. There is no suggestion, for example, of a mistake in the expression of the terms. The essential aspects of the conduct alleged to constitute breach are known and uncontraverted. The potential, and emphasize the word potential, for controversy would be evidence to be introduced of the circumstances surrounding the formation of a lease. Sobeis opposed the application for an interim injunction on the basis that the evidence did not establish grounds for a temporary injunctive relief at the required threshold, that neither the plaintiff nor the lesee had established irreparable harm. The Court would not automatically engage in a prolonged examination of the merits just because a breach of a negative covenant is alleged. There are occasions for assessing the evidence for the cause of action or defence more closely than American Cyanamid might suggest. The plaintiffs rely upon Miller v. Toews for the proposition that the enquiry into irreparable damage is less vigorous or less telling in cases of a breach de novo. However, the position taken in Manitoba and Saskatchewan on negative covenants is inconsistent with our approach. The Manitoba court expressed an analytical approach for interim remedies, which was extended to include an application for permanent injunctions. The Saskatchewan court dismissed the application to interpret and apply a contract on the grounds that neither Shoppers drug Mart nor M.C. LeBlanc had established actual or substantial harm. HELD: The application was dismissed. There would be no final determination as to whether or not there was a material breach of the covenant. The issues were determined for the final determination by the trial judge. The court would have the discretion to order a final determination of the issues at trial but would not have the power to order an adjournment or to order further consideration of the application. The parties had come to no conclusion on either of those issues."
d_2000skca131.txt,"The Crown sought leave to appeal the sentence of 2.5 years for manslaughter on the grounds it was not proportionate to the gravity of the offence and failed to meet the requirements of deterrence and denunciation. HELD: A sentence of 5 years of imprisonment was imposed. The sentence was set aside because it did not comply with the fundamental principle of sentencing that it be proportionate to the gravity of the offence nor achieved the objective of denunciation of crimes of this nature. The manslaughter resulted from a common criminal enterprise, planned in advance, and was expected to be violent. The accused pled guilty, had no criminal record, did not participate in the actual physical beating and stabbing of the victim who died from the wounds or of the other victim; she intervened to stop the beating although only after being satisfied the alleged the drug dealer had nothing to give the robbers.  The accused appeared to be doing well in the prison programs. The sentence of the co-accused who had a record of 40 previous convictions had been increased to the equivalent of more than 10 years imprisonment.","The 18 year old, who had pleaded guilty to a charge of manslaughter in respect of the death of Milan Kulas, was sentenced to 2½ years imprisonment. The Crown appealed the sentence, alleging that it was not proportionate to the gravity of the offence and failed to meet the requirements of the law in terms of deterrence, denunciation and separation. HELD: The appeal was allowed. The sentence was set aside and a sentence of five years imprisonment was imposed in lieu of the sentence. The mitigating factors were that the accused had no criminal record; she did not participate in the actual physical beating and stabbing of the two men and intervened to stop the beating of the first and second robbers and seemed satisfied that he had nothing to give the robbers."
5_2010nspc18.txt,"The on-site supervisor was convicted of two offences under the Fall Protection and Scaffolding Regulations (failing to ensure a guardrail was installed at the perimeter of the work area and failing to ensure that an intermediate or 'mid' guardrail was installed) after a mason was killed when he fell from scaffolding on the job site. Prior to the mason beginning work for the day and the supervisor temporarily leaving the site, he had told another employee to install a 'mid' guardrail but no such rail was in place when the mason fell. The court found that having decided to use guardrails, the defendant was required to make certain that those guardrails were, in fact, constructed in the manner prescribed in the regulations and to supervise and inspect the scaffolding before work was undertaken, no matter the experience level of his crew. In regard to the first count, what the supervisor thought might be a substitute for part of a proper guardrail system did not comply with the regulations. The defendant will donate $2,000 to the Public Education Trust Fund and make 18 presentations at various venues over the next 18 months; he will appear in court on a specified date to provide a status report on his progress in this regard. This was not a case of reckless disregard or deliberate indifference to the legislated safety measures and the defendant's degree of moral blameworthiness was at the lower end of the continuum as he neither created nor negligently left in place a hidden hazard. Both the actions of another workman and the deceased's own actions had contributed to the fall.","The defendant was found guilty of two counts of failing to comply with the Fall Protection and Scaffolding Regulations. The defendant had been working on a work platform supported by scaffolding that was approximately 13 feet above concrete sidewalk. As he stepped out and reached to secure his block or level line, he placed one foot on the open edge of a false ceiling suspended by wires and fell down onto the concrete sidewalk below. He was 47 years old and the foreman on the job who designed and constructed the scaffolding at the time of the incident. He had no prior violations of the Act or his failure to properly supervise and inspect the guardrails before work commenced in that area. In both cases, the actions of the defendant contributed to the hazard of the worker working at heights without any fall protection measures in place. Although the defendant's negligence was not conscious or planned, it was definitely an error in judgment in believing that the steel I-beam supporting the roof overhang could substitute as a top-rail."
b_2018skca65.txt,"HELD: The appeal was allowed and a new trial ordered. In this case, the court found that the judge had not erred in his decisions regarding the first and the third requests for adjournment but had in the second request by failing to provide sufficient reasons for his denial. Amongst many factors it considered, the court found that most importantly, the appellant had not caused his counsel to withdraw for the purpose of delaying trial. It concluded that the error resulted in a miscarriage of justice based upon the appellant’s poor conduct of his own defence and lack of understanding of trial process.","The defendant applied for an adjournment following his conviction on a charge of fraud over $5,000 contrary to s. 380(1)(a) of the Criminal Code. The defendant's counsel had justifiably withdrawn and he was left to conduct his own defence. Allowing the appeal and ordering a new trial, that the circumstances of this case did not indicate that the defendant had suffered a miscarriage of justice or that the adjournment request was a serious error of law. The court was of the view there was no tenable basis for interfering with the trial judge's discretion in refusing to grant the adjournments and, in the circumstances, the trial court would not be inclined to grant such an application. The trial judge handled the defence rather adroitly on his own and his father was very helpful to the appellants throughout the course of the trial. HELD: The appeal was allowed and the trial was ordered a new one. 1) There is no tenability basis for a decision to refuse an adjournments if the fact that the accused is without counsel on the scheduled trial dates is not his fault but that of his counsel and he had no complicity in the matter 2) There are no tenible reasons for a denial of an adjournMENT, even if the reason is not well founded in the law. 3) When asked to grant an adjournion a judge may, as here, make a discretionary decision based on reasons wellfounded in the Law. However, in this case the decision may be made in the light of the realities of each case consistent with the interests of justice. Where the decision itself leaves little to review, the appellate court must have resort to the whole of the record, examining it for evidence that might support, or impugn, the decision to deny the adjournMENT request."
5_2005nssc172.txt,"The parents applied for leave to apply to terminate a permanent care and custody order respecting their three children. Proposed Notices of Adoption were filed for two of the children after the parents' application was filed but before it was heard. The order had been made due to, inter alia, issues of poor hygiene and nutrition; lack of supervision; domestic disputes; physical risk to the children due to inappropriate discipline; the mother's explosive temper and mental health; the father's anger; lack of insight, desire or inability to improve by the parents; inability to control themselves during access or exercise access meaningfully and an all-consuming anger and preoccupation with the Agency. Since the order was made, the mother was diagnosed with and now receiving medication for bipolar and obsessive compulsive disorders. Application for leave granted; access not ordered at the present time; supplemental affidavits and viva voce evidence were considered given that the parents had only obtained counsel after the application was filed and the nature of the issue at stake; the application could not be arrested simply because the Agency had taken steps to have the children adopted after the application was filed. Some of the factors leading to the permanent care order were being addressed by the parents, although they had not been fully dealt with; the main achievements so far appeared to be an improvement in the parents' relationship, the courses of counselling and parenting instruction they had embarked upon, an expressed willingness by the mother to undertake psychotherapy, the mother's diagnosis and medication and the parents' changed attitude towards cooperation with the Agency; these are significant building blocks on which to anchor intense parental counselling","The applicants applied for leave to terminate an order for permanent care and custody respecting their three children. The applicants had been fighting an old war, blaming the Agency for their past. They had placed the children in one home for adoption, and had deferred to their current spouses because they thought that they were being misdirected by the Agency. The spouses had taken anger management courses, had taken marriage counselling, and were working with the Agency to improve their parenting. They were both granted parenting courses. The Agency opposed the application to terminate the order on the basis that the applicants had failed to make sufficient progress in communicating with the children and had supported their aggression against the agency. HELD: The application for leave was granted. The Court found that the evidence presented by the applicants was not sufficient to justify granting leave to reapply for the order to terminate. The children were placed in a new home, with ongoing, informal contact between the parents. Counsel for the applicants indicated that they intended to proceed with the application for divorce, rather than the original application, and that they had not made sufficient progress sufficient progress to justify allowing the Agency's application to proceed. The parents' parenting was abysmal, and there was no evidence that they would be able to manage the children adequately if given the opportunity. The mother had completed anger management training and had made significant improvements in the cleanliness of their home. The father had recently been diagnosed with Bipolar Disorder and was seeking medication to help him deal with the difficulties he was having with his children. As for the mother, she had completed marriage counselling two years ago and she had taken parenting courses in 2005. She admitted that she had not taken any courses between the date of the appeal and December 2004 and that her husband had indicated that he was not the biological father of S.B.C.H. (who was referred to as E.S.) and that she planned to take further parenting courses to better learn how to deal with her anger. She had also completed parenting courses, which she believed had been successful in helping her children become better parents. She now intended to apply for marriage counselling in the fall of 2005. Application for leave denied. The affidavit filed by the applicant indicated that it was not available to the Agency at the time of this application. Although other parenting services were available, it was unlikely that these services would benefit them sufficiently."

The defendant did not file affidavit evidence but opposed the application solely on the basis that recent amendments to the Queen's Bench Act precludes reference to minutes of settlement. HELD: The plaintiff was entitled to enter judgment for $15,000 plus costs of this application. A settlement agreement reduced to writing in no way offends the confidentiality required under s.28.1. The plaintiff is entitled to rely on the minutes of settlement and must be permitted to refer to them in his affidavit. Section 28.1 is not meant to apply to this situation. If a party to an action is unable to enforce a concluded settlement, the pre-trial process becomes meaningless. The legislation never intended such a result. There was no suggestion that there was non-disclosure, misrepresentation, duress or fraud in the execution of the minutes of settlement. Nor was it suggested the minutes were unclear or ambiguous. The defendant did not allege the settlement was amended or altered or that the balance of $15,000 does not remain owing.","The plaintiff applied for summary judgment pursuant to Queen's Bench Act rules 184A(1)(a) and s. 29 in accordance with minutes of settlement agreed to by the parties following a pre-trial conference. The defendant argued that the majority of the plaintiff's affidavit must be struck by reason of the fact that the averments contravene s. 28.1 of the Queen'sBench Act, 1998. HELD: The application was granted. 1)The defendant was to pay $20,000 plus costs taxed to the date of the Minutes of Settlement. 2)The plaintiff did receive the first installment of $5,000 from the defendant. The remaining $15,000 was not paid to him nor had it been paid to his lawyer.  3)Section 28 of the settlement agreement is not meant to apply to the situation before the plaintiff. Section 28.2 is not intended to refer to anything said in the course of the negotiations. There is no evidence of non-disclosure, misrepresentation, duress or fraud in the execution of the minutes. 4)There is no suggestion that the signatures on the minutes of settle are not those of the parties and their solicitors. 5)There was no suggestion the defendant's lawyer received any first installment or any of the money. He did not suggest he was paid. 6)The court is prohibited from entering into agreements with the parties after the settlement is concluded. 7)The affidavit filed by the plaintiff on the basis that it cannot be struck cannot be used to establish the non-compliance with the terms of the agreement.

c_2003skqb46.txt,"The Attorney General applied to strike out the plaintiff's claims on the grounds they are statute-barred by virtue of the LAA s.3 and that all the claims except for trespass to person are not exempted by s.3(3.1); by POPA s.2; alternatively, the Court has no jurisdiction over any cause of action relating to intentional torts committed by a Crown servant or employee prior to May 14, 1953; all claims arising from the conduct of two deceased Sisters who died in 1988 and 1993 are barred by the TA and SAA. The plaintiff claimed he was physically assaulted by employees and staff and suffered the loss of his traditional language and culture between 1944 and 1952 while attending the Qu'Appelle Residential School. The AG acknowledged the plaintiff attended the school from 1946 until 1949. The AG in a previous application was granted leave to amend its statement of defence and third party claim to plead and rely upon the Crown Liability and Proceedings Act; Limitations of Actions Act ss.31(d),(h) and (j); Public Officers' Protection Act; Trustee Act s.59, or its predecessor legislation Survival of Actions Act s.10; Crown Liability Act s.3(1)(a) and the Exchequer Court Act s.19. A third party claim against the Oblats alleging they controlled and operated the residential school at all material times, was not relevant on this application. HELD: 1)The claim based on physical assault by the Sisters was struck. The Court has no jurisdiction over any cause of action relating to intentional torts committed by a Crown servant or employee prior to May 14, 1953. The Crown remains immune from claims for trespass, assault and battery committed by servants and officers before the enactment of the Crown Liability Act in 1953 (renamed the Crown Liability and Proceedings Act in 1990), which did not operate retroactively. The LAA s.3(3.1) does not create a cause of action but simply removes statutory time limitation periods barring otherwise existing actions. Before May 14, 1953 the Crown was subject to claims for negligence pursuant to the Exchequer Court Act s.19(c). The Dyson procedure is available in Canada in every jurisdiction except New Brunswick and Nova Scotia. 2)The claim based on negligence is subject to the two year time limitation prescribed by LAA s.3(1)(d) which must calculated having regard to the principles of discoverability. 3)The claims of breach of trust and breach of fiduciary duty are equitable claims subject to the six year time limitation in LAA ss.3(1)(h) which explicitly begins to run from the discovery of the cause of action (PG v. AG Canada). Relevant factual issues are to be dealt with at trial. 4)Even though the claim in trespass is based on acts alleged to have occurred over 50 years ago, it clearly falls within the class of actions contemplated by LAA s.3(3.1)(b)(ii). As such it is also exempted from any limitation period against others liable for the conduct. 5)The argument that the 12 month limitation period in POPA s.2(1)(a) should be applied in priority to the more general provisions of the LAAA was rejected in RJG v. AG Canada. 6)Claims based on direct liability of the Crown for negligence, breach of trust and fiduciary duty are not affected by time limitation periods applicable to the deceased Sister Greyeyes and her estate. The time limitation periods are abrogated by LAA s.3(3.2). Since there is no limitation period barring an action against the Sister or her estate, there can be no provincial limitation period available to the Federal Crown under CLPA s.24. 7)The other claims made directly against the Federal Crown are not affected by limitation periods applicable to Sister Elle or her estate. SAA ss.5 and 10(1),(3) and (4) do not bar the claims against her.  LAA s.3(3.2) abrogates the time limitation in SAA s.10(3)(b).","The Attorney General applies to strike out the plaintiff's claims on the grounds that they are barred by certain statutes or alternatively that the Court has no jurisdiction over any cause of action relating to an alleged intentional tort committed by a Crown servant or employee prior to May 14, 1953. The plaintiff claims that he was physically assaulted and that he lost his traditional language and culture approximately 50 years ago, when he was attending the Qu'Appelle Residential School near Lebret, Saskatchewan (the 'Residential School'). The Attorney General acknowledges that Sister Elle was employed at the Residential School from 1944 until her death in 1993. HELD: 1) The limitation period in the POPA is set aside by s. 3(3.2) of the LAA for actions which fall within the scope of s3(3).2) The Limitation of Actions Act does not apply to the claims arising from acts or omissions occurring prior to that date. The Court held that the claims relate to internal management of the Residential Schools and acts that were 'distinct and separate' from any public mandate. As such, the 12 month time limitation period under s. 2(1)(a) is not applicable. 2) The plaintiff's claim against the Attorney General arising from the conduct of two deceased employees of the residential school is barred by s3.1 of the Liability and Proceedings Act. 3) The individual's claims are not exempted from limitation periods in s3 and 3.2. The limitation periods are set aside pursuant to s3 for actions falling within the broad definition of the Act. 4) In any event, the plaintiff cannot pursue a claim against any person for the intentional tort of its officers and servants occurring before May 14 1953.  5) The Court had no jurisdiction to hear or adjudicate upon any cause that occurred prior to the date of this action. The same argument was rejected in [R.J.G.] v. Attorney General of Canada and the Public Officers' Protection Act (POPA). Even if the time limitation time in s2(1) applies to claims other than those described in s. 1(3), time begins to run under s2 (1)(f) of that Act only when the alleged injury or damage ceases. That is a factual matter to be dealt with at trial. 6) The 12 month limitation period is set Aside by s2 of the POPa. That limitation period explicitly begins from the discovery of the cause of the action. 7) There is no agreement on the facts and the"
c_1996canlii6986.txt,"A Director was charged with professional misconduct for coercing the resignation of two principals in his school division. The Discipline Committee found the appellant guilty of misrepresenting the school process report involving the first principal and of threatening the other principal that if he did not apply for a transfer and resign the matter would be dealt with at the board table and that 'it could get ugly'. The Executive Committee of LEADS issued a reprimand to be placed on his file for five years and a fine of $2,500. At issue was whether the Discipline Committee erred in its findings of fact and the burden of proof, whether the facts, if true, constituted professional misconduct and whether the penalty imposed was excessive. HELD: Appeal dismissed.  1)The legislation does not appear to call for a change in the traditional approach. The fact that an appellate judge can substitute his or her decision for that of the Discipline Committee or order of an executive does not mean that the appellate court's view of the facts and credibility of witnesses supercedes in any way the role of the Discipline Committee unless it finds there were inappropriate inferences drawn, conclusions reached which were not supported by the evidence, or a misdirection on a point of law. None were found in either case. The Discipline Committee did not err in its interpretation of 'professional misconduct' or its application to the facts.  2)Section 52 of the LEADS Act and s62 of the Medical Profession Act, 1981 are virtually the same except for minor changes in wording and format. The jurisprudence under the Medical Profession Act was applicable to the standard of review in this case. 3)The penalty imposed was not wrong or unjustified. Section 47 of the LEADS Act gives the Executive Committee wide latitude in the nature of punishment that it may impose upon a person found guilty of professional misconduct. The Executive is not bound by the recommendations of the Discipline Committee. They are only guidelines. 4)The Act is silent as to who shall bear costs of providing the documents filed pursuant to s51(2) of the Act. If the legislature had intended the statutorily mandated costs to be costs in the cause it would have said so. LEADS should bear the costs in this case. In any event pursuant to the court's inherent jurisdiction and pursuant to s52 of the Act the costs of providing the materials were to be borne by the respondent. 5)Subject to the above the respondent was entitled to costs of and incidental to the appeal.ADDENDUM to TWL QB96220.

The discipline committee recommended that the defendant be transferred. The defendant received a reprimand (to be placed on his file for a period of 5 years) and a fine of $2,500. Both parties submitted briefs of law in support of their positions. In issue was whether the findings of fact as set forth in the discipline committee were true or unprofessional conduct. HELD: 1)The Discipline Committee did not err in its finding of fact respecting the conduct of the appellant. It simply applied the standard of proof as defined in s. 51 of the LEO Act (the broadest applicable legislation in the country). 2)The discipline committee was directed to consider all of the evidence presented by the witnesses. 3)The defendant was found guilty of one count respecting the parties. 4)If the facts as found by the Discipline Committee were in fact true, then the defendant's conduct as a principal constituted professional misconduct which constituted unprofessionalconduct. 5)The imposition of a fine was also found to be excessive as it was found in respect of the defendant. 6)The parties were awarded costs of the appeal."
3_1996canlii4959.txt,"The Crown appealed two sentences of two years less a day each, to be served concurrently for armed robbery. The 32 year old appellant had 32 previous convictions including two armed robberies and seven convictions relating to possession of weapons. HELD: The Crown appeal was allowed and the sentence for each offence was increased to three years imprisonment to be served concurrently. 1)The judge made an error in calculating the time on remand that should have been credited to the sentence. Only six months rather than the whole year should have been counted. 2)Given the appellant's record these offences demanded more than the three year minimum generally imposed.","This was a Crown appeal against two sentences of two years less a day each, to be served concurrently. The sentences were imposed in respect of two convictions for armed robbery. The respondent agreed that the facts of the case were accurately set out in the Crown factum. When the respondent returned to his mother's apartment, he decided that the hash was no good. He ripped off his jacket and threatened the owner of the apartment, who was frightened by the owner's threatening behaviour with the knife. The husband was arrested on the charge and was held on Remand until the date of sentencing. In the proceedings before the trial court, it was considered that he had been on remand the entire time being one year. The sentencing judge felt that a sentence of more than three years imprisonment would be appropriate in the circumstances of this case. He gave credit of 2 years for the 1 year he believed the Respondent had spent on Remanded for the same offence and imposed sentence of 2 1/2 years less 1 day concurrent on each charge. Some additional facts were not reproduced because they are not relevant to the appeal. The appellant is 32 years old and has 32 previous convictions including two armed robberies and seven other convictions relating to possession of weapons. He has a common law wife, four children from previous unions, and an aged mother who is at least partially dependent on him. He was on remanded for a total of 1 year because of a previous armed robbery conviction. HELD: The sentences for each offence were increased to three years for each of the convictions. The Crown should have been given a much more unpremeditated sentence than the three year minimum generally imposed for such offences."
c_2012nssc46.txt,"The parties agreed on discovery dates and the order in which witnesses would be discovered. As a result of an honest error, the defendant wasn't able to attend the original dates. The plaintiff became frustrated and concerned about further delays. While the defendant was making good faith efforts to resolve the discovery issues (including whether its witnesses should be excluded from attending discovery of the plaintiff's witnesses), the plaintiff's lawyer issued discovery subpoenas to compel the defendant's witnesses to appear, making the exclusion issue moot. The defendant moved to have the subpoenas dismissed, and sought solicitor and client costs on the motion. The defendant argued the subpoenas were improper and an abuse of process, and accused the plaintiff's lawyer of making unwarranted attacks against the defendant's lawyer in his pre-hearing brief. The motion was heard over approximately one-half day. Motion granted. The plaintiff will pay total costs of $2,550 (plus disbursements) to the defendant, consisting of $1,500 in party and party costs under Tariff C and $1,050 in solicitor and client costs. The tariff amount of $1,000 is increased by $500 to reflect the fact the issuance of the subpoenas was an improper step, albeit one falling short of an abuse of process. It required the defendant to bring this motion to strike. The plaintiff was given a chance to withdraw the subpoenas and chose not to. Solicitor and client costs were warranted especially in light of the defendant's lawyer's language, which was unduly harsh and unnecessarily strong. His allegations added a layer of complexity and seriousness to the case, which caused the defendant to spend extra time preparing a response. Lawyers are officers of the court and the court must encourage them to use courtesy, respect and professionalism.","The defendant filed a motion to dismiss discovery subpoenas issued to its witnesses. The motion was allowed and the order granted included a direction as to the manner of discovery. The defendant argued that the issuance of the subpoenas was inappropriate and in non-compliance with the Civil Procedure Rules. The plaintiff sought an award of costs on a solicitor/client basis against the defendant, arguing that the discovery subpoena process was a waste of process and that the defendant's counsel had made unwarranted attacks upon the plaintiff's counsel. The Defendant argued that it must show it's dissatisfaction with this approach by the plaintiff’s counsel in strong terms. Accordingly, the defendant seeks an award on a party/party cost basis. HELD: 1)The discovery subpoena procedure was fundamentally flawed. The delay between July and September for discovery examinations was not unreasonable. 2)There was no evidence presented which warranted special consideration as to credibility issues as compared to other cases or situations. 3)The issuing of the discovery documents was an abuse of process. 4)The parties positions on discovery, when they would be held, and in particular the order in which the parties would be discovered became entrenched. The Court may subtract from or add to the tariff mentioned in Rule 77.03. 5)The issuance of three discovery subpoena subpoenas (which in effect dictated the order of witnesses) made exclusion a mute issue. The issuance of four discovery subpoena sets out what the parties will be doing. The purpose of each subpoena is to discover the witnesses. Each subpoena is different in that it deals with a different set of circumstances, rather than a straightforward decision to issue subpoenas. The parties agreed initially that Rule 18.16 was applicable. The prevailing practice is different (in the view of the Plaintiff's counsel) than what was suggested by the defendant’S counsel. There was no material delay by the Defendant or its counsel in moving to discovery examinations. The use of discovery subpoena for this purpose is something to be frowned upon. The appropriate practice would be to make a motion requesting discovery of the witnesses as originally agreed. 6)Costs were awarded on the solicitor-client basis."
4_2016skqb136.txt,"Family Law – Custody and Access – InterimThe petitioner and the respondent had four children during the course of their marriage. They separated in 2010 and the petitioner applied for interim orders, including arrangements for the parenting of the children. The court made an interim order that the parties would have joint custody with the primary residence of the children to be with the petitioner. The respondent would have access at reasonable times and on every other weekend. The parties reconciled for two years but then separated again. In 2012 the petitioner applied for an order enforcing the 2010 interim custody order. At that application, the court found that both parents were capable of parenting, but in the short term it confirmed terms of the 2010 order. A number of pre-trial conferences were held without resolving matters, and during that time, the parenting arrangements changed substantially. The oldest child began residing with the respondent in December 2014. In December 2015, the second oldest child began residing with the respondent. They stayed with the petitioner on alternate weekends. The applicant then brought this application for an order pursuant to ss. 23(1)(a) and (e) of The Children’s Law Act and pursuant to the 2012 court order, confirming the original interim order that the four children of the marriage have their interim primary residence with her and that the respondent have specified parenting time on one day each week and alternating weekends. The petitioner alleged that the respondent was attempting to influence the two youngest children to reside with him. HELD: The court ordered that the status quo parenting arrangement should remain in place until trial. In this case, the status quo was not the arrangements as they had been in 2010 and in 2012. The court found that the arrangements had evolved since the 2010 order by agreement of the parties and the changes had not occurred because the respondent was attempting to alienate the children from the petitioner.","Three days after the parties separated, the petitioner applied for interim orders dealing with, but not limited to, the parenting of the children, child and spousal support, exclusive possession of the family home and division of family property. The parties had previously separated in July 2010. The petitioner had primarily resided with the respondent for only four months. The respondent had not brought a formal application to change the previous interim order, and had only been brought back on 7 days' notice. HELD: The application was dismissed. The court found that the application was not an application for an order changing the parenting arrangements in place for the children nor was it intended to overturn the respondent's interim order. The Court found that Kraus J. found that each parent is capable of making all of the decisions that are made in the children's best interests and that this has not been the reality for the last three and one-half years with respect to equal parenting time during major holidays, for the past two and one half years with regard to alternating weekends and weekday overnights and that the children have had their primary residence with the petitioner. The interim parenting time will be on Wednesdays from 3:20 until 7:00 pm and alternating weekends from 5:20 to 7:30 pm. There is no reason to believe the children would be at any risk in the meantime."
3_1993canlii4594.txt,"The appellant was detained after leaving a suspected 'after hours' club which was under surveillance by police. He was charged with a breathalyzer offence, and was convicted. He appealed, arguing his s. 9 Charter rights had been violated. He also contended the evidence of the amount of alcohol he had consumed on the night in question constituted 'evidence to the contrary' which rebutted the presumption in s. 258 of the Criminal Code. Dismissing the appeal, that the police officers were not acting arbitrarily or in a random fashion when they detained the appellant, and had a reasonable basis for stopping his vehicle. The appellant's contention he consumed only two small bottles (1-1/2 ounces each) of rum, plus some cough syrup and mints, did not constitute evidence to the contrary to rebut the presumption of the breathalyzer offence. On Appeal.","The accused was arrested for impaired driving and given a breathalyser demand. The police officer then radioed two other police officers to stop the vehicle and gave them the usual two breathalysers. The accused refused to take the tests and was convicted on a charge of impaired driving. At trial, the Crown argued that the officer's evidence as to what alcohol he had to consume did not tend to show that the respondent's blood-alcohol level was within the permitted limits. The Provincial Court Judge however held that if the officer had given effect to the opinion that the amount consumed by the accused would not have given readings, it would have constituted evidence to rebut the presumption of s. 258 of the Criminal Code. For the appellant, that the police officers involved were not acting arbitrarily or in a random fashion and had advanced a reasonable basis and had an articulable cause for stopping the vehicle."
b_1999skqb167.txt,"An appeal of a conviction for having the care or control of a motor vehicle after consuming in excess of 80 milligrams of alcohol in 100 millilitres of blood contrary to s.253(b) and s.255(1) of the Criminal Code. Although the trial judge concluded the appellant rebutted the presumption in s.258(1)(where it is proven that an accused occupies the seat normally occupied by the operator of the vehicle, it is presumed he is in care and control unless he can establish that he did not occupy the seat for the purpose of setting the vehicle in motion), the appellant was found to be in de facto control. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. It was clear from the trial judge's acceptance of the evidence of the two paramedics who had noted the car parked in an unusual place and police officer who came along later, that he rejected the theory advanced by the appellant's counsel. The location of the ignition key was not relevant. The appellant's memory of the events was far from clear given the level of his intoxication. The trial judge was entitled to accept and rely on the evidence of the Crown witnesses.","The accused was convicted of operating a motor vehicle with a blood alcohol content over.08 contrary to s. 253(b) and s. 255(1) of the Criminal Code and of having consumed alcohol in such a quantity that his blood alcohol concentration exceeded.07 contrary to ss. 253/b and s255(1). The accused advanced a spirited argument that the evidence outlined by the learned judge did not justify the conclusion that the Crown had established proof of 'care and control' beyond a reasonable doubt. He attacked the evidence of the ambulance attendants and police officer over the accused's version of what took place. HELD: The learned trial judge was entitled to accept and rely on the testimony of the Crown witnesses to support the conviction and was perfectly entitled to reject the theory the appellant's counsel advanced. The location of the ignition key was not relevant, given the fact it was located somewhere on the right side of the steering wheel. Counsel for the accused had thoroughly dealt with the next question, namely, had the Crown on the evidence established by credible evidence beyond reasonable doubt that the appellant (notwithstanding that he had rebutted the presumption) was nevertheless in de facto control of the vehicle. He was entitled, in his view, to do so. The Court found that the accused was guilty of count two of the Information. The accused was found guilty of failure to exercise care and control."
c_2009skca53.txt,"The three respondents pled guilty to three offences: trafficking in cocaine for the benefit of, or at the direction of, or in association with a criminal organization contrary to s. 467.12 of the Criminal Code; conspiring together and with others to traffic in cocaine contrary to s. 5(1) of the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act and s. 465(1)(c) of the Criminal Code; and trafficking in cocaine contrary to s. 5(1) of the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act. On the last two counts, each was sentenced to 1 year less a day to be served in the community on each count, to be served concurrently, plus a 10 year fire arms prohibition. On the first count, each was sentenced to serve 1 year, in the community, consecutive to the sentences for the other counts. They were also subjected to DNA orders and there was an order of forfeiture of a vehicle belonging to a third party. The Crown appealed these sentences on the grounds that the sentencing judge failed to give proper effect to the gravity of these offences. The Court weighed all the evidence and circumstances of the accused, and found the sentencing judge was clearly moved by the personal circumstances of the accused and while they are mitigating and would normally justify a sentence at the low end of the range, it was the Court's view that the sentencing judge gave them undue weight in comparison to the principles of denunciation and general deterrence, which must play a significant role in offences of this nature. The Court further stated the 1 year sentence for the trafficking offence, to be served in the community, was demonstrably unfit given the range of sentences established in other cases of trafficking offences, even after taking into account the mitigating personal circumstances of these offenders. The Court found the sentences must be set aside. The Court found that an appropriate sentence for each of the respondents, taking into account the seriousness of the offences, the personal circumstances of the respondents, and the aggravating nature of the offences pursuant to s. 467.12, would be 18 months, concurrent, for each of the last two counts, and 1 year consecutive for the criminal organization offence, for a total of 30 months imprisonment. HELD: The total sentence in each case is 30 months, 5 months having already been served.","The three respondents pled guilty to three offences: trafficking in cocaine for the benefit of, at the direction of, or in association with a criminal organization, to be served concurrently, plus a 10 year fire arms prohibition; conspiring together and with others to traffick in cocaine contrary to s. 5(1) of the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act and s. 465(1)(c) for the Controlled drugs and substances Act. They were also made subjects to DNA orders and there was an order of forfeiture of a vehicle. The Crown appealed the sentences. HELD: The sentences were 30 months, 5 months having already been served. The total sentence in each case is 30 months in the community, 5 month having already being served. 1) The respondents all worked 12 hours a day and rotated their shifts so that the phone and delivery car were being operated 24/7, seven days per week. The noted high volume of sales was made possible by practices defined by the organization and established to ensure they worked as an efficient team to ensure delivery of cocaine on a 24 hour day basis while reducing the risk of discovery. 2) The offences were carried on in furtherance of criminal organization. Section 467.14 of the Criminal Code requires that the sentence imposed for the offence be consecutive to any other sentence imposed on the predicate offence. It is clear the effect of this legislation is to frustrate the will of parliament through the failure to recognize and impose the mandatory consecutive penalty required by law for the aggravating offence. The motivation for these offences was financial gain. 3) The three respondents were trained in their techniques by the criminal organization and were able to work hard and earn a lot of money while they were incarcerated, earning a lot less than the usual 30 months for the predicate offences and being subject to a DNA order for a vehicle belonging to a third party. 4) The sentencing judge erred in finding that the sentences were demonstrably unfit, in light of the high volumes of trafficking and lengthy period of time over which it had taken place, the highly dangerous nature of the substances sold, which included crack cocaine, the fact that they were working for a criminal organisation and their motivation was financial loss."
d_1995canlii5746.txt,"When Davidson, Sr. sold his farm to his son he retained the right to continue receiving the rentals arising from four surface leases which he had previously granted to oil companies in respect to producing oil wells. The son granted an option to purchase to the plaintiff which was exercised and a fee simple title was issued in 1973 subject to encumbrances including caveats protecting the surface leases. There was no reference to the rent charge reserved or excluded by the option agreement. The plaintiff asserted that whatever rights arose from the option agreement were merged in the transfer and effectively disappeared upon the registration of the transfer and the issuance of a new unencumbered title. HELD: Declaration denied. Plaintiff's action dismissed with costs. 1)The absence of a caveat protecting the rent charge has had no affect because of the plaintiff's continued ownership of the property.  2)Rarely, if ever, has there been a case where, as here, a purchaser has contracted to obtain the property under an instrument clearly accepting the unregistered equitable interest, then has obtained a fee simple title, then has permitted the unregistered interest to continue unimpeded for 15 years and then, perhaps tiring of the inconvenience of the lease and thinking that the money would be useful, has decided to seek an order of this Court terminating the other interest and directing that it be paid to him. His counsel made no suggestion that the plaintiff had a moral claim, it was purely an attempt to secure by legal means that which he had previously agreed to forego. This is a court of equity as well as a court of law and as such it is repugnant that the court be called upon to vest in an applicant an interest which he has heretofore freely recognized to be the property of another, both before and after receiving his transfer under The Land Titles Act. 3)It was apparent that there was no intention that the rent charge would be merged since it was recognized and allowed to continue for 15 years.","The plaintiff was granted an option to purchase land from the defendants. The option was exercised and a fee simple title was issued to him. The title was encumbered by, inter alia, caveats protecting the surface leases but there was no reference to the rent charge reserved or excluded by the option agreement. The land fell into the family of which the plaintiff was son, one who needed to expand his farming operation. HELD: The plaintiff's action was dismissed with costs. 1)It was apparent in this case that no intention that therent charge would be merged since it was recognized and allowed to continue in the hands of its holders for a period of about 15 years. 2)The land had been acquired by the defendants under the Optionor of the Second Part and the Optionee covenants. 3)The plaintiff had been denied his right to sue the defendants because he had not received the money from them. 4)The defendants continued to be at a risk of being sued because of the rights conferred by the Optione. 5)Because the plaintiff had not been awarded the option fee, he was at a high risk of having his property cut by the landlords because of their shared interest in the land. He was advised that since he had been given the option title and there were no caveats preventing the rental charge from being paid, he could continue to receive the money."
d_1995canlii3966.txt,The accused pleaded guilty to a charge of assaulting his 8 year old stepdaughter by slapping her and striking her with a small paddle. The Crown and counsel for the accused agreed that a fine and probation would be appropriate. The trial judge sentenced him to 1 year in prison and 1 year's probation. He appealed his sentence. HELD: Appeal allowed. 1)The force applied was minimal and the child was not injured physically. 2)The sentence imposed would result in the accused losing his employment which would harm his dependents. 3)The Court reduced his sentence to 60 days intermittent.,The appellant pleaded guilty to the charge of assaulting an eight year stepdaughter. He was sentenced to one year imprisonment and one year's probation. The Crown and the defence agreed that it was probably an instance where a fine and probation order would create the necessary special deterrence and parental guidance the situation called for. The trial judge was however of the view that the conduct of the accused warranted a more severe penalty. HELD: The appeal was allowed and a sentence of 60 days intermittent was substituted for the sentence of 1 year. The probation order was to remain unchanged except to substitute the word 'approved' for'supervised' in the first condition.
6_1997canlii9876.txt,"The respondent was hired as an account manager by the appellant. She did not reach her planned sales goals during her employment, and became depressed. She took six weeks off work on the advice of her doctor. When she returned from sick leave she was dismissed by the appellant, who had already decided to terminate her employment after concluding that she was not able to handle the job. She claimed damages for mental distress for the sudden and callous manner in which she had been dismissed. The jury awarded the respondent $20,000 in lieu of notice and $60,000 damages for mental distress. The appellant appealed the award for mental distress. Per Hallett, J.A., Roscoe, J.A., concurring, allowing the appeal, that the suddenness and callousness of a dismissal does not constitute conduct that gives rise to an actionable wrong separate and apart from the cause of action for the dismissal without notice. Per Freeman, J.A., dissenting, dismissing the appeal, that a degree of mental distress is always likely to accompany the termination of employment. However, when the employer's conduct aggravates the mental distress beyond the degree which can be remedied by agreement or reasonable notice, a right to further damages arises.","The appellant sold computer systems including hardware and software to hospitals and other health care facilities. The respondent was hired as account manager with a sales territory consisting of four Atlantic provinces. She was expected to take three or four years to develop the territory. Her responsibilities included making sales contacts, co-ordinating the activities of the specialists within the company who had to design and build the system required by the customer. The sales compensation plan provided for a four percent commission on software licenses and the net margin on hardware sales plus a scheme of cash bonuses for exceeding revenue targets which were not stated in her employment contract. The appellant alleged two errors in law: he should not have permitted the issue of mental distress to go to the jury, and he mischarged the jury on the question of foreseeability. The jury was awarded $10,000 for mental distress and $50,000 punitive damages. Both issues were dealt with in the Supreme Court of Canada's decision in Vorvis v. Bank of Canada, [1955] 1 S.C.E.L. 165 (C.A.). The court found that mental suffering would not have been in the reasonable contemplation of the parties at the time the employment contract was entered into as flowing from the appellant's unjust dismissal. It would have been very unjust to deprive the plaintiff of her valuable time and money."
e_1999skqb268.txt,"The defendant manufactured solarium in Saskatoon which it sold to the plaintiffs in Minnesota. The plaintiffs alleged the solarium was defective, sued and obtained judgment in the Minnesota Court which it now sought to enforce in Saskatchewan. The defendant argued the Minnesota court did not have jurisdiction because at the time the action was commenced he was not 'ordinarily resident' in the state of Minnesota. The defendant was served in Saskatoon with notice of the claim but did not appear or defend the action or surrender to its jurisdiction. HELD: The action was dismissed with costs to be taxed. 1)The defences available to defendant in Saskatchewan where an action is brought to enforce foreign judgment are set out in s.6 of the Foreign Judgments Act. 2)While there may be evidence supporting the conclusion that the defendant was carrying on business in Minnesota, that same evidence does not support the conclusion the defendant was ordinarily resident there. The defendant advertised its business in Minnesota and elsewhere in the United States and employed agents there to sell its product. The logical conclusion was that the address in the city of Minneapolis was a business address. It could be argued that the defendant carried on business in the state of Minnesota but the question was whether the defendant was ordinarily resident in that state. The Foreign Judgments Act reflects real difference in the meaning of 'ordinarily resident' and 'carrying on business'.","The plaintiffs sought to enforce payment by the defendant of judgment for $23,396.03 in US currency awarded to them by Carver County District Court in the First Judicial District of Minnesota. The action was defended on the basis that the defendant was not ordinarily resident in the state of Minnesota and did not appear before the Minnesota court or submit to its jurisdiction. HELD: The plaintiff's action was dismissed with costs to be taxed.  1)The Court in Minnesota did not have jurisdiction over the defendant because at the time the action was commenced the defendant had made use of United States postal facilities and had to comply with postal regulations which required an address in the United States. In order to comply the defendant arranged for an address at 701-4th Avenue South in the City of Minneapolis. An address of this nature could be understood as connoting either residential or business address. But because of the activities of the defendant in Minnesota, that is to say, its activities in sales, the logical conclusion that it is a business address, the Court in Minneapolis did not submit to the jurisdiction of the Minnesota Court. 2)The case law have reviewed convinces me there is a real difference in the meaning of these terms and that the Act reflects that difference. While there may be evidence supporting the conclusion that the Defendant was carrying on business in Minnesota the same evidence does not support the conclusion it was ordinarily resident there."
4_2000canlii3136.txt,"In a trial of liability only, jury found defendants to be entirely responsible for causing motor vehicle accident. Plaintiff was found contributorily negligent and liability was apportioned 57.5% to defendant and 42.5% to plaintiff. Plaintiff suffered significant injuries and plaintiff and spouse applied for interim payment of damages. Application allowed in part; plaintiff awarded $250,000.00 as interim payment; spouse's application denied. Once court is satisfied plaintiff has met threshold requirement of a judgment or admission of liability, it must strive with evidence before it to determine what damages are likely to be recovered by plaintiff and may then order interim payment if it thinks just, within limitation that it not exceed a reasonable proportion of the projected amount. The greater the certainty of the final outcome of liability and the greater the strength of the evidence supporting the damages claim, the higher the proportion of damages that will be advanced. There is nothing which precludes interim payment from being substantial amount in a proper case but court must be cautious to avoid any influence on eventual outcome of damage assessment. Although there had not yet been discovery of plaintiff's doctors or an independent medical exam obtained, the plaintiff's injuries were largely demonstrated by clinically objective medical evidence and there was no evidence of any pre-existing condition. In such circumstances, a substantial sum could be ordered. Neither pre-judgment interest nor costs are to be considered by the court in such an application. The evidence in support of the spouse's application was far too incomplete and had yet to be tested by defendants in discovery. Court could not form opinion on what damages spouse was likely to recover.","The plaintiff was seriously injured in a motor vehicle accident and brought an action for the recovery of damages from his employer. The issue of liability was severed when a civil jury trial was held in 2000. The plaintiff sought to recover from the defendants 57½% of their damages to be assessed. The defendant argued that, because of the plaintiff's previous employment record as a homemaker, it was not likely that he would have recovered any measure of compensation for loss of future earnings. The defendants offered an interim payment to the plaintiff in the amount of $168,000. This amount was reduced to $1500 plus taxable disbursements as required by Rule 33.01(A). The plaintiff's counsel agreed that $250,000 represents a just amount of interim payment that ought to be made to him and an order will issue accordingly."
2003skqb248.txt,"An appeal from conviction and sentence for theft of an electricity generator valued at under $5,000 contrary to Criminal Code s.334(b). On the first appearance in October, 2001, the Crown advised it would proceed by summary conviction. The appellant pled not guilty. Defence argued that, in the absence of evidence to the contrary, it should be inferred that the accused acquiesced or implicitly consented to proceeding by way of summary conviction. Counsel agreed pursuant to s.786(2) to proceed by way of summary conviction and invited the court to treat the agreement as having been in place when the trial began. Both preferred the appeal to be heard in this Court or in the Court of Appeal. The appellant sought to have the conviction set aside on the grounds the verdict was unreasonable and not supported by the evidence; the trial judge failed to properly apply the doctrine of recent possession and did not provide adequate reasons for his decision. HELD: The conviction appeal was dismissed.  1)This Court had jurisdiction to entertain the appeal. The Provincial Court judge had jurisdiction as the trial proceedings did not violate s.786(2). 2)The trial judge did not misconstrue nor misapplied the doctrine of recent possession. The unexplained recent possession of stolen goods standing alone will permit, but not necessarily require, an inference that the possessor was the person who stole the goods. The elements of recent possession must be strictly proven if possession is the only evidence connecting the accused with the theft. Otherwise possession should be considered circumstantial evidence and weighed accordingly. There was no palpable and manifest or overriding error made by the trial judge in weighing the evidence.  3)Criminal Code s.687 appears to permit this Court to set aside the 9 month suspended sentence and to grant a conditional or absolute discharge. However, there was no transcript of the sentencing proceedings except for a few lines. If the transcript is not available, this Court may be reconvened to address the applicability of s.687 and whether it would be appropriate to vacate the sentence and embark on the sentencing process afresh.",HELD: The appeal was allowed and the sentence imposed was set aside. The Provincial Court judge did not err in determining that the Crown could proceed on indictment or by summary conviction. The substantive distinction in the proceedings was limited to the range of sentencing upon conviction. On appeal the question of jurisdiction was asked if the Crown had misconstrued or misapplied the doctrine of recent possession and whether the appellant had given adequate reasons for convicting himself. The appellant argued that the trial judge misinterpreted the doctrine and should have proceeded by indictment. The respondent argued that he had been directed to enter into an agreement with the Crown that the matter would be decided by trial. The judge therefore proceeded to sentence the respondent to a nine month suspended sentence with a victim surcharge of $100.00 and set aside the sentence. The sentence was upheld. 1)The conviction was not supported by the evidence and could not be supported without the application of the Doctrine of recent Possession. There was nothing in the decision that convinces the Court that the judge in weighing the evidence committed any palpable and manifest or overriding error.  2)There was no transcript of the sentencing proceedings except for a couple of lines and without being able to examine the sentencing judge's reasons it is impossible to determine whether the sentencing court judge applied correct principles or whether the sentence is excessive or otherwise unreasonable or demonstrably unfit.

The uncontradicted evidence that the mother never had any intention to return to the matrimonial home was accepted.

The respondent had purchased the property in 1996 and used it for composting, the creation of topsoil and sand excavation. The appellants claimed the respondent misrepresented the boundaries of the parcel of property that the appellants sold to them in 1996. Alternatively, the respondent claimed a breach of contract because the property was materially less than the size it was represented to be and the plans to extract sand or otherwise develop the property were negatively affected by the respondent's demand.

The trial judge found the plaintiff's evidence to be lacking in credibility and found that the collision did not contribute materially to the plaintiff's poor health. It only caused a mild aggravation of her pre-existing and major back problem. The trial judge assessed general damages at $25,000. The plaintiff's costs were reduced on the basis that she refused a formal offer to settle for slightly less than what she was awarded and refused a second offer which was increased before trial to an amount in excess of what she was awarded. The plaintiff appealed and the defendant cross-appealed. Appeal and cross-appeal dismissed. No strong and cogent reasons were advanced to warrant interference with the trial judge's findings on credibility. There was ample evidence to support the conclusion that the accident only caused a mild aggravation of the pre-existing condition and thus no basis upon which court could interfere with that conclusion or adjust upwards general damage assessment. Trial judge applied no wrong principle in exercising discretion to reduce plaintiff's costs. Award of $25,000 was not so far outside range of damages for like cases as to be considered wholly erroneous estimate of damages.","The respondent admitted liability for driving his truck into the back of the appellant's motor vehicle. The trial judge described the accident as a very mild rear end collision. She determined that the accident did not contribute materially to the respondent's present poor health, and that, because of his pre-existing, and major, back problem, the accident caused only a mild aggravation of his existing back problem. Accordingly, the appellant awarded him $25,000.00 general damages for general pain and suffering, and sought to set aside the trial judge's credibility findings and to attribute a larger percentage of his present health problems to the accident in question, with a correspondingly higher assessment of damages against the respondent. This court has repeatedly stated that the credibility of witnesses is a matter peculiarly within the province of the judge. In Travelers Indemnity Co. v. Kehoe (1985), 66 N.S.R.

1999skqb142.txt,"FIAT. The former registered representative of TFPG was terminated for selling unapproved investments in breach of a Shareholder Advisor Agreement which permitted the sale of TFPG's financial products and services only. TFPG sought an interim mandatory injunction requiring the respondent to return all materials and files respecting TFPG's clients, to cease any contact with its clients, and to make no attempt to solicit any current or prospective client. HELD: The respondent was ordered to immediately cease all contact with TFPG clients whose account the respondent, or anyone associated with him, had administered with a view to soliciting or directing a client, affiliate or associate away from TFPG. The restriction would not prevent a client or prospective client from engaging in any business with the respondent nor was he prevented from advertising his services. 1)It was agreed that the respondent should return all of TFPG's files and materials with a right to make and keep a copy.  2)TFPG abandoned the relief sought respecting solicitation of any business of any nature similar to that of TFPG from any TFPG client or prospective client. 3)The agreement merely set out the terms both parties agreed to for valuable consideration. It was not unconscionable nor against public policy. The respondent had warranted that he had an opportunity to seek independent legal advice prior to signing the agreement. The applicant met the test for injunctive relief but the relief as set out in the draft order was too restrictive and denied others freedom of choice as to which party they wished to deal with. 4)A contractual right to injunctive relief is only one factor. The applicant must establish that the right to interlocutory injunction is clear; there is a serious question to be tried and a strong prima facie case; that irreparable harm will result; if there is a doubt as to whether there is an adequate remedy in damages there must be a determination, on a balance of convenience, which party is likely to suffer a greater harm.","FIAT. The plaintiff sought an interim mandatory injunction requiring the defendant to deliver all files, documents, records, plans, software or other TFPG related material respecting clients of the plaintiff. The defendant had entered into a Shareholder Advisor Agreement with the plaintiff in exchange for this agreement which the plaintiff received commissions from. It is alleged the respondent sold unapproved investments of a competitor and as result he was terminated pursuant to the agreement. As well, the applicant claims the respondent has and continues to breach the 'non-solicitation' clause contained in the agreement by carrying on the same business on his own. That part of the order may issue. HELD: The application was dismissed. The court found that the right to have injunctive relief was not conclusive. It was only one factor in the exercise of the discretionary power of the court. The provision for an injunction was important in its influence upon an exercise of that power. It could be used to prevent the parties from signing any agreement which favours the independent contractor and the granting of an injunction. The provisions of the Agreement for the issuance of an injunty were not binding on the court as they were not in force prior to the signing of the contract. They were to: 1) make all files and documents turned over to the applicant; 2) make no attempt, either direct or indirect, with those clients whose accounts were managed or managed by the respondent; 3) make sure that any and all contact, either indirect or direct, is not directed at or at the respondent's prospective clients; 4) make any attempt to contact or direct with any of the clients whose account was managed or administered by Darcy Bergen; 5) strictly avoid any contact with anyone who was a prospective client of the respondent other than those referred to in the Agreement; 6) make clear that the parties' agreement is one which would be against public policy. In any event, the court was satisfied that the respondent had not signed the agreement prior to signing it."
b_2011nssc75.txt,"After a piece of family property was divided into two parcels, one of the brothers continued to use a driveway and maintain a garden on the other parcel. When this brother died, his son continued to use the driveway and garden, even after the second property changed hands many times. When the current owners of the second property refused to allow the continued use of their property, the son claimed that his use of the driveway was of right on the basis of expressed reservation or prescription. He argued that his uncle was incompetent when he executed a statutory declaration stating that the use of both the driveway and the garden had been with his express permission. Judgment for the defendants; there was no express reservation of the driveway in the deed to the second property and the plaintiff did not have a prescriptive right to use the driveway. Although the plaintiff and his father had used the driveway in a continuous, uninterrupted and peaceful manner for well in excess of 20 years, the statutory declaration showed that this use had been with the uncle's permission.","Roy Longard, the plaintiff, wanted to continue to garden on the Keel property and use the Borden driveway. He claimed that he had the right to do both. HELD: The Court found that the defendant had not shown that the reservation contained in the 1942 deed to the extent that it incorporated the driveway into his easement. There was no expressed reservation shown by the defendant as to the access road. The Court awarded costs to the plaintiff. Roy Longard did not have a proven right to the easement as there was no record of prior use by him. He relied on the doctrine of modern lost grant, which states that if an actual grant was made when the defendant received the portion of his property and as long as the defendant remained on his property it would have been retained. This doctrine could not be rebutted. The defendant, who claimed a 'prescription or lost modern grant', failed to demonstrate that his access road was connected to the defendant's property."

The accused was charged as the owner of the vehicle, not necessarily the driver. The offence was the result of a speed monitoring camera and the Act allows the Crown to complete their case without calling any witnesses. The accused testified that he did not speed past any highway workers or equipment. He said that he was following a pilot vehicle when he passed the workers and equipment and only sped up after the pilot vehicle turned around when there were no more workers or equipment. The picture of the accused’s vehicle from the speed monitoring camera did not show any highway workers or equipment. HELD: The person who tested and deployed the speed monitoring camera provided affidavit evidence that the picture was taken within a marked construction area but it did not say that the accused was speeding as he was passing highway workers or occupied highway equipment. Section 203(1) specifies that there is only an offence for travelling at a speed greater than 60 km/h when passing highway workers or operating equipment. The accused was found not guilty.","The accused was charged with driving faster than 60 km per hour when passing highway workers or occupied highway equipment within a work zone. The offence under s. 203(1) of the Traffice Safety Act is a strict liability offence and its documentary evidence proves every element of the offence. The only aspect of the Crown's case that the accused disputes is that he passed highway workers and occupied highway Equipment when he was travelling faster than60 kilometres per hour. The accused was the only witness for the defence. He testified that he was driving and that he did not speed past any highway workers nor occupied highway machinery in the work zone, nor did he record his speed immediately after it passed the workers or equipment, or if he did, at the speed monitoring device. There were no workers or highway equipment in the speed monitored zone. HELD: The accused is found not guilty of the trafficking safety offence.  1) The Court found the accused not guilty. The court found that the offence under the Traffices Safety Act was a'sizzler' offence and that documentary evidence proved every element. 2) The offence is driving faster then 60 km/hr when passing a highway worker or flag person or any highway equipment occupied by highway worker, whose presence on the highway is marked in the manner determined by the board, or whether it is in motion or not. The offences are driving at speeds over 60km/hr. 3) The accused's evidence consisted of a photograph of the offending vehicle taken by a speed monitoring camera showing the date and time the photograph was taken and the speed of the vehicle when the photograph and the affidavit of the person who tested, deployed, and operated the speed monitor device, and an SGI Motor Vehicle Division certified search."
d_2003nssc223.txt,"The testator had prepared his own Will on a pre-printed form and left his assets to his children, whom he then proceeded to name. One of the children predeceased the testator and an application was made for an interpretation of the Will. the gift to the deceased child did not lapse; her estate is entitled to it. The general rule that a lapsed gift falls into the residue is expressly subject to any contrary intention appearing in the will; a class gift always expresses such a contrary intention. Where the gift is to a class of close relatives (e.g. to children), if this is a class gift it does not fall under this statutory exception. In such a case, the gift falls to the surviving members of the class. This case satisfied two of the exceptions to the class rule, namely, that the number of beneficiaries was given and that the names of such were given. The gift was not a class gift but rather a separate bequest to each individual child and no contrary intention was discernible in the Will.","The testator intended to make a separate bequest to each individual child as a gift personae designatae rather than a class gift. From time to time, the testator made attempts to make changes in his will, but these were not properly executed and witnessed. The testator provided that his assets were to be divided equally among his children. This was not a situation in which he would have taken immediate steps to redraft his will. The remainder of his estate was entitled to its share just as if it had died immediately after his death."
2_1999canlii12398.txt,"The parties were involved in an accident. The defendant stopped at a stop sign 39 feet from the intersection and rolled forward while yielding. The plaintiff locked his brakes and skidded into the defendant, attempting to avoid an accident. Damage to both vehicles exceeded the insurance deductibles and both parties claim damages against each other for the amount of the deductibles. HELD: The plaintiff will have judgment against the defendant in the amount of $50. The defendant will have judgment against the plaintiff in the amount of $450 plus costs. Fault for this accident was attributed 10% to the defendant and 90% to the plaintiff. The defendant had indeed yielded properly but could have been more prudent in insuring that other motorist were aware that she yielded. The plaintiff should have taken more appropriate measures to avoid the accident","The plaintiff was travelling west on Highway 306 when he saw a car approach from his right, stop at the stop sign, and then proceed forward toward the highway. Henry complied with the requirement to stop by approaching from his left, placing a stop sign 39 feet back from the edge of the pavement, which itself was approximately two feet from the driving portion of the highway (the highway). The damages to both the truck and the car exceeded the $500 insurance deductible. The plaintiff brought this action against the car's owner, Vernon Henry, and Margaret Henry for his $500.00 deductible and the Henry's counterclaim for the same. HELD: The plaintiff was awarded judgment against the two parties, plus costs of two subpoenas. 1)The Highway Traffic Act places an additional duty upon such drivers. When the plaintiff saw a vehicle approach from your right, approach from my right and stop at a non-stop sign and proceed forward towards the highway, he applied his brakes with such force that his truck entered a skid, left the highway and struck the side of the car. However, the plaintiff's action against both the plaintiff and the defendant was limited to the amount of $50,000.  2)Henry complied with a requirement to comply with the road's rules of the road by appearing to approach from the right and proceeding toward the actual intersection. In case where that intersection is 39 feet away, it is quite possible to proceed toward it even while yielding to oncoming traffic. 3)There was further evidence that after the collision, her car remained off the paved portion of highway. The police found that the vehicle's front wheel skid marks were also entirely off the pavement and several feet off the ground. In short, it must be concluded that either Henry had stopped, or was able to stop, before entering the defendant's right of way."

The appellant asserts a palpable and overriding error by the learned trial judge in accepting, and finding as fact, part of the testimony of a witness but not accepting the further testimony of the witness that an amount was also owing to the appellant by the respondent. HELD: The appeal is dismissed. The trial judge was not required to accept the entirety of the witness's testimony, despite having accepted most of it, particularly in light of the contradictory evidence of the respondent denying the sum claimed by the appellant. The denial by the respondent of the appellant's claim, accepted by the trial judge, was fatal to the appellant's onus of proving a mutual understanding and absolute acknowledgement of the alleged debt between the parties.","The appellant asserted a palpable and overriding error by the trial judge in accepting as fact part of the testimony of the respondent who accepted the amount as being the correct quantum of his counterclaim and for which judgment was given to the respondent for $1,685.86.

d_1999canlii12581.txt,"In issue was whether the Bank breached its lending contract, its fiduciary duty or duty of confidentiality; and if so, what damages, if any, should be awarded. The defendant's bank loans fell into default after SGI disability benefits were terminated. The Bank reported the particulars of the loan defaults to a credit reporting agency (Equifax). The defendant declined to give an assignment of any accident injury settlement he might receive from SGI and requested the bank direct Equifax to eliminate any references to his default or delinquency upon the bank loans. The bank offered to put an explanatory note on their credit report confirming the arrears were the result of the defendant's automobile accident and that he had undertaken to pay the bank from the proceeds of the accident settlement. The bank commenced this action for payment. The Compains sought general, punitive, exemplary and aggravated damages in a counterclaim for breach of the bank's duty of good faith, duty of confidentiality and breach of contract. HELD: The counterclaims were dismissed with taxed costs to the bank for both the claim and counterclaims. The bank's claim was admitted at trial. 1)Compain expressly waived any contractual rights which he had to confidentiality of his credit information by the provisions of paragraph 8 of the Personal Credit Line Agreement. The principles outlined by the English Court of appeal in Tournier enumerated four exceptions to a bank's confidentiality obligation to its customers. 2)The analogy between the insurance cases and a bank and borrowing customer was not complete or appropriate. Assuming, without deciding, that banks do have a duty of good faith and fair dealing towards their customers, the bank did not breach such duties in their dealings in this case. 3)The characterization of the accounts as collection accounts was fair, reasonable and accurate in the circumstances and were not out of the normal course of business.","The plaintiff banked with the Royal Bank and at the time of the accident the Compain's were indebted to the Royal bank under a credit line and Visa credit card account. The Royal Bank agreed to defer commencement of any action with respect to the defaulted Bank Loans until such time as the Compaine received an accident injury settlement from SGI. The Bank refused to pay the loans and the plaintiff counter-claimed for general, punitive, exemplary and aggravated damages. HELD: The claim against the Royal was dismissed in total. 1)There was no evidence lead to suggest that the characterization of the loans as collection accounts was out of the normal course of business for the respondent. The evidence suggested that the Bank's failure to act fairly and reasonably in deciding to release the loans to Equifax constituted bad faith and lack of fair dealing. 2)There had been no evidence that the respondent made any effort to obtain new credit or to complete any of the business reports that were exchanged and introduced at trial. There was no suggestion that the misrepresentation of these loans as collections accounts was fair, reasonable and accurate in all of the circumstances. 3)The plaintiff Royal Bank did not act in bad faith or in breach of its fiduciary or contractual obligation towards the respondent in making the reports it did to the defendant. The RBC acted fairly and fairly throughout in making its reports to the credit reporting agency. 4)None of the counter-claimants' claims were upheld and they were dismissed in the total. The plaintiff had costs against the defendant (plaintiff by counter-suit) in respect of the claim and to whom Royal Bank will have costs. 5)The Royal Bank's action to enforce payment of the loan defaults was only taken after it had received settlement proceeds from the accident settlement.  It was not acceptable to the respondent with the result that he refused to repay his loans. The court found that the Royal had acted in good faith and in keeping with its obligations including its report to the Equifax as a credit report agency."
2_2011skpc5.txt,"The accused was charged with impaired driving and driving over. 08. The sole issue to be determined was whether the accused was the person operating the vehicle at the time of the stop. The police testified that they had walked through the bar before closing time and then returned to the bar at closing time. The evidence was that the accused had been seen playing drinking games in the bar. The police observed the people they had seen in the bar get into a truck and back up. The police activated their emergency equipment and approached the vehicle. The accused was sitting in the driver's seat when the police approached the vehicle. The defence suggested that another individual had been driving the truck when it backed up but had gone inside the bar to purchase off sale before the police approached the truck. HELD: The accused was convicted of both counts and a judicial stay was entered on the impaired driving count. The Court found that the evidence of the accused was unreliable as a result of her alcohol consumption on the offence date. The evidence of the person that the defence suggested was the driver was inconsistent and caused the Court concern about its reliability. The Court found that at the time the individuals got into the truck, the accused was behind the wheel and that she was the one who backed the vehicle up and pulled it forward. The keys were in the vehicle and it was running when the police came to the driver's door. The accused's blood alcohol content at the time of driving as shown by the Certificate of Analysis was 150 milligrams of alcohol in 100 millilitres of blood.",The accused was charged with impaired driving and driving over.08. The defence had admitted all of the essential elements of each charge; the only issue was whether or not the accused was the person operating the vehicle. HELD: The defence evidence lacked reliability. The accused was found guilty of impaired driving. The Court found as a fact that the keys were in the ignition when the police arrived at the vehicle and had been in the vehicle since the time the group entered the vehicle; the Court found that the accused had been drinking and the entire incident took place in the middle of the vehicle with no one in the front seat and no-one in the back seat. She was found to be the only accused on both counts.
b_2006skqb218.txt,"The respondent applies to vary the consent joint custody order granted in October 2004. His application was prompted by the relocation of the petitioner with one of their two children, Tyson. The sole issue on this variation application is the determination of the primary residence of Tyson. HELD: 1) The petitioner wants to move Tyson 5.5 hours away from the respondent. This also requires a change in access arrangements. These are changes in circumstances that are material.  2) The petitioner has developed a strong bond with Tyson. The respondent has developed a close relationship with the parties' other child Kailey. After Kailey went to live with the respondent, neither parent did much to facilitate the access of either child. Before the petitioner and Tyson moved, although a short distance apart, neither Kailey nor Tyson saw his or her non-custodial parent and sibling on a regular basis. Even telephone access has been sporadic. Both parents have established homes that accommodate only one child. 3) The petitioner's move must be considered in light of the circumstances that existed before the petitioner's relocation. The parties had already adopted a split custody arrangement without formalizing access or adjusting child support. 4) Permitting the petitioner to relocate is in the best interests of Tyson. It is important that Tyson continue to live in the home of the parent whose constant presence he has become accustomed to. The petitioner has always been Tyson's primary caregiver. The petitioner is the psychological parent.","HELD: The application was directed. The court found that the sole issue was determining the primary residence of the child (Tyson) which would be in the Archerwill district, was not the issue. The child had been living with his biological mother for the past few months and had not shown any interest in changing his primary residence. Tyson had some motor co-ordination and was easily distracted and had difficulty concentrating. He required special education resource help but was good natured. There were negative consequences in changing the child's primary residence (Kiley). The move must be considered in light of the circumstances that existed prior to the relocation. The move was to an entirely new and different community. He would be separated from his psychological parent, who was closely bonded to him. There would also be disruption to his school bus and transportation arrangements."

For the purposes of the Act, 'literary work' includes tables, compilations, translations and computer programs; 'telecommunication' means any transmission of signs, signals, writing, images or sounds or intelligence of any nature by wire, radio, visual, optical or other electromagnetic system. What the appellant did was distribute the copyrighted material by placing it in a restricted area designated as Hacker's Delight available only to persons granted special status and were not where any caller would become aware of them without J.PM's permission. It was clear that when he accessed his computer by modem from his friends' homes and downloaded the programs onto their computers, he was 'distributing' the infringing copies. Furthermore, by controlling the means and manner by which the users accessed their computer boards and providing the software to assist in the downloading by modem by those users, the appellant was also distributing, that is giving out, or sharing the infringing copy. The appellant appealed. Dismissing the appeal, that the Crown did not prove that the appellant 'distributed', distributed, distributed, or distributed the copyrighted materials, or that he had the requisite knowledge or that the distribution was to an extent that it prejudicially affected the owners of the copyrights. It is asking far too much of the Court or any other person aware of the evidence, feel, to suggest that this knowledgeable young man did not know or understand that what he was doing was illegal. The only apparent defence offered is that he doesn't think that he was breaking the license agreement or doing anything wrong. This is not an unreasonable concern which should be carefully considered in reviewing the evidence."

Because two years had lapsed further examinations were appropriate and an order issued for the petitioner to attend a further examination. If the updated information is not necessary for trial the petitioner may request costs at that time. The application for an order with respect to without prejudice offers of settlement was dismissed as matters of evidence were to be determined by the trial judge.  1)Since the decision in Martin v. Gray the Law Society amended the code of conduct to provide for rules where a member transfers from one law firm to another. 2)The difficulty in this case was that no measures were taken prior to or at the time the solicitor joined the firm to ensure confidentiality. The time period before taking appropriate steps was completely inadequate.  3)The second question, whether there was a risk that the confidential information will be used to the prejudice of the client, Martin v.

Parties are entitled to structure their legal relationships as they see fit. The Court must determine whether the tax is payable based on the agreements as constructed between Husky and the third parties. There was no evidence that Saskatchewan Finance and the third party contractors entered into an agreement to alter the nature of the contracts so that Husky paid PST when it would not otherwise have been obligated to pay. The evidence established that Husky determined the way in which bids were submitted and the way Husky was invoiced. In each contract, Husky required that the bid include a price for service and price for materials. In each case, it was contemplated that PST was in addition to the price bid for the materials provided. The contracts between Husky and the third parties all contain provisions and terms that provide for the sale of materials to Husky. On the basis of the contracts, there was a sale of tangible property under the PST Act. Husky was the user or consumer of the cement.

HELD: 1)Section 258(7) has been judicially amended to mean 'true copy' which presumably, though not logically, means something more than 'copy'. It has grown to the point that an affidavit may be disregarded if the police do not provide supplemental evidence when challenged as to the manner in which they assured the accuracy of the copy. 2)The trial judge further advanced the law to a point where, even when not challenged, there is an obligation to provide supplemental evidence of comparison in order to buttress the evidence of the affidavit.

The applicant's arguments are confined to a relatively narrow issue.","The Mutual Fund Dealers Association (MFDA, 'applicant' or'respondent') seeks leave to intervene in the stated appeal. The appellant consents to the intervention while the respondents oppose the application. There is a second issue by way of cross-appeal raised by one respondent in regard to matters of delay and abuse of process. The second issue is not relevant to this application and the proposed intervenor has no interest in this second issue. HELD: The application is allowed for intervention with some strict conditions. The court is not bound by any of the factors in determining an application for intervention but must balance the convenience, efficiency and social purpose of moving the case forward with only the persons directly involved in the lis. The factors to be considered in such an application are R. v. Monsanto Canada Inc. (1995), 1995 CanLII 3921 (C.A.). It is common ground the issues of delay, possible prejudice, and the transformation of the court into a political arena are not factors that need to be examined in an application to intervene. The framework of principle governing applications of this nature was set out by R. & W. Sherstobitoff (1995) in R. vs. Latimer (R.W. 1995), 138 Sask. R. 195 (Canton) at pp. 196-97. The parties may file and serve their material by fax in order to expedite matters. The applicant's material shall not exceed 12 pages. The intervenor may make oral argument only if requested by the Court. The matter of costs is left to the panel hearing the appeal."

The appellant has failed to persuade us that Mr. Justice Koch erred in any material respect. In other words, we see no tenable basis for interfering with his decision. [2] The debtor clearly committed an act of bankruptcy under ss. 42(1)(e) of the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act, R.S.C. 1985, c. B-3, as a result of the sheriff's return of nulla bona to the respondent's writ of execution against the debtor. [3] That left Justice Koch to consider whether to dismiss the petition pursuant to ss. 43(7) of the Act or to stay proceedings on the petition pursuant to ss. 43(11). [4] As for the first, the debtor did not satisfy Justice Koch that he was able to pay his debts or that there existed other sufficient cause to dismiss the petition. Based on the evidence adduced by the debtor, we are of the view there is no basis to conclude that Mr. Justice Koch should have been satisfied of these matters. [5] As for second, concerning ss. 43(11), we note that the subsection contains discretionary power to stay proceedings. That, of course, serves to narrow the basis for intervention on appeal. We cannot say Justice Koch erred in any requisite respect in the exercise of this discretionary power. [6] Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed, with costs on appeal to the respondent to be taxed in the usual way.","Fulltext of judgment follows: [1] It will not be necessary for us to hear from the respondent.

3_1999canlii12358.txt,"Two female employees filed complaints with the Saskatchewan Human Rights Commission alleging sexual harassment and discrimination contrary to the Saskatchewan Human Rights Code. The unionized employer applied for judicial review in the nature of prohibition contending the provisions of the Code were superseded by the collective agreement and s.25 of the Trade Union with the result that the Board of Inquiry lacked jurisdiction to hear the complaint. The chambers judge found the Act took precedence over the Code on the basis that the Act dealt specifically with the employment relationship and granted an order prohibiting the Board of Inquiry from hearing and determining the matter. Sub-questions to be determined included: what are the statutory schemes of the Trade Union Act and the Saskatchewan Human Rights Code; what has the Supreme of Canada decided about the exclusive jurisdiction of an arbitrator to resolve disputes in the context of labour law; the essential character of the dispute and ambit of the collective agreement; whether either the Code or the Act has exclusive jurisdiction to decide the dispute and if not, which statute takes priority or is paramount. HELD: The order of the Court of Queen's Bench was set aside and the matter was remitted to the Board of Inquiry appointed under the provisions of the Code. 1)The chambers judge correctly decided that the issue in this case is confined to a determination of the correct forum in which to bring the complaint of sexual harassment. 2)Human rights are fundamental, quasi-constitutional rights which embody fundamental values and public policy. Because human rights are not private rights, but public rights which constitute fundamental public policy, parties are not able to contract out of, alter, amend, or repeal or create exceptions to human rights provisions. To do otherwise would permit the denigration of the rights and obviate the protection of the rights the statute seeks to protect. 3)The mere fact that a collective agreement includes an article or clause which complies with the Code or a provision which covenants not to discriminate on the basis of the grounds set out in the Code, does not in and of itself transform the nature of the dispute from a human rights violation to a breach of the collective agreement. The ambit of the collective agreement does not affect the finding that the essential nature of the dispute is a human rights violation particularly when the public interest component and wide powers granted under the Code to redress a violation are taken into account. It is not in its essential character a complaint arising out of the employment relationship under the collective agreement.  4)The Commission was awarded its costs on double column V in this Court and on the appropriate Court of Queen's Bench tariff. No costs were requested by the intervenor.ADDENDUM: Paragraphs number 25 and 31 are substituted as follows: [25] This position was reinforced by Weber v. Ontario Hydro and New Brunswick v. O'Leary. The policy driving such decisions is that the dispute resolution process, established by the various labour statutes, should not be duplicated or undermined by concurrent common law actions in the courts. This also conforms to the theory of deference that courts accord decisions of specialized tribunals. For a complete discussion of the issue see Parr and Prince Albert District Health Board v. Saskatchewan Federation of Labour released concurrently with this judgment. The Ambit of the Collective Agreement [31] One must not lose sight of the fact that the terms of the collective agreement itself can play an important role in the determination of whether the jurisdiction of the court has been ousted in favour of an arbitrator. The fact that parties have included an anti-discrimination clause in the collective agreement does not alter the fundamental nature of the dispute or have the effect of extending the scope of the arbitrator's jurisdiction. It may play a role in determining whether the statutory tribunal would decide to hear the complaint, but it cannot affect the determination of the essential nature of the dispute or the question of jurisdiction. The essential issue is whether this complaint is a dispute between the parties with respect to the meaning, application or alleged violation of the collective agreement. To find that it is, with the result that the dispute must be arbitrated, would permit the parties to contract out of the Code, something they cannot do.","The plaintiff union applied for judicial review in the nature of a prohibition contending the provisions of the Code were superseded by the collective agreement and that a 'labour tribunal' appointed under the collective agreements had exclusive jurisdiction to resolve the complaint. The chambers judge correctly determined that the issue was confined to a determination of the correct forum in which to bring the complaint of sexual harassment: a board of arbitration appointed pursuant to the terms of the union agreement or a Board of Inquiry appointed pursuant the Code. HELD: The issue was whether s. 25 of the Act prevented the complainants from having their allegations of sexual discrimination decided under the Code; whether s25 of the Trade Union Act deprived the plaintiff union of jurisdiction to proceed with its grievance procedure; whether the arbitrator had exclusive control over the grievance procedure and whether the dispute was a violation of s. 16(1) of the collective bargaining agreement. The fact the parties included an anti-discrimination clause in the agreement does not alter the fundamental nature of the dispute or have the effect of extending the scope of the arbitrators' jurisdiction. The mere fact that it is included in a collective agreement cannot change the essential character of the disagreement. The essential issue is whether this complaint is a human rights violation and not a breach of the employer’s collective agreement. To find it is, with the result that the dispute must be arbitrated, would permit the parties to contract out of the code."
e_2005skqb51.txt,"The plaintiff seeks damages for unlawful arrest and assault, including aggravated or punitive damages arising out of events which resulted in his arrest and a charge of obstruction. During the course of his arrest, the plaintiff received cut to his scalp. He remained in custody until released at approximately 7:30 a.m. that morning. The three named defendants are members of the Saskatoon Police Service. The City of Saskatoon is their employer. HELD: The action for wrongful arrest is dismissed. The plaintiff was assaulted when his head was driven onto the hood of the vehicle. The plaintiff is awarded $2,500 in general damages and pre-judgment interest on that amount. It is not an appropriate case to award punitive damages, but the Court awarded solicitor client costs to the plaintiff in the amount of $6,000 plus taxable disbursements. 1) The Court accepted the plaintiff's evidence that he did not physically interfere with the police officers outside of the lounge. The police officers that attended at the lounge and became involved in the arrest of Mr. Sampson were in the execution of their duty. The plaintiff does not dispute that he possessed the general intent to make the comments that he did throughout the proceedings and that he did so wilfully. The issue is whether or not his actions obstructed the police officers, who were in the execution of their duty. 2) The combined actions of the plaintiff and Ms. Krupa clearly interfered with the police officers' arrest of Mr. Sampson, to the point that Constable Pura called for back-up help. Once the back-up officers arrived, one of them was required to expend time and effort restricting the movements of the plaintiff and Ms. Krupa. Once on the street, they again confronted the police officers. Their combined actions clearly affected the work of the police officers in the execution of their duty. There were reasonable and probable grounds to believe the plaintiff was obstructing the police officers in the course of their duty. 3) On the facts in this matter, the same conclusion is arrived at based solely on the plaintiff's individual actions. The plaintiff's officious interference consisted of verbal abuse, excessive criticism and undue pertinacity in his discussion and questioning and provided reasonable and probable grounds to believe he was obstructing police officers in the execution of their duty. The action for wrongful arrest is dismissed. 4) The cut to the plaintiff's head is a minor one, not requiring stitches or immediate medical attention. The plaintiff experienced headaches for several weeks. He also had stiff neck and sleep disturbance. There were no long term effects. Corrigendum received January 25, 2005 and added to fulltext.","The plaintiff sought damages for unlawful arrest and assault arising out of events which resulted in his arrest and a charge of obstruction. During the course of his arrest, the plaintiff received a cut to his scalp just inside the hairline above his left eye. The actions of the defendants were in dispute as to whether the plaintiff's actions amounted to obstruction or unlawful arrest pursuant to s. 495(2) of the Criminal Code, and whether the police had to arrest the plaintiff bearing in mind the provisions of s. 10(3) of The Police Act, 1990 and the Police Act as to who did what. HELD: The plaintiff was awarded aggravated or punitive damages. 1)The events leading up to the arrest and the activity of all participants while in the lounge were not largely in dispute and vary in minor detail only. The action of the plaintiff outside of the lounge are in dispute. 2)Credibility was not determinative. The plaintiff did not require transportation to hospital but he nevertheless asked the officer if he wished to go to the hospital and was advised that it was necessary to arrest him. 3)The plaintiff did have some prior knowledge of the conduct of the defendant within the lounge. He was aware that he was being followed by two of the officers at the time of his detention. The interaction with the second officer was at odds with what the other witnesses say. 4)The actions of one of the accused outside of lounge were in question. The events in the city were not in dispute but the actions of another individual. The issues were whether the accused's actions amount to obstruction, whether the act of resisting arrest was reasonable force, and if so, did any of the reasonable force provisions of the Code apply. 5)The issues were as follows: credibility; did the accused engage in physical or verbal abuse of the complainant; did any reasonable force apply or was s. 8 of The Alcohol and Gaming Regulation Act applicable? 6)The action of one person outside of a lounge was in dispute because the plaintiff had not attended a function and was not certain of what was to be done."
c_2004nssc248.txt,"In a divorce proceeding, the wife claimed lump sum spousal support in the amount of $20,000 to allow her to return to her native country. She also claimed that periodic maintenance was not appropriate because of the difficulty of enforcement when she is living abroad and referenced two occasions when the husband was paying periodic support that she had to seek the assistance of Maintenance Enforcement. The husband opposed paying any more spousal support but expressed a preference for lump sum support if he was required to pay more, as it would allow him to move on with his life with his new family. Husband ordered to pay a lump sum award of $10,000 to wife; when the parties moved to Nova Scotia, the husband was able to improve his financial situation, while the wife's position deteriorated.","The parties were married in 1996 and had previously been divorced in 1993. There are no children of their relationship and the only contested issue on this hearing is the respondent's claim for lump sum spousal support. The parties agree all property has been divided to their mutual satisfaction and an outstanding debt of approximately 34,000 krona is their joint responsibility. The respondent was working and living in Sweden at the time of the separation. She is now working part-time and the petitioner is looking to obtain employment. HELD: The respondent is to pay $10,000 to the respondent by way of lump sum support.  1) The Court has jurisdiction to grant a support order as an incident to divorce. Periodic payments are the norm. However, it is only when a lump sum is the proper vehicle for providing support or when lump sums are necessary to put a person in a particular position that such an award should be made. 2) There is a great diversity of marriages and the need to deal with support entitlement and quantum on a case-by-case basis. Nothing in the Act foreclosures an order for support of only portion of the claimant's need whether viewed in terms of amount or duration. The concept of equal distribution does not call for equality of income in either the determination of eligibility or the assessment of quantum. 3) The respondent has the means to provide some level of support. 4) Although the parties had a traditional marriage, it appears each party maintained separate bank accounts and the means of the parties (except for the respondent) were found to have been more stable. The Court was satisfied that the respondent, because of her stated intention to return to Sweden and the very small amount she had received while she was living in Nova Scotia, was entitled to support. 5) Although she did not provide support for these amounts, the petitioner was not challenged."

Bennett, owner of an office building (the Plaza), leased space to VIP for five years ending in 1997. Issues included (i)whether there had been a valid renewal of the head lease; (ii)whether there had been valid renewals of sub-leases; (iii)assuming valid renewals, did s4 of the Statute of Frauds bar enforcement against Bennett; (iv)whether the Court had jurisdiction to hear an application for relief under s11 brought solely by notice of motion; (v)are the applicants entitled to such relief; (vi)whether Bennett was bound by the sub-leases by virtue of taking the assignment from VIP. HELD: The application was dismissed. 1)It was assumed that the evidence led by the applicants was true in order to determine issues (iii) and (iv) which dispose of the application. Issues (i), (ii) and (vi) could not be dealt with summarily because of the conflicting affidavits. 2)Notwithstanding Queen's Bench Rule 13(1), the term action in s11 includes summary application by way of notice of motion. There is no reason for landlords to have better access to this Court than the tenants concerning possession of demised premises. The words 'or otherwise' include extrajudicial actions by landlords, including re-entry. Had it been concluded that it was necessry to proceed by statement of claim, such error would have been procedural one, curable under Rule without affecting the jurisdiction of the Court. 3)The Court should exercise its discretion within the guidelines outlined in Golden Griddle. grant of relief requested by the applicant would constitute an improper exercise of such discretion. They were not the sole tenant in stand alone building of the kind in Chatham Empire Theatre. The relief sought would unfairly affect the landlord. As the applicants expressed no interest in taking over the whole head lease premises on the terms of the head lease, there was no need for a conditional order of the nature of London Bridge. 4)The only memoranda consisted of the original head lease and subleases and the unsigned fax messages. The fax messages did not meet the essential requirements for a valid lease. The actions and performance by VIP and the applicant fell short of constituting part performance for the purposes of s.4 regardless of a narrow or broad interpretation of the doctrine. In any case the Court would not have exercised its discretion by binding Bennett with leases which comprised less than 15% of the head premises in the absence of evidence that clearly demonstrated the owner's ability to rent out the balance of the head lease premises was not impaired economically or physically. The applciants could obtain other office space including that offered by Bennett. General and punitive damages would provide an adequate remedy.","The applicants sought an order under s.11 of the Landlord and Tenant Act vesting the whole term of their sub-leases with either V.I.P.

The latter had then proceeded by notice of motion in circumstances where no 'action' existed. HELD: The application was dismissed. 1)The evidence led by the applicants was true. The Court assumed that the actions and performance of the applicants fell short of constituting part of their performance for the purposes of s.4 regardless of whether a narrow or broad interpretation of the doctrine was applied.  2)The Court was of the view that a decision on issue nos.3 and 4 could dispose of theapplication and perhaps the issues between the parties.

5_2009nspc10.txt,"The accused was arrested for possession of drugs and a weapon, and for breaching his probation. Police testified they saw him walking down the street at 10am and noticed a strong smell of marijuana. When approached, he was smoking a cigarette in front of the provincial courthouse. He said he had smoked marijuana on the street, but did not have any other drugs on him. After they spoke, he asked to leave, saying he was late for a court appointment. The police asked him to deal with this matter first, ran a CPIC check and discovered the accused was on probation and required to keep the peace and be of good behaviour. He was not cautioned/advised of his right to counsel until he was arrested on the basis of what the Crown claimed was a reasonable belief the accused possessed drugs. Police conducted a 'pat-down' search, and found drugs (marijuana and cocaine) and a weapon. The accused argued his Charter rights were violated (s. 8, 9 and 10(b)) and asked the court to exclude the evidence obtained in the search. He also argued his admission/statement was not voluntary and should be excluded on the basis that it was given in the context of a violation of his Charter rights. Motions to exclude the statement and evidence obtained in the search denied. The accused's s. 8 and 9 rights were not breached. While his s. 10(b) rights were violated when he asked to leave and the officers asked him to deal with this first (which amounted to detention), his admission/statement was made before the detention and was voluntary. Further, no evidence was obtained as a result of the breach since the search only took place after the arrest/cautioning. After reviewing the relevant jurisprudence, the court concluded: the Crown must prove the arresting officer subjectively believed they found an offence apparently being committed; that subjective belief must be objectively reasonable; police may rely on an inference in forming their belief (such as the inference that marijuana smokers typically carry a supply with them); and that inference must be objectively reasonable in light of the circumstances and facts of the case. Here, the officer's subjective belief that the accused was in possession of drugs was objectively reasonable. The court accepted her evidence that she had special training in identifying the smell of marijuana and distinguishing between a strong and faint smell of marijuana. The CPIC check showed he was on probation in relation to a drug charge. Since the officer had the authority to arrest under s. 495(1)(b) of the Criminal Code, the arrest was lawful. The search taking place incidental to the arrest was reasonable. In obiter, the court went on to say that, even if the accused's s. 8 and 9 Charter rights had been breached, an analysis under s. 24 would lead to a decision not to exclude the evidence: it was not conscriptive; the offence was serious; there was no bad faith on the part of police; and the accused could have lawfully been arrested for admitting to what was a breach of his probation.","The accused was charged with possession of cannabis marijuana and a charge of possession for the purpose of trafficking. The accused was in front of a mall when the officers approached him. They noted a strong smell of burned marijuana coming from the accused's person. The officers approached the accused and smelled marijuana. They asked him where he had been and found him to be in possession of marijuana. He told them that he had just smoked a cigarette at the mall. The officer noted that the smell of marijuana was strong and it was found on the accused. The police had no reason to suspect that the accused was under the influence of cannabis. They conducted a search of the vehicle and found no marijuana. The arrest was found to be unlawful and the cannabis marijuana was excluded from the evidence. The statement of the accused to the police occurred before the officer had the authority to arrest him and, therefore, before the triggering of a police duty to advise him of his rights. The Court of Appeal found that the officer's stated reason for arrest was based upon reasonable and probable grounds. The facts were not in dispute. There was no evidence of coercion or intimidation prior to the officer having the opportunity to testify or to provide evidence of his prior marijuana use. The evidence of the police officer and the accused’s relationship with each other supported the conclusion that the marijuana was present in the vehicle. There were other possible explanations for the strong smell, other than the accused having been smoking cannabis marijuana. However, there was no police obligation to advise the accused of his right to remain free of any obligation to leave the premises."
9_1994canlii4283.txt,"The respondent had undertaken the residential development of certain lands bordering the appellant's property and constructed roadways which it proposed to convey to the Department of Transportation, who agreed to accept with the consent of owners of property where water would drain from the road. When the appellant refused to consent, the respondent applied to the municipality for proceedings under the Ditches and Water Courses Act, which failed to achieve agreement. The respondent then filed a requisition with the county clerk pursuant to s. 7(1) of the Act which allows for the appointment of a municipal engineer. The engineer filed a report in which he concluded the respondent was entitled to open a ditch on the appellant's land, subject to certain conditions. In this action, the appellant appealed pursuant to s. 12 of the Act. Allowing the appeal, that the Act appears to assume that landowners will agree that a ditch benefits their land and provides a mechanism for apportioning cost. However, it does not give an engineer authority to expropriate land or take any interest in it, nor does it provide a means by which the appellant is forced to accept the ditch. Further, the common law prohibits the use of another's property to solve one's drainage problems.","The applicant developer, Armoyan, made an application to the municipality of Halifax for implementation of proceedings under the Ditches and Water Courses Act. The applicant failed to agree to the terms of the agreement, and instead held a requisition with the clerk of the county under s.7(1) of the Act. Granting the applicant the costs of the application, that the applicant is entitled to continue the ditch to a proper outlet, and that the respondent's fees in accordance with the County's resolution are to be charged to the applicant. HELD: The applicant's application was dismissed. The scope of appeal was narrowed to include the application of the respondent. It was reasonable to assume that the defendant, as a subdividing developer, will sell off its land, leaving the Haverstock land with a gratuitous duty to maintain that storm sewer or drain for the benefit of its upstream neighbours. There was no compliance with the provisions of the Expropriation Act."
b_2001skca85.txt,"The Court of Appeal was required to determine the limits of its authority to change the application of the Rule against Perpetuities, an established common law principle, to a particular type of oil and gas lease. In 1950 Taylor entered a 'top' (head) lease for mineral rights with Freeholders Oil, effective upon the expiry of Imperial's interest in 1959. The new owner of the land recognized the assignment of the 1961 top lease sold to Tarragon in 1993. After reaching an agreement in 1993 in principle for a 'farmout' arrangement whereby Maxx agreed to drill the lands for Tarragon, Maxx concluded the top lease offended the Rule against Perpetuities and entered its own lease with the landowner. The trial judge held the 1950 Freeholders lease was void because it contravened the Rule against Perpetuities; although top leases do not offend the policy behind the rule, any modification of the rule is best left to the legislature; there was a breach of confidence. HELD: The appeal was allowed with costs on double column V. The action for a declaration that the top lease is void was dismissed with costs in Queen's Bench. 1)The top lease in question was not void as it did not offend the object and purpose of the Rule. The reasoning and approach of the Supreme Court of Canada in Salituro, Tolofson and Morguard was persuasive. The decision of the House of Lords in Arthur J S Hall demonstrates the need to re-examine archaic rules of common law which cannot be justified in modern society. The genius of the common law lies in its adaptiveness to changing times. Its basic principles are not meant to become rigid formulae. Common law rules may be tweaked to do justice between the parties when a rigid and mechanistic application of the rule would run counter to the object and purpose of the rule. Since the socio-economic and political conditions which gave rise to the creation of the Rule no longer exist, it was open to the Court to consider the application of the rule in the context of a commercial instrument such as the top lease in question.  2)Although top leases have been attacked on other grounds, this was the first case before the Saskatchewan Courts in which the Rule against Perpetuities has been advanced to void such a lease. The historical background and object and purpose of the rule were reviewed. The general purpose is to prevent the tying up of property to the detriment of society in general. The common law rule against perpetuities prevails over intention because it is not a rule of construction, but a rule of property. A mere possibility, or even a probability that the estate or interest may vest within the time is not enough. The 'wait and see' doctrine has been adopted by statute in some jurisdictions.DISSENT: The Court should not modify the Rule in the face of the significance of such a modification, the efforts of the legislature to legislate and the inability to deal with such issues as the retrospective operation of such a decision. The Rule against Perpetuities applies to this top lease. As there is no life in being in this case, the interest must vest within 21 years of its creation which would have been 1971. The Rule is not concerned with the duration of an interest but only that an interest may vest at a remote time in the future. The rule invalidates interests in land that vest too remotely.","The trial judge held that the lease was void because it breached the rule against perpetuities and allowed the respondents' action for declaration to that effect. He allowed the counterclaim by the appellant against the respondent Maxx Petroleum for breach of confidence with consequent directions for an accounting and assessment of damages. The principal question on this appeal is whether the appellants' oil and gas 'top lease' with the late Harry Herbert Taylor should be rendered void by the rule. HELD: 1) The trial judge found that the 1989 Freeholders agreement was void by reason of common law rule 7.5 because it did not prevent the development and utilization of the lands. 2) The parties' 1989 lease was in the public domain and could not be found to be subject to the rule 9.5. 3) In the circumstances, the present day lease was not inconsistent with the principles set out in the Freeholders Agreement and the policy behind the rule is not offended. 4) The key issue is the time of vesting. The Interpretation of the Rule is not the same as that held in the old Freeholders' agreement. The parties clearly intended to have a contingent relationship with future vesting as to the reversionary interest in the mines and minerals. However, uncertainty precluded the parties from simply proceeding on their own."

HELD: A trial of the issue was directed, as it could not be decided on the material filed whether he was intentionally unemployed or underemployed. The father's circumstances had changed since the consent order. The fact he no longer resided with a girlfriend and was making payments on a truck did not justify any reduction.

If the certification order is struck, the province will still face individual claims. The AG has not shown that defending individual actions will cost less than defending one class proceeding. There is no evidence to estimate how it may incur significantly higher expenses as a result of how the points at issue in the appeal are resolved. The matter has been ongoing for some time and it is reasonable to expect the province has already spent time and money to prepare the defence they will eventually file. To succeed on this basis, the court would require a reliable indication of what remains to be done during the stay period, what component of that residue would be wasted if the appeal is allowed, and some estimate of that cost.","The plaintiffs sought a stay pending the appeal of a certification order in a class action. The defendants had not filed notice of defence and, pursuant to s. 4(6) of the Act, were not required to do so until 45 days after the certification order was issued. As part of their appeal, the plaintiffs brought a motion for stay on the basis that every cause of action advanced and remedy sought would be contested. They also sought to have the certification hearing held after the Court of Appeal issued its decision on these appeals. Motion dismissed; there is no evidence that this will happen. The appeal does not involve a summary judgment motion that would dismiss the claims outright in any form, against the defendants; rather, the appeal seeks to strike the Certification Order for common issues trial in class proceeding. If that order is struck, the Province will be entitled to an award of costs."

The respondent contended that it should be on a full-time basis, and applied to the Supreme Court in chambers for an order quashing the appellant's decision. The chambers judge found that the appellant had ignored the clear words of s.37 of the Workers' Compensation Act in reaching its decision, and thus had exceeded its jurisdiction; the decision was quashed and the matter remitted back to the Board. The appellant appealed. Allowing the appeal and setting aside the order to quash, that s.37 of the Act was not a section limiting the Board's jurisdiction and that, considering s.37 and s.53 of the Act, the decision of the Board was not patently erroneous.","This was an appeal from a decision allowing an application for certiorari to quash a decision of the Workers' Compensation Board and remitting the matter to the Board to determine the rate of compensation payable to the respondent. The respondent had worked for several years for M-I Drilling Fluids Canada, and experienced periods of layoff and/or job layoff. In 1993, he was laid off full-time hourly employment. He was awarded compensation for one day of work per month until June 1993. In 1994, the same employer engaged the respondent in two separate ways: contract employment, which included one eight hour day per week; part-time employment. HELD: The appeal was allowed and the decision and order set aside. 1)The interpretation of the Hearing Officer of s. 37 of the Act limited the Board's jurisdiction. The Chambers judge held that the interpretation by the hearing officer of s37 was one which was subject to review for correctness. 2)The Board was not entitled to the opinion of the Chambers judge as it was not patently unreasonable."
b_1999canlii12407.txt,"The defendant, who was to install sewer and water lines on four lots for the hamlet, was charged with seven violations of the Occupational Health and Safety Act and Regulations. It had been agreed that the offences were strict liability. The principle issue was whether the defendant had an obligation imposed by law with respect to the workers and if so whether he discharged it by exercising due diligence in the circumstances. The essential facts were not in dispute. HELD: The defendant was found guilty on all offences.  1)There is a legal duty on an employer under the Act to take steps to supervise and oversee excavations to ensure the usual protocols for safety are met. This requires at a minimum the presence of an experienced person on site. Any reasonable person with some knowledge of worksite safety would insist that the walls be properly sloped, that there be at a ladder or other method to get out of the trench and that first aid supplies were readily available. Supervision is essential particularly when the worker is inexperienced. The deceased had had no experience in sewer and water trenching. No inexperienced person should be allowed to work on such a potentially dangerous site without proper training and specific guidance and supervision. The Law is specific on the requirements to be met for safety of the workers on excavation and sewer and water hookups. 2)The remedial progress report was ruled inadmissible. There was no formal comment on the issue of admissibility. 3)The Act does not define due diligence but well established case authority defines it as taking reasonable care to avoid causing harm which is prohibited by law. 4)The Act does not apply to a contractor. The relationship had all the ordinary indicia of an employer/employee relationship. The defendant controlled the project, tools and materials and bore the risk of loss or profit, had the ultimate responsibility for the worksite, completion of the project and the payment of wages.","The defendant was charged with seven violations of The Occupational Health and Safety Act, 1993. The defendant was an employee and contractor making a contract to install sewer and water lines on four lots in the town of Meadow Lake. The contract was for an amount of money which the defendant paid on an hourly basis. The two men had no expectation of receiving anything but wages for hours worked at the job; they had no prospect of making profit on the job wages were in the contemplation of all involved. The plaintiff was assisted in laying pipe by an experienced worker who was not available to work the job. In his role as pipe-layer, the defendant controlled the construction of the lines and was not an employer. The evidence established that the relationship between the defendant and the workers was one of employer to worker and was one that was akin to 'work for wages in the service of the defendant.' The defendant arranged for his nephew to work with him to look for a piece of pipe located near a trailer on the surface. The nephew worked with the defendant on the project and died shortly after the completion of the work. HELD: The report was inadmissible without addressing the technical aspects of the ruling or making a formal comment on the legal arguments put forth by the parties. 1)Once one finds there was a legal duty on the defendant as an employer under the Act, his obligations under the law are to take active steps to supervise and oversee the excavations to make sure that the usual protocols for job safety are met. 2)If the defendant had an obligation imposed by law with respect to the workers it would have required the presence of an experienced person on site.  3)The defendant did not take reasonable precautions to prevent death or injury to the two men.  4)Once the law is established that an employer has an obligation to the worker it must be exercised due diligence in the circumstances. This is particularly true when one considers that the relationships between the employer and the worker are akin to that of master and servant or employer to employee. No inexperienced person ought to be allowed to work on such a potentially dangerous site without proper training and specificguidance and supervision."
c_2008nssm39.txt,"The applicant law firm applied for a taxation of accounts in a complicated family law matter. The client contended that there was obvious overbilling and that the solicitor was negligent in failing to specify in an interim Order the actual time at which she had to leave the matrimonial home. Accounts as presented are certified; there was no indication whatsoever of overbilling, whether with respect to legal fees or disbursements, and there was no negligence on the part of the solicitor as she had acted reasonably in relying on the representations of the husband's lawyer as to when the Order would be enforced. It is not always necessary to examine every single entry in detail on a line-by-line basis; an overall view of the entries contained in an account can be taken when assessing reasonableness. The temporal limitation of cross-examination is within the Small Claims Court's scope of discretion in special circumstances.","The applicant sought a taxation of the accounts that it issued to the respondent. The respondent opposed the application, claiming that it was an obvious overbilling. The applicant also alleged that the respondent was negligent in the execution of a court order which granted interim exclusive possession of the matrimonial home to the applicant's estranged spouse. The Respondent argued that to limit cross-examination in such a manner would constitute a breach of natural justice. She also argued that an application in December 2006 before Justice Lynch would not otherwise have been necessary. In issue was whether the respondent's estranged husband had either been convicted of or plead guilty to a criminal charge and he did not pay a significant fine associated with the crime. HELD: The respondent's motion for recusal was granted. 1)The evidence presented by the respondent and the applicant was examined thoroughly. 2)The respondent was clearly aware of the complexity of the legal situation, the time available to cross-examine her was limited due to her failure to specify in the order that the actual time at which she had to leave the home would be in addition to the fifteen minutes of cross‑examination that had already taken place. The trial judge did not err in asking the respondent why she went to Crownside. Rather, she indicated that she was trying to minimize the time that she would have available to her. 3)There was no evidence of bias on the part of the respondent, who was clearly articulate and capable of representing herself, but the trial judge had placed very little weight on her convictions. There was a fairly straightforward and uncomplicated taxation process."

The appellant's solicitor at the time of the trial had called no expert evidence concerning either the proper construction of the chimney, which was alleged to be faultily constructed, or the cause of the fire. HELD: The appeal was dismissed with costs on double Column V, including costs of the motion to adduce fresh evidence. 1)The evidence was clearly available, clearly contemplated by the parties and for whatever reason not called. 2)The trial judge neither misapprehended nor failed to take into account evidence which was before him in arriving at his conclusion concerning the causation of the fire. There was evidence to permit the trial judge to make the findings of fact that he did and to award the damages based on those findings.","The appellants applied to adduce fresh evidence and to amend the statement of claim in the within action. The tests for the admission of fresh evidence were set out in R. v. Lensen, [1980] S.C.R. 672 and [1988] SCC 1 S.A.R 672. The appellant contended that the expert evidence which he wished to tender was relevant, credible and if believed could reasonably, when taken with all the other evidence, be expected to have affected the result. He candidly conceded that, with due diligence it could have been adduced at the trial. HELD: The application to exclude fresh evidence was denied. 1)The tests for admission of new evidence on appeal were well known and the application was denied by the Court of Appeal. However, in the circumstances of this case the trial judge either misapprehended or failed to take into account evidence which was before him in arriving at his conclusion concerning the causation of the fire. There was evidence which would permit the trial Judge to make the findings of fact that he did and to award the damages based on those findings. 2)The Court declined the application by the appellants and the respondent's solicitor to add fresh evidence."

Changes in circumstances included the fact that the child was developmentally delayed and required a special program. A pediatrician testified that inconsistency in parenting approaches would further delay the child's development. HELD: Custody was awarded to the father. 1)Each parent was a capable caregiver. However, the father was available to provide full-time care due to an employment disability and exhibited a strong desire to do so. The past physical abuse of his former spouse was not considered relevant as it did not affect his ability to parent the child. 2)The mother was to have weekly access on two non-consecutive days for eight hours and two hours on a third day. The child was to sleep in the same bed every night.","Saskatchewan: Two parents sought custody of the child on the grounds that he or she was best able to meet her needs. The central issue was what custody arrangement would be in Sophie's best interests. Each parent presented volumes of evidence respecting the shortcomings of the other, all with the view of discrediting the other's ability to act as a custodial parent. HELD: 1)The issues arose in the context of a divorce action. 2)Each parent was a capable caregiver. 3)Because of his employment disability, he remains available to provide full-time care for Sophie and exhibits a very strong desire to do so. 4)Each party was awarded joint custody with the express purpose of demonstrating that the child's needs require a better understanding of her needs and the world in which she is born. 5)Each child was given equal access to the child and the Court was directed to find the appropriate director of child development and development. 6)The child had the best interests of both parents because she was born in 1993 and lived with each parent during alternative weeks. It was important to demonstrate that child development was the priority priority because the past conduct of a parent can significantly prejudge or prejudice the ability of a person such as himself to act in her best interest. The child was also placed in the hands of a dedicated caregiver because of the doctor's specialized training and the child was exposed to much intensive child care."
2006skqb189.txt,"FIAT: The issues on this application are with respect to extraordinary expenses and the quantum of spousal support. HELD: 1) The petitioner's income is $73,000 versus $29,000 for the respondent. The parties cannot agree if any of the expenses fall into s. 7 of the Guidelines as being extraordinary: $975 for child care, $500 for dance, $350 for school activities, and $1,140 for asthma medication. 2) The court does not believe that the 'reasonable coverage' definition contained in the May 1, 2006 amendment is new law. At best, it is a single test now enunciated in legislative form which should provide for more consistency and predictability as opposed to the many attempts to articulate a definition of extraordinary which is found in the case law. What items claimed are necessary to attain the child's best interests and yet are reasonable given the economic circumstances of the child and her parents? Which items might be reasonably covered by the sum of the parent's income plus child support? 2) The child care costs and asthma medication costs are of sufficient amount and peculiar to this child as to be extraordinary or not expected to be reasonably covered from the table amount of child support and the respondent's income.  3) With respect to spousal support, neither counsel referred to the spousal support guidelines and the formula for spouses with children which measures the difference between the individual net disposable incomes of each former spouse. These guidelines suggest that an award of between 40% to 46% of that difference in individual net disposable income be paid by the spouse with the higher INDI to the former spouse with the lower INDI. These guidelines create a rough ballpark of $900 to $1,100 per month in this particular case. However, the petitioner is bearing the full responsibility for family debt repayment in the interim. In order to pay creditors in a timely fashion, the petitioner has taken this responsibility onto his shoulders. In the circumstances, it is ordered that the petitioner pay to the respondent interim spousal support of $700. The consequent reduction of family debt is therefore a factor of this particular interim spousal support order and should not cause confusion when addressing any property issue in the future.","FIAT: The respondent moves for an order granting to her, (1) joint custody and primary care (residence) of the child with access to her former spouse and (2) interim spousal support in the sum of $750 per month. The petitioner is not opposed to an order requesting (or more appropriately 'confirming') joint custody of the daughter with the respondent and the respondent, together with special or extraordinary expenses pursuant to s. of the Federal Child Support Guidelines. HELD: 1) It is ordered that the petitioner pay to the respondent 71% of the costs which is monthly sum $125 for the child. In the likely event the petitioner's health plan covers the residual cost of Keandra's asthma medication not paid for by the respondent's plan, the petitioner shall bear 71 % of special or ordinary expenses as hereafter described.  2) The child support agreement was minimal and the positions were conflicting. The child supported should commence in April 2006 inasmuch as the child support payment is set-off April 1, 2006. 3) The parties agreed on custody, access, basic child support and entitlement. Each party presented meritorious arguments as to the outstanding issues dealing with extraordinary expenses and the quantum of spousals. 4) The children were parented by the petitioner. The mother was the primary caregiver, while the father was an offsetter.

9_2001canlii390.txt,"The accused was charged with operating a motor vehicle while his ability to do so was impaired and while over .08 (breath sample readings were 160 and 150 mg) contrary to s. 253(a) and s.253(b) of the Criminal Code, respectively. Issues arising during the trial included whether there was a breach of his s.8 and s.9 Charter rights to be secure against unreasonable search or seizure, and not to be arbitrarily detained; if there was a breach, was there a remedy under s.24(2); whether the evidence was sufficient to prove the offence of impaired driving beyond a reasonable doubt. The police officer concluded that he had reasonable and probable grounds for the breath demand based upon the accused sleeping through two green traffic lights, a strong smell of alcohol, and his somewhat bloodshot or glassy eyes. HELD: The accused was acquitted of both charges. 1)The evidence was sufficient to establish breaches of s.8 and s.9 of the Charter. The Certificate of Analysis constituted conscriptive evidence which, on balance, would not have been discovered by alternative means. Its admission into evidence might render the trial unfair and bring the administration of justice into disrepute. In the absence of the Certificate of Analysis, the evidence was not sufficient to prove the offence under s.253(b) beyond a reasonable doubt. 2)The strong smell of alcohol and somewhat bloodshot or glassy eyes were not sufficient to conclude there were reasonable and probable grounds for the demand. The court is required to examine the evidence as a whole. Every case will depend a great deal on its individual circumstances. It was not reasonable for the officer to assume that the vehicle not moving at the lights was a reliable indicator of impairment for these purposes. The evidence of slurred speech was not reliable as there was nothing in the officer's notes regarding slurred speech, nor had it been included in the investigation documents. The accused did not have any problems with balance or manner of walk, was cooperative throughout, and did not have any difficulty understanding his rights and the breath demand read to him from a printed card. The officer did not ask the accused whether he had been drinking. 3)The nature and quality of the evidence of a strong smell of alcohol, and eyes which were somewhat glassy or bloodshot, in the context of Stellato, was so frail as to leave a reasonable doubt as to impairment. The 'classic' signs of impairment (erratic driving, strong odour of alcoholic beverage, glassy and bloodshot eyes, slurred speech and unsteadiness on one's feet) was not intended to be an all-encompassing list, and its application will very much depend on the circumstances of a given case.","The accused was charged with operating a motor vehicle while impaired contrary to s. 253(a) and 253(b) of the Criminal Code and with driving while over.08 contrary. The accused was co-operative throughout and did not have any difficulty understanding his rights and breath demand, which were read to him from a printed card. HELD: 1) In the circumstances herein, the officer observed the accused's vehicle sit through the green lights but thereafter, he responded immediately and awoke when the officer grabbed him by the wrist. As well, he appeared to fully comprehend the circumstances in which he was involved. The officer did not ask the accused whether he had been drinking and walked him back to the police vehicle. He did not observe any problems with balance or manner of walk. Therefore, the accused was not guilty of the charge under s.253(a).  2) In respect to the evidence of slurred speech, it was not regarded as a reliable indicator of impairment, given that the accused had immediately awakened when the police officer pulled him by his wrist and grabbed him and then grabbed him again. He appeared to be able to comprehend the situation quickly. However, his eyes were still glassy and glassy, and he did not appear to have the ability to process the smell of alcohol or to provide a reasonable and probable grounds for the breath demand despite the fact that the officer was able to observe the accused sleeping through the lights and hearing the accused speak through the sound of the alcohol. 3) The officer concluded that the evidence was sufficient to establish a breach of the accused s.8 and s.9 of the Charter to be secure against unreasonable search and seizure, and not to be arbitrarily detained. Under s.24(2) of The Charter, the Court held that the existence of reasonable and likely grounds for a breath demand outweighs all other reasonable and possible grounds. 4) In this case, the evidence is not reliable. The evidence of a strong smell and alcohol, and eyes which were somewhat glassy or bloodshot does not constitute reasonable or probable grounds. The admission of it into evidence might well render the trial unfair and bring the administration of justice into disrepute.  5) In regard to the admissibility of evidence, the leading authority is, of course, v. Stellato (1994), [1994] 31 CR (4th) 60. In that respect, the nature and quality of this evidence of impairment is so frail as to leave the officer with a reasonable doubt as to"

The father now applied for interim sole custody, alleging that the ongoing extreme conflict between the parties was adversely affecting the children. An assessment recommended that the children live with the father and have access with the mother. Father granted interim sole care, custody and control of the children. The serious concerns raised by the assessment satisfied the threshold requirement of a material change in circumstances; the urgency of the concerns required immediate action.","This was an application to vary the terms of the parties' 2001 Corollary Relief Judgment respecting parenting. The parties had entered into a Separation Agreement in 2000 which was incorporated into the Corollaries Relief Judgment in May 2001.

She now sought to retain a child psychiatrist, psychologist or therapist to assist with the children's individual emotional needs. The mother had previously applied to vary her parenting arrangement to one that had resulted in ongoing conflict between the parties. Application to vary vary ordered. There is no authority in the Divorce Act to make an interim variation order. However, this practice of 'Interim Variation' has become a local practice.

b_2018skca27.txt,"HELD: The appeal from conviction was dismissed and sentence appeal allowed. The sentence was varied to 12 months of probation. The court found with respect to each issue that: 1) the presumption of competent trial representation had not been displaced. The trial lawyer’s decision not to cross-examine the complainant was a tactical one. She was very young and had difficulty expressing herself in the courtroom whereas she had given clear, coherent statements to the police shortly after the offence. The lawyer determined that it was not beneficial to the appellant’s position to highlight those statements by raising certain inconsistences between them and the complainant’s testimony;  2) the trial judge’s assessment of credibility was entitled to deference. He correctly identified R v W.(D.) as the guiding legal principle in the circumstances and his credibility findings were supportable on the evidence; and 3) the sentence was unfit because denunciation and deterrence are secondary factors in sentencing young offenders and are to be considered in a fashion consistent with the principle of “diminished moral blameworthiness” described in s. 3 the YCJA. The court acknowledged that this offence, committed against an 11-year-old and causing her serious psychological harm, might warrant a custodial sentence but for the appellant’s exemplary conduct since the offence and the almost four years that had elapsed between the offence in 2012 and his sentencing in 2016. Under s. 3(1)(b)(iv) and (v) of the YCJA, the delay in this case offended the concept of timely justice. To impose a custodial sentence on the appellant in this case would be contrary to the purposes of the YCJA as it would impede the appellant’s rehabilitation and reintegration into society. The court decided that a fit sentence in this case would be 12 months of probation.","The appellant was convicted after trial of sexually assaulting his 11-year-old niece contrary to s. 271 of the Criminal Code. The appellant applied to admit into evidence the transcript of the first trial and an affidavit of the appellant's former babysitter, which outlines discussions between the appellant and his counsel prior to and during the second trial. HELD: The conviction appeal was dismissed. The sentence appeal was allowed and the sentence imposed was varied to 12 months of probation. The trial judge correctly identified R v W.(D.) as the guiding legal principle in sentencing youth to a more reasonable sentence than was imposed under the Youth Criminal Justice Act. 1) The appellant had identified certain inconsistent statements in respect of which his counsel did not cross-examine the complainant. He failed to establish these omissions amount to unreasonable professional judgment that reach the threshold of incompetence. The evidence must meet the criteria for the admission of fresh evidence as set forth in Palmer (1979), 1979 CanLII (SCC), [1980] SCR 759 at 775 and the trial judge made no specific findings of fact related to reliability or credibility of the former spouse. It is appropriate to conclude that the focus of this focus is balancing conflicting principles to arrive at a sentence tailored to the individual circumstances. 2) Given the seriousness of the offence and the fact that that denunciation and deterrence must take paramount importance, the appellant must establish that the representation provided by trial counsel was incompetent. 3) It is well understood that an appellate court must show great deference to a trial judge's assessment of witness credibility. An appellate court may substitute its own sense of an appropriate sentence for the one imposed by a trial level court in only two circumstances. The first is when the sentence is demonstrably unfit. The second is when it is unfit as it contradicts the principles, purpose and provisions of the YCJA. The sentencing judge properly instructed himself pursuant to the process outlined in Palmer to determine whether on the basis of the evidence that he had accepted, he was convinced beyond a reasonable doubt of the accused's guilt. This is a case where a trial is a matter of course, but there are no alternatives to custody that are reasonable in the circumstances."

The proposed dependent adult resisted the application and attributed his previous difficulty managing his affairs to a severe drinking problem but indicated that he had not been drinking for six years. The uncle had never been declared incompetent to manage his affairs. He voluntarily transferred the land left to him by his father and had allowed the trust arrangement to continue since 1951. Over the years, the land was transferred from the original trustees to various other family members and was presently registered in the name of the applicant nephew. There was no dispute that the uncle was the beneficial owner.HELD: The land was vested directly in the name of Selwyn Hand. The conditional stay in place pending the resolution of this application for the appointment of a property guardian was lifted. 1)The proposed dependent adult was capable of managing a significant portion of his business affairs and matters relating to his estate and property. However he required significant independent assistance in the management of the land held for his benefit. His suggestions and proposal to sell the land and travel were reasonable and financially modest. 2)The criteria set forth in s18 for the appointment of a property guardian was met and the Public Trustee was appointed to administer the balance of the proceeds from the land sale remaining after the uncle pursued his financial commitments and his dreams.  3)Costs in the amount of $7,000 were to be paid to the applicant in the event the uncle chose to sell his land. 4)Any proposed sale would be subject to the approval of the Court upon application of Hand.

The parties agreed to Gabrielson J. receiving the report and neither party sought to cross-examine the writer of the report. HELD: Leave denied. Even if there was a scintilla of merit to the argument, the Court would not grant leave to appeal on the basis that to grant leave to appeal on an extremely technical ground would cause delay that is manifestly not in the best interest of the child in the circumstances of this case. The issue is not of sufficient significance either to the parties or to the wider public to warrant an appeal.","The Minister of Social Services applied for leave to appeal an order pursuant to s. 37(2) of the Child and Family Services Act that the child be returned to his father. When the child was approximately 18 months old, the Minister sought a permanent order pursuantto s.37(2)(c) pursuant to which the child's father, R.S., appealed the order and sought to adduce fresh evidence in relation to his fitness to parent the child. The matter came back before the Minister with the agreement of the parties that the judge on appeal had jurisdiction to make an order subject to conditions (see s.63(4)(c)) that both returns the child to the custody of parent, pursuant to S.37 and has the child remain in the custody OF the Minister for a temporary period, pursuant TO s.25(1)(b). The father appealed the custody order and argued that, fundamentally, the order is fraught with ambiguity for it is unclear whether, during the transition period, the minister retains status as parent until the transition is complete and the child is returned to the father's care, and if so, who determines when the Transition is complete?

2006skqb462.txt,"FIAT: In October 2005, a referendum was held within the student body of the University of Saskatchewan to determine whether the University of Saskatchewan Students Union should join the Canadian Federation of Students and its related corporation, the Canadian Federation of Students-Services. The result favoured joining the federation. The applicant applies under The Non-Profit Corporations Act, 1995 seeking sundry relief, the net result of which would set aside the outcome of the referendum. HELD: 1) The test emanating from the Controverted elections cases are not applicable. In debates of this type, the preferred guidance is from the test articulated in Walton (Litigation Guardian of) v. Saskatchewan Hockey Association and the related cases dealing with non-profit organizations. In those cases, the Court does not ask itself whether the results have been skewed, but rather has the organization acted in good faith and generally in accord with the concepts of natural justice? This does not mean that there must be an exacting legal process or an application of the full 'panoply' of procedural natural justice issues. The question is has the organization acted in a fashion that meets the legitimate expectations of a fair-minded observer? 2) No reasonable observer could conclude that the USC approached the post-vote process in good faith or in a fashion that is in harmony with the broad rules of natural justice. When faced with a result (rendered by a procedure which it had specifically established for the referendum) which was not consistent with its wishes, the USC simply ignored its own rules and imposed its own preordained outcome. Accordingly, the Court concluded that the USC breached its obligation to act in good faith and conducted itself in a fashion inconsistent with natural justice. The applicant is entitled to a portion of the relief he seeks. The referendum held by the USSU on the issue of whether it should join the CFS is of no force or effect.","FIAT: In October 2005, a referendum was held within the student body of the University of Saskatchewan to determine if the University OF Saskatchewan Student Union should join the Canadian Federation of Students and its related corporation, CFS-S. The result favoured joining the federation. The applicant applies under The Non-Profit Corporations Act, 1995, seeking sundry relief, the net result of which would set aside the outcome of the referendum. HELD: 1) In its view, the applicant has no standing to bring an application under s. 135 of the Non-profit Corporation Act. It would be counterintuitive not to add CFS as a party to the application. 2) In this jurisdiction such relief is discretionary. 3) In Abrahamson v. Baker and Smishek (1964), 1964 CanLII 380 (SK CA), 50 W.W.R. 664 (Sask. C.A.), the Court addressed an application to declare an election invalid due to irregularities. Section 225 addresses an application by a complainant to bring the within application. If the applicant does have standing, it is common ground, by all, that the applicant is a former director. 4) The conduct complained of by the applicant falls within the ambit of s. 225(1) of the Act. The authorities in the CFS and the Elections Board are sufficiently broad so as to subsume an order declaring a referendum of no force or effect. 5) The burden lies on the party seeking the right to cross-examine to show the examination will assist in resolving the issue before the chambers judge. 6) The applicant in his final year at the University at Saskatchewan took considerable umbrage at the conduct of the USC and CFS in relation to the referendum, which he alleged was a violation of his rights under the Act and that he gave notice of intention to seek judicial review as early as April 2006 and therefore was'member' even by the respondent's definition. In his petition to have the USC set aside, the Court dismissed the application by CFS that it would consider a request by the plaintiff to have its proceedings declared to be in breach of the terms of the non-profit corporation Act. 7) In his application to strike portions of the affidavits submitted on behalf of others because they were scandalous, argumentative or irrelevant, the court admits of only one qualification.

6_1999skqb124.txt,"The plaintiff who had been employed by the defendant's predecessor for 23 years as office manager and bookkeeper until 1997, brought an action for damages against her new employers for dismissal without adequate notice. The plaintiff took stress leave and requested to be relieved of her duties as office manager in 1998. The action proceeded under the simplified procedure in Part Forty of the Queen's Bench Rules. HELD: 1)The conduct amounted to constructive dismissal entitling her to withdraw services without a reduction in the notice period. Although the defendant had numerous complaints the plaintiff was not dismissed for cause. Her termination of employment related only to her reduced position as bookkeeper which was for an indefinite period of time. Her employment had already been terminated by notice of nearly a year. She remained entitled to notice to March 31, 1999 at her salary at the time of termination and to medical expenses that would have been covered but without bonuses or extra payments for sick pay. 2)The defendant did not establish the plaintiff ought to have done more to mitigate her loss. There was no basis for punitive damages nor for an extension of the period of notice.  3)The net earnings between May 1998 and March 1999 were deducted after deducting $50 for the cost of qualifying for that employment. Amounts owing by the plaintiff to the defendant were to be deducted. 4)The plaintiff was entitled to interest in accordance with the Pre-judgment Interest Act. 5)The defendant could make no deduction for insurance benefit payments. Sections 45 and 46 of the Employment Insurance Act was drawn to their attention. 6)The plaintiff was awarded costs. Fees were to be taxed on column 2. 7)The plaintiff was to deliver a copy of the calculation of the judgment. Either could issue judgment with the other's consent as to form and content. An application for further directions could be made.","The plaintiff brought an action for wrongful dismissal or, stating it more correctly, for damages for dismissal from her employment without adequate notice. The action was under the simplified procedure in Part Forty of The Queen's Bench Rules. At trial, the affidavits-in-chief of the plaintiff's witnesses were marked as plaintiff exhibits and the witnesses were then called for cross-examination by the defendant followed by redirect questions from plaintiff's counsel. At the conclusion of the action, the defendant was to be allowed to make no deduction for any such insurance payments made to the plaintiff. Equal latitude may also be required in the defendant's cross- examination of its witnesses.HELD: The plaintiff was awarded judgment for $50,000 plus interest. 1)The conduct to which she refers may be viewed as constructive dismissal and was accepted as such by the plaintiff by letter on May 25, 1998. But her employment had already been terminated by notice of nearly a year. 2)The theory of notice is that at the end of the period the employment insurance benefits will remain unimpaired. The defendant can therefore make no deductions for any insurance payments and if the plaintiff has bad feelings about the treatment she had received in the previous employment, they ought to be deducted. The plaintiff ought to have been compensated for her bad feelings. 3)The plaintiff was also awarded interest in accordance with the Pre-judgment Interest Act s.45 and 46."

She also stated that just prior to this she was awakened by the feeling of someone touching her vagina. The accused was charged with sexual assault and sexual touching of the complainant., accused found not guilty; the complainant's testimony was internally inconsistent and her cross-examination revealed obvious errors which were never corrected to rehabilitate her credit. The evidence was more impressionistic than probative of the facts alleged and the accused's evidence raised reasonable doubts in the court's mind.","The accused was charged with sexual assault and touching of the complainant. The complainant was a close friend of the accused's. She recalled that the accused had moved over and touched her breast and vaginal area while she was asleep. The accused testified that he had left his clothing on the complainant and she had then gone to the living room to watch a movie. She later awoke and felt something in her pyjamas. She did not see the accused touch her; she concluded that the touching was for a sexual purpose and that the only rational conclusion was that it was the accused and not him who could have touched her. HELD: The accused was found not guilty. On the total evidence, the evidence was more impressionistic than probative of the facts alleged and the complainant's testimony was not persuaded. The Crown had proved beyond a reasonable doubt on the Information tried before me that he sexually assaulted or touched her with his hand. Accordingly, he will enter acquittals on the record."
2005nsca64.txt,"The chambers judge refused to grant an adoption to a single mother of her own daughter as he determined that the child would not gain anything vis a vis the mother by such an adoption but would lose the potential for a relationship and support from her father. The evidence before the chambers judge was meagre but showed that the father had not seen the child for the past four years. The mother appealed., appeal dismissed; the chambers judge focused on the best interests of the child and did not fail to give appropriate consideration to the factors set out in the Act. He did not place too much emphasis on the child's loss of a potential relationship with and support from the father on the facts of this case.","The single mother appealed the November 2004 decision of the Children and Family Services judge refusing to grant her the adoption she sought with respect to her four year old daughter. The appellant was not married at the time of the daughter's birth and remains single. The child's father has had no contact with her nor has he provided any child support since November 2000. It is not known if the appellant and the child have lived with the father or anyone else or if there is contact between the child and the extended families of either parent. The father was not notified of the adoption application and has not consented. Notice of the proposed adoption was given to the Minister of Community Services as required by s.76(1) of the Child andFamily Services Act. The Minister refused to grant the adoption on the basis that it was not in the child's best interests to do so even though he found all of the technical requirements for the adoption had been complied with. He agreed with the appellant that there was a net loss to the child if the adoption was granted. The Court of Appeal dismissed the appeal. The Appeal held that the primary consideration in an application for adoption is the best interests of the child as set out in s.2(2) of that Act. With respect to the appellant's legal relationship with her father, it is governed by the Maintenance and Custody Act. Section 18 and 19 provide that child's parents have a legal duty to support their child if they are unable. If the adoption were granted those statutory provisions would no longer apply and pursuant to s.80(1)(b) the child would cease to be her father's child, with the consequent loss of possible contact, support and inheritance."
2_2003skpc44.txt,"The plaintiff sought to recover the purchase price and repair and inspection costs of a used vehicle pursuant to the Consumer Protection Act s.57(1)(b). Mr. Russell sold the vehicle under consignment to the plaintiff for $1,600. The sales agreement indicated the vehicle was sold 'as is'. The purchaser returned the vehicle the next day because of a problem with the seat belt, a vibration or pulsation from the brakes and the 'check engine soon light' had come on. The plaintiff paid for the sensor replacement. Triple R absorbed the other costs of repair. The plaintiff's daughter continued to have problems with the car including with lower ball joints, exhaust system and motor mounts. At issue was whether or not a consignee is a 'retail seller' as defined in the Consumer Protection Act. HELD: The plaintiff was entitled to recover the $1,600 purchase price plus foreseeable damages which included costs of repairs and inspection totalling $242.35 and costs of $20 less a reduction of $1,542.35 for the 5,000 km it was driven. 1)A consignee is a retail seller within the meaning of the CPA and accordingly Triple R was deemed to have given the warranties set out in the CPA. If the legislature had intended that consignees were not to be considered retail sellers, it would have listed them in the excluded group. Persons may be considered retail sellers even though they have no contractual relationship to the purchaser in s.55. 2)While the plaintiff did not pay a large sum of money, he could still expect this vehicle to be safe to drive. It was not safe and accordingly was not of acceptable quality. The retail seller bears the burden of establishing the exceptions enumerated in the statutory warranty and failed to do so. The vehicle was unsafe from the outset and could not be considered suitable for the purpose of providing transportation. It was unnecessary to make a finding with respect to warranty s. 48(g) (durable for a reasonable period of time). 3)This auto was substantially unfit for all the usual purposes for which, to the knowledge of the retail seller, it was being bought and accordingly the breach was of a substantial character. 4)The plaintiff rejected the goods within a reasonable period. The commencement of the present action was treated as the rejection of the product. The bulk of delay was caused by the defendant's failure to pick up and look at the vehicle (and implication this would involve repair) as agreed.","The plaintiff was not a partner in Triple R and was engaged in consignment auto sales with Triple R's knowledge and consent. Triple R offered the plaintiff a car for his daughter. The plaintiff purchased the vehicle for $1,600. He was not satisfied that the vehicle was unsafe from the outset. He sought recovery of the purchase price and the costs that he had incurred for repair and inspection. HELD: The plaintiff was awarded $1542.35 plus costs of $20 for a total of $1563.35. 1)The law of contract clearly recognizes that there is a consignment contract between the consignor (Mr. Oborowsky) and the consignment dealer (Triple R). There is also a sales contract between Mr. Dillabough (the vendor) and Mr. Finch (the purchaser). However, in the circumstances the plaintiff was entitled to recover his purchase price of $1600 plus foreseeable damages. 2)The vehicle was driven almost 5,000 kilometres before the seriousness of the problem was discovered. The dealer's position remained that the plaintiff's was not that of Triple R. 3)The court concluded that a consignee is a retail seller within the meaning of the Act and accordingly that Triple R is deemed to have given to the plaintiff the warranties set out in the Act. 4)The plaintiff did not reject the product within a reasonable period of time. The decision was made on his behalf. The vehicle was not used after the plaintiff learned of its very serious problems. The retail seller bears the burden of establishing the exceptions enumerated in the statutory warranty and has failed to do so."
c_2017skqb144.txt,"HELD: The application was granted. The court ordered that the property be sold and the proceeds of sale take into account the amount necessary to protect the respondent father’s claim. The Partition Act, 1868 applies in the province. It did not allow the equitable principles of unjust enrichment and constructive trust to operate to create a proprietary interest. The court found that s. 4 of the Act applied, which provides a monetary remedy so that if the respondent father could establish entitlement to some amount for his maintenance and improvement costs, he would be protected for that amount for his costs.","The parties apply for partition and sale of lake front recreational property owned by them together with their brother. Each of the parties owns an undivided one quarter interest as tenants in common in the property. The property is located next door to another that until recently was the permanent residence of the parents. They are now separated and may have to be sold. The parties argue that the benefit and corresponding detriment must have occurred without juristic reason. They claim that Ronald, through the operation of the principle of unjust enrichment and resulting or constructive trusts, has contributed approximately $40,000 in materials and $40k in time to maintain and improve the property and that these improvements have added to the value of the Property. They also claim that the proceeds from the sale are over and above the contributions of the others. HELD: 1) The Court has a discretion to refuse partition under s. and s. 4. This opens the door to consider the manner in which the parties organized their relationship and whether an injustice has arisen that without equity cannot be remedied. 2) There are three elements that must be satisfied in order for a claim in unjust enrichment to succeed: there must be an enrichment of the defendant, corresponding deprivation of the plaintiff, and an absence of juristic reasons for the enrichment. The Court's Discretion Under the Act is limited to refusing partition when reasonable expectations and public policy are considered. This necessitates determining whether it is s. or s. which operates in these circumstances. If this case is governed by s. the application will be allowed as cannot see anything in the evidence that suggests that the Applicants are motived by malice or are being vexatious as those terms have been interpreted in Reed Reed (1985), [1993] SCC 10 (CanLII), [Ont. C.A.], [1995] SCR 269 (Qld) and [1996] SCBR 670 (QBR 670) in the sense that if it appears that a Sale of the Proceeds would be more beneficial to the parties then division of the property between them would not be sufficient reason to refuse the relief sought. In either case, if a sale is directed the court may or shall give all necessary or proper consequential directions. 3) There is no evidence that any of the above can be said to constitute juristic or constructive reasons for refusing a partition order. The application will have to go under the s.4(1) of the Act and not s.3(1)."

HELD: The plaintiff was awarded $30,737.93 plus costs plus pre-judgment interest. 1)The plaintiff had taken all reasonable steps to mitigate her losses. The duty is to take such steps as a reasonable person would take in his own interests to maintain his income and position in his industry, trade or profession. The former employer has no right to expect that the former employee will accept a lower paying alternative employment with doubtful prospects. 2)Reasonable notice would have been ten months. She had been erroneously requested to take 19.871 days as annual leave and therefore actually received one months' notice. Nine months salary at $26,514.00 plus $1,325 for lost pension benefits and $564 for the Canada Pension Plan were awarded. She was to be compensated for 19.871 days of combined time in lieu and annual leave.","The plaintiff was employed with the defendant, Gabriel Dumont Institute of Native Studies and Applied Research, from January 1983 to May 1993. She was the sole supporter of her family as her husband was unemployed. The plaintiff had taken all reasonable steps to mitigate her damages, including turning down an offer of employment from another company for a new and experimental position. The job was risky and the duties were materially different from those at her job with the institute. She had already taken 19.871 days of combined time-in-lieu and annual leave. This was a new position for the institute and required that the applicant take at least 18 months' notice. HELD: The plaintiff was awarded 9 months' salary in lieu of notice. The court assessed her damages at $26,514.00 and that of the institute for $1,325.93. The defendant was awarded pre-judgment interest pursuant to the Pre-Judgment Interest Act.  1)The plaintiff had been employed for over ten years. She earned an average of $35,352.00 per annum. 2)She was part of the management team by her employer. Her damages were assessed at $2,946.00. 3)The defendant was not obligated to accept the offer for the period 9 months to be reasonable notice. 4)The court was cognizant of the fact that the onus is on the employer to establish that its former employee failed to mitigate. The trial judge was entitled to find the plaintiff justified in rejecting the offer."
e_2005skqb549.txt,"There is no dispute between the parties as to the nature of the plaintiff's investment in the defendant corporation. The real issue between the parties is whether the plaintiff is entitled to the summary relief, which she now seeks pursuant to Rules 129 and 133 of The Queen's Bench Rules. It is the position of the plaintiff that the cross- examination of the defendant on his affidavit discloses that the corporation is profitable company and that s. 34(2) of The Business Corporation Act does not provide any defence to the defendants against the requested relief sought. The parties are in disagreement over the issue of the amount of dividend payments that have been made by the corporation to the plaintiff pursuant to her investment in the corporation. HELD: 1) The plaintiff's application for summary judgment does not require the corporation to redeem any redeemable shares. Rather, the plaintiff's application is one seeking summary judgment. The corporate defendant is not making payment to redeem shares, but rather following judgment however and whenever obtained, it would be subject to the normal judgment process, including execution. Such execution or enforcement of judgment is not tantamount to redemption of shares. The plaintiff provided notice in writing to the corporation that she wished to redeem all her Class E preferred shares effective March 2005. The principal amount of her shares is $214,600. It is this amount that she seeks as the substance of her summary judgment. Section 34(2) of the Act does not serve to prevent the plaintiff seeking summary judgment from the court. The effect of granting judgment, if it is otherwise appropriate to do so, does not place the corporation in a position of breaching the prohibitions contained in s. 34(2) of the Act. 2) The defendants have not demonstrated that there is real insolvency on the part of the corporation. The defendants have failed to provide responses to the undertakings. Further, the defendants have not provided any professional analysis or evidence in support of their position that s. 34(2) is applicable. 3) The amount sought to be recovered by the plaintiff does represent debt or liquidated demand as contemplated by Rule 129. The plaintiff is entitled to summary judgment against the defendant corporation for the sum of $214,600 pursuant to Rule 129. Further the plaintiff is entitled to interest at the rate of 16% from March 2005 in accordance with the Share Agreement. 4) The plaintiff has not demonstrated an appropriate basis for summary judgment against the individual defendants. 5) The plaintiff is entitled to costs.","The plaintiff commenced an action against the defendants seeking various items of specific relief and costs on solicitor-client basis. Thereafter, the plaintiff brought notice of motion seeking an order from the Court an order that the defendants provide an accounting in relation to specified items. The defendants denied any obligation to redeem the plaintiff's preferred shares, and asserted that they would be unable to pay its liabilities as they fell due. The plaintiff brought an application for leave to amend the statement of defence and an order pursuant to Queen's Bench Rule 173(e) for an order granting her summary judgment for the sum of $214,600 plus interest at rate of 16% per annum for the redemption of her preferred shares. The parties were in disagreement over the amount of dividend payments made by the plaintiff to the defendant pursuant to her investment in the company. At issue was whether the plaintiff was entitled to summary judgment. HELD: 1)The plaintiff's motion did not require the defendant to make any payment to purchase or redeem any redeemable shares. Rather, the corporate defendant is not making payment to redeem shares in essence but rather, following judgment however and whenever it would be necessary to be paid to other shareholders who have right to be compensated, including execution. Such execution or enforcement of judgment is not tantamount to redemption of shares. 2)There was no dispute as to the nature of the plaintiff’s s.34(2) application for summary judgment, and the inherent jurisdiction of the Court struck the statement.

The appellants appealed. They argued that the trial judge, by measuring the respondent's loss on the basis that he should be put in the position he would have been if the financial statements had been accurate, had applied the wrong test. Allowing the appeal reducing the damage award to $2,745,600, that the trial judge erred in the test he applied to the award of damages. The proper test is to put the respondent as far as possible in the position he would have been in if he had not invested in the company. The damages are the amount by which the actual value of the company was less than what the respondent paid at the time of purchase.","This was an appeal from an assessment of damages flowing from the appellant's liability to the respondent in tort for negligently prepared financial statements upon which the respondent relied in deciding to purchase the shares of a business. The appellant was a businessman living in Port Hawkesbury and the numbered company was his vehicle used to acquire the business. It was at this time that he began to become aware of the company's real financial situation. He had undertaken significant personal obligations and had used substantial additional funds at considerable risk. Consequently, he could not be placed in his original position merely by returning the purchase price. The trial judge determined that the trial judge had correctly calculated the damages, prima facie the amount by which the actual value of the business was less than what the appellant paid for it. He therefore awarded direct damages of $200,000 to $1,800,000 for a total of $2,000,000. The respondent was awarded consequential damages of approximately $1.8 million. The Court considered that the first approach was to be preferred as it looked at the company as a going concern on the transaction date rather than assuming liquidation at a future date. It would be impossible to quantify the loss that the appellant would have suffered had he not purchased the company."

The lottery money was spent on household finances and lost in husband's small business venture. Husband 'spent more money on alcohol than he should have'. HELD: This did not amount to dissipation of matrimonial property within the meaning of the Act. Husband's mismanagement of the family's financial affairs was grounds for unequal division of the property:","The applicant sought a division of matrimonial property, custody and maintenance for the two youngest children, aged 8 and 8 years, and custody for the three other children under The Deserted Wives and Children's Maintenance Act. The parties owned modest home and equity in the said home of approximately $16,000. The respondent borrowed money and bought some trenching equipment. This business failed and resulted in substantial loss. The trenching business was repossessed, the matrimonial home had to be sold and the mini-motor home was gone. The family took more holidays and did more travelling. The father, who was on unemployment insurance, sought custody of the two younger children, custody of Amanda and 8 year old, under The Infants Act and child support for the said children pursuant to The Desert Wives' and Childrens Maintenance Act respectively. HELD: 1)The respondent was to be given custody of all the matron property and custody of two younger boys and one girl. 2)The applicant was to have her name shown on the matrons' register and on the registry as his name was already shown on her registry. 3)The court found that the respondent, who had spent much of the money trenching, abused alcohol and spent more money on alcohol than he should have. The respondents were in charge of the family finances and finances from 1977 to 1981. There was little left. The money was spent on the family and lost in the trenching.  4)The parties were to have custody of their two children for the purposes of the Matrimonial Property Act and the Rent On Property Act. 5)The father was to pay the arrears of child support in the amount of $1,800 and the respondent's share in the rent on the property as he was already paying the rent in the lot which was already paid for. 6)Costs of the trial were to be deducted for the wife's custody and those of the four children."

e_2013skqb390.txt,"HELD: The Court sentenced the accused pursuant to s. 742.1 of the Criminal Code in force at the time of the offence that precluded the use of conditional sentence order for a serious personal injury offence, which included sexual assault. The Court found that the offences fell on the low end of the sexual assault spectrum as there was no skin to skin contact, the contact was brief and without violence or threats. The aggravating factors were that the accused had two previous convictions for sexual offences and that one of the victims had some cognitive disability. The accused was sentenced to a term of one year imprisonment for each count, followed by a term of probation of two years. The sentences were to be served concurrently.","The accused was found guilty, after trial, of two counts of sexual assault contrary to s. 271 of the Criminal Code. The offence occurred when the accused touched the complainant's breasts and vaginal area while she was sleeping with him. The complainant told the probation officer that the accused had a back problem that prevented him from gaining employment. The probation officer conducted two risk assessments and found the accused at low risk to re-offend. The accused was sentenced to nine months incarceration followed by 12 months probation. HELD: 1)The accused is 61 years of age and had two previous convictions of sexual interference on children. He was assessed as low at risk to offend, even where he was without a criminal record. The Court of Appeal varied the sentence based on the respondent's record. 2)The respondent used physical force which distinguishes this case from the cases of fleeting touching and one involving the use of physical force. This case is at the lower end of the scale with respect to sexual assaults and the Court found that the respondent used a generalized risk assessment, which places the onus of proving any fact not admitted, on the complainant, and on the accused, by the court, to ensure the service of the sentence in the community would not endanger the safety of the community and would be consistent with the fundamental purpose of deterrence."

HELD: The imposition of trust conditions on the disclosure of victim's statements and videotaped statements in cases of sexual assault does not prevent the accused from exercising his right to make full answer and defence as guaranteed by ss. 7 and 11 of the Charter. The obligation to disclose is not absolute. The Corwn's obligation to protect the privacy of the complainants is fulfuilled by providing the statements and videotapes to counsel for the accused on trust condition that counsel retain them in his possession. The information contained therein is available to the accused and retained experts for use in preparing his defence. Since the accused knows the sustance of the complaints and, therefore, the case he has to meet, there is no danger to the fairness of the trial by virtue of the trust condition attached to disclosure.

Application dismissed.","FIAT. A person charged with two counts of sexual assault applied for a remedy under s. 24(1) of the Charter and s. 650(3) of Criminal Code compelling the respondent to provide full and complete disclosure of the complainant statements. HELD: 1)The material filed by the Crown was sufficient to establish a considerable problem with wrongful use of complainant statements generally but not the degree in which it exists in this jurisdiction. The Court of Appeal made specific mention of the respondent's failure to provide copies of certain disclosure material to the accused. 2)The Court of Justice did not find that the respondent was inconsistent with its decisions. Rather, it was the accused's counsel who was restricted by the order in Thomsen v. R. v. Stinchcombe who suggested that defence counsel should not be allowed to give disclosure materials to the public. 3)The accused contended that disclosure in criminal proceedings is now constitutionally required by law to be made available to all Canadians. The fact that the complainants' statements and videotapes contain sensitive personal information that the accused would not be able to divulge to them was of concern to the defence. 4)The respondent's undertaking to supply videotape of one of the complainant's taped taped interviews was not sufficient to prevent the disclosure of these videotapes. 5)The applicant was restricted in his quest for disclosure by the fact that he was unable to watch any videotape provided to him by his counsel or an expert witness. 6)Mitigating circumstances included the absence of evidence of the Crown's breach of trust, the admission of the victim's evidence, the absence or absence of any evidence of how the accused might have been prejudiced in the conduct of his or her own counsel in making his/her submission to the Crown. The evidence did not show that the Crown had established a significant problem with the disclosure practices in the province. 7)The court was of the view that disclosure by defence counsel is a form of disclosure which must be accommodated to the greatest extent possible. 8)Mitigation of the breach of privacy was considered in Petten. 9)The application was dismissed with costs. 10)The judge found that the judge was in breach of the conditions imposed on defence counsel pursuant to s. 7, 11(a) and 11(d). The judge was satisfied that the defence counsel's obligation to report to the court was breached.

e_2013skqb434.txt,HELD: The Court granted the application. It held that: 1) a solicitor-client relationship was created between the applicants and the defendants based on the evidence; and 2) that the applicants had not rebutted the presumption that they had received confidential information during the meeting that was relevant to the plaintiff’s action against the defendants. That finding was sufficient to disqualify them for acting for the plaintiff.,"HELD: The application was dismissed. The court found that the plaintiffs and their lawyer did not have a conflict of interest as the parties had discussed the possible purchase and sale of the plaintiff’s personal care home and that it would be appropriate for the plaintiffs to use their lawyer to represent the plaintiff. There was no delay in the application. The reason the plaintiffs were not disqualified from acting for the plaintiff was because their lawyer had previously advised them that they would have to retain a different lawyer. The judge also found that because the plaintiffs’ lawyer had advised them of the impending sale of their farm property, there was a reasonable prospect that their lawyer would also act for them."
e_2011skqb467.txt,"The complainant and the accused were in relationship and came to Regina where they stayed in hotel, drank, consumed cocaine and shopped. An argument ensued about missing shopping bag. The accused was charged with two counts of uttering death threats to the complainant; unlawfully confining the complainant; assault causing bodily harm on the complainant; committing sexual assault on the complainant; breach of recognizance in having contact with the complainant. At trial, both the complainant and the accused testified as to what transpired during the argument that resulted in the charges. HELD: 1) The accused was found not guilty of sexual assault. 2) The accused was found guilty of unlawful confinement. 3) The accused was found guilty of assault causing bodily harm. The Court did not accept the accused's invoking of self-defence pursuant to s. 34(1) of the Criminal Code. The accused admitted to striking the complainant with a closed fist five times as hard as he could and the force used was excessive. 4) The accused was found guilty of threatening to kill the complainant at the hotel. 5) The accused was found guilty of uttering death threats and breach of recognizance by contacting the complainant. The Court did not accept his testimony and denial.","HELD: The defendant was found not guilty of sexual assault, assault causing bodily harm, unlawful confinement and uttering death threats. The complainant swore she tried to flee several times after the melee in the hotel room, but was prevented from doing so by the defendant. The Court found as a fact that during the events at the hotel, the defendant threatened to kill the complainant and the defendant were both at large on his recognizance entered into by a Justice or a Judge and being bound to comply with a condition that they did not contact or communicate directly or indirectly with the complainant except through a member of the Law Society of Saskatchewan. The elements required for self-defence were not present. The defendant had not been believed by the complainant. He was not known by the Court that the complainant had attempted to flee from the hotel. On the facts, the complainant's testimony did not appear forthright. All of his own acts were minimized or justified, and all of the defendant's acts were aggravated. The accused's repeated threats to kill her did not explain his reaction to her mental state."
d_1996canlii7113.txt,"The question was whether a corporate board could breach its undertaking to remain in a small community when it had taken advantage of the government sponsored community bond program in order to establish its business. The Shareholders' Agreement obliged all shareholders to vote their shares so as to confirm the nominees of certain shareholders, thereby freezing the board composition without regard for its performance. As a result the board was dominated by the original Precision group of shareholders and even though the Government of Saskatchewan and Bondco were entitled to enough votes to exercise control of the company, they could not change the board and did not have the usual ways of enforcing their wishes. Members of Bondco were concerned that jobs were being obtained in Saskatoon at the expense of Rosetown jobs and the economic spin-offs expected from their $800,000 investment were not being realized in Rosetown due to the opening of the Saskatoon facility. An application was brought under s234 of the Business Corporations Act. They sought a restraining order enforcing the covenant, an order appointing new directors, an order of compensation for breach of contract and an order directing the closure of the Saskatoon operation and the return of company assets to Rosetown district unless Bondco granted written consent. HELD: It was ordered that 1)the Shareholders Agreement was amended deleting the offending paragraph concerning the Board of Directors and substituting a new paragraph; 2)certain provisions of the Articles of Continuance as amended were suspended until the Termination Date; 3)the present board was suspended pending the election of directors at a special meeting of shareholders; 4)the respondent was enjoined from moving its operations and from transferring or hiring employees at any place other than Rosetown District unless Bonco's written consent was filed with the Court. 5)The Chief Executive Officer was not displaced nor was the Saskatoon operation directed to be closed.  6)Bonco was entitled to its taxable costs against the individual respondents.","Precision entered into a Financing Agreement with the District of Columbia in 1991 and Bondco invested $800,200 in the metal fabrication plant. In 1996, the president and CEO of the corporation advised Bondco that Precision had leased a manufacturing facility in Saskatoon, Canada, and that the directors should be obliged to consent thereto. The shareholders' agreement obliged all shareholders to vote their shares so as to confirm the nominees of certain shareholders, thereby freezing the board composition without regard to its performance. The board dominated by the former president's supporters and prevented the company from moving operations and from having its legal offices in the city. The actions of the board have been high-handed and oppressive and the complainant is fully entitled to the assistance of the court."

HELD: The plaintiff's claim was dismissed. 1)When the evidence of the three independant witnesses was considered, the defendant insurer met the onus referred to Grover Holdings and established that the fire was deliberately set. While there was no direct evidence to establish the plaintiff set the fire himself, the inference was drawn that he did or, in the alternative, caused someone else to do so.  2)Had the plaintiff been in the mobile home he should have been suffering to some degree from carbon monoxide poisoning, he should have been coughing, his hair should have been singed, he would have had soot on his face and his clothes would have smelled of smoke. 3)The plaintiff did not call evidence to rebut the fire investigator's opinion that a significant quantity of fire accelerant had been used nor was his brother called to confirm his testimony that he attempted to re-enter the mobile home after arranging for the fire department to be called.","The plaintiff's residence, mobile home and contents were insured with the defendant who had denied liability alleging that the plaintiff intentionally started the fire or caused it to be started. HELD: The defendant had met the onus referred to in the Grover Holding case and had established that the fire was deliberately set.

All of the evidence going to the question of whether there was just cause for the appellant's dismissal was eminently suited to assessment by the jury. Specific issues such as those relating to assessment of damages could have been withdrawn from the jury notice. 2)There was no general rule that an action for wrongful dismissal should be tried without a jury. The questions that arise are questions of law rather than fact. Where possible questions of fact should be separated from purely legal issues and such questions as whether there has been a breach and the quantum of damages, the jury will have the opportunity to decide. 3)The application was also denied on the issue of costs."

He had continued pain in the neck, shoulder, back and hip four and one half years after the accident. Throughout this period, the plaintiff missed only three days and then three weeks of work. The medical evidence conflicted as to whether the injuries were the cause of the continued pain. Awarding $25,000 valued at date of judgment with an adjusted interest rate. The court found the injury was mild and not the cause of the continued pain. The plaintiff was found to have chronic pain syndrome.","The plaintiff was injured in a motor vehicle accident when he braced his leg on the highway and suffered a soft tissue injury. He worked as a technician for several years, then as a supervisor for four years. He changed jobs in the ensuing years, claiming damages for myofascial or chronic pain, mainly relating to his left hip. He now suffered from chronic pain syndrome, which was not a direct result of the accident. He no longer exercised or felt good about his work, and suffered from severe back pain four and a half years ago.

8_2009nssc261.txt,"The Trustee opposed the bankrupt's application for a discharge on various grounds. The bankrupt supported four children and had been discharged from the military due to illness arising from her active service. The bankrupt will be entitled to an absolute discharge once certain conditions are met, including the payment of one month's rent, the value of the horses and surplus income for nine months to the Trustee. The bankrupt's disability pension from Veterans' Affairs was not included in the calculation of surplus income as the public policy reason behind the exemption for proceeds received due to personal injury and a soldier's danger pay applied to this disability pension. The Trustee had no claim to the insurance proceeds received by the bankrupt following the loss of her home by fire as it was a modest sum used to replace lost personal exempt assets; the three horses were found to be owned by the bankrupt as opposed to her children, for whom she had purchased them as pets and were included in the value of her estate; the court exercised its discretion in determining the amount of surplus income, noting that the administration of the estate had been unusually hostile and it was important that the bankrupt be able to stabilize her family finances.","The respondent asked that she be discharged from bankruptcy as she suffered from Post Traumatic Stress Disorder, Major Depression Disorder, and Borderline Personality Organization. These illnesses entitle her to a pension from the Department of Veterans Affairs. She refused to cooperate with the trustee on this application and argued that they were not assets of her estate and that she should be compensated for the loss of her household goods which were taken from her. She also argued that she had received substantial amounts of money from her insurers and that they did not belong to her. The trustee objected, arguing that they had little or no value and that the respondent should be allowed to keep them in compensation for certain exempt personal property which had been taken from the respondent. HELD: The respondent was discharged from bankruptcy. She was entitled to an absolute discharge. 1)The respondent was not asked to make a detailed analysis of what is exempt and what is not exempt. She had ample time to make arrangements and she had asked for bank statements for 12 months prior to bankruptcy. 2)The trustee was not required to make any specific determination as to the value of the three horses. The respondent's evidence at the hearing was that she did not have any money in her bank account at the time of her bankruptcy. 3)There was no evidence before the court as to their precise value or the precise amount of money used for the purpose of calculating surplus income. There was a general presumption that all horses should be exempt from taxation. 4)No amount was given to the trustee as a form of income exempt from the taxation of horse and horse assets. The pension should not be considered surplus income for the purposes of calculating the surplus income of the horses.  5)There were a number of mitigating factors, such as the respondent's willingness to take on new responsibilities, her level of responsibility for her family finances, her willingness to pay the trustee any amount for the horses she had already received from her insurance proceeds, her ability to inspect the barn when she gave up her home, her modest means of transportation and her willingness and ability to pay her fair share of the expenses associated with the move."
d_2012nssc139.txt,"The applicant is the only drug store in a rural community. The respondent worked there for 30 years, in various positions. He signed a 5-year, 10 mile non-competition clause in 1995. He quit in early March with the intention of opening a new drug store down the street in early April. Other key staff members intended to quit and work in the new store. The applicant moved for an interim injunction to prevent the respondent from opening his store pending the hearing of their motion for an interlocutory injunction. Interim injunction granted. The new Civil Procedure Rules (2008) distinguish between interim and interlocutory injunctions. This is one of the circumstances which was contemplated when the new Rule 41.04 was enacted. Urgency exists and the applicant can't wait. While the non-competition clause may well not survive a challenge at the full hearing of the interlocutory injunction motion, all the applicant needs to show is that there is a serious issue to be tried. There is. This isn't a frivolous or vexatious application. There's a high potential for the applicant to suffer irreparable harm (e.g. the loss of customers, market share) especially given that this is a small community. An interim injunction will only result in a delay of a few weeks. The interlocutory injunction is set to heard at the end of April. The stakes are higher for the applicant than they are for the respondent.","The plaintiff brought a motion for an interim injunction in connection with a motion to interlocutory injunction issued in the absence of a declaration that a new drug store was imminent. The defendant, who had resigned from the plaintiff company, sought an interlocal injunction in order to launch a new business. The only drug store in the city operated by the defendant was owned and operated by its successors. The defendants had signed a non-compete agreement whereby the employee agreed not to engage in the drug store business within 10 miles of the plaintiff's business for years after the end of his employment. In 1995, the defendant signed the agreement which would have allowed the employee to remain in the business for another 30 years. Salsman left the company in March 2012. Other key employees of the defendant company indicated that they would resign or leave the company to join the new company. This was not a frivolous or vexatious application. The impending and imminent opening of the new business satisfies the requirement that of 41.04 2 (c) that urgency exists and cannot await the determination of the motion for interlocutorutory injunction. It is obvious that once that new business opens, the effect upon the plaintiff’s company will be profound and there is really no going back."

The defendant had not given any reasons for not filing a defence in the proceeding other than his assertion the originating notices were not served on him. HELD: The defendant's application was dismissed. The court found that it had not shown that the defence was not filed and delivered within the time limited by the Rules and that the plaintiff had no reason for not responding to the defence. As the defendant had explained in his affidavit that he was not responsible for the car accident, the court could not find that his affidavit or affidavit of service indicated that he had served the documents on the plaintiff. The plaintiff's claim was also not supported by his affidavit because it did not set out acts upon which in the words of Ives v. Dewar would clearly indicate he had a good defence to the action on the merits; not necessarily a defence which would succeed at trial because the action was not being tried on the application, but facts which would show beyond a question that there was a substantial issue between the parties to be tried."

The Court had earlier acquitted the accused on the charge of driving while disqualified as there was no evidence regarding the status of the accused's driver's licence. At issue was whether the GiO cycle or moped which the accused was operating was a motor vehicle as defined by the Criminal Code. The accused asserted that his GiO bike was operated that night by pedaling it as the electric motor was not working and asserted that driver's licence was not required to operate the GiO bike nor was he required to put licence plate on it. HELD: The accused was found not guilty of the charges before the Court. There was no evidence that the electric motor on the GiO bike was operational that evening and the officer testified that he observed the accused dragging his feet while driving the moped.,"The accused was charged with impaired driving and operating a motor vehicle while disqualified. The issue before the court was whether the accused was pedaling his bike as his sole means of propulsion and whether the electric motor was operable. HELD: The accused was found not guilty of the charges of driving while disqualified and failure to provide a breath sample. The Crown had failed to prove that the accused's motor vehicle was a registered motor vehicle as defined by the Criminal Code. Gary Rookes was acquitted of the impaired driving charges. The issues were whether there were pedals on the accused’s bike, whether there was an electric motor on his bike, and whether he was using it as a sole means to propulsion. The only issue was whether there had been any pedals on his Moped. The accused had stated on his affidavit that his bike was not a bicycle as it was not designed to be driven by any means other than muscular power. The defence did not cross examine the accused. The offence was charged under s. 253(1)(a) of the Criminal code, and s. 259(4) of that Code. The offences were: (1) driving while impaired by alcohol or drug contrary to s.253(1); (2) failing to provide breath samples contrary to section 254(5); and (3) driving with a suspended licence or less than a year on which the accused had been convicted of the charge of driving over the legal limit. The second offence was driving while over.08. The court found that the offence was not defined by s.255(1) as the offence of impaired driving. The officer testified that he observed the accused pedaling the bike with both of his feet close to the ground rather than resting on the floor board as the motor powered the bike. During the trial, the Crown argued that the e-scooter was not motor vehicle, as the accused blew into the approved screening device twice, and that his first breath lacked sufficient pressure to activate the device. In the absence of any detailed observations respecting the accused and the fact that he failed to provide sample of breath, the court found the accused to be guilty of both counts."

The accused apply for a review of the detention orders. HELD: 1) A review of the detention orders would ordinarily be cursory and the applications dismissed. The reasons for the decisions to refuse to release the accused cannot seriously be questioned. 2) However, a factor that causes concern is that 6 months after their arrest, not only has a preliminary hearing not been conducted, no date for a preliminary hearing has been set. No preliminary hearing date will be set before May 2005. The preliminary hearing will take 2 to 3 weeks.  It seems unlikely that the trial of these individuals will take place within a year of the date of their arrest. 3) They are ordered released on terms and upon the filing of security in the amount of $1,000.","HELD: The accused were released from detention after a show cause hearing. There was a substantial likelihood that the accused would, if released from custody, commit a criminal offence. The delay in the release of the accused from detention caused several problems for the defence. The accused was only 21 years of age and had a significant youth court record. He was convicted in youth courts in Manitoba and Manitoba of 13 breaking and entering, theft, and possession of stolen property charges; one charge of failing to comply with undertakings; and two charges of obstructing police officer. He had been using an alias at the time of his arrest and was facing outstanding charges and was wanted in Manitoba for drug related charges. He is alleged to have been the number two man in the Regina organization. Although only 21, the accused has a significant criminal record; six youth court records, one conviction for breaking and enter and theft, one for failing to attend court, and one for being unlawfully at large. HELD: 1)The accused was released on a recognizance with conditions. 2)He was ordered released on conditions including that he would not consume alcohol and non-prescription drugs, not enter any public premise which served alcoholic beverages and not be in possession of any cellular telephones. 3)His release was denied for the same reasons that the defence lawyer's release was refused. The judge would ordinarily be cursory in their cursory examination but this time she cannot be seriously questioned."
e_2014skqb265.txt,The determination of whether the trial judge’s conclusion regarding the officer’s suspicion was reasonable was question of law subject to the correctness standard. The respondent conceded that the officer had the requisite subjective belief that he had alcohol in his body so the appeal centered on whether the objective test had been met. The appeal court did not find any basis to disturb the trial judge’s finding of fact as to the factors the officer based his suspicion of alcohol consumption on. The court noted the trouble with the fact that the respondent admitted to drinking alcohol that “evening” but the stop was at 5:00 am in the morning. The trial judge disregarded the respondent’s admission to drinking because there was no smell of alcohol and the trial judge said there should be if the consumption was recent. The court concluded that the trial judge erred in dismissing the alcohol consumption admission. A reasonable person would have assumed that the officer’s question was with respect to recent consumption of alcohol not an earlier irrelevant time. It was also found reasonable for the officer to believe the consumption was recent. The court concluded that a reasonable person standing in the officer’s place would reasonably suspect that the respondent had alcohol in his body. An answer by an accused person that they have been drinking was found to be stronger support for a suspicion than the smell of alcohol. Because the respondent’s Charter rights were not breached a new trial was ordered.,"The accused was charged with impaired driving and driving with a blood alcohol level over.08. He was acquitted of both charges. The Crown appealed the acquittals of the accused and the conviction of impaired driving. At trial, the accused challenged the reasonableness of the investigating officer's suspicion upon which the officer based his ASD demand. The trial judge determined the officer was not deliberately trying to violate the accused's rights, but his dealings with the accused were less than what society should expect from a police officer who has been trained in the use of the ASD. HELD: The accused was found guilty of driving with blood alcohol in his system and the ASD demand satisfied the officer's objective requirement of s. 254(2)(b). The Court found that the officer relied only on three factors in forming his suspicion: 1) his nervousness, his lack of desire to tell the accused what he was doing and the fact this incident occurred at 5:12 in the morning; 2) there was no basis for disturbing this finding of fact. There is no basis in disturbing this found of fact which was evident in the trial."

HELD: The sentence was varied by reducing the term of probation to 1 year and by deleting the provisions concerning possession and consumption of alcohol, entry into premises where alcohol is sold and consumed, and submission to breath or blood testing. A period of probation was appropriate but 3 years was out of proportion to the nature of the offence.

c_1998canlii14058.txt,"FIAT. An application pursuant to Rule 188 for a determination of whether the defendant was liable pursuant to s86(1) of the Highway Traffic Act for the personal injuries of the infant plaintiff or was immune from liability by virtue of s228 [now s232] of the Education Act. The second point of law to be determined was whether the co-defendant as car owner was liable if the driver was found to be immune from liability. The motor vehicle accident occurred while the infant plaintiff was being transported during a field trip, approved by the defendant school board, and the defendant was the teacher. HELD: 1)The teacher/driver was acting within the scope of her duties and was immune from liability by virtue of the Education Act. 2)The owner was only liable to the same extent as the driver. The reasoning in Neault was directly on point. Just as the Workers' Compensation Act and the Highway Traffic Act prevent the injured worker from suing the owner of the vehicle because he is prevented from suing the driver, the Education Act extends the same immunity to the owner as it does to the driver by operation of s86(1) of the Highway Traffic Act. 3)There was no apparent conflict between the statutes. When read together, the legislation provides that a negligent teacher is granted immunity from liability if the teacher has acted within the scope of the Education Act. The Traffic Act is the general statute, governing liability of all drivers. The Court did not agree with the School Board's analysis that the Education Act was the general statute. 4)The injured plaintiff was not denied a party to sue for negligent operation of a vehicle as he had recourse against the school board and its insurer. The immunity under the Education Act only applies to teachers and principals.","FIAT. The question is whether the defendant is liable for s. 86(1) of the Highway Traffic Act for the personal injuries suffered by the infant plaintiff, or whether the co-defendant is immune from liability by s. 228 of The Education Act. HELD: 1)Whether the defendant has an immunity under s.228 of The Highway Traffic act extends to the owner of the motor vehicle. In the event the mother is not liable, the father is immune. 2)In the event Edith Larsen is immune the liability from s.8 of the Education Act the school board is not able to find in favour of the board. 3)The school board has the right to sue the employer of the registered motor vehicle for injuries sustained while in the course of employment. The school board can sue the father for negligence. 4)The immunity only applies to teachers and principals. The argument that the mother has been immune is not supported by the facts. The fact that the father was not liable for the injury at all and the mother was immune by the s.231 of the Act ensures that any school board member who is negligent or otherwise wrongfully taken out of the vehicle is liable."
5_2004skqb417.txt,"Each party has applied for a variation of the judgment granted by Gunn J. in April 1999. The judgment incorporates the terms of an Interspousal Contract dated April 1999 that provides for basic child support to be paid by the petitioner in the amount of $1,411 per month. The calculation of child support in the Interspousal Contract was based on the petitioner earning $110,000. The petitioner seeks to have child support reduced for Kimberly and discontinued for Ashley. The petitioner has unilaterally terminated support for Ashley on the basis that she is over 18 years of age and not in full time attendance at school. The respondent seeks an upward variation of ongoing child support for Kimberly on the basis that the petitioner's income is significantly higher than $110,000. She also seeks a retroactive variation of support paid for both girls. HELD: 1) The parties agree that much of the petitioner's income since the separation has included significant amounts of non-recurring income in the form of capital gains, stock options and severance pay. In accordance with s. 16 of the Guidelines, a payor's income for child support purposes is determined based on total income, adjusted in accordance with Schedule III, as shown on his or her income tax return. The petitioner has provided no compelling reason to exclude any of his non-recurring income. To the contrary, it is the fairest way of proceeding. The petitioner's income since separation discloses that non-recurring income can realistically be anticipated in the future, as it has constituted a significant portion of his income in four of the last five years. The fairest way of determining the appropriate level of child support is by calculating it based on his income during the previous year. 2) The petitioner's line 150 income on his 2003 income tax return was $199,922. This includes $114,454 of non-recurring capital gain income from the sale of shares in Poplar Hill Resources. It does not include the non-taxable portion of that capital gain in the same amount. Pursuant to Clause 6 of Schedule III referred to in s. 16 of the Guidelines, this non-taxable amount is to be included as an adjustment to income. This results in the petitioner's 2003 income for child support purposes being $314,376. However, in examining documents provided by the petitioner regarding his previous year's income, it is apparent that he incurred net capital losses in 2002 of $65,424. The Court imputed $150,000 of income to the petitioner for the year 2002 despite this net capital loss and his line 150 income being only $2,410. It is therefore reasonable that this capital loss be deducted from the non-taxable portion of the capital gain he realized in 2003. This results in only $49,030 of the non-taxable portion of the 2003 capital gain being added to income for total income of $248,952. Based on the Guidelines, child support of $1,928 would be payable for Kimberly.  3) During the same year that the petitioner was enjoying income in excess of $248,000, the respondent's income for herself and the two children was only $24,345. It is self-evident that the petitioner has a substantially greater ability to provide financial support for Kimberly than does the respondent. In the circumstances it is appropriate that one-half of the Guideline amount for the petitioner's income in excess of $150,000 be payable as child support. Effective January 1, 2004, the petitioner shall pay monthly child support for Kimberly of $1,557.  4) Ashley did not complete grade 12 until June 2003. In the normal course, she would have graduated in June 2002, but she was short some classes. The required classes were not available in September 2002 so she did not return to school until the new semester in January 2003. Although Ashley was not in full time attendance in school during the last six months of 2002, she had not yet completed her basic education and had every intention of doing so. She was not in a position to withdraw from her parent's support. Considering the disparity in the ability of each of her parent to contribute to her support, it is appropriate that support for Ashley be the amount determined by applying the Guidelines as if she were a child under the age of majority.  5) A written request by the respondent for the petitioner to provide copies of his income tax returns is not required because the parties incorporated a positive obligation to exchange tax returns in their Interspousal Contract. Consistent with the objectives of the Guidelines and implicit in the Interspousal Contract the parties must have understood that the petitioner's child support obligation could change if his income changed. 6) This is clearly a case where a retroactive variation is warranted. No variation can be considered for 1999, the year of the Interspousal Contract and the judgment. Given the various sources of the petitioner's income and the significant annual fluctuations in his income, it is appropriate to use his previous year's income as the basis for calculation of his child support payable in the subsequent year. The Court went on to calculate the petitioner's income and the child support payable for each year. 7) In 2002 the petitioner's line 150 income was only $2,410. Given the pattern of the petitioner's income in the three preceding years, along with the fact that he disposed of capital assets in 2003 that generated undisclosed cash flow, and, some 2 years later, he nevertheless retains significant net assets, the Court imputed additional income to the petitioner of $150,000 for child support purposes. 8) The respondent was awarded costs set at $2,600.","Each party applied for a variation of the 1999 child support judgment. The parties separated in 1997 and shortly thereafter the husband moved to Alberta. The 1999 judgment incorporates the terms of an Interspousal Contract which provides for basic child support to be paid by the husband in the amount of $1,411 per month. The wife, who recently commenced negotiations for a retroactive upward variation of child support, applied for variation in March 2004. She sought an upward variation based on the husband's income significantly higher than his. The husband argued that since the parties separated he had not had the financial resources to provide financial support for his two children. HELD: 1) The parties were able to determine the appropriate level of support payable without interruption to June 30, 2003. Given the pattern of the respondent's income in the three preceding years, along with the fact that he disposed of capital assets in 2002 that generated undisclosed cash flow and some two years later he nevertheless retains significant net assets, it is reasonable to impute additional income to the husband for 2002. Based on the Guidelines and an annual income of $248,952 the child support payable for two children from January 1, 2003 to June30, 2003 would be based on his current income. The calculations would be adjusted accordingly. 2) The husband was entitled to costs of this application set at $2,600."
d_1998canlii4665.txt,"The primary issue in this appeal was the standard of review to be applied on appeals from a Hearing Officer to the Workers' Compensation Appeals Tribunal. The appellant had his appeal denied on the grounds that the decision of the Hearing Officer was not patently unreasonable. Allowing the appeal and remitting the matter for re-hearing, that an appeal from a Hearing Officer to the Tribunal is a statutory appeal. It is not a judicial review, and the standard of review is therefore one of correctness not whether or not the Hearing Officer's decision was patently unreasonable. The deference that the Tribunal must show is only with respect to the advantages the Hearing Officer may have in the fact finding process of a particular case.",This was an appeal for which leave was granted from a Worker's Compensation Appeals Tribunal decision. It was limited to question as to the jurisdiction of the Tribunal and to the usual appellate deference to trier of fact. This appeal was allowed and the matter was remitted to the Tribunal. There was no reason to think that the Tribunal is any less expert generally in matters relating to workers' compensation that fall within s. 243(7) than the hearing officer. The concept of patently unreasonable decision had no place in this statutory appeal process. The Tribunal has made an error of jurisdiction as to its powers on an appeal from the hearing Officer.

The estate counterclaimed for a mortgage debt incurred by the father on behalf of the plaintiff. The plaintiff was not included in his father's Will as a beneficiary and the Will contained no reference to the mortgage debt. The father's statement of assets filed in his divorce and matrimonial property action did not disclose it as an asset. HELD: 1)The unsigned handwritten memorandum evidenced a binding agreement for lease between the plaintiff and his father. He affirmed the lease in his discussions with a daughter. 2)The plaintiff neither repudiated the lease nor failed to complete his obligations under it.  The fact that he did not vigorously contest the right of his brother to farm the land on behalf of the estate did not estop him from suing for damages for his father's breach of the lease.  Damages of $6,500 were awarded. 3)The plaintiff failed to establish a quantum meruit claim. He did not produce any documents to show he had been reimbursed for his labour on the farm in prior years. Other family members helped with the farming from time to time. He did nothing while his father was alive to demand or obtain payment. 4)Even if the mortgage was considered a debt in 1989 it was subsequently forgiven. It was significant that the plaintiff was not included as a beneficiary and the amount of the mortgage was similar to the bequests to the other children. 5)The plaintiff was awarded his costs against the estate on a party and party basis for that portion of his claim on which he was successful and for defending the counterclaim. Solicitor and client costs against the estate were not appropriate as the issues raised by the claim and counterclaim were not typical estate issues. Judgment issued against the two executors in their representative capacity.","The plaintiff sues his father's estate for damages for breach of a farm lease and for a mortgage debt incurred by the deceased on behalf of the plaintiff. The issues raised by the claim and counterclaim are: 1)Is there a valid lease agreement between the plaintiff and his deceased father? (b)If so, was the lease repudiated by the plaintiff; and 2)Is the plaintiff entitled to reimbursement from the estate on a quantum meruit basis for the value of his farm labour? (c)If the lease is valid, is the plaintiff estopped from suing on it? (d)The plaintiff did not vigorously contest the lease nor fail to complete his obligations under it. The $17,800.00 mortgage (and interest) granted by the father to Farm Credit Corporation to clear his land from Bank of Montreal mortgage is not debt enforceable by the estate.  4)In the circumstances, the fact the plaintiff's father did not repudiate the lease and he did nothing to obstruct its enforcement, does not estop him from suing the estate fordamages for his breach of the lease."
b_2016skpc86.txt,"HELD: The court found that the child was in need of protection under s. 11(b) of The Child and Family Services Act, that his parents were unable to care for him, and that physical or emotional harm was likely to occur to him. J.A.’s mother was found to be a person of sufficient interest under s. 23 of the Act. The court ordered that the child should be placed in the custody of J.A.’s mother as a person of sufficient interest for a period of four months pursuant to s. 37(1)(b) of the Act. The child’s parents should have adequate access to build their relationship with him and to allow them, with the assistance of others, to come up with a plan that would allow them to eventually care for their child.","The child was apprehended at birth by the Minister of Social Services but the Minister did not proceed with the application and the child was allowed to take home with her. The parents agreed that one of them would always be present to supervise the care of the child. The child had diminished cognitive abilities as she suffered from FASD and had challenges around understanding and retaining information despite presenting as though this was not the case. The mother alleged that the father had physically assaulted her and had threatened to kill anyone who entered the farm. The father was charged under The Youth Criminal Justice Act. HELD: The child was in need of protection and an order was made under s. 23 of the Child and Family Services Act. The order was that the child be placed in the grandmother's custody as a person of sufficient interest for a fixed period of 4 months, pursuant to s. 37(1)(b). That period is of shorter duration than the six months suggested by the minister. The decision to return the child to the parents' care was not supported by the evidence. The children would remain in need OF protection under s.(2) the Act. Having found that the parents were not able to care for the child and that physical or emotional harm was likely to occur to the six week old child, the order was amended to order that the infant be placed with the grandmother."
2_2006nsfc7.txt,"Although the mother initially had sole custody of the parties' two children, they were placed in the joint custody of both parents, with primary care and control with the father, when the mother was hospitalized due to mental health disturbances. When the children were not later returned to her care, the mother brought an application to vary the primary care arrangements, alleging that the children were not receiving suitable and appropriate parenting while in the father's care. The father, who lived close to the maternal grandparents and relied upon them extensively for the care of the children, questioned the mother's emotional and mental health and stability. The transfer of primary care of the children to the mother is conditional upon the fulfillment of several provisions and prohibitions, including the mother's disclosure to her mental health caregivers of any alcohol consumption and the recent harassing phone calls made by her; should the parents be unable or unwilling to cooperate with the court directives, the court will consider filing a report of neglect under the Children and Family Services Act; primary care and access will be reviewed by the court in six months time. The children were at considerable risk if placed in the primary care of either parent; the evidence showed that the father was unable to meet the children's needs on a daily basis; in addition to his questionable parenting judgment, his regular daily drug use in circumstances where the family lived in poverty and one child had an asthmatic medical condition showed that he placed a higher priority on his relationship with marijuana than his primary responsibility as protector of his children. Although the mother's parenting plan was well-conceived, the court questioned whether she could withstand the daily pressure of raising the children and noted her past habit of consuming alcohol while taking medication.","The mother applied for a change in the primary care arrangements for two children. The father was currently employed as a roofer but was unable to drive a motor vehicle, having accumulated myriad of driving infractions to add to his already lengthy criminal record. The children were at considerable risk if placed in the sole care of either parent as their mother habitually smoked drugs and alcohol while in the mother's care and there was an ongoing strain of poor relations with the father. The mother's past habit of consuming alcohol while taking medication had an adverse effect on the children. As the father had no driver’s license and was not able to obtain one, the mother was at a high risk of future drug use. As a result of these problems, the father was sentenced to criminal charges and is awaiting sentencing. As for the mother, she filed this application for a variation of the primary day care and control order. HELD: The Court found that the primary issue was the mother’ s failure to provide proper primary care and support to the children and that if the mother continued to smoke drugs and be in a high-risk relationship with her current partner, this would automatically divert funds available to adequately provide amenities for the children in the long term. The Court also found that, in the circumstances, the parents’ relationship was negatively impacted by the alcohol and drug use of the children, especially since their mother was no longer employed and their father was unable and unwilling to drive motor vehicle. As these issues were all but resolved, the Court ordered a custody and access assessment of the boys."

A judgment was rendered, dividing the matrimonial property and dismissing the appellant's claim for maintenance. The appellant now appeals on the ground that the trial should not have proceeded without him. HELD: The appeal is dismissed. 1) There is no error in the decision of the trial judge. The medical evidence did not indicate any inability to either instruct counsel or to represent him in Court. The trial judge had little choice but to do what she did. 2) The authorities cited by the appellant have no application to this case as they all deal with situations where someone did not appear at his trial. In this case, the appellant appeared but refused to participate. For the same reason, Queen's Bench Rule 271 has no application.","The appellant appeared for his trial in matrimonial matter after a peremptory adjournment. He refused to participate in the proceedings and the judge ordered that the trial proceed without him, although the judge did allow a friend to give evidence on his behalf. The trial judge dismissed the appellant's claim for maintenance. The appellant had been warned in writing that his health would be put into jeopardy by his attendance at trial. He had been given several accommodations by the court, including a provision of written instructions on the conduct of trial by self-represented litigants, time for consultations and preparation during the trial, and private room for consultation. The judge allowed the appellant to return to the courtroom after advising the appellant that he wanted to give an evidence. The court granted divorce, divided the matrimony property and dismissed the respondent's claimant for maintenance since no evidence was led with respect to it. The medical opinions fell far short of justifying anything other than allowing someone else to represent the appellant, but the appellant had already demonstrated an inability to obtain the services of a lawyer acceptable to him and the appellant declined to proceed with Mr. Hawke at his side. HELD: The appellant's application for bail was dismissed. There was no error in the decision of the trial judge. He appeared to be incapable of representing himself and that he needed a lawyer. He then withdrew from the courtroom. The Court granted divorce and divided the Matrimonial property, but dismissed the applicant's maintenance claim.  1)No error was found on the part of the court in the granting and dismissing of the application for the Queen's Bench Rule 271, the Rule 271 of the Charter, or the Rule 8 of the Appellant Rules, or in the circumstances where a person does not appear at his trial. 2)There was no evidence of the reasons for the decision nor of the reasonableness in the reasons provided.

b_2002nsca30.txt,"A fifteen year old died in a motor vehicle accident. The estate brought a claim for loss of future income and lost earning capacity. The Chambers judge found that such a claim was not available and the estate appealed. Appeal dismissed; the context of the legislation, its purpose and text all support the conclusion that the deceased's loss of prospective earnings is not an actual pecuniary loss to the estate.","Where a person is killed due to the fault of another, the person's estate may sue the wrongdoer for certain damages which have resulted in an actual pecuniary loss to the estate. The main question to be decided in this case is whether the earnings which the deceased would have likely have earned had he not been killed are 'an actual peculiary loss' and are, therefore, recoverable by the estate in an action against the Wrongdoer. The Nova Scotia survival of actions legislation contained several exclusions and limitations not found in the earlier Ontario and English legislation. The provision excluding causes of action for adultery and inducing a spouse to leave or remain apart from their spouse or children excluded these sorts of damages. In Nova Scotia, the law provided that if a person was killed as a result of another's negligence, no cause of action could be expected, as there was no pecuneiary loss as required by the Act."

2_2007nsca122.txt,"Two days after the wife commenced a divorce action in Nova Scotia, the husband commenced one in Texas. He successfully applied to have the wife's divorce petition set aside on the grounds that she had not been ordinarily resident in Nova Scotia for at least one year immediately prior to the commencement of the proceeding. The wife applied for a stay of execution pending her appeal of this decision. She argued irreparable harm to herself and the parties' child on the basis that if the stay was refused, she would be required to travel to take part in the Texas proceeding, leaving her law practice for an extended time and uprooting the child who was settled in school here. She also feared that she would be found in contempt for failing to obey the Texas custody orders and be imprisoned. Application for stay pending appeal dismissed; the irreparable harm claimed by the appellant was entirely speculative at this point as if the Texas court did grant custody to the father, under the Child Abduction Act, a Nova Scotia court would have jurisdiction to determine the child's habitual residence and whether the appellant was wrongfully detaining him here. Given that the Texas court would be free to continue its proceeding even if a stay was granted, until such time as the conflict of laws issue was resolved, it would be risky for the appellant not to participate in the process there. Furthermore, the order under appeal was not one that lent itself to being stayed under Rule 62.20.","The appellant appeals from a stay of execution of an order setting aside her petition for divorce. On an application by the respondent to set aside the divorce petition on the basis that Nova Scotia lacked jurisdiction, the court determined that the appellant had not been ordinarily resident in Nova Scotia for at least 1 year prior to the filing of the petition.

An inspection of the mall roof revealed that 10.5 per cent of the joists inspected had at least one panel point with a broken or missing weld and the same remediation scheme as that implemented by the Province for the government's own buildings was recommended. The plaintiff, concerned with safety issues arising from the report, followed the consultant's recommendations and undertook remediation of the mall and then claimed against the defendant, which was the parent company of the corporate entity which had fabricated the joists. The defendant's expert took the position that although the actual repairs to the welding and webs of the open steel joists was necessary, the reinforcing of the joists undertaken in the remediation was not required in order to mitigate the danger. Judgment for the plaintiff; there were defects in the open web steel joists at the mall which constituted a real and substantial danger to the occupants; this danger was caused by the defendant's negligence and the remediation program carried out at the mall was necessary to alleviate the real and substantial danger. There were internal problems with the welds which could not be discovered by non-destructive inspection and the lack of proper welding procedures and quality control issues at the company prevented one from having confidence in any welds fabricated by them, at least based on external observations.","The plaintiff obtained a number of open web steel joists from the defendant. The defendant proceeded to build them at locations throughout the country. The plaintiffs alleged that the defendants had failed to maintain the quality of the joists they had inspected. The defendants claimed that the plaintiff had undertaken remediation of the mall, using the open web standard joist. The plaintiff claimed that one of the defendants' divisions had attempted to have its joists deslagged. The issue was whether the defendants were subject to the mandatory mandatory inspection that was required of all future open web joists.

A decision on the corollary issue of whether the proceeding should have taken place under Rule 4.07 (dismissal for want of jurisdiction) or Rule 88.02 (abuse of process) is unnecessary.","Rule 4.07(3) – Rule 88.02 for abuse of process The respondent applied for a stay of proceedings pursuant to Rule 4.06(3), s. of the Arbitration Act and Rule 88(02) of the Courts. The Chambers judge defined the issue as whether the respondent had attorned to the Court's jurisdiction. He found that he had. More than two years after the suit started, the appellant applied for stay. More recently, the Chambers judge dismissed the appellant's application for stay, dismissing the appeal with costs to the respondent. The respondent had defended and taken steps in the proceedings which precluded right to apply for stay under s. OFR. The trial judge did not explicitly determine whether the applicant in Marineserve had 'attorned to' the jurisdiction of the Court. The appellant provided documents and attended a discovery to recover fees and disbursements charged to their client while he was still partner. For more than 2 years, the respondent did nothing to seek the stay that s.of the Arbitrator Act permits. And then he only did so when faced by a motion to produce documents and attend discoveries. The evidence supports these findings. Therefore the remedy of stay is no longer available."

HELD: The applications were dismissed with each defendant to recover separate costs on the appropriate tariff. Although the defendants' pleading may delay but not defeat or prevent the plaintiff from proceeding with its foreclosure action, the defences were so closely connected with the plaintiff's demands that it would be manifestly unjust for the plaintiff to proceed without taking the defendant's defences into consideration.","FIAT: A major hog producer came under creditor protection pursuant to the Companies Creditors' Arrangement Act. In the resulting reorganization two new corporations, each acquired several pig barns formerly owned by the respondent defendant. The acquisitions were financed for the purchasers by Farm Credit Canada (FCC), as primary lender, and National Bank of Canada (National). There may have been other sources of acquisition funding. The present claims for foreclosure should be dismissed or the court should declare that National is estopped from foreclosing or taking possession of secured property until the expiration of the respective three-year periods of barn use restriction by the doctrine of equitable estoppel. HELD: Both applications are dismissed. Although the facts and circumstances in each case are virtually identical, the complexity of them makes it appropriate that each defendant recover separate costs on the appropriate tariff. 1) The present defence to foreclosure is so closely connected with the parties and their creditors that it would be manifestly unjust for the respondent to proceed without taking National's defences into consideration.  2) National's plea can serve to delay, but not defeat, FCC's foreclosure actions, or prevent FCC from proceeding with its foreclosure actions. 3) Although there was no reference in the HTP conditions to mortgagees the Court found that the statements of defence filed by the defendant fail to disclose reasonable defences to the plaintiff's foreclosure proceedings; 4) the claims asserted on statements of defense should be advanced in separate actions; and 5) the statements are otherwise an abuse of the process of this Honourable Court."

The midpoint of the valuations was used to value the respondent's interest in the company at $192,727.00. 3)The petitioner was to receive the balance of the proceeds of the sale of the matrimonial home plus $13,500 to equalize for monies paid to clear off the respondent's writ of execution. 4)Any interest accrued on the sale of the matrimonial home was to be divided equally. 5)The petitioner received her automobile, RRSP and bank account. 6)She was given judgment against the respondent for $135,982.00 with a charge against the matrimonial assets to be registered at Land Titles. 7)$84,000 of the respondent's RRSP was transferred by way of spousal roll over to the petitioner. 8)$12,000 of the settlement proceeds from the wrongful dismissal claim were to be assigned and paid out to the petitioner. 9)All monies were to be paid within six months failing which the Sheriff was to proceed with the judicial sale of such of the assets of the respondent as may be required. 10)Judgment and a charge was ordered against the respondent for the outstanding property taxes in the amount of $15,428.64 which he was to have paid on or before October 1, 1993 by a previous court order. 11)Technology had passed the petitioner by and she had been economically disadvantaged to some extent from the marriage or its breakdown. She had upgraded but had been unable to secure employment.

The respondent was to transfer the monies owing to the mother to the extent of $84,000.  2)The court valued the father's interest in the company at $192,727. It was appropriate to value the assets as of the time of the application as opposed to his interest solely in the NW, NE and SE. 3)The respondent was ordered to pay all monies due to the divorce as against the judgment created herein.  4)The evidence of the father was accepted over the respondent when there was avariance in the appraisal of the assets. The court preferred the evidence of Mr. Protz over the opinion of the Land Titles Office Registrar. 5)The Registrar was directed to register a charge against the father against him as a result of the October 31, 1992 judgment as against him.  6)In addition to the sale proceeds as above, the respondent was given her automobile, her bank account and the bank account.

e_1995canlii4493.txt,"The appellant appealed his conviction for impaired driving, contending the trial judge failed to direct herself in law as to the appropriate burden of proof. Dismissing the appeal, that the trial judge applied the correct test for impairment. The Criminal Code does not prescribe special tests for determining impairment. The trial judge must receive sufficient evidence to satisfy him or herself beyond reasonable doubt that the accused's ability to operate motor vehicle was impaired by alcohol. On Appeal.","The appellant appealed the conviction of driving a motor vehicle while his ability to operate was impaired by alcohol (Criminal Code s.253(a)) was convicted. In issue was whether the trial judge erred in law in misapprehension of evidence and in failing to direct herself to all of the evidence bearing on the relevant issues; in law, it is not an offence to drive a vehicle after having consumed some alcohol as long as it has not impaired the ability to drive. However, a person who drives while his or her ability to do so is impaired by Alcohol is guilty of an offence regardless of whether his ability is greatly or only slightly impaired. Here the appellant had not been drinking and was driving in a straight line when the accident occurred, when the police officer first noticed him walking unsteadily while holding on to the van, when he noticed that the appellant was swaying on his feet, that his speech was slightly slurred, and when he thought that this other car pulled out in front of him when in fact she was making right hand turn off the highway, there was ample evidence for the Crown to prove its case beyond a reasonable doubt. The trial judge applied the correct test for impairment and did not err. On the other hand, the appellant's comments in response to speculations made by the defence counsel during his summation did raise an issue for the trier of fact in each case. It was pertinent to note that in R. v. White, 130 N.S.R. (2d) 145 N.C.A., Justice Chipman under #66 stated: 'The words 'impaired by alcohol' in the Criminal Code raises an issue. would resist any attempt to further define these words, but do reject the proposition that by the use of such plain and simply words, parliament intended to adopt some standard involving a marked departure from the norm or other graduated standards.' The above statements set forth the law to be applied in this case. In the case before us the trial Judge carefully reviewed the evidence relating to the issue of whether the appellant could have been impaired and therefore fell into error; in the trial decision to use the absence of evidence to conclude that he was impaired and in the interpretation of the phrase 'impermissible by alcohol'. When one considers the fact that there was a rear end collision on the 103 Highway; that he had not had a drink since 6:00 p.m. that evening; when one considers that the accident was a matter of fact for the appellant to find the"

The Court instructed the respondent on the procedure for submitting the children's health insurance claims.

9_2008nssc58.txt,"The estate applied to have the court find that a large number of bank shares which had been gratuitously transferred by the deceased to her great niece were being held in trust for the deceased. Following discovery examinations, the great niece, who was the alternative executor appointed under the will, applied to have the executor, the deceased's husband, removed on the basis that his discovery evidence raised grave concerns about his mental capacity to continue to act as executor. Application to remove the executor dismissed; there was no medical evidence submitted in support of the applicant's claim that the executor was not competent to administer the estate and although it was clear from the discovery evidence that he did not have a clear understanding of his duties as executor, given that he was the only beneficiary under the will, he was the only person whose interest was at risk if he failed to properly administer the estate.","The applicant sought an order removing the executor of the will of the deceased testator, who was the alternate executor. The deceased had been diagnosed with paranoid delusions and was unable to perform his duties as executor due to a lack of vision and hearing. The applicant argued that the evidence from the deceased's sister, who had recently been diagnosed as mentally incompetent, raised grave concerns about his mental competency to continue to act as an executor and suggested that he had passed over control of all his affairs, including the executorship, to a third party. The executor's sister was also discovered in connection with this application and the application to remove the present executor was dismissed. The court found that the applicant had not met the onus on him to show cause why the Royal Bank shares held in her and the testator's names as joint tenants should not be treated as assets of the estate or, in the alternative, subject to certain trusts. Regarding the applicant's claim that he is infirm, the court was satisfied he is not entitled to the benefit of this judgment on the basis that he has not met his primary duty to administer the estate. On the equally important second test, the Court was satisfied that the deceased himself was the only person at risk if he failed to properly administer the will. He is the only beneficiary."

Section 7(2) indicates that whenever the legislature confers jurisdiction on the Court of Queen’s Bench, and is silent with respect to an appeal from that Court, an appeal lies from it. The Psychologists Act does not state that there is no appeal from a decision of the Court of Queen’s Bench.","This application concerns the jurisdiction of this Court to hear an appeal from a decision of the Court of Queen's Bench when the latter exercises jurisdiction under statute that is silent as to the right to appeal to this Court. The particular issue is whether ss. 7(2) and 7(3) of The Court of Appeal Act, 2000, which is referred to in s. 5 of The Psychologists Act, 2004, have the same meaning as the words 'psychologists Act', which is the substance of the Act. HELD: The application was dismissed.  1) The psychologists Act does not state that there is no appeal from here on out. The psychologist act does not mention this provision. It states that an appeal lies to the court from hereon from a Queen’s Bench decision.  2) The Psychology Act and its predecessors, dating back to The Interpretation Act, have no effect on the question of whether there is a right of appeal hereon. 3) There is no need to obtain leave for 'interlocutory appeals' (SSR 27 at 41). 4) There was no distinction between professional and amateur statutes and the clear legislative intent proclaimed by s.7(2). 5) There are situations where the legislature has chosen to ignore or omit the law, which in turn leads to confusion. The Court had to determine whether it had jurisdiction to hear a appeal from Queen”s Bench.  6) In this case, the Psychologists act does nothing more than confine the right of appeals to the Court’S Bench and to the Psychologist Act. It is necessary to consider on a case-by-case basis whether the Court had jurisdiction, whether the legislature intended to resolve the issue by considering the general purpose of the legislation, the objectives and purposes of the court, and the law. The psychologist Act does nothing less than provide a general purpose for an appeal to be heard in Queen‘s Bench only. The Psychologist act does, however, provide a specific right to be appealed to the Supreme Court of Canada, pursuant to s. 7 of the Interpretation act, and that does not limit the member’ s.8 right of Appeal to this one. 5) The Court held that s.9(2)(a) is a clear expression of legislative intent establishing the general rule that there would be no appeal to the Queen in any event that confers jurisdiction on Queen“. 6) The conclusion of s. 8 is that there was no ambiguity in"

2006skqb536.txt,"The primary issue is whether the plaintiff, the owner of certain farm equipment consigned for sale at unreserved auction, has indirectly allowed another individual to bid on its behalf, or for its own benefit. The plaintiff corporation agreed to sell its entire inventory of farm equipment at unreserved auction for a guaranteed return of $577,500. The guarantee was given by the defendant corporate auctioneers (Ritchie). The auction was to be conducted by the defendant corporate auctioneers (LeBlanc), a newly formed division of Ritchie. After the auction sale was concluded, the defendant refused to pay the plaintiff the guaranteed price. The defendant declared the guarantee unenforceable under provisions of the 'Contract to Auction' and ultimately charged the plaintiff a commission of 14% on the gross proceeds. The defendant alleges that the plaintiff indirectly allowed another individual to bid on its behalf or for its own benefit. HELD: 1) Clause 3.07 of the Contract to Auction prohibits an owner from bidding directly or indirectly, and from allowing any other person to bid on his behalf. The issue here is whether the plaintiff allowed a family member to bid for the plaintiff's benefit. A family member can be a bona fide purchaser as well as anyone else, but the nature of an unreserved auction dictate that such relationships be disclosed to the public. The essence of the problem and the underlying purpose behind clause 3.07 is to protect bona fide bidders, and to ensure that there be no surreptitious bidding by another for the owner's benefit. 2) The plaintiff allowed Mr. Caruk to bid at the sale for the plaintiff's benefit. It went beyond the passive act of allowing him to bid. It actively facilitated bidding. Mr. Caruk acknowledged he had no money to buy equipment. The plaintiff lent him up to $100,000 for that express purpose. It is immaterial that the loan came from Mr. Tkachuk personally rather than from the plaintiff company he controls and directs. The plaintiff corporation benefited. It has leased all its cattle to Mr. Caruk and the equipment will be of significant value to the fulfillment of that contract. 'For the benefit of the owner' does not have to mean for the exclusive benefit of the owner. 3) The undisclosed arrangement between Mr. Tkatchuk and Mr. Caruk gave the nephew a significant advantage at auction. That advantage was magnified by the fact that he possessed insider information. He knew his uncle had a guaranteed price from Ritchie's for the equipment, because that information had been imparted to him by his uncle. All one needs to add is that Mr. Tkachuk would have profited very significantly had his arrangement with the nephew gone undiscovered. He would have secured a guaranteed price, while procuring the commercial advantages of having his cattle lease fulfilled using equipment the nephew could not otherwise have afforded to purchase. 4) In an area such as this where bona fides are of fundamental importance, and particularly where an owner has the advantage of a guaranteed price from the auctioneer, a deliberate non-disclosure of material information can have an impact every bit as significant as a deliberate and obvious misrepresentation. The plaintiff should have disclosed the arrangement with Mr. Caruk to the defendants. In not doing so, and in allowing and enabling Mr. Caruk to bid at the auction, the plaintiff breached clause 3.07.  5) The provision for a 14% commission on the gross proceeds of sale as a consequence of breach of a fundamental term of the contract is not extravagant or unconscionable and, as the defendants pointed out, they did not elect to exercise their conjunctive right in clause 4.05 to additional amounts as liquidated damages. The concluding paragraph would have entitled them, in addition to all other rights and remedies, to re-sell the property acquired by Mr. Caruk and to retain an amount equal to 20% of the proceeds realized. The provision for a 14% commission on the gross proceeds of sale does not constitute a penalty. 6) The defendants' claim solicitor and client costs pursuant to clause 4.03 of the contract. The defendants are prima facie entitled to costs on a solicitor and client basis, but in the circumstances there are issues whether they should be restricted to one set of costs, and other issues relating to appropriate quantum. The issue of costs will be assessed by this Court pursuant to Rule 565, with the defendants serving and filing a draft bill in the form required for a solicitor and client bill, an affidavit of disbursements, and written argument. The plaintiff shall have 14 days to reply. 7) The plaintiff will have a judgment against the defendants in the amount of $1,316.64 representing the power washing bill wrongfully deducted from the auction sale proceeds payable to the plaintiff. In all other respects, the plaintiff's action is dismissed with costs.","The plaintiff agreed to sell its entire inventory of farm equipment at an unreserved auction. The guarantee was supplied by the defendant Ritchie Bros. Auctioneers. The auction was to be conducted by LeBlanc Auction Services. The plaintiff was first approached to become a potential customer. In the transitional period, the contractual negotiations between the plaintiff and the defendants generated two standard form agreements, a preliminary 'LeBlanc' contract dated December 2003 and a subsequent 'Ritchie Bros.' contract dated March 28 2004. Both parties refused to pay the plaintiff the guaranteed price. After the auction sale was concluded, the defendants declared its guarantee unenforceable under provisions of the Contract to Auction which charged the plaintiff a commission of 14% on the gross proceeds of sale. In this case, the plaintiff did not feel inescapably bound to contract with the defendants. HELD: 1) While a number of issues require exploration in the present case, no one in the legal establishment was entirely sure that the plaintiff, the owner of certain farm equipment consigned for sale at unreserved auctions, had indirectly allowed another individual to bid on its behalf, or for its benefit. 2) There were no explicit discussions between the parties prior to the auction or at the onset of the sale. There was no evidence of any of the above. 3) In any event, the issues arose as a result of the unique nature of 'unreserved auctions', where goods are sold to the highest bidder and the owner is precluded from affecting sale prices either by the use of reserve bids or through involvement, directly or indirectly in the bidding process. 4) The plaintiff, who was intending to remain in the cattle business despite advising the defendants he was retiring from farming, did not have a binding contract with them. The defendants proceeded to advertise the sale extensively, taking out ads in three provinces and in the northern United States, preparing thousands of catalogues for mass distribution, and directly delivering 1,500 posters to farm yards and mail boxes in Melfort and area. Lorne Campbell, the principal shareholder and operating mind of the plaintiff purchased the equipment from the defendant in 2003 and intended to have it auctioned off. He was concerned that if the plaintiff bid indirectly on an owner’s behalf, they would void the contract. He sought damages. 5) The defendants were awarded costs of the auction.  6) In the sum of $577,500 the plaintiff was awarded 14% of the guaranteed sale price. 7) The defendant was awarded $577.5 million. 8)"
7_1997canlii11172.txt,"An application pursuant to s232(4)(c) of the Income Tax Act for a determination of whether the applicants have solicitor-client privilege in respect of 25 documents for which Revenue Canada had sought disclosure. The applicants were husband and wife, their two sons and the companies in which they were principal shareholders and/or directors. The documents related to three separate occasions upon which the applicants sought the advice or assistance of a lawyer in relation to proposed transactions. The documents in issue were originally in the possession of their accounting firm. At issue was the extent to which solicitor-client privilege could be asserted in relation to communications with and documents prepared by third parties. HELD: 1)The privilege claimed in relation to all of the documents relating to the legal advice sought after January 1995 was upheld. 2)The claim was not upheld for copies of a letter setting out the proposal for the 1988 transaction. One letter appeared to be advice offered by the accountants to the applicants.  3)The applicants abandoned their claim for privilege with respect to handwritten notes summarizing share value and fair market value of assets which had been prepared by the accountants other than for the purpose of obtaining legal advice. The claim of privilege was abandoned for a declaration of gift and minutes of a director's meeting in 1991. 4)It has been clearly established in case law that even though a client may look to his/her accountant rather than a solicitor for advice in relation to the law of taxation, the applicants must show the documents were protected by solicitor-client privilege and not merely accountant-client privilege. 5)Although solicitor-client privilege is defined in s232(1)(e) of the ITA, the issue had to be resolved in light of the common law test for privilege. 6)Privilege may extend to accountant communications where the accountant is acting as agent or representative of the client for the purpose of seeking legal advice from a solicitor. Recent cases appear to diverge on the question of the circumstances necessary to found the requisite relationship of agency. 7)The accountants were clearly acting as agents for the applicants for the purpose of obtaining legal advice, as was found in Susan Hosiery. They were at all times acting in a confidential capacity on behalf of and on instructions of the applicants. 8)Solicitor-client privilege extended to items of accounting information obtained for the purpose of receiving legal advice. Notes prepared by the accountant and the interoffice communications summarizing discussions with the solicitor also fell within the scope of privilege.","An application for determination of whether the applicants have solicitor-client privilege in respect of 25 documents for which Revenue Canada has sought disclosure. The corporate applicants were husband, wife, accountant and two adult sons who were principal shareholders and directors of the corporate applicants. The husband and wife had each held company records and prepared documents for the purposes of obtaining legal advice from their accountant. The accountant was acting as representative or agent for the purpose of seeking advice from the applicant. The wife and son were given company records of meetings and sales meetings with the accountant, which they then forwarded to the applicant's solicitor. The applicant abandoned its claim for privilege in regard to certain documents relating to the accountant and instead sought the production of additional documents. HELD: 1)The accountant's role in relation to the subsequent communication with the applicant was clearly representative of the client's legal advice. 2)The accounting firm's privilege extended to include communications between the husband's accountant and the applicants' accountants. 3)Privilege in communicating with third parties was extended to communications with or from the accountant's representatives. The central issue was whether and to what extent solicitor and client privilege applies to documents prepared by third parties in this case, the clients' accountant.  4)The parties were clearly acting as agents for the client. The parties' communications were privileged and extended to the extent that the accountant was privileged from production of documents to be sent to the accounting firm for production. 5)The 'confidentiality' principle articulated in Susan Hosiery gave too narrow a scope to the privilege claimed by the respondents. The Act provides that communications between a lawyer and an accountant are privileged. It is common ground that no litigation was contemplated in the case of this case. The 'client privilege' extends to communications between lawyer and accountant. A lawyer's privilege is defined in s. 232(1)(e) of the Income Tax Act and extends beyond the confines of the communications between an accountant and a solicitor. A solicitor's privilege does not extend to communications to or from third parties unless the documents at issue were prepared in the context and for the sake of anticipated litigation. The privileged communications fell within the scope of communications between client and accountant.  5)Solicitor-client privileged extends to all communications between person and legal adviser. The latter is privileged in that it is the communication between a person and a lawyer that is the real purpose of communicating. The former is privileged and the latter is not privileged. The second privilege extends to include any communications with"

The accused was panhandling outside a store when he and one of two security officers had a verbal confrontation. The accused walked towards the security officer with a butcher knife. The security officer ran to his vehicle and the accused followed him and slashed a tire on the security officer’s vehicle. The attending officer was directed to a yard where he located the accused. A knife was also located in the yard. A videotape from the store was entered as an exhibit and played for the court. The accused was considerably smaller than either of the security officers. The accused testified that he was homeless and had a lot to drink the day of the incident. He indicated that he “blacked out” and was in front of two security officers when he came to. He said that he offered them a cigarette for being in their personal space and one of the men told him that he would punch him out. The accused indicated that he got the knife out of the bag just to show the men that he was bigger than them. He said that he did not intend to stab them. At one point the accused admitted following the security officer to his vehicle and at another point said he did not. The accused said he then tried to get away from the area but was prevented from doing so by a large black vehicle. The accused said he eventually stabbed the vehicle’s tire because it was blocking his way and he went into panic mode. The accused raised the issue of self-defence. HELD: There was no question that the Crown established the offence beyond a reasonable doubt. The court found that the accused initiated the confrontation by walking up to the security officer and getting very close to him. The court found that the Crown witness’s evidence was preferred over the accused’s where it differed, namely the slashing of the vehicle tires. The court accepted the accused’s submission that the security officer told the accused to get out of his face or he would knock him out or something to that effect. The court considered the factors set out in s. 34(2) and concluded that the force or threat faced by the accused due to the size of the security officers and the words used by one of them did not warrant the action taken by the accused. The court offered numerous reasons for the conclusion: the accused initiated the confrontation; the security guard did not touch or further go after the accused; no physical force was used against the accused; and there was no history between the accused and security officer. The accused’s actions were out of proportion to any reasonable response to any threat. The court held that the Crown established, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the facts and circumstances of the case did not give rise to the defence of self-defence. The accused was found guilty as charged.","The accused was charged with assault and threatening to use a weapon contrary to s. 267(a) of the Criminal Code. The evidence presented at trial supported the Crown's argument that the accused initiated the confrontation by walking up to him and, in very close quarters, as the accused himself testified, getting into his personal space. The defence called two security officers to give evidence. The first officer testified that the defendant threatened to apply force to the accused and that the second officer followed the accused to the rear of the building and, as he did not follow the accused, threw a knife at him and struck the vehicle's tire. The second officer testified on cross-examination that the knife was in his hand and he saw the accused run towards the back of the store, which was also in the parking lot, followed all the while by the knife. HELD: The accused was found guilty of assault. The accused's actions were not reasonable in the circumstances and did not constitute lawful protection of himself from any use of force by the defendant.

1998canlii13596.txt,"Administrative Law - Judicial Review - Bias/Institutional BiasAdministrative Law - Medical Care Insurance - Medical Fees - Repayment - AppealProfessions and Occupations - Physicians and Surgeons - Cardiologist - Medical Fees_____ A cardiologist appealed an order made against him by the Joint Medical Professional Review Committee for repayment of  $207,821.03 in medical fees he received over a fifteen month period from the Medical Care Insurance Branch (MCIB). Alleged errors of law included improperly placing the burden of proof on the doctor; failing to take into account all relevant factors including the doctor's statistical analysis; considering it beyond his mandate to provide cost effective services in keeping patients out of the hospital; by using and relying on the knowledge of the Committee in preference to the expert evidence; the orders made concerning various medical services were not reasonably supported by the evidence. The numerous grounds of appeal also included breach of the rules of natural justice by reason of a lack of institutional independence. The application under Part 52 of the Rules of Court for a judicial review was brought to determine whether there was a reasonable apprehension of bias raised by the statutory roles of the Committee and Director or lack of institutional impartiality of the Committee or its lack of independence from the Director or MCIB. _____ HELD: The judicial review application was dismissed. The appeal was allowed and the repayment orders were set aside except for the orders respecting surcharges. 1)Natural justice issues: A reasonable apprehension of bias or institutional bias were not proven. The Committee provided adequate written reasons for its decision. The chairman refuted the allegations that the Committee heard and relied on evidence outside the presence the appellant about which he was not advised. Neither the Director nor the Committee acted in a prosecutorial fashion. Examples included the adjournment granted when the appellant failed to attend and the concession to his request that no cardiologist be placed on the Committee. 2)Errors of law issues: The statistical evidence could be considered by the Committee as a prima facie case. It was then open for it to call on the doctor to rebut the presumed departure from an acceptable pattern of medical practice. This did not shift the overall burden of proof to the doctor nor did it require him to prove his pattern of medical practice was acceptable to the Committee. The Committee did not err in law in misconstruing its mandate or by ignoring the statistical analysis presented by the appellant whose definition of the mandate was much narrower than envisaged by the legislation. It was not agreed that the Committee is not bound to follow the rules of evidence and the proceedings were of an investigative nature. The phrase 'balance of probabilities' means 'more likely than not'. To hold otherwise would make nonsense of administrative law and would violate the rules of natural justice. The distinction between the pattern of the doctor's billings and the pattern of his medical practice was more a matter of semantics than substance. If economics were the only consideration the review process would be a useless exercise and the statistical comparative evidence would be conclusive of the issue. There was no credible evidence that the members of  the Committee misused their expertise and relied on it rather than determining the issues from the evidence presented. 3)The appellant established that for the most part the decision of the Committee was not reasonably supported by but was contrary to the evidence. The MCIB statistics were flawed as a reliable comparison tool and the appellant's adjusted statistics were more reliable even if based on estimates rather than substantiated data. The appellant's medical practice was unique in three respects. He did not have hospital privileges and  had staff and diagnostic equipment equivalent to a cardiac care unit in the hospital; he ordered more diagnostic tests and did more follow up than other cardiologists and had extended office hours. 4)The decision of the Committee was varied to quash all repayment orders except for $14,239.76. The appellant admitted that many of the surcharges had been billed because of his erroneous interpretation of the tariff.  5)Leave was granted to bring the issue of costs back for determination if necessary.","A cardiologist appeals an order by the Joint Medical Professional Review Committee that he repay $207,821.03 in medical fees he received from the Medical Care Insurance Branch. The appeal is brought under s.49.21(1) of the Saskatchewan Medical Care insurance Act. HELD: 1)The Committee was mandated under the Act to determine whether the cardiologist's pattern of medical practice was acceptable to it considering that his billings to medicare were out of line with the billings by the other cardiologists in Saskatchewan. 2)It was necessary to deal with whether there was a reasonable apprehension of bias raised by the Committee's involvement in the hearing conducted by the Director and the Committee in preference to the uncontroverted expert evidence. 3)The Court was restricted to considering only the record of the proceedings."
5_2006nssc353.txt,"The claimant flooring dealer had supplied and installed a large amount of flooring in the defendant's new home. Although the defendant had visited the claimant's store and selected the flooring, the actual purchase was made by the defendant's contractor who did not pay the claimant and had now declared bankruptcy. The adjudicator found that although the three criteria for an unjust enrichment claim had been met, there was no special relationship between the parties and thus, denied the claim. The claimant appealed. Appeal allowed; the absence of a special relationship will not automatically defeat a claim of unjust enrichment; the Small Claims Court has the equitable jurisdiction to determine unjust enrichment claims.","During the construction of Dr. Paul Joseph's home by the respondent company, which contracted for flooring material from the appellant company, the respondent contracted for the material as well as its subcontractors. There was no direct contact between the Appellant and the wife, and the purchasing of all the material was left to the respondent who dealt with the flooring manager. The goods were invoiced to Maritime and delivered to the applicant's home, but the applicant was not paid for the materials until the very last minute. When the goods arrived at the applicant’s home, it became apparent that some of the subcontractors were not paid by the applicant, and so the applicant did not receive compensation. The applicant had not received compensation for the floors. The Small Claims Court has the equitable jurisdiction to determine unjust enrichment. The Court of Appeal allowed the appeal and ordered the payment of the appellant. The trial judge found that the evidence established that there was a “casual arrangement” between the parties, frequently contractual at the outset, which relationship would have made it unjust for the defendant to retain the benefit conferred on him by the plaintiff benefit, be it formally or pursuant to the terms of the contract. This relationship in turn is usually, but not always, marked by two characteristics, firstly knowledge of the benefit on the part of the defendant, and secondly, either an express or implied request by the defendant for the benefit, or acquiescence in its performance. The relationship in this case was not one of convenience, but rather one of trust."
8_2005skca120.txt,"The deceased made a Will appointing her only son, the appellant, as executor. In her Will, she left her home to her son, and divided the rest and residue between her two daughters, the respondents. The deceased transferred title to her house to the names of herself and the appellant jointly. She also transferred some bank deposits totalling approximately $57,000 into the joint names of herself and the appellant and designated him as the person entitled to receive payments under a RRIF totalling approximately $29,000. After her death, the appellant took the position that the bank deposits and the proceeds of the RRIF did not pass under the Will but were given to him for the benefit of the deceased's grandchildren and himself. He paid out about $45,000 to the grandchildren and himself, but nothing to his sisters, the residuary beneficiaries under the Will. The sisters brought action against him, claiming the funds were part of the residue of the estate and obtained a judgment to that effect against him. He appeals against that judgment. HELD: Appeal dismissed with costs.  1) Section 75 of The Queen's Bench Act does not apply to this case. 2) The trial judge carefully reviewed the evidence and the law respecting the presumption of advancement and the presumption of resulting trust. The judge did not mention the possibility of and express trust in favour of the grandchildren. She must have considered whether an express trust existed because that was exactly what the appellant's evidence suggested and exactly what the trial judge rejected in her findings of fact. Since the funds in question were not given to the appellant as a gift, and were not given to him in trust for the grandchildren, they must of necessity revert to the estate. In the case of the bank deposits, the funds would revert to the estate on the basis of a resulting trust. In the case of the RRIF, the funds would revert to the estate on a different basis. Since there was no gift to the appellant, and no trust in favour of the grandchildren, the monies must revert to the estate. 3) While the appellant characterized this issue as being one of mixed law and fact, it was essentially one of fact alone, the issue was what the deceased intended when she transferred the bank deposits and designated the payee of the RRIF. The standard of review in respect of such an issue is palpable and overriding error. The judge made no such error.  4) The appellant asked for relief pursuant to s. 57 of The Trustee Act in respect of the money paid by him to the grandchildren. The appellant says he paid the monies to the grandchildren in the honest belief that he was carrying out the wishes of the deceased. The appellant knew from the outset that his sisters disagreed with his position and intended to take proceedings against him. The appellant's actions in distributing the funds without at least getting directions from the Court were imprudent for a trustee. The circumstances do not justify, on any equitable basis, compelling the innocent respondents to bear the loss to them occasioned by the trustee's imprudence","Respondents: When the respondent mother died in 1999, the appellant took the position that the bank deposits and the proceeds of the RRIF did not pass under the will but were given to him for the benefit of her grandchildren and great-grandchildren. The appellant paid about $45,000 to his sisters as well as obtained a judgment to that effect as well a judgment against the appellant for the amounts they, as the residuary beneficiaries, should have received. This appeal was against that judgment. The standard of review in respect of such an issue is palpable and overriding error and the judge made no such error. There is nothing more than the lack of consideration and the fact that the appellant knew from the outset that the respondents disagreed with the position taken by him and intended to take proceedings against him. The trial judge did not err in law in finding that the respondent intended the funds in question to go to the appellant and his sisters.

2_2007nssc235.txt,"The parties, divorced, had children, aged 23, 19, and 14 years, respectively. The wife applied to vary the Corollary Relief Judgment (CRJ) following the termination of spousal support. The termination had occurred pursuant to the terms of the CRJ which provided that support would terminate either twelve months after her graduation from the M.B.A. program in which she was enrolled, six months after she withdrew from the program, or when she found employment. The wife had graduated from the program later than expected and a further six months after her course work was completed. Both parties applied to vary child support. The oldest child had completed his first university degree and was currently attending law school. Pursuant to the father's employment, until the completion of their first degree, the children qualified for a program which reimbursed the father for 75 per cent of the child's educational expenses. The CRJ had provided that the father's responsibility to pay all of the oldest child's educational expenses was conditional upon compliance and eligibility for the education reimbursement policies. The middle child was attending university and lived in the wife's home over the summer months. Spousal support application denied; given the family history of an emphasis on education and the oldest child's career plans and apparent aptitudes, he remained a child of the marriage; the father is to pay $10,000 per year directly to the oldest child for the next two years. The father will pay 25 per cent of the core university costs which are not covered by the plan for the middle child as well as the difference in the Table amount of support for two children versus one child; the father shall pay the Table amount of support for one child to the wife for the youngest child as well as that child's expenses for private school; the wife will be responsible for any extra-curricular activities or tutoring outside the private school; the youngest child will be entitled to the same post-secondary benefits in the same fashion as the two older children; the CRJ is amended to provide that the two oldest children are in the joint care of their parents and will not include any other reference to custody or access; the husband is entitled to specified block access with the youngest child; if flight arrangements are made for this child and she does not fly (and there is no medical reason confirmed in writing by a doctor for that failure), the husband's block access shall be expanded for one week at the next access period and the cost of any penalty from the missed flight will be deducted dollar for dollar from the child support payable by the husband.","The parties brought a variation application under the 1985 Divorce Act. Each brought a different order of support, primarily related to the issues of spousal support, child support and access. The Corollary Relief Judgment provided that the husband would pay $3,100 per month in monthly child support until the wife graduated from the M.B.A. program, or until the Wife obtains employment. The requirement for the husband to pay William's educational expenses was conditional upon the wife having finished her course work in December 2005 (six months before the order ended) yet did not graduate until October 2006. The husband was unaware of the reason why his support order was terminated prior to this date. The evidence showed that all of the children's living expenses were being met, partly due to the husband's generous support in the fall of 2003 when he started paying more. The wife was not seeking employment and the parties had made a series of cross-applications regarding child support. The oldest child, who was 23 years old, had been the primary supportee for the past few years. The mother's position in the family was that she was responsible for her own choices and there was no evidence of her seeking employment with respect to the father's support. She had completed her coursework at the time of the order and was working part-time and living with her children. The father indicated that he would cover the balance of the cost from his own pocket and specifically, would designate rent from his home in South Africa to cover off my educational costs. The application to vary child support was dismissed. There was no reason for the mother not to be employed or actively seeking employment."
8_2013skqb403.txt,"HELD: The application was dismissed. With respect to the issues, the Court found: 1) that the board had not relied upon the clause in the Policy Statement but on the evidence before it. It was not necessary to decide then whether the Policy Statement was ultra vires; 2) that the board’s interpretation that the Act granted discretion to the board to refuse to reimburse a specific medical treatment was reasonable; 3) that the board’s conclusion was reasonable. The scientific studies did not definitively stated that medical marijuana was effective. In some situations where a patient’s only recourse would to be to use a non-clinically approved drug whose safety and efficacy was still questioned, a determination that the medical aid was not necessary or required might be unreasonable, but not in this case where the applicant declined to try Sativex; and 4) that there was no evidence that the board based its decision on irrelevant considerations such as the potential political ramifications of paying for medical marijuana.","HELD: The application was dismissed. The Board's decision to deny reimbursement was reasonable and within the range of possible, acceptable outcomes. There was no evidence that the Board erred in determining that medical marijuana was not necessary or required for the pain relief sought by the applicant or that it was improperly fettered its discretion by relying on the submissions of the Board's medical consultant and medical department. Even if Policy Statement was ultra vires, it does not decide this matter. It is not necessary to decide whether Policy Statement 5 is ultra viring. 1) The Board found that it had the power to create POL 10/2011 as an exercise of the exclusive jurisdiction granted to it under s. 22(1) of the Act. On the face of its reasons, the Board denied reimbursement specifically because medical marijuana is potentially unsafe and unproven. 2) The board did not rely on policy statement 5 or even mention it in its decision. Rather, it based its decision on the evidence before it. It does not need to decide if Policy 5 was ultra-vires. 3) There is nothing in the language of that section that suggests the Board did not have the power or authority to determine whether medical marijuana should be reimbursed. The board's decision is reasonable and reasonable. It falls within a reasonable range of outcomes. 4) It is reasonable that the benefits and safety of medical marijuana have not been established to the point that it is 'necessary or required' under the terms of s. 106(1)(a). In such a case, a determination that the medical aid is not 'necessary' or'required' is reasonable but this is not the case here. 5) The applicant takes the position that the board has denied reimbursement for medication that had worked for him for 10 years and that had been recommended by an expert doctor. The use of the word'shall' in s. 11(1), requires the Board to provide medical aid to injured employees. The applicant argues that the prohibition on the reimbursement of medical marihuana is unconstitutional. The respondent states that the decision to refuse reimbursement is based on irrelevant considerations in effect, misconceived perception of the potential political consequences of paying for medical marijuana."
e_2009skpc9.txt,"The plaintiff claims against the defendant for water damage sustained to their belongings while in transit from Edmonton to Nipawin in a one ton, 17 foot cube van owned by the defendants. The issues are whether the plaintiffs are precluded from recovery against the defendant by virtue of the contractual term acknowledging the equipment to be water resistant only as well as the posted disclaimers to this effect. HELD: The plaintiff shall have judgment for $250 plus costs of issuing the claim and service. 1) Notwithstanding that the plaintiff signed the rental contract acknowledging that the equipment was not waterproof and only water resistant, it appears from the last three sentences of the inspection report that water was entering at the corners of the door by virtue of the door not sitting flat at the corners. This defect would have permitted excess water to enter prior to being cleaned. Perfection could not be expected since it was acknowledged that the rental unit was not waterproof and some seepage may be expected even after the door had been fixed. Nonetheless, the sealing problem would have taken it beyond the acknowledgment of the unit being only water resistant. 2) The plaintiff acknowledges that the truck remained parked outside in heavy rainfall for two days and nights prior to being unloaded. This exacerbated the scope of the damage claimed since the water would have continued to seep in unabated for roughly six times as long as the trip itself took. The Court concludes that the defendant is only 20% responsible for the damages sustained to the plaintiff's possessions.","The Plaintiffs claim $6,700.77 against the Defendant for water damage sustained while in transit from Edmonton to Nipawin, Saskatchewan in a one ton, 17 foot cube van owned by the Defendant.

HELD: 1) Whether the Plaintiffs are precluded from recovery by virtue of the contractual term acknowledging the equipment was water resistant only as well as the posted disclaimer.  2) Quantum of damages and mitigation. The defendant was found to be only 20% responsible for the damages sustained to the plaintiffs' possessions in all the circumstances. In all, the defendant was only 20%. Quantum of damage and mitigation were not considered. The plaintiff was awarded costs of the claim totalling $250,000.  3) The court reviewed the various alleged breaches of the equipment and found that even if the goods were transported in heavy rain conditions, the plaintiffs were nonetheless the authors of their own misfortune by permitting the loaded truck to sit for an additional 2 days after reaching their destination in steady rain prior to its unloading."

In so doing, it asked that its solicitor, Mr. Hesje, be appointed as selling officer to conduct the sale and report to the Court.

He informed the court that some members of our Court have allowed this to be done, others have declined. In the court's respectful view, it is not appropriate for the Court to appoint, as selling officer, the solicitor for the applicant creditor. There are obvious difficulties with conflict of interest.

e_2016skpc157.txt,"HELD: The court found with respect to the following issues: 1) it would not permit the defence to argue the s. 8 violation at the conclusion of the trial because it had not mentioned it in its Charter notice. The Crown disclosed the video-taped interaction between the officer and the accused to the defence at the outset and it was clearly pertinent to the issue of reasonable suspicion, but the defence failed to raise it; and 2) there were two periods of delay and the court was satisfied that the 77 minutes between arrival at the station and the taking of the second sample was satisfactorily explained. However, the court found that first period of 35 minutes between the arrest to the time of departure was not satisfactorily explained. The officer did not act expeditiously and the delay may have prejudiced the accused because when, as here, the readings are slightly above the legal limit, the tests need to be taken as soon as practicable to ensure that the accused’s blood alcohol content at the time of driving is determined accurately. The Crown was not entitled to rely on the presumption in s. 259(1)(c) of the Code.","HELD: The accused was found guilty of driving while her ability to do so was impaired contrary to s. 255(1) and s. 253(1)(a) of the Criminal Code and having consumed alcohol in such a quantity that the concentration of alcohol in her blood exceeded.08 contrary to the s.255(1(a)) and contrary to ss.253(2)(b). The accused had no difficulty walking or talking and there was no evidence of her drinking prior to the demand. The police officer essentially decided that he had the reasonable suspicion to make the demand, he came to that conclusion without taking the time to properly ascertain the indicia of impairment. Within 45 seconds of coming upon the accused, he made the demand and she provided suitable sample. The accused did not display any other signs or indicies of impairment and the breath tests were not taken as soon as practicable. The officer's explanation for not being able to leave the scene till some thirty-five minutes after he arrested the accused was not satisfactory. The delay may have prejudiced the accused. The need to take the tests as soon (as practicable) is a very important and must be applied with reason. The reasonable suspicion standard may be law, but it requires something more than mere hunch. The Crown failed to demonstrate that the breath test results were relevant to the case. The fact that the accused had two shots and had no opportunity to observe her and, therefore, it was necessary to get the accused to the breathalyzer room as quickly as practicable was not sufficient to ensure accurate breath tests."
d_2004nssf15.txt,"The parties were married for 10 years. Contrary to the wording of their separation agreement, the husband argued that they had agreed that spousal support would only be payable for one year as the wife needed extra income from a secure source in order to obtain a mortgage on a new home.

Spousal support to continue at the rate set out in the separation agreement for a period of fifteen months from the date of the decision at which time all support shall terminate, unless, prior to the termination date, the wife commences an application which results in her showing cause why spousal support should continue; the husband has complied with his obligations with respect to the provision of an automobile. The wife's financial means and needs required support, the husband had made an agreement to provide such support and the evidence did not support a conclusion that it was agreed to be for only one year. Although the wife did not establish any disadvantage from the marriage, there were disadvantages relating to its breakdown and her lifestyle deteriorated as result of the marriage ending.","The parties were married for ten years and had entered into a Separation Agreement in 2001. They have lived separate and apart for more than a year. The husband petitioned for divorce in June 2003. The wife, who had received one-half of the proceeds of the sale of the matrimonial home, filed an Answer in September 2003. She alleged that the husband failed to provide her with an automobile for the past year. HELD: 1)Spousal support was granted retroactive to the date the husband ceased paying it (April 2004). The wife's circumstances did not support the continuation of the agreement. 2)There were disadvantages related to the husband's decision to allow her to purchase an automobile. However, the Court found that the wife was entitled to support at separation and that such entitlement continued. Her financial needs and needs did not require it. The obligation to pay spousal supported was agreed to be for only 1 year. 3)The wife was employed as a waitress. Her employment prior to marriage provided her with relatively the same income. She admitted that there may have been more hours available to her than she actually worked. She said some medical problems but there was no evidence to substantiate them or indicate how they would prevent her from working full time. 4)The husband acknowledged that he advanced money to the wife during the course of the marriage. She argued that he should have paid more. She also alleged that he encouraged her to work longer hours and that he failed to protect any claim she had on her husband's business ventures. 5)The parties agreed the wife should have spousa support for an indefinite period. She was awarded retroactive payment of $1,000 for 15 months. The court found that it was not necessary to provide support retroactively, given the uncertainty over the length of the support period. Given the wife's age, her financial situation clearly demonstrated her need for such support to continue."

4_2013skqb207.txt,"The issue to be determined was whether the parties' children should remain in La Ronge or be relocated to live with the respondent in Melville on an interim basis. The parties were in a common law relationship and had two children, aged 9 and 12. After separation, the children resided with their mother, the respondent, in La Ronge and they had access with the petitioner on the weekends. In January 2011, the parties agreed to a weekly co-parenting arrangement. In April 2013 the petitioner was advised by the respondent that she and the children had moved to Melville. Up until that point the child had always resided in the La Ronge area and attended only one school. HELD: The Court found the co-parenting arrangement to be the de facto parenting arrangement and that there was no risk to the children with either parent. The Court ordered that the parties were joint custodians of the children and that preservation of the status quo was in their best interests. The Court ordered that the children primarily reside in La Ronge with the petitioner and attend school there. The Court also ordered specified access for the respondent.","FIAT: Further to the hearing on May 7, 2013, the issue is whether the children are to be relocated from La Ronge to live with the respondent. The parties commenced a common law relationship in 2000 and are two children of the relationship, namely: Justin and Sean. The initial parenting arrangement was that the children resided with the petitioner and with the mother. The mother had sold her home in March 2013 and the parties agreed to a verbal co-parenting arrangement that was in place until March 2013. The respondent unilaterally relocated the children in April 2013. This arrangement was a de facto co- parenting arrangement between the parties. There was no risk for the children. The preservation of the status quo is in the best interests of the two boys. Therefore, the parties are to reside in La Ronenge or Air Ronge. HELD: 1)The interim order was made in the amount of $1500 payable within 10 days from the date of this judgment.  2)The parties were to be joint custodial parents for the two young boys. The primary residence was with the wife. She was entitled to interim access every second weekend. 3)The non-primary care parent was to be entitled to access every weekday commencing May 31, 2013 to Sunday, June 2, 2013. 4)On the evidence the parties were joint custodians for the 2 boys who resided in the petitioner's residence. The Court was satisfied that the parties had verbal co/parenting arrangements with the children rotating weekly between the parents. This was a consensual arrangement which was not only voluntary but also supported by the evidence. The children were to spend at least part of their time in the respondent's home."

Counsel were to explore the possibility of conducting exchanges through the supervised exchange program. Contempt must be proven beyond a reasonable doubt.

The father applied to have the mother cited for contempt for denial of access. By fiat of October 4, 2002, Matheson J. transferred custody to the father and directed the mother to give viva voce evidence in response to the allegation of contempt. The mother had filed an affidavit in responseto the father's motion. HELD: The father was to have access for the weekend of August 16 to August 19, for the week of August 26 to August 30, and for the four-week supervised exchange program. Costs will remain in the cause. 1) The mother was to cooperate with the father in obtaining access. She was to file a certificate of completion within sixty days. 2) The father's application was dismissed but without prejudice to any subsequent reliance on these events in the event of a future application for contempt.  3) Although both parents appeared to have a genuine desire and intent to express genuine affection and appreciation for the child, it was not necessarily the child who needed to be investigated, but the parents. These parents demonstrate little understanding of the effects of conflict on the child. The child is merely reacting to the unpleasant behaviour of his two primary parents. Many parents are often requested to share transportation of child for access when there is geographical separation. No four-year-old enjoys confinement in vehicle and if the father is responsible for all of the transportation he may be perceived as the villain. Children of this age do not switch gears easily. It can be assisted by having the child draw pictures for Dad, helping him pack his favourite articles and giving the child easily understandable information about when he is returning. It was admitted by the mother that she sent nothing when he went. She is required to complete the parent education program and file a Certificate of completion."
d_2017skqb42.txt,"HELD: The action was allowed. The defendants had defamed the plaintiff and he was entitled to damages in the amount of $100,000. The court found the following with respect to each issue: 1) it would substitute Postmedia as a defendant pursuant to Queen’s Bench rule 3-84(2) as it was the successor to Canwest and was aware of the plaintiff’s claim when it purchased the Star Phoenix and it would not be prejudiced. It would not deprive Postmedia of a defence under s. 5 of The Limitations Act because the articles remained on Postmedia’s websites and were republished whenever they were viewed or downloaded; 2) after reviewing each of the articles and assessing the words complained of, it found that the words constituted defamation; 3) all of the defendants were found to be joint tortfeasors with Purdy because they participated in the publication of a libel and were jointly and severally liable in defamation to the plaintiff; and 3) an appropriate award for general damages was $50,000. The court allowed the claim for aggravated damages as the defendants were found to be motivated by actual or express malice because Purdy did not simply report the jury’s verdict in her articles but indicated that she believed that the jury had not reached the proper verdict in the trial. She deliberately chose to report the stories of people who had made complaints about the surgical care provided to them by the plaintiff without verifying it or seeking comment from the plaintiff. As she was acting in the course of her employment, Purdy’s malice was attributed to all the defendants. The plaintiff was awarded $50,000 in aggravated damages.","HELD: The court found that the statements of claim issued by the plaintiff was not in breach of the contract between the plaintiff and the defendants. The court also found that, although the plaintiff had had a previous tubal ligation, the defendant had not been negligent and was entitled to an injunction to compel the defendants to remove certain content from their control. The plaintiff and her children both suffered brain damage and had to be amputated. The articles and their contents caused the defendant serious damage to his reputation and caused him a bad reputation. He voluntarily stopped performing laparoscopic surgeries and decided to take the opportunity to take some time off to assuage negative public opinion in the United States. The article was published in two newspapers in different jurisdictions. In the first, the doctor was referred to as the owner of the Star Phoenix newspaper. He was aware that the article entitled 'botched surgery' referred to in the article, that the patient's bowel had been'slit open', that the surgery was performed in a grossly negligent, malicious, and highhanded manner calculated to ignore the rights and objections and complaints of the plaintiff. The doctor was not aware that he was being sued by the defendants and felt that, while he might have suffered some prejudice as a result of the articles, they were not the only ones who had been published. The defendant was not seeking damages and the plaintiffs were awarded damages."
e_2014skqb344.txt,"The court gave leave to counsel for the plaintiff to file an amended draft order nisi. It made the following recommendations regarding the draft order: 1) the sale should be held under the direction of a solicitor other than the plaintiff’s solicitor; 2) that relying upon a partial appraisal and in the absence of information on the condition of the property, setting the reserve bid at $100,000 might not reflect the best price. Fairness demanded the reserve bid be set at $125,000 but the court set the bid at $115,000. If the property could not be sold at that price, the plaintiff was given leave to apply to the court for a lower reserve bid; and 3) Queen’s Bench rule 10-47(2) required that purchase monies are to be paid into court to the credit of the cause to be applied as directed by the court, including costs. Only after an application and service upon the defendant and after the court had assessed solicitor client costs could monies be disbursed to the plaintiff. Monies owed under the mortgage must be set out by the court on application. All of these matters may be addressed in one final proceeding, in the application to confirm the sale, if the judicial sale proved successful.","The plaintiff applied for an order nisi for judicial sale of the property owned by the defendants. The Limitation of Civil Rights Act does not preclude the plaintiff from suing on the covenant because this is not a purchase-money mortgage. However, a judicial sale is required so that the plaintiff may apply to have the amount of deficiency set by the court. Otherwise, as provided by s. of the LCRA, foreclosure of the mortgage operates as full satisfaction of that debt. HELD: The application to confirm the sale must be brought by notice of application. The draft order sets out the proposal for disbursing the purchase monies. The proposed selling officer ought not to be the plaintiff's own counsel. 1) The setting of the reserve bid in a judicial sales is an exercise of judicial discretion. The only information before the court as to the value of this mortgaged land is a partial appraisal. From this partial appraisal and with no information on the condition of the premises, setting the reserve bid at $100,000 may not reflect the best possible price that can be attained. 2) Counsel for the plaintiff has leave to file an amended draft order for nisi para judicial sale. This draft order incorporates the rulings herein and the corresponding form 10-47(2) of the Queen's Bench Rules. It would be more fair to set the reserve Bid at an amount closer to $125,000. If the mortgaged lands cannot be sold at that amount, the plaintiff had leave to return the matter to court to seek a lower reserve bid, based upon evidence to support its position. It is appropriate that assess solicitor-client costs. 3) In the circumstances, the application to be brought in a timely manner is a stage in the foreclosure proceeding to not only seek confirmation of the sale, but also to seek the court's direction on the payment of the purchase price, including costs. 4) All outstanding matters ought to be addressed in one final proceeding."

The creditor objected that the applicant had plenty of opportunity over the years to pay and drew attention to prior allegations of mismanagement or redirection of funds which should have been allocated to the payment of interest. HELD: The payment which should have been paid in November was to be paid within 7 days. The remaining payments set out in the schedule will commence January 2001 with the change in rate of interest from that provided under the Interest Act to one equivalent to pre-judgment interest. A 5 day grace period was allowed after which the respondent was allowed to proceed immediately with enforcement by execution, garnishment or any means it deems appropriate.

The remaining payments set out in the schedule will follow thereafter continuing with January 1, 2001. An officer of the applicant swore that the officers were prepared to infuse $100,000 into the company's treasury if need be to make up any shortfall from funds needed by the company to pay the instalmentments.

8_2014skqb299.txt,"HELD: The application was dismissed. The court held that the standard of review of the arbitrator’s decision was one of reasonableness. Section 25 of The Trade Union Act states that the conclusions of arbitrators are final and therefore the court noted they should not be interfered with lightly. Further, the court noted that the decision of the arbitrator was not of significant importance to the general public. The court reviewed the history of collective bargaining at the university and found that tenure was not dependent on the president’s personal recommendation in the past. The court found that the arbitrator’s reasoning was transparent and intelligible throughout. To include the word tenure in the definition of appointment or promotion was not the only conclusion that could be drawn. The arbitrator’s decision was within the range of acceptable conclusions and was reasonable.","The parties disagreed on the standard of review to be applied to the arbitrator's interpretation of s. 51 of the Act. The University's position was that the president's personal recommendation to the board was not required, and the Board was not obliged to follow his recommendation. The Arbitrator erred in misapplying the principles and tools of statutory interpretation in the awarding of tenure. HELD: The dispute was resolved in favour of the president and the board of governors. The parties agreed to a lengthy statement of facts and the admissibility of number of documents.  1) An award of tenure is neither an appointment nor promotion as contemplated by the Act nor is it a promotion within the meaning of the terms of the Agreement. The president must be taken to have acted through the tenure committee and the appeal committee and their actions are taken as his.  2) The interpretation by the Arbitrator was that an award on tenure was neither an appointed nor promotion under the Act, nor was it a appointment or promotion as considered by the Board. It was more reasonable to conclude that it was exercised within parameters set by the president in accordance with the Act and therefore within the Board's discretion. 3) Although the president may appoint a person to a permanent position on the academic staff of the University, the Board has not been bound by his recommendation as to tenure. The decision of the Board is final and there shall be no appeal within the University of Saskatchewan. 4) The legislature has, by default or design, chosen not to restrict the Board’s ability to set up the appropriate process and to award tenure itself. The court relied on the law from Dunsmuir v. New Brunswick, [2008] S.C.R. 190. 5) The parties’ position was based on the assumption that the President had the final say on whether a person should be given tenure, whether it was an appointment or a promotion, and whether the interpretation of sec. 51. 2. The latter was supported by the fact that the interpretation was consistent with those authorities discussed in the dissenting opinion."
9_2005skca89.txt,"This appeal arises from proceedings under The Family Property Act. The couple had lived together for several years. She sought judgment distributing their property. The property included a house in Vancouver, which he had acquired some years earlier with the financial assistance of his parents. The trial judge found that the respondent had acquired the house after the commencement of the spousal relationship and then went to hold that the petitioner was entitled to an equal share of its value with no reduction owing to the gifts or loans from his parents. The respondent appealed. HELD: Appeal allowed by the majority. Lane J.A. wrote in dissent. Majority: 1) The Vancouver property was acquired after commencement of the spousal relationship. The value of the property did not qualify for exemption under s. 23(1)(a) of the Act. There are a number of facts that merit emphasis. The respondent received $125,000 from his mother before the spousal relationship started. He still had that amount on hand when the relationship commenced. He used the money as a down payment on the purchase of the Vancouver house shortly after the relationship commenced. By establishing these facts, the respondent established the requisite conditions for the grant of an exemption of the value of the Vancouver property to the extent of the $125,000. 2) The trial judge erred in declining to take into account the loans of $100,000 the appellant received from each of his parents for the purpose of purchasing the Vancouver property. There was insufficient evidence before the trial judge to enable him to find that the mortgage debts were statute-barred and he did not make a firm finding on this point. The trial judge's finding that the respondent will not have to repay the loans was incomplete. He did not assess the loans in light of s. 21(3)(e) of the Act. On the whole of the circumstances concerning the Vancouver property and the length of the spousal relationship, there is no tenable basis for not giving effect to s. 21(3)(e) of the Act and the contributions made by the respondent's parents on his behalf to the acquisition of the property. The petitioner is entitled to share in the build up of the equity in consequence of the pay-down of the mortgage. Minority: 1) The Vancouver home ought to be distributed in accordance with s. 22 of the Act. The gift of $125,000 was made by the respondent's mother with the full knowledge that the parties were living together. In this case, the contribution by a third party on behalf of a spouse to the acquisition of family property is one of the usual factors outlined in s. 21 of the Act and it would be inequitable to exempt the gift from distribution. 2) The trial judge did not err in failing to deduct from the family property the loans given by the appellant's parents. He made a finding the loans were statute-barred. The trial judge clearly considered the legislation and his interpretation of the legislation was not challenged by the respondent. He also made the finding the loans would likely never be repaid. He simply used less than precise language.","This appeal stems from proceedings under The Family Property Act, initiated by Deborah Ruskin, a nurse, against Leith Dewar, a doctor. The two lived together for several years and Ruskin sought judgment distributing their property or its value equally between them. The trial judge held that the parties had become'spouses' within the meaning of the Act in early June 1994 and then held that Ms. Ruskin was entitled to an equal share of its value with no reduction owing to the gift or loans. With that appeal, Dr. Dewar appealed. HELD: Appeal allowed.  1) This appeal is the equivalent of Mitchell v. Mitchell (1992), 91 S.R. 113 and 114 (Sask. C.A.). The trial court erred in finding that the value of the Vancouver property was not exempt from distribution because it was acquired after the commencement of spousal relationship, not before. 2) There are number of facts that merit an exemption for equalization. It has now been approximately 9 years. While the appellant's income when he purchased the home was perhaps unexceptional, he has had substantial income for the last number of years and made no payments.  3) The appeal raises the following questions: Did the trial judge err in awarding the respondent an equal portion of the value in Regina? No. 1) The trial Judge did not err in concluding that the values of the house and its value fell to be exempt from distributions because the property had been acquired prior to the spousals relationship. It follows that the property did not qualify for exemption under s. 23(1)(a). 4) The parties cohabited with one another continuously for two years. This relationship was governed by s. 21 and 23 of the act. Harker, 2005 SCC 25 (SK CA), 172 Sask. R. 201(Sask.) 1) It would be unfair and inequitable to allow the respondent's application to have the house distributed equally between the parties. The respondent, faced on appeal with the possibility the judge may have misapplied these sections, contended the matter was governed not by s21 and 23 but by section 22. The significance of this case is that the fact as found is sufficient in law to render the relationship between the spouses spousally effective as of late June 1994 as contemplated by the definition of'spouse in section 23. This is why say the trial Judge cannot be said to have erred. He turned first to the exemptions provided for by s23. More"

The mother's three older children had been apprehended with two other older children placed with a person of sufficient interest and the third child was made a permanent ward of the Ministry. The Minister argued that given the extensive past history of the three older children, the Minister properly apprehended the infant and the permanency planning committee was of the opinion that there was no use putting off the inevitable permanent order for the child. The mother and the child's father had separated with the father supporting the mother having the child returned to her care and the father having access to the child.

The child shall be returned to the mother who is a person who has a right of custody of the child pursuant to s. 36(3) of the Child and Family Services Act. This shall be done on a transitional basis as determined by the Ministry with the child to be completely returned to the mother within 30 days of this order. There was no evidence presented at trial regarding attempts by the Ministry to pursue any less intrusive alternatives and instead proceeded directly to the most severe position being a permanent order. The evidence did not justify the Ministry's position.","The Ministry brings an application for a permanent order for the child, born April 19, 2010, pursuant to s. 37 of The Child and Family Services Act. The biological parents, M.S. and P.K., oppose the application and submit the child should be returned to the mother. HELD: 1) The child is in need of protection pursuant to ss. 37(1) and s. 11 of the Act.  2) The burden is on the Ministry to establish its case on the balance of probabilities being the civil burden of proof. 3) The children have been placed into the temporary custody of the Minister, and the parents wish to have the children returned to them, they must make efforts to improve or remove the conditions or circumstances in the home which have resulted in the children being taken from the parents. 4) Two former child protection workers have been granted status as persons of sufficient interest pursuant to sec. 23 of The Act. They were present throughout the course of this trial but declined the opportunity to take any active part in the proceedings."
1993canlii3174.txt,"This was an appeal from a decision varying the appellant's maintenance downwards. The parties had a traditional marriage, with the wife remaining at home and caring for their three children. Upon separation, they entered into a settlement agreement whereby maintenance was set al. $2000 monthly while the appellant remained in the matrimonial home. The agreement stipulated that the settlement was a full and final settlement on all corollary matters between the parties. The respondent subsequently remarried, underwent some difficult financial times and made the application which was the subject of this appeal. The appellant contended the terms of the agreement were final. Per Jones, J.A. and Chipman, J.A. (concurring for separate reasons), allowing the appeal and setting aside the lower court order, that while courts have ultimate jurisdiction in the matter of support, settlement agreements must be respected. There is no difference between an agreement which provides for long term maintenance and one that does not contain such a provision. The effect is to permanently settle the issue in both cases. To review the agreement, particularly after the lapse of a substantial period of time, could lead to grave injustices to one or both parties. Per Hallett, J.A., (dissenting), dismissing the appeal, that a settlement agreement which provides for periodic support payments indefinitely is very different than one which contains provisions for termination of support after a specified period. The causal connection test established in Pelech v. Pelech (1987), 38 D.L.R. (4th) 641, should not apply to payors of periodic support for an indefinite period. Such agreements do not have the degree of finality that was effected by the settlement agreement under consideration in the Pelech decision.","This was an appeal from a decision in Hall, L.J.S.C. reducing the appellant's support from $2,000 to $1200 per month. HELD: The appeal was allowed without costs. 1)While there had been a radical change in the wife's circumstances, there was no link between the change in circumstances and the marriage. The appellant recognized her obligation to contribute to her own support and would continue to find employment. 2)Plelech does not deprive the courts of ultimate jurisdiction in the matter of support. Where the parties have negotiated their own agreement, freely and on the advice of independent legal counsel, as to how their financial affairs should be settled on the breakdown of their marriage, there is no connection between the new and former marriage. 3)The principles in Pelech should not be confused with those in Richardson v. Richardson, which set out the criteria for granting variation of spousal support as developed by the Pylech report. Each case must be decided on its own facts. 4)The evidence of the accountant who prepared the 1991 income tax returns supported the argument that substantial variations in the income of the husband self-employed business man could occur. The trial judge did not refer to this significant evidence in his reasons but simply referred to a projected annual income of approximately $32,000. 5)There was truly finality to the financial relationship between the parties. The principles enunciated in Peleech were not intended to be confined to cases where the court could intervene and grant variation if necessary."
c_2016skqb293.txt,"HELD: The appeal was granted on the basis of the first two grounds as well as others. The court quashed the tribunal’s decision and reinstated the appellant’s hospital privileges. The court reviewed the transcript of the tribunal’s hearing and its written decision. With regard to the first two issues, it found that the tribunal had erred in law in the following ways: 1) by failing to conduct a de novo hearing as required. It did not refer to the expert opinion submitted by the appellant as new evidence at the hearing; and 2) by failing to explain its decision. It did not refer to the new evidence nor did it state how it had reconciled the conflicting expert opinion evidence offered by the appellant and the respondent. It merely accepted the evidence of the SMO’s experts.",HELD: The appeal was granted. The decision of the Practitioner Staff Appeals Tribunal was reviewed and the errors that led to the granting of a remedy to the appellant were in accord with s. 45(3) of the Act. The Tribunal did not err in any respects and the appellant's position was accepted by the Tribunal as being in accordwith that of the Tribunal. There would be no reason for the Tribunal to have the same powers as a commission under the Public Inquiries Act if it was not a de novo proceeding.
2_2007skqb378.txt,"The outstanding issue is child support, past and future. The dispute largely centered on what monies were owed from the past. Central to this was the determination of the respondent's income. HELD: 1) The respondent is a farmer. His income tax returns for the years 2004, 2005 and 2006 have been filed, but certain adjustments must be made. The purpose of the capital cost allowance is to provide money to purchase replacement equipment. However, not all of the money is needed and is not used for that purpose. It is that unused portion which should be allocated as part of the respondent's income. In this case, 40% of the allowance should be treated as income for the purpose of calculating child support. The personal portion of the utility costs should be included as part of his income, an appropriate percentage is 25%. An amount of the legal and accounting costs should be attributed to the respondent personally and added to his income, in 2004 $1,000 is added, in 2005 $5,000 is added and in 2006 $1,000 is added. The respondent has taken advantage of the optional inventory adjustment and that must be factored back into his income using the methodology set out in Tamke v. Tamke, 2001 SKQB 528. As the respondent's income has undergone serious fluctuation over the years, it is therefore appropriate that his income for calculating child support be based on the average of his income in the years 2004 and 2005. 2) The respondent will not have to pay half of the cost of Stacey joining a school trip to Europe. This is because Stacey paid half of the cost herself and because the respondent was asked to contribute at the time but refused. The petitioner knew the respondent had refused to contribute and, when she elected to pay the balance, she did so unilaterally. It would be inappropriate to compel the respondent to contribute now. 3) The school fees paid by the petitioner are not extraordinary and should be encompassed in the basis child support. The health costs in the form of orthodontic treatments are extraordinary and the parties shall contribute equally as their incomes are presently comparable. 3) On five occasions the respondent failed to attend at the agreed meeting spot with the result that the petitioner had to make the entire trip to deliver the children to the respondent so he could exercise access. She will be compensated for the actual lost wages and fuel costs that she incurred on the respondent's behalf, but not for costs she would have incurred in any event.  4) The respondent shall pay costs of $1,200.","The parties have three children, three of which are now with the respondent. The parties resided with their respective parents on alternate weeks. In 2004, the petitioner moved with the three children to Alberta. In 2005, the three youngest children moved back with the petitioner. In 2006, the respondent paid child support of $300 per month for three years, until July 2004, when two of the children moved with him to Edmonton. The payments were based on an imputed annual income of $26,500. The petitioner now wants to be compensated for lost wages and the cost of fuel. HELD: 1) The capital cost allowance is an ordinary, and not extraordinary, expenses and would be encompassed in the basic child support. 2) The petitioner knew this and when she elected to pay the balance she did so unilaterally and on her own initiative. It would be inappropriate to now compel the respondent to contribute when he earlier expressed a contrary position. The respondent's conduct here is clearly wrong and should not be repeated. 3) The respondent was awarded one-half of the amount owing by the petitioner for certain school fees. He was asked to contribute at the time but refused. She knew this was wrong and did not act unilaterally. 4) The fees are ordinary and not ordinary expenses and should be encompassing in the support. It was appropriate to now require the respondent not to contribute. 5) The Court reviewed the various costs of child support payable over the years and found that they were not extraordinary. The costs were to be shared equally."
c_2014skqb144.txt,The Court dismissed the application. It found that the accused was not capable of representing himself but that the accused had not shown that he was indigent.,"HELD: The application for court appointed counsel was dismissed. The court found that the accused did not meet the second criterion for being indigent as it did not consider the complexity of the legal issues involved in the charge or charges against the accused, particularly including an assessment of the possible sentence to be imposed. The accused had made no effort to obtain financing for his own defence and had not made any efforts to secure financing. The Court found that given the accused's circumstances and the fact that he was in a position to make some arrangements for financing, the court would not have made an order appointing him. On the issue of indigency, the Court determined that the most appropriate remedy was a stay of proceedings under s. 24(1) of the Charter in the event the prosecution insists on proceeding with trial in breach of the accused’s Charter right to fair trial."

At the end of the review they were to provide a written report to the hospital's Chief Executive Officer. The hospital staff participating in the investigation and review were advised that their information would be treated as part of a 'peer review' and therefore confidential. Upon receipt of the report the hospital, as a result, refused to disclose the report to the families. An application pursuant to the Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy Act was made by an M.L.A., who sought for the disclosure of the report and for a review of the hospital's decision to not release the report. The hospital decided to release the full report. The appellant employees appealed the decision of the hospital, claiming that they had been assured confidentiality. Allowing the appeal, that the disclosure of personal information consisting of personal recommendations or evaluations, character references, or personal evaluations by the appellants and other hospital staff are presumed under s. 20(3)(g) of the Act to be an unreasonable invasion of a third party's personal privacy. Under s. 20(1) the hospital is required to refuse to disclose this information. It necessarily follows that recommendations in the report founded upon such information is also presumed to be an unreasonable invasion of privacy and is likewise not to be disclosed. The remainder of the report is disclose able.","The appellants sought to have a peer review conducted of three individuals who had committed suicide at the hands of their own hands. The decision was made against the recommendations of senior management at the hospital and contrary to assurances given to the families that they would not be receiving the report. The authors of a report were approached by the hospital staff and assured that it was to be a confidential document, which would be used as an internal document only, thus ensuring the confidentiality of their participation. The hospital refused to release the report and, after several days of examination, it was concluded the report was not to be released. The appellants appealed. Dismissing the appeal, that a review of the circumstances of the three individuals is an educational tool and confidentiality should not be grounds for suspicion by family members or members of the public. In these circumstances, the appellants will suffer."
4_2003skqb490.txt,"The applicants brought a motion seeking proof of the Will in solemn form, questioning the testamentary capacity, due execution of the will and raising the issue of undue influence and coercion. HELD: The motion was dismissed with costs. The role of the Court is that of a gatekeeper. The Court will not send an issue to trial unless evidence is brought forth which, if accepted, would tend to negative knowledge and approval of testamentary capacity. No issue of credibility arose.","FIAT. In January 2003, one of 29 nieces and nephews of the deceased sought proof of the will of the late, great-grandfather, who was 88 at the time of his death. He had given instructions for a will in 1998 and then changed his mind. The executors had been unable to obtain the notes of a lawyer who had received instructions for never-completed will. HELD: The application was dismissed. 1)There was a presumption of testamentary capacity and in the face of challenge the executors provided uncontradicted evidence which affirms positively the testimony capacity of the applicant not only at the crucial time the will was signed but for months thereafter. Those attacking the will have not come forth with evidence which would tend to negate testamentary Capacity. No issue of credibility has arisen.  2)The applicant was granted costs."

HELD: In reviewing the registrar's judgment, it is clear that he succinctly and accurately set forth the facts of the matter and that to that end there has been no complaint regarding the judgment. The court considered the registrar's analysis in this matter and can find no fault with his reasoning. The registrar's interpretation is supported by the legislation and, based upon the undisputed facts which he found, the interpretation is reasonable.

The trustee did not request costs and none will be awarded. 1) There has been no reason demonstrated to set aside the adjudication of the registrar and nor to remove the respondent's agreement with respect to the application of this provision. 2) The proposal is developed based upon the trustee's due diligence in this regard and recommendations are made to the creditors concerning the viability of the proposal. 3) The registration of the security agreement by the applicant subsequent to the date the proposal was filed was contrary to the statutory stay provision as set out in s. 69(1)(a)of the BIA. It is undisputed that leave was not obtained for this purpose.  4) The trustee's analysis that permits court to get to the PPSA is correct but the submission that section 20(2)(a is applicable to proposals is not supported by the legislation.

8_2017skqb53.txt,"The accused was charged with the commission of sexual assault, sexual touching in relation to a 16-year-old and possession of child pornography. The accused came to police attention via a report by the complainant. She reported that the accused was often viewing a pornographic website while in her presence. The police prepared an information to obtain a search warrant (ITO). The ITO stated that the search would provide evidence of the accused’s viewing of pornography in the presence of the complainant, bolstering the complainant’s credibility. The ITO did not reference possession of child pornography. The ITO sought only a search of the “search history on the computer”. The issued warrant authorized a search of the accused’s computer and related devices and media, as well as documents pertaining to occupancy of the home and control of computer equipment. The complainant subsequently alleged that the accused had taken photos of her in the shower. The police did not amend the ITO to include a search for photos. The police executed the search and seized, inter alia, a laptop, an iPhone and CDs. The police delivered the material to a computer forensic specialist at the RCMP and requested a complete forensic search of the computer and phone to obtain a general search of the Internet history, pictures of the complainant and messages between the complainant and the accused. The police knew that the search of pictures was not included on the search warrant. The RCMP did not review the terms of the warrant prior to completing the examination and examined the entire contents of the laptop and phone. The accused submitted that his s. 8 Charter rights had been violated by the search and applied for exclusion of evidence pursuant to s. 24(2). The application proceeded by voir dire. The evidence was apparently located on either the accused’s laptop or cell phone, but the nature of the evidence obtained was not disclosed at the voir dire. The following issues were raised: 1) What is the correct procedure to be used to challenge evidence seized pursuant to a search warrant; 2) Was the Crown able to call amplification evidence and have it considered in support of the search and seizure conducted; 3) Did the ITO set forth reasonable and probable grounds that the items sought were evidence with respect to the commission of an offence; 4) Did the ITO use boiler plate clauses; 5) Did the ITO establish reasonable and probable grounds that the items were likely to be found in the place to be searched; and 6) What was the extent of a search of a computer or computer device. | HELD: Evidence of the accused’s search history was validly obtained. Other evidence was beyond the scope of the search warrant and obtained by violation of the accused’s s. 8 rights. The court held: 1) There is a two-step inquiry to be made when real evidence is seized during a search. The first step is an inquiry into constitutionality, and the second is reached only after a constitutional infringement has been established. Both inquiries impose an onus on the person claiming infringement. The standard of proof is the balance of probabilities. Challenges to constitutionality of warranted searches may involve either or both a facial and a sub-facial attack on the authorizing warrant. The record examined on facial review is fixed: it is the ITO, not an amplified or enlarged record;  2) In attempting to enter evidence of the complainant’s allegation that the accused took pictures of her in the shower, the Crown relied on an argument that the ends justified the means. This amplification evidence sought to allege a whole new offence and area of search. It was not admitted; 3) The point of this voir dire was not to determine admissibility of evidence outside of the search warrant context. There was no requirement that evidence sought in support of allegations made be directly connected to a complainant or the actual subject matter of a complainant; 4) The ITO did not use impermissible boiler plate clauses when read in its entirety. However, it did not set forth reasonable and probable grounds that text messages were evidence with respect to the commission of an offence; 5) The ITO provided sufficient description. It was reasonable to infer that search history meant search history of the accused with respect to the websites defined in the ITO. Further argument was required on whether text messages could be included; and  6) Police are not entitled to rummage through entire contents of a device searching for other evidence. The ITO sought only the search history.","HELD: The application was allowed in part and the balance of probabilities were considered. The court found that the accused had reasonable doubt as to the reliability of the Internet search history, was in a position of trust and authority toward a person aged 16 years for a sexual purpose, touch directly or indirectly with a part of the body, any part of that body of a person under the age of 18, and that the suggested criminal offence was not contained in the ITO. The accused was found not guilty of the charge under s.271 of the Criminal Code. The evidence of the complainant's discussion with the accused about the alleged sexual assault was entered to amplify what the accused actually swore to in theITO and to justify or authorize the seizure of additional items taken in the execution of the search warrant. There was no evidence before the court as to whether any of the accused's s.8 Charter rights had been violated."
e_1999skqb150.txt,"FIAT. It was held in an earlier fiat in June that the addition of the two proposed plaintiffs asserted new causes of action and amendments to the statement of claim could only be considered pursuant to an application under s.44(11) of the Queen's Bench Act. The defendant resisted the joinder of the new plaintiffs and amendments on the basis of undue delay and actual prejudice. The statement of claim alleged nuisance, and in the alternative, negligence against the City with respect to the design, construction and maintenance of the sewer system causing his basement to flood. The plaintiffs stated they only became aware of the damage to their home and possible health problems over period of time. Leave to appeal the June fiat was denied. The defendant plead limitation period defence to the amendment and argued that if the City had received notice of any ongoing problems it would have investigated and possibly taken steps to minimize any damage; that evidence had been lost; it may be too late to determine the causes. HELD: The amendments were allowed. 1)The limitation period in s.314(1) applies from the time damages were sustained, not from the date of the occurrence which led to the damage. The facts were uncertain. It was uncertain when the limitation period commenced. If the date the applicant should have discovered the additional damage was the date they received the geotechnical and structural engineering report, the amended claim was brought within the 1 year limitation period. 2)Inexcusable delay was not established. 3)It was not accepted that the defendant suffered actual prejudice. If it was prejudiced it was through its own inaction. No evidence had been lost. The basement was available for inspection. It had the benefit of the reports provided by the applicants. 4)The requirements of s.44(11) were met and judicial discretion was exercised to allow the amendments. The fact that the joint owner of the property was not included was due to inadvertence rather than any deliberate choice. It was also appropriate to join the new plaintiff. It appeared that the expanded claim alleged in the requested amendment was not apparent at the time the original claim was issued and arose out of the same occurrence. 4)Costs in the cause.","FIAT. The proposed plaintiffs applied to set aside proposed amendments to the original statement of claim and the joinder of parties to that claim. In the end, the Court held the amendments did not require leave to amend and found that the infant could be joined as a plaintiff on the basis she was an infant against whom the limitation period for the Urban Municipality Act had intervened. The amendment could only be considered pursuant to an application under s.44(11) of the Queen's Bench Act as amended. HELD: The application was allowed. The defendant resisted the joinders of the original plaintiffs and the amendments to statement of claims on the grounds of undue delay on the part of the proposed plaintiffs and actual prejudice to the defendant. The application is allowed. 1)The limitation period in s.314(1) applies from the time when the damages were sustained, not from the date of the occurrence which led to the damage. The fact that the plaintiffs were not children at the time of the action was not a factor to be taken into account. The material filed does not establish inexcusable delay or actual prejudice.  2)The Court was able to join the parties as litigation guardians for the minor in that the application proceeds and the issues are decided as to the damages. 3)The applicant was a joint owner of the property and should have been included as a defendant at the original action. The facts of this case are that the defendant had very timely notice, and the fact it chose not to investigate or communicate with the plaintiff following service of the statementof claim is not the fault of the plaintiffs. If it was prejudiced, it was through its own inaction. 4)The amendments were allowed in respect to the individual claim.  5)No evidence had been lost. The basement is available for inspection.

e_1996canlii6831.txt,"The petitioner sought a divorce, custody, spousal and child support and an unequal division of matrimonial property. The respondent counter-petitioned for similar relief, including divorce, joint custody and an equal division of the property. HELD: 1)Sole custody was awarded to the mother with access on the same terms as contained in the interim order. Two reasons for not awarding joint custody were the obvious acrimony between the parties and the respondent's reluctance to support his children. Three weeks after his application for sale of the home was rejected, he applied for a leave of absence from his job. It was inferred that he was trying to avoid complying with the order for interim support. 2)The mother re-entered the workforce after many years' absence. She suffered an economic disadvantage from the marriage and its breakdown. 3)The car owned by the petitioner when she married was exempt property. The motorcycle was disregarded as there had not been a significant increase in value. The list prepared by the respondent was used to divide household goods, tools and equipment. 4)The respondent was to assume one-half of the bank loan and it was agreed that the pension funds should be shared equally. 5)It would be unfair and inequitable to the custodial parent to order an equal division of the matrimonial property. The petitioner was granted possession of the matrimonial home until the younger child's 18th birthday or until she vacated the property. 6)The respondent cannot avoid his responsibility of providing an adequate level of support by turning his back on well-paid employment.

e_2016skpc106.txt,"HELD: The accused was found not guilty. The court found that the accused’s s. 8 Charter rights were breached. Pursuant to a Grant analysis, the court excluded the evidence obtained after the illegal entry of the accused’s home. The court found that the accused had not consented to the entry by the officer and the complainant and it was therefore a warrantless search. The officer did not have the lawful authority to enter the home on the basis of arresting the father as he was not in hot pursuit. The complainant had not obtained a warrant under s. 13.1 of The Child and Family Services Act to enter the accused’s home and therefore had no lawful authority to enter the home. There were no exigent circumstances to justify the search such as preventing the destruction of evidence as they already established that the person they sought was not in the house. The unlawful entry and search of the accused’s home was a severe breach of the accused’s Charter rights. The impact upon her was severe as the complainant gathered evidence and apprehended her children. The accused’s assault on the complainant was minor in nature and although not excusable, her offence was a reaction to a significant breach of her rights. The administration of justice was served by excluding the evidence.","The accused was charged with assault contrary to s. 266 of the Criminal Code. The complainant was a child protection worker employed by the Ministry of Social Services. She enlisted the assistance of Moose Jaw Police to enter the accused's apartment to investigate whether the children were in need of protection and if necessary to apprehend the children. The accused kicked the complainant and hit her. The defence argued that the accused was not in hot pursuit of an individual and that apprehension was justified on that date merely by reason of him having contact with the complainant. HELD: The child protection worker did not have any lawful authority to enter Ms. Bigsky's apartment. She was not exercising criminal law power and her entrance to that suite will be contrary to her section rights, unless that entrance and search is determined to be lawful under some other legal authority. The most fundamental question here is whether the police officer had the legal authority, pursuant to s16 of the Child and Family Services Act, to enter and arrest the accused. The fact that a worker had directed the accused not to have any contact with Ms.Bigsky does not alter that situation. The childprotection worker did have reasonable grounds to believe that contact between the parties was harmful to the children and they were immediately in needof protection. However, the Court was not satisfied that the father had contact with this individual on this date. The evidence that was obtained following the unlawful entry was not relevant to this case."
e_2009nssm47.txt,"The claimants live on property abutting the defendant Burrow's property. The defendant Renouf is Burrows' friend. As favour, Renouf attended the property while Burrows was away and cut down some trees that he was asked to cut. He went on to cut down several others that he felt were diseased/damaged. eventually realizing he had crossed the property line and cut down more than 17 of the claimants' trees. The claimants sued for the cost of replacing the trees with a comparable number of mature trees, the cost of removing the felled trees and to recoup for anticipated damage to their septic field. At issue was: 1. whether Renouf trespassed; 2. whether Burrows was liable for Renouf's actions (for 'hiring' Renouf or because they were engaged in a joint enterprise); and 3. damages. The claimants did not want Burrows helping with the tree removal, even if doing so would save money. 1. Renouf trespassed on the claimants' land and is liable for damages. That it was an honest mistake is irrelevant since trespass does not require bad faith or improper purpose. 2. Burrows is not liable. He was not Renouf's employer, nor were Renouf's actions foreseeable. It was a favour and Renouf went way beyond the scope of what he was asked to do. Burrows is not responsible for everything that flowed from their limited enterprise. The case law requires a degree of blameworthiness (a neglectful or unlawful enterprise) which creates a foreseeable risk of harm. 3. Renouf to pay the claimants: $3,750 to replace the trees with young, native trees (half the amount sought by the claimants), $2,000 for tree removal (half the quote submitted by the claimants since they refused to mitigate the damage by allowing Burrows to help). While Burrows had counterclaimed for damages arising from a confrontation between the claimants and his son, he did not seriously pursue it and it was dismissed. Costs of $1,234 awarded to the claimants (including $960.77 for disbursements). While the amount seems high, the case was large one and the counterclaim, although not seriously pursued, hung over the claimants' heads as they prepared for trial.","The plaintiff claimed that the defendant had cut down some trees on his property, by mistake. The defendant had been friends with the plaintiff for many years and had offered to help remove the trees. The plaintiff had been reluctant to part with the defendant's property due to the uncertainty about the boundary, and had only recently returned to it. He asked the defendant to return the trees to his property and offered to remove the rest of the trees for a total of $3,750. The Defendant refused, and the plaintiff sought damages against him in the amount of $2,000 for tree replacement and $2 million for repairs to the plaintiff's septic field. HELD: The claim against the defendant was dismissed. 1)There was a degree of blameworthiness which causes liability to attach. It could be because the enterprise was itself unlawful, or because there was neglect on the part of one of the parties which created a foreseeable risk of harm. 2)The plaintiff was not able to collaterally or vicariously take advantage of the opportunity presented to him by the defendant. He could not have foreseen the defendant would be expanding his cutting to an area anywhere near the neighbours. If there was liability on either or both of the defendants, it would have to be found that they were involved in a joint enterprise. 3)The defendant was clearly part of joint enterprise to remove few damaged trees from his own property, which was a fully lawful enterprise. There was no reasonable foreseeability that he would stray so far from the area discussed that a neighbour's property might be breached. 4)The Court found that the individual with the most experience in forestry may have been able to participate in such an enterprise."
e_2002skpc80.txt,"The accused was charged with owning a dog that without provocation attacked a person contrary to the Urban Municipality Act s.135.3(3). There were four separate incidents involving the dog in September 2001. At issue was whether the Crown had proven an attack on any of the four occasions. The accused agreed that the presumption of non-provocation set out in s.135.2(1) of the UMA applied and that presumption had not been displaced. HELD: 1)A $200 fine was imposed along with conditions. The dog must be kept within an enclosed continuous fence and chained to a post. There must be a gate preventing exiting except while on a leash and muzzled. The owner must display a sign stating Guard Dog on Duty. 2)If dog is territorial or protective, and the facts show the human has, by intruding, been in law provocative, the offence may not be proven beyond reasonable doubt. On the evidence there was no intrusion sufficient to justify an attack or which could be considered provocation. 3)There were seven specific pieces of evidence which supported the conclusion that the owner did not take reasonable steps to ensure his dog did not attack someone in the fashion prohibited by s.135.3(3). It is irrelevant at law that after dog attacks it responds to its owner's commands. The dog escaped the yard, was off leash and was not sufficiently restrained or enclosed. logging chain affixed to post is substantial way of tethering dog. One would not expect dog to be attached to logging chain if there were no concerns.","The accused was charged with assault contrary to s. 135.3(3) of the Urban Municipalities Act. The evidence indicated that the accused's dog escaped through a garbage can enclosure in front of his house, and then ran through a nearby backyard. The accused also displayed a sign that said 'Guard Dog on Duty, Beware of Dog'. HELD: The accused was found guilty of four separate incidents in September 2001 involving the dog's owner. The Court accepted the accused’s evidence that the dog came within two to three feet of the complainant, and that it chased the complainant and then drove away before the dog got any closer. It was not appropriate in the context of the Act to charge the accused with assault. The appropriate fine was $200. On the definition of attack, as understand it, an attack is an unrequested confrontation of human by dog made in circumstances where the dog is in close proximity and was snarling and barking, but in that case she was inside of her residence. There were seven specific pieces of evidence backing up the accuseds evidence: the dog was not sufficiently restrained or enclosed, that it ran from its yard and attacked the complainant. The chain was attached to a post embedded in the ground and the eye-bolt or similar attachment was secured by flat washers on either side and the basis on which the dog ran was not adequately explained."
b_2010nssc387.txt,"The small claims adjudicator granted an order for substituted service after the respondent had trouble serving the appellant with notice of her claim. As per the order, she personally served the appellant's mother and notified the appellant of the hearing date by text message. He didn't appear and default judgement was granted against the appellant in the amount of $11,031.35. The appellant appealed, arguing the adjudicator failed to follow the natural requirements of justice. He denied being in contact with his mother. He admitted receiving the text message(s) but said he didn't believe the respondent, but didn't make any further inquiries. New evidence (a letter from his mother saying she was not in contact with her son) was allowed on the appeal. Appeal dismissed. The right to be heard is a fundamental right, and an appeal of a default judgment must be subject to the highest scrutiny. Here the respondent's claim was valid. The adjudicator had the jurisdiction/authority to make an order for substituted service and the respondent followed it. At the very least, the appellant was notified of the hearing dates by text message(s). While he may not have believed the messages, he should have taken some steps to confirm with the court if there was indeed a hearing set. He failed to prove he had a reasonable excuse for defaulting, chose to ignore the notice, and was mistaken only as to what would be the outcome if he failed to appear.","The respondent appeals a decision of the Adjudicator of the Small Claims Court in the amount of $11,031.35. The respondent appeals that decision by Notice of Appeal (form 9) filed with the court on the same date and within the 30 day appeal period. The singular ground of appeal cited in the appellant's Notice is a failure to follow the requirements of natural justice. The appellant mistakenly showed up for the hearing on the wrong date, which was one day after the actual hearing. While waiting around for half an hour, he checked the doors of the Court House several times, then assumed that Court was cancelled because of bad weather. He then realized that it was the wrong day and he chose to ignore the hearing. HELD: The respondent is entitled to costs against the appellant. 1) It is a breach of the requirements for natural justice not to have a mechanism in Small Claims court whereby, if a defendant does not file a defence or appear at a hearing by mistake, but can show that he or she has an arguable defence that should be heard on its merits and he has a reasonable excuse for defaulting and is not just stalling, the judgment cannot be set aside. In light of the increase in the monetary jurisdiction of the court, it is as relevant to nature justice in the small claims court as it is in the Supreme Court. There is still a requirement that the applicant show sufficient bases for the court to exercise discretion to avoid abuse.  2) It does not automatically follow that just because they were not present that their appeal will be allowed. The Court must also view the Respondent's actions and the courts record of events in determining whether due process was followed and whether the Rules and Regulations prescribed by the Court were adhered to. 3) It was not automatically followed that just a failure of natural law could be entered. The judgment cannot possibly be set off without an appeal. Natural justice demands that he be heard."
e_2012nssc101.txt,"The accused was charged with sexual assault and various other sexual offences with respect to his niece (who had spent weekends and summers with her father, who lived with his sister and the accused) when she was between the ages of 12 to 15. The accused denied the allegations, suggesting that, since the niece had not disclosed any of these matters until she was 17 years old, she had made up generalized allegation against him to stop her boyfriend from breaking up with her and then found it necessary to maintain the lie, tell her friends, her mother and the police and get more specific when pressed for details. He also argued that she was not credible because her testimony in court was inconsistent with that in the preliminary inquiry and although there were numerous persons she could have confided in at the time, she never told anybody about the alleged incidents but kept going back to visit her father. Accused found guilty of all counts. Although she was at times frustrated and unable to recall precisely, the niece's demeanour was consistent with a young person doing her best to be truthful and accurate in intimidating and embarrassing circumstances. Her evidence was both consistent with that of other witnesses and internally consistent and the inconsistencies with her previous statements were minor. The court found she had no motive to lie initially or during her trial testimony and the reality was that by making these allegations, she knew her father would be forced to move and would become estranged from his sister, her family would be fractured and the 'sister'-like relationship she had with the accused's daughter would end.","The accused was charged with four counts of sexual assault. The Crown alleged that the accused touched the victim with his penis, moved around in a manner that offended the victim's sensibilities, and touched her inappropriately. The accused was tried in provincial court. The evidence presented at trial suggested that the Crown had established that the victim had been sexually assaulted by the accused, and that it had proceeded to find out whether the accused had motive to lie or mislead. The court found that the essential elements of sexual assaulting were examined: 1) the accused's credibility was mixture of reliability (being now accurately recalling matters they had had in the past) and impartiality (are they disinterested in the outcome of the case and do not favour any party over another?) and was it possible that the evidence was skewed? 2) there was some confusion as to where the accused and his family were living; 3) the probative value of this evidence was greatly outweighed by the prejudice to the accused if he was not in fact her biological father; and 4) the essential element of the offence were comprehensively addressed by the Supreme Court of Canada in v. Ewanchuk 1999 CanLII 711 (SCC), [1999] SCR 330. In this case, the accused was found guilty of four counts relating to the alleged touching of the victim. The core elements of this offence were found to be consistent with independent witnesses; the accused committed the offence of touching the victim contrary to s. 271(1)(a); and four counts related to the touching of a part of the body contrary to the s. 151 of the Criminal Code."
d_2008nsca10.txt,"The appellant appealed the adoption order regarding her natural child. Although at one time the child had been in the permanent care of the Agency, that order was terminated and replaced by a private guardianship order which had placed the child with the now-adoptive parents. Although neither of the birth parents, who resided in British Columbia, had attended the adoption hearing, the birth mother now sought access to the child and requested that the court receive fresh evidence as to her unsuccessful efforts to obtain counsel to represent her at the adoption hearing. Appeal allowed; adoption order set aside; matter remitted to the application court for a further hearing; application to admit fresh evidence granted in part; the portions of the appellant's affidavit addressing her efforts to secure counsel for the adoption hearing admitted into evidence. The appellant had a bona fide intention to appear or to be represented at the hearing and had made reasonable, although unsuccessful, efforts to do so. Allowing the appeal would be in the child's best interests as she had resided with the adoptive parents for the past three years and would continue to do so pending the further hearing.","The appellant was the birth mother of a child who was residing with her birth parents at the time of their adoption. The child was in need of protective services and a temporary guardianship order issued in Alberta where the parents were returned to her birthparents but again apprehended by the child welfare authorities. In 2005 an order for permanent guardianship was granted. The order made no provision for access to the child. The appellant applied for fresh evidence on this issue. She had a bona fide intention to appear or be represented and made reasonable efforts to do so. The Private Guardianship Order which the respondents were granted granted in 2002 had a provision that access by the birth parents was left to the respondents. They were each personally served with notice of the hearing scheduled to take place in May 2007. Neither appeared at the hearing nor heard from the appellant. She appealed that order in 2005. At this stage she is not seeking to oppose the adoption, but wishes to be heard on the issue of access. The consequent delay need not impact the child as it is in the child's best interests that her birth mother's wish to have access be determined on the application to adopt. Bringing the appeal and remitting the matter to the application court would make no comment on the merits of the appellant's intended submissions to that court or in any event consider whether such result would be in the best interests of the child and, if so, to allow the appeal to be allowed in the permanent guardian order and in the adoption hearing in Alberta."

The respondent companies that acquired an interest in the subject land subsequent to the caveat being removed opposed the application based, among other things, on the principle of indefeasibility of title, as did the Registrar of Land Titles. HELD: The application is dismissed with costs to the respondents. 1) Even if the caveat was removed improperly, the Court ought not to retroactively reinstate it, because to do so would defeat the fundamental principle of indefeasibility of title that has been continued in The Land Titles Act, 2000; and 2) it would not be appropriate to permit the applicants to attempt to access the assurance fund through the mechanism of a chambers application requesting declaratory relief. The process, if the applicants chose to pursue it, would be an action under Part XII of the Act.","HELD: The application was dismissed. The court found that even if the caveat was wrongfully removed by the Registrar of Land Titles, it would not be appropriate to retroactively reinstate the caveat. The companies that acquired an interest in the South West Quarter of Section Twenty-seven (27), in Township Two (2), in Range Four (4), in the Province of Saskatchewan, in the Dominion of Canada, were entitled to costs of defending the application. The respondents were awarded costs fixed at $750."
d_2005skqb454.txt,"The plaintiff sues the defendants for $50,000 plus interest. The claim is based on the allegation that the plaintiff loaned the defendant Kelly $69,000. The plaintiff claims the defendants agreed to repay the loan in the amount of $1,500 per month. HELD: The plaintiff's claim is dismissed. The only evidence that might suggest that this transaction was a loan to either of the defendants was that some of the payments made by the defendant to the plaintiff were in the amount of $1,500, the amount that the plaintiff asserts was the monthly amount to be repaid by the defendant for the loan. However, there was no evidence as to when the agreement to pay $1,500 was made. In her testimony, the plaintiff stated that when the decision was made to pay the $69,000 to the business, she did not have a discussion with the defendant, Kelly. The only discussion she seems to have had was with her husband after which she wrote a cheque to the defendant.","The plaintiff sought damages in the amount of $50,000 plus interest in accordance with the provisions of The Pre-judgment Interest Act. The claim was based on the allegation by the plaintiff that she loaned $69,000 to the defendant, who she then husband Ken, into the auto brokering business. The defendant denied that the transaction was a loan, and argued that in fact it was an investment by the plaintiffs into that auto broker business. HELD: The plaintiff's claim was dismissed. 1)The evidence did not show that the plaintiff advanced a loan to either the defendant or her husband. There was no written contract or other written evidence of any agreement between the plaintiff, the defendant and/or the numbered company defendant evidencing the nature of the transaction. 2)The defendant did not have any evidence of a monthly repayment agreement with the plaintiff. The evidence was that some of the payments made by the defendant were in excess of $1,500 per month. The plaintiff stated on cross-examination that she felt she received a profit from the first transaction, and that she categorized some payments from as 'commission' when they were made. 3)The only evidence that might suggest that this transaction was an arranged loan was not filed with the court. No evidence was held on the basis that the defendant ever made a monthly payment to the plaintiff on a monthly basis. On the basis of the cross examination, the plaintiff stated that she did not intend to repay the loan but that she thought she had repaid it on her own. 4)Issue No.5 was moot. The action was brought under simplified procedure rules and the defendant was awarded taxable costs."
9_2003skqb481.txt,The United States of America sought to extradite the respondent to face a charge of conspiracy to import into the USA a substance containing cocaine. The USA brought a motion to set a date for the extradition hearing. The respondent brought a motion requesting further disclosure and alleged that the USA had not disclosed all of the evidence in its custody or control. HELD: The application for disclosure was dismissed. A date for the extradition hearing was set.,"The accused, a Jamaican national living in Canada, applied for a stay of proceedings pending extradition on the grounds of contempt of court for failing to provide proper disclosure and for the Attorney General to discharge under s. 29(1) of the Extradition Act. HELD: The motion on behalf of the Deputy Attorney General was granted and the hearing was to proceed on January 6, 2004.  1)The accused was entitled to disclosure of all the evidence in his custody or control except only the diplomatic note from USA to Canada which initiated the process. There had been no investigation in Canada of the alleged offence. The Attorney General has only that information which the USA authorities have seen fit to provide to him. 2)The application was dismissed.  3)The issues with disclosure were as follows: 1)It is alleged that the Attorney general has not disclosed all the information in his possession or control. Counsel for the AG has undertaken that everything within the control of the AttorneyGeneral has been turned over to the solicitor for the purposes of the extradition hearing. If he is not entitled under ss.29 to what he has requested then concurrent common law rights cannot serve to expand his entitlement.  4)The role of the hearing judge is modest one; absent express statutory or treaty authorization, the sole purpose of an extradition hearing is to ensure that the evidence establishes a prima facie case that the extradition crime has been committed. The extradition procedure is based upon a treaty where each state assumes that the reciprocating state has a fair and just criminal system. Responsibility for the conduct of our foreign relations, including the performance of Canada's obligations under extradition treaties, is vested in the executive. 5)The request for detailed disclosure prior to a hearing in the case of United States of America v. Daul was without merit and it was accordingly dismissed."
c_2001skqb39.txt,"The defendants brought an application to compel responses to a large number of questions objected to at examinations for discovery of the proper officer for SPMC, and sought an order requiring SPMC to comply with numerous undertakings. The objections were categorized as the questions sought to elicit the plaintiff's manner of investigation or expert opinions; it should have been asked of another witness better suited to answer or third parties as the questions relate to issues between the defendant and the third parties; it was irrelevant or improper. HELD: 1)The plaintiffs were not required to answer questions which would require them to accept or reject an opinion of another party to the action. 2)The plaintiffs should answer what cellulose fibre insulation was present at the time of the fire. 3)The affidavit answered whether Miner was a participant in the investigation notwithstanding the defendants are not entitled to the names of possible expert witnesses at the discovery stage. 4)Any meeting between the plaintiff's investigators and the fire marshal clearly related to its investigation and is privileged. The defendants could obtain the information directly from the fire marshal. 5)The question of whether there was any liaison between the city fire investigator and SIAST was improper as it relates to the manner of investigation. Questions can be asked of the city. 6)Details of the plaintiff's investigation, including an engineer's report, was protected by litigation privilege. 7)The question regarding what observations were made of the damage was too vague. The plaintiff's claim was in excess of $7 million. A proper foundation must be laid in the context of specific questions and answers given or not given (Hill v. Arcola School Division). The defendants are not entitled to expert opinion. 8)Whether SPMC's insurer's investigation team participated related to manner of investigation and was therefore privileged. 9)The defendant will be able to examine the city in the third party claim with respect to documents from the fire department. 10)All discussions at mediation proceedings are strictly confidential. The name of the plaintiff's expert, who prepared the drawings in contemplation of litigation, is privileged. 11)The facts and observations upon which expert opinions are based must be disclosed including any photographs.  12)Whether any pattern on the wood would indicate contact by propane flame required expert opinion. 13)Questions concerning what material first ignited could only be answered by having experts reconstruct what in their opinion occurred at the time the fire started. 14)If the plaintiffs do not have a position (on whether there was a fire stop in the 1967 construction of the tower), there is no rule the court is aware of requiring them to adopt a position. They can be required to give an undertaking to provide a position if they adopt one at a later date. Whether they believed the building was built in accordance with the 1960 fire code when constructed in 1967 was information obtainable by the defendants. 15)If the party being examined had no control over or greater access to a witness than the examining party, it need only disclose the evidence known to it. There is no obligation to seek information from third parties when the defendants are capable of obtaining that information. 16)An undertaking was given to advise if and when the plaintiffs develop a position on whether the parapet roof was constructed in accordance with the detail set out in FC and whether the detail in the sketch of the Tower parapet was correct. 17)If the request for the proposal related to Kelsey, the document should be produced, but if it only related to the Regina campus, the document was not relevant. 18)Whether it was considered anytime that Hagblom would be a sub-consultant was a legal question. The trial judge will interpret the terms of the agreement. 19)Any information required could be obtained directly from the architects who had been added as third parties by the defendants.  20)The plaintiffs gave undertakings to answer the other questions and did not object to answering them. 21)The 36 objections (less 3 that were withdrawn) failed. It would be an abuse of process for the defendants to ask the same question of a second officer hoping to obtain a different answer. The same question can be put if the first did not answer it. The fact there were three separate officers does not restrict the defendants to only asking certain questions of each. The reason for having three officers, each with a different expertise in a certain area, was to prevent the plaintiffs from having to give endless undertakings. Having all three present during each examination would have saved time and unnecessary legal fees. 22)The exhibit was not before the court to determine how complicated the question was. Defence counsel was to break it down. 23)There were 200 undertakings. As a general rule examinations for discovery should be completed before the party being examined is required to comply with the undertakings. It would lead to endless delay if the examining party were allowed to simply adjourn and demand the undertakings be complied with. There were no exceptional circumstances.  24)Costs were left to the trial judge.","The defendants applied to compel responses to a large number of questions that were objected to at examinations for discovery of proper officers on behalf of Saskatchewan Property Management Corporation (SPMC). The plaintiffs claimed that the question asked was asking for the names of possible expert witnesses who had been retained by the defendants to assist in their investigation of the damage caused to the building. The defendants argued that these names did not reveal anything of the facts in issue that the respondent did not already have but were details of the appellant's investigation. Objection No. 8-P. 317, Line 15 to P. 318 had to do with the question as it was a question that was asked of SPMC. The question was too vague to answer. The only thing that would be clear was whether the plaintiffs' expert who prepared the drawings was privileged. The plaintiffs refused to answer the question. Objections No. 9-P1 and P. 327 were allowed. The plaintiff's claim in excess of $7,000,000 was limited to the number of undertakings made by the defendant and was not supported by the actual evidence. There must be some reasonable degree of specificity to question of this nature when reference is made to document. The defendant's request for the plaintiff's expert opinion on the burn pattern was not allowed. It was clear that the plaintiffs did not have the requested information and there was nothing compelling between the expert's and the defendant's positions."
c_2012skqb426.txt,"The Crown applied under Part XXIV of the Criminal Code to have the accused declared a dangerous offender after he pled guilty to committing an aggravated assault on his common-law spouse contrary to s. 268 of the Code. The application is based on the Code provisions in effect before the danger offender legislation set forth in The Tackling Violent Crime Act was passed. The accused is 52 years old and in poor health. He has a significant criminal record thatreveals a history of violence and an inability to abide by court orders. The offences occurred between the time he was 40 and ended in 2006 with his last conviction, the predicate offence. Two psychologists prepared psychological assessments both of which concluded that the offender should not be declared a dangerous offender because his risk to re-offend could be reasonably managed by supervision in the community. The issues before the Court were: 1) whether the predicate offence is a serious personal injury offence as defined by s. 752 of the Code; 2) whether the offender is a threat of the kind contemplated by s. 753 of the Code and thus a danger to society; 3) if so, whether the Court should exercise its residual discretion an impose a fixed-term sentence or resort to long-term offender provisions, even though the statutory criteria for declaring the accused a dangerous offender have been met; and if a long-term offender designation is warranted, what determinate sentence and long-term supervision order should be imposed? HELD: 1) The Court held that the aggravated assault committed by the offender was a serious personal injury offence because it was an indictable offence involving the use of violence against his spouse. 2) The Court found that the Crown had proven the criteria required that the offender clearly fits within the definition set forth in ss. 753(1)(a)(i) and (ii), in that this offender had shown a repetitive and persistent pattern of aggressive behavior, especially against women. 3) The Court decided to exercise its residual discretion not to designate the offender as a dangerous offender and found that the he met the long-term offender criteria and that his risk to re-offend could be managed within the meaning of s. 753.1(1)(c). The offender has never been imprisoned in a penitentiary and thus had never had the benefit of programming offered in that system. The appropriate sentence should be 7 years. As the offender has spent approximately 3 years and 4 months in pre-sentence custody, the Court gave him credit in that amount on a one-to-one basis. The Court ordered that the appropriate length of time for a long term supervision order is the maximum of 10 years since the offender needs to learn alternative ways to express his frustration and address his issues with alcohol.","The offender pled guilty to committing an aggravated assault on his common-law partner contrary to s.268 of the Criminal Code. The Crown has applied under Part XXIV of the Code to have him declared a dangerous offender. The offender is 52 years old and with a significant criminal record. The Court has entered the conviction against the offender and prior to him being sentenced. HELD: 1)The Court has jurisdiction to entertain the dangerous offender application. The application was made following the conviction of the offender. He was sentenced to 60 days in jail.  2)The offender has a serious health problem and appears to be in denial regarding his potential to abuse alcohol. He has a chronic alcohol abuse problem. He required surgery as a child to have a heart valve repaired. In 2008 he had a stroke. He is currently undergoing treatment for this type of condition. He appears to have some serious supervision problems. His risk to re-offend violently in the future is high. 3)There is no doubt that the offender meets the dangerous act criteria set forth in the relevant Criminal Code provisions in force at the time. However, the real issue is whether there is a reasonable possibility that he can eventually be controlled in the community so as to justify the imposition of a long term offender designation. If found to be a long-term offender, it is then necessary to impose an appropriate determinate sentence to go along with the long term supervision order. 4)There are two additional events that are germane to the consideration of his criminal history. On January 1, 1995, the offender was charged with common assault contrary to S. 266 of the code. That matter was apparently resolved by having the offender enter into a recognizance wherein he was required, for a period of 1 year, to report to probation officer, have no contact with his wife and accept drug, alcohol and anger management programming. An amended notice of application was provided to the offender in September 2011. He will be remanded for period not exceeding 60 days to be assessed by Dr. Holden as required by s. 752.1(2). 5)He has serious health problems. As result of the predicate offence and two breaches of conditional sentences that were registered in 2004 and 2006, his risk for future violence is high (HELD): 1)His risk for violence in the foreseeable future appears to decline rapidly and that, therefore his risk assessment should be downgraded. 2)It is well know that generally speaking, the risk of committing new offences significantly declines as men age. However"
b_2010skqb187.txt,"The plaintiff granted the defendant a mortgage over a parcel of land just outside the city limits. The defendant failed to make any payment. The plaintiff applied for foreclosure on the land and an order nisi for judicial sale. The defendant was a developer. He argued that the foreclosure action was void because the land was being used as farmland and was subject to protection under s. 9 and 11 of The Saskatchewan Farm Land Security Act. The other issues before the court were the appropriate period of redemption and whether the plaintiff could submit a bid that incorporated the value of the land as a 'credit' enabling the plaintiff to merely 'top up' the bid by the additional amount needed to reach the bid price. HELD: The Saskatchewan Farm Land Security Act (SFSA) did not apply. The undisputed evidence was that since the defendant acquired the land in 2007, their focus was to develop the land as an industrial park and they had undertaken a host of activities to achieve that purpose which clearly indicated that their intent was not to farm the land in the sense contemplated by the SFSA. There was no foundation to deviate from the usual redemption period of 90 days from the date of the decision. The bidding process in a judicial sale contemplates a level playing field for all participants. The fact that the plaintiff is likely to receive a significant cash payout from the judicial sale does not modify the desirability of obliging all bidders to pay into court the full bid price. Normal bidding rules shall apply. The plaintiff was entitled to costs.",HELD: The application was dismissed and the usual bidding rules were applied. The applicant had failed to meet the requirements set out in the Farm Land Security Act (SFSA). The land had been purchased by a developer for development and its focus and direction had been the undertaking of a host of activities designed to develop the land into an industrial park. The Land was purchased by the developer for the purposes of farming with an emphasis on providing protection to farmers against loss of their farm land. The amendment to the SFSA provided that the purchaser must be a 'Mortgagor' on the mortgage to receive a significant cash payout. The redemption period was 90 days from the date of this decision. The plaintiff had to pay into court the full bid price.
2_2005skqb513.txt,"FIAT: The parties are the parents of a son born April 10, 2003. They are married and the family home is in Connecticut. The respondent mother is a Canadian citizen and has returned to Canada and now resides in Laird, Saskatchewan. The petitioner is an American citizen and continues to reside in Connecticut and brings an application under The International Child Abduction Act for an order directing the child to be returned to Connecticut. HELD: The respondent is directed to return the child to the State of Connecticut by January 8, 2006.  1) The child was born in Canada. He and his mother joined his father in Connecticut one month later in May 2003. In February 2004 the child and his mother returned to Canada for a planned one-month visit. It is clear that the petitioner did not consent to the prolonged absence of the respondent and the child. In about November 2004 the respondent and the child returned to Connecticut and resumed living with the petitioner. Reconciliation was attempted. The respondent and child left in December 2004 and have not returned. The crystallizing moment was in March 2004 when the respondent did not return from her trip to Canada. For the purposes of the Convention, circumstances should be examined to determine habitual residence. At this point the parties had adopted traditional roles. The respondent was at home raising the child and the petitioner was attending his duties in the navy. Through their conduct the parties had evidenced a settled intention to make their home in Connecticut. The respondent chose to unilaterally remove the child from that home. 2) The petitioner had obtained an interim order in February 2005 directing the child to be returned to Connecticut. He also pursued his case in the Superior Court in Connecticut and on October 2005 obtained an order dissolving the marriage, directing the respondent to return the child to Connecticut and granted the petitioner sole custody. The respondent now asks that any order directing her and the child to return should be conditional on the petitioner varying the order he obtained in October 2005, vacating the award of sole custody to the petitioner and replacing it with something in the nature of joint custody. The conditional return order proposed by the respondent is inappropriate. Having determined that an order for return is warranted under the Convention, it does not lie with a Saskatchewan Court to impose a revised starting point for the process of determining custody in Connecticut. This Court's role concludes upon the determination the petitioner has made out a case for an order for return.","FIAT: The parties are the parents of a child born in April 2003. They were married in Connecticut and the family home was in Connecticut. The respondent mother, Canadian citizen, now resides in Saskatchewan. The petitioner father brings an application under The International Child Abduction Act for an order directing the child to be returned to Connecticut. HELD: 1) The case law is at odds as to whether reference should be had to the domestic statute when addressing the issue of habitual residency under the Convention. It is absolutely clear that the petitioner did not consent to the respondent and Joshua's prolonged absence in Canada. When they did not return, the consent was implicitly withdrawn and at that point for the purposes of the Convention, the child was granted sole custody. 2) The parties have concluded that the child's habitual residence is and was Connecticut. There is no suggestion that the exceptions under the Articles 12, 13 or 20 are applicable. The Court concludes that the statutory definition of habitual residence under The Children's Law Act, 1997 is not in conflict with the case law developed under the convention. 3) The Court was impressed with the lawyer who argued that the chasing order, particularly now that it has finalized sole custody in the name of the petitioner, should prompt the Court to make an order of return conditional upon the child having returned."

This fiat concerned several documents. The Crown had already disclosed the contents of each of these documents and the only matter remaining in issue was the name of the lawyer who released the information. This arose as a result of the action of a Regina lawyer who had improperly revealed information from two of his divorce clients with respect to the charges against LaPorte et al.

3_2001nssc117.txt,"The plaintiffs were Sergeants in the Town of Bedford Police Department. Following amalgamation and before any collective agreement was concluded, the Chief of the amalgamated force issued a department order declaring that all persons in the position of the plaintiffs would be referred to as a level two Sergeant which created a two-tier structure within the Sergeant rank. The bargaining agent for the union declined to process a grievance on behalf of the plaintiffs and agreed with the two-tiered structure which was eventually incorporated into the collective agreement. After unsuccessfully complaining to the Nova Scotia Police Commission and the Halifax Regional Board of Police Commissioners, the plaintiffs commenced an action alleging that the creation of the two-tiered structure was a violation of the Police Act and adversely affected their employment rights. The intervenor union brought an application to strike the plaintiffs' proceeding on the basis that the court lacked jurisdiction to hear the matter. Application granted; proceeding stayed pending submission to arbitration or any other form of proceeding that is permitted under the statutory enactments applicable; if no application is made to lift the stay within two years, the action will stand dismissed. Where there is a threshold question of whether the dispute is arbitrable, that decision should initially be made, absent very limited exceptions, by an arbitrator and not by the court. It is irrelevant if the plaintiffs have now lost their rights to initiate the arbitration process.","The Halifax Regional Municipality Act, effective as April 1, 1996, provided for the amalgamation of the municipal police forces into the Halifax Regional municipality. The plaintiffs were part of a Bargaining Unit represented by the Municipal Association of Police Personnel (MAPP). The issues raised by the plaintiffs were whether the two-tier system for a sergeant violated s. 35(1) of the Regulations made under the Police Act, and whether this constituted an exclusive mechanism for the resolution of the plaintiff's dispute. HELD: The statement of claim was struck out. The court held that it had jurisdiction to deal with the subject matter of whether the collective agreement violated its provisions. It held that, in determining whether the dispute arises from the collective agreements, a dispute arises out of them. This is especially so when it is considered whether there is an effective remedy."

The father applied to vary child support in November on the basis of his reduced income. HELD: The application was dismissed with costs to the petitioner fixed at $1,000. The onus is on the applicant to provide cogent, independent or objective verification of change of circumstances. This application was brought 10 months after the pre-trial conference. It was of no consequence that someone may come into the home rather than using commercial day care service. There was no change in the father's hours of work or the schedule. The only change was that the mother was no longer available to provide care during Saturday of his access weekends. The mother was not to schedule activities during the father's access periods without his consent and he was to provide 7 days written notice if he chooses not to exercise access during specified times. This was not a variation of the custody/access regime but rather specific directions to provide some predictability for the children.","The parties applied to vary the child support provisions of the consent judgment, including his contribution to child care expenses and access provisions. The respondent claimed his income had been reduced and referred to his 1999 tax return indicating an income of $42,386.34.

HELD: The application was dismissed with costs to the petitioner fixed in the amount of $1,000. 1)The parties agreed upon a standard of living based upon his reported income but rather on his true income including cash and unreported income. There had been no material change in the circumstances of the children since the consent judgement as there had been some change in their circumstances. 2)The respondent was ordered not to schedule activities for the children during the respondent's access periods without his consent.

The plaintiff claims she told the Town Office to shut off her water supply and the failure to do so let to the damages being sustained. HELD: The claim is dismissed. 1) There is no evidence that the plaintiff gave clear instructions to the town to shut off her water. 2) The proximate cause of the damage was turning off the heat and power without ensuring that water line, toilets, and the water tank had been properly drained. 3) The plaintiff sustained no damages herself. She admits she negotiated the sale price of $50,000 with her daughter prior to any damage being sustained to the property. No adjustment had to be made to her daughter thereafter for any 'loss' occasioned. Any claim would have to be made by her daughter not her.","The plaintiff brought an action for water damage sustained to her former residence when frozen pipes burst in the basement of her home. She alleged that she instructed the Town Office to shut off her water supply and the failure to do so led to the damages being sustained. The plaintiff’s claim was dismissed. The court could not find clear instructions were given to the town to disconnect the water service. The form executed by the plaintiff clearly indicated request for final billing. The evidence demonstrated a misunderstanding at best between what the plaintiff believed she was requesting and what in fact she did instruct. This cannot be construed as negligence in the circumstances by the town nor does the fact that specific forms are now utilized for disconnect purposes, elevate the likelihood of the plaintiff suffering damage to her property."

Corrigendum received dated March 19, 2010 and added to fulltext.","The accused entered a guilty plea to committing an assault causing bodily harm contrary to s. 267(b) of the Criminal Code. After the plea was entered, the accused and another accused entered into a plea agreement to commit the assault without any real explanation for doing so. The victim had been affected significantly by the assault and the accused tended to minimize his responsibility in the pre-sentence report, which did not accurately reflect the facts placed before the court by the Crown in its submissions on sentence and those facts accepted by the accused through their counsel. HELD: The accused was sentenced to a fine of $1,500 plus a probation order for two years. The court ordered him to comply with the terms of the probation order and imposed a suspended sentence with strict conditions. 1)The victim was a valued employee of the company for three years. He was employed consistently for all but two years since his fifteenth birthday. He is now 42 years old. He has some experience with alcohol and drug use. The nature of the offence itself is aggravating. The accused participated in gratuitous violence without any actual explanation for why he did so. 2)The accused has a previous criminal record as an adult and as a youth. He tended to emphasize his responsibility for the offence, even though this is not being stressed by the police. The principles of sentencing and parity demand similar sentences in the circumstances. 3)A fine plus probation order with strict terms can accomplish the principles of sentence as outlined in s. 732.1(5). The victim was the first person to be affected by this crime. The circumstances were aggravating, taking into account both the facts and the mitigating factors. The Court found that a fine plus a victim fine surcharge would be appropriate in the circumstance."

There was an appeal from a decision in the Supreme Court which held that the action by the appellant was against actions of 'an employer', not of his employer.

Allowing the appeal and varying the sentence to nine months, that while perjury is a very serious offence, the sentence exceeded the range imposed for offences of this nature.","The appellant was charged with perjury in connection with a break, enter and theft incident. He pled guilty to the charge, giving false testimony with intent to mislead the court. The sentence of two years was reduced to nine months imprisonment, based on the opinion the trial judge committed no error in principle. The aggravating factors were: he felt intimidated, that the evidence was not given for his own benefit and that he had no criminal record other than his own conviction for break, enters and theft."
2008skqb146.txt,"FIAT: The parties have three children, Jill born December 1981, Luke born May 1986 and Keegan born November 1989. The respondent states that he has paid child support pursuant to the court order of February 2000 but, when the children reached the age of majority, he reduced the amount of child support payable as the children became independent and moved out on their own. The petitioner takes issue with the respondent's unilateral reduction in child support and submits the children remained children within the meaning of the Divorce Act so long as they were attending university. The parties agree that given the age of the children there has been a change in circumstance sufficient to allow a review of the existing child support order. HELD: 1) The parties agree that Jill, age 26 is no longer a child of the marriage and that Luke, age 21 is not presently a child of the marriage but could once again become a child of the marriage if he attends university in the fall of 2008. The parties also agree Keegan is 18 and remains a child of the marriage by virtue of the fact that he is taking classes at the university. 2) While the respondent asks that he be allowed to pay child support directly to the children, there is nothing in the material filed which would indicate that the petitioner is not providing support to the child in an appropriate fashion. Further, the difficulties that would arise in respect to enforcement of the order if the child support payments were not made directly to the petitioner would mitigate against such a variation.","FIAT: The parties filed an application for an order varying child support. The declaration that the children were no longer children of the marriage and that they no longer be children within the meaning of the Divorce Act was granted in May 1999. In August 2007, the petitioner filed a maintenance enforcement application for the child support payable by the respondent. The parties agree that given the age of the children, and the change in the amount of the respondent's income, that there has been a change in circumstances sufficient to allow a review of the existing child support order. HELD: 1) It is well-settled that full time attendance in a post-secondary education program may result in a child over a age of majority qualifying as a 'child' within the Meaning of the Act. 2) If the respondent is to have paid $380 per month plus 33% of s. expenses, with such payments to continue on the first day of each and every month until such time as the child, Keegan, is no longer a child within that meaning of it. 3) In the case of Bowman v. Bowman, 2005 SKQB (CanLII), 260 Sask. R. 312, the Court of Appeal suggested a three step process in dealing with support orders for children who have reached the Age of majority. Each case must be considered on its own facts. The guiding principle is reasonableness.  4) Although initially the parties were at odds concerning all three children, by the time of their latest submissions some consensus had been reached regarding two of them. The respondent's share would be 33% or $2,667 and the parties agreed that Luke, now 26 years old and on his own and could once again become a child, but only if he attends university as he intends. The Court of Justice agreed that given their age and the children attending university and working part-time, there had been a dramatic change in circumstance sufficient to permit the Court to consider whether the respondent was providing support to Keegan in an appropriate fashion."
9_2006skca114.txt,"This is an application for leave to appeal, and leave being granted, an appeal by the Crown from a sentence imposed against a young offender pursuant to the Youth Criminal Justice Act. The respondent pled guilty to a charge of robbery, an offence contrary to s. 344(b) of the Criminal Code. The respondent was sentenced to 90 days secure custody, 45 days community supervision, 1 year probation and a 10 year firearms prohibition. HELD: Appeal allowed orally. The sentence is set aside and a sentence of 12 months closed custody, 6 months community supervision, 1 year probation and a 10 year firearms prohibition was imposed in addition to the 90 days closed custody already served at the time of the appeal.  1) It was clear that the primary concern of the sentencing judge was that, in the wake of the Supreme Court of Canada decision in R. v. B.W.P.; R. v. B.V.N. 2006 SCC 27, a custodial sentence might not be open to him at all. It is the Court's view that the sentencing judge's conclusion that the decision in B.W.P. virtually ruled out custodial sentences for young persons under the Youth Criminal Justice Act was unwarranted. The gist of that decision is that under the Act the principle of general deterrence is not a factor to be taken into account and cannot be used to justify a sentence harsher than the circumstances of the offender and the offence would warrant. Nor is specific deterrence to be considered as a separate factor. 2) It is the Court's view that a long custodial sentence is necessary to accomplish the task of bringing the seriousness of the offence to the respondent's attention, and provide meaningful consequences to reinforce societal values without negatively affecting the respondent's likelihood of rehabilitation.","This was an application for leave to appeal and, leave being granted, an appeal by the Crown from a sentence imposed against a young offender pursuant to the Youth Criminal Justice Act. The respondent had pled guilty to a charge of robbery, an offence contrary to s. 344(b) of the Criminal Code, and was sentenced to 90 days secure custody, 45 days community supervision, one year probation and a 10 year firearms prohibition. The Crown appealed the sentence, which was set aside and a sentence of 12 months closed custody, 6 months community supervision and a 1 year firearms ban. HELD: Appeal allowed orally. 1) The sentence imposed was demonstrably unfit, failing to take into account the seriousness of the offence, the culpability of the respondent, the criminal history and other circumstances of the offender, and his need for psychological and substance abuse counseling and further education.  2) The respondent was already served the 90 day closed custody portion of the sentence originally imposed. That sentence is to be set aside. In addition to the time already served, the respondent is to serve 12 months in closed custody to be followed by 7 months community policing. There is no suggestion in the decision that deterrence was factor taken into account."

The sentence was imposed for robbery with threats of violence contrary to s.348(1)(b) and s.334(2) of the Criminal Code which were committed in March 2000 while the accused was on probation. The appellant and co-accused were convicted of breaking and entering a private residence. The accused took $25 from the premises and held the 68 year old victim while the co-accused went to look for a knife after threatening to cut off his fingers. The following day the two accused used threats of violence while robbing a pharmacy and a witness testified the accused yelled to the co-accused to kill the victims. The co-accused who was convicted of assault received 7 years in prison for the robbery concurrent with 5 years for the B &amp; E. The 23 year old aboriginal who had a Grade 3 education had a prior record of 42 criminal convictions including eight violent or weapons related offences. HELD: Leave was granted. The appeal was allowed. The sentence of 4 years in prison on each charge to be served concurrently took into account time served on remand and electronic monitoring. The sentence was demonstrably unfit and fell outside the range of sentences previously imposed. The sentencing judge relied solely on the principle of rehabilitation, essentially ignoring the other sentencing principles including the level of gravity, the principle of deterrence, the need to denounce such acts, the sentence imposed on the co-accused, and the need to protect the public. A sentencing circle was inappropriate given the level of violence, his risk to re-offend, his consistent ignoring or refusal to follow court orders, and the fact that a penitentiary term was called for in such circumstances. He had violated various forms of community release orders including bail and probation 16 times. He had a history of drug and alcohol abuse and had not attended treatment.","The Crown sought leave to appeal the sentence imposed on the respondent after a sentencing circle. The Crown had sought leave from the Court of Appeal in connection with two previous offences of robbery and robbery with threats of violence contrary to s.348(1)(b) and 334(2) of the Criminal Code. The respondent was 23 years old aboriginal and had a prior record consisting of 42 criminal convictions including eight violent or weapons related offences. He had violated various forms of community release orders including bail and probation orders some 16 times. He was considered high risk to reoffend. HELD: The Crown appeal was allowed. The sentence imposed was set aside and a sentence of four years imprisonment from this date on each charge to be served concurrently. This sentence takes into account the time the respondent served both on remand and on electronic monitoring. 1)The sentencing circle was inappropriate in these circumstances given the level of violence, the respondent's high risk of reoffence, his consistent ignoring of or refusing to follow court orders and the fact a penitentiary term was called for. The order was inappropriate and the ordering of a sentence circle was appropriate given the levels of violence and the high risk he was at the time of the offences. The co-accused received a seven year concurrent sentence for robbery and five years concurrent on the breaking and entering. The main player was the co-occused who had received a 7 year sentence for the break and entering and was sentenced to 7 years concurrent for the breaking & entering and 5 years concurrent concurrent for drug and alcohol abuse. The 23 year old aboriginal had a previous record of 42 arrests, mostly for breaking and enter and was considered at high risk for reoffending. He displayed a high level of risk to offend, his repeated ignoring of court order orders and refusal to follow orders lead to the conclusion the sentence is inadequate and the public must be protected from this type of criminal behaviour and more severe sentences are called for.(1)The ordering of sentencing circles was inappropriate, inappropriate in the circumstances and we are all of the view leave should be granted and the appeal allowed."

The plaintiff applies for summary judgment pursuant to Rule 485 of the Queen's Bench Rules. The parties agree that damages should be assessed on the basis of the affidavit evidence. HELD: 1) The defendant pled guilty to a charge of assault causing bodily harm. He was sentenced to a fine of $1,500, placed on probation for 18 months and ordered to make restitution to the plaintiff for the cost of the dental work in the amount of $3,263.30. 2) The plaintiff suffered serious injuries and significant pain for a number of months after the assault. Extensive dental treatment was required and will be required at some point in the future. The plaintiff has minimal scarring. He is awarded general damages of $12,500. 3) The pleadings and the affidavit evidence do not support a substantial award for aggravated damages. However, the photographs graphically depict the extent to which his appearance was altered. Hurt feelings can reasonably be inferred from the fact that the plaintiff was rendered unconscious on the ground in a crowd of onlookers. These circumstances justify an award of aggravated damages in the sum of $2,000. 4) The plaintiff was awarded special damages in the amount of $1,911.70.","The plaintiff was standing with other patrons near the entrance to a pub when the defendant punched him in the face and knocked unconscious. The plaintiff claims damages for injuries sustained in the assault. Liability is admitted and the plaintiff now applies for summary judgment and an assessment of damages pursuant to Rule 485.

Extensive dental treatment was required and further treatment will be required in the future. Excluding any component for aggravated damages, a fair award for general damages is $12,500. 2) Aggravated damages are simply variety (or possibly sub-head) of non-pecuniary damages. They too compensate for intangible loss, but in particular for hurt feelings caused by the nature of the plaintiff's defendant's conduct. While some of the plaintiffs' injuries were serious and not life-threatening, they did have some minimal scarring and disfigurement, which were not significant. Excluded any component of aggravated damages the court concludes that a fair value for general damage is $13,500, plus costs and pre-judgment interest. 3) The plaintiff was awarded $16,411.70 plus costs."
6_2000skqb94.txt,"A jury determined the plaintiff was constructively dismissed from his employment as park superintendent in 1997 and awarded damages for failure to give reasonable notice. The defendant claimed the contract of employment was all inclusive; that the plaintiff exaggerated the amount of time he spent on the job in winter; that the reduced winter hours were not in lieu of overtime pay as he was a manager within the meaning of s.4(2) of the LSA; the doctrine of estoppel or waiver applied as he never claimed a right to holiday pay for 10 years and the employer relied on his not doing so; if the plaintiff is entitled to holiday pay he should only recover back to April 1990 as he is limited by the Limitation of Actions Act; it should not be based on wages plus truck allowance as wages as defined in the LSA does not include allowances for costs. The claim for unpaid holiday pay claimed from April 1988 to October 1997, based on his wages plus one-half his truck expense allowance, was reserved pending a decision by the Court of Appeal as to whether the Court of Queen's Bench has jurisdiction to determine the issue of entitlement to holiday pay. HELD: The claim was dismissed with costs.  1)The Court of Appeal held in Kolodziejski v. Auto Electric Service that the Queens' Bench has jurisdiction to entertain a civil action for non-payment of holiday pay. 2)The plaintiff may rely on s.30(1) of the LSA to establish he is entitled to holidays and on s.33 to establish he entitled to pay in lieu of taking holidays. The onus then shifts to the defendant to prove it complied with some exception in the LSA. Section 75 prevents an employee from waiving his or her entitlement. Whether the plaintiff asserted his right to holiday pay or not, he remained entitled to his annual holidays in accordance with the LSA. 3)The plaintiff can claim for any holiday pay in lieu of time off that he can establish he was entitled to from April 1990 to his termination date. Section 3(1)(f)of the LAA states that a cause of action for recovery of money under a contract, express or implied, must be commenced within 6 years of the date on which the cause arose. 4)The plaintiff clearly indicated that a portion of the truck allowance was made to avoid paying tax. As such it would be contrary to public policy for the Court to appear to endorse the plaintiff's actions by calculating his holiday pay on the basis of his wage and this portion of his truck allowance.  5)The defendant's position that the contract included a component of holiday pay each month was inconsistent with its position that the plaintiff took these days off as holidays during the year. The contract of employment did not include a component of holiday pay in lieu of time off.  6)Failure by the defendant to keep records for the purpose of inspection by the minister does not result in a reverse onus. The onus remains on the plaintiff to establish what holidays he did not take. 7)The plaintiff admitted to taking time away from his duties for personal time and for city business as mayor. The plaintiff was not there in his capacity as superintendent. Section 31(1)(b) indicates that an employee shall be permitted to take holidays in one uninterrupted period. The defendant allowed the plaintiff to take days off in any manner he chose. It was inconsistent that the plaintiff's failure to comply with the notice requirement meant for the benefit of the employer could be used by an employee to disclaim that his days off were holidays. 8)The plaintiff was clearly a manager within the meaning of LSA. Even if he were not a manager, he failed to prove, on a balance of probabilities that he worked overtime hours in excess of the statutory minimum in order to qualify for overtime. Any days off taken by the plaintiff could not be considered taken in lieu of overtime. The days he was away were holidays as defined in s.30 of the LSA. 9)He did not establish he did 3 weeks holidays.","The plaintiff sued for damages from the defendant alleging he was constructively wrongfully dismissed from his employment with the defendant. The plaintiff elected to have the determination of liability and the assessment of damages determined by a civil jury. The issue of whether the defendant's jurisdiction to deal with holiday pay was severed from the jury and left in reserve until the Court of Appeal renders its decision. HELD: 1)The plaintiff's hours of work were very flexible in the winter. Even if the plaintiff was entitled to holiday pay in lieu of time off, the plaintiff should be considered to have waived this entitlement by his conduct over the years. The defendant asserted that the plaintiff never claimed his right to holidays or holiday pay for 10 years and that the defendant relied on the plaintiff's conduct in this regard. 2)There were several preliminary issues which must be dealt with. The first issue was the amount on which any holiday pay should be based, in the event the plaintiff is awarded damages. The second issue was holiday pay. The court referred to Kolodziejski v. Auto Electric Service Ltd. (1999), 177 Sask. R. 197. 3)In the alternative, the defendant claims that the doctrine of estoppel or waiver should apply to prevent the plaintiff from claiming his entitlement to holidays. The onus rests with the plaintiff. It would be contrary to public policy for this Court to appear to endorse the plaintiff’s actions by calculating his holiday pay on the basis of his wage and this portion of his truck allowance. The plaintiffs work obligations remained the same under the agreement. The Court held that the allowance was really wage disguised for the purposes of avoiding paying income tax. The doctrine of de novo should apply if the court finds the plaintiff has been habitually dismissed or the plaintiff did not observe holiday pay and therefore cannot be faulted for it. The argument that holiday pay is a waste of time and money should be paid to the plaintiff to avoid taxation is not supported by the evidence. 3)'The plaintiff clearly indicated that the $250.00 portion of the truck allowance was made to avoid paying tax. He may rely on s.33 to establish that he is entitled to holidays in lieuof taking holidays. As such, it would be perverse for the plaintiff not to have claimed holiday pay any more than 10 years. 4)The first issue would be the jurisdiction of the Court to determine the entitlement to holiday compensation. The presumption that arises out of the LSA is that it is rebuttable presumption arising out of a presumption in the Act"
b_1995canlii6024.txt,"The accuseds were charged under ss.300 and 301 of the Code with (i)committing and (ii)publishing a defamatory libel against a police officer. They filed a plea of justification as permitted under s.611(1) of the Code. The Crown denied the truth of the plea pursuant to s.611(4) and the matter proceeded to trial. At the opening of their trial the accuseds applied for an order declaring ss.300 and 301 of the Criminal Code to be of no force and effect on the basis that they constituted an unreasonable limitation on their rights and freedoms guaranteed under ss.2, 7 and 11 of the Charter. The Crown admitted that ss.300 and 301 limited an individual's right to freedom of expression as provided by s.2 of the Charter but argued that this infringement was justified under s.1 of the Charter. HELD: Application allowed in part.  1)The onus of justifying the limitation of a right or freedom is on the party seeking to uphold the limitation and the standard of proof is by a preponderance of probability. 2)The standards against which a limit on a right or freedom guaranteed by the Charter can be shown to be reasonable and demonstrably justified are those underlying values and principles essential to a free and democratic society. While the right of free speech is important in our society, it is not unrestricted. 3)In order to justify an infringement of this right, it must be shown that: (i)the impugned legislative provision has an objective of pressing and substantial concern and (ii)there is a proportionality to the legislation in that: (a)the measures must be fair and not arbitrary, carefully designed to achieve the objective in question and rationally connected to the objective; (b)the means should impair freedom of expression as little as possible; (c)there must be a proportionality between the effects of the limiting legislation and the objective. S.300 of the Code meets these tests, and is therefore a reasonable limit on free speech and is valid. 4)Ss.611 and 612 of the Code, which permit a plea of justification do not create a reverse onus on the accused. They are procedural and merely serve to put the Crown on notice as to the accused's defence. The Crown must still prove that the alleged defamatory libel is knowingly false beyond a reasonable doubt. 5)S.301 of the Code makes it an offence to publish a defamatory libel whether or not the accused believes it to be true. S.301 is therefore not a reasonable limit and is invalid. ADDENDUM: The Court ordered that the agreed statement of facts set out at pp. 2 and 3 of the judgment not be published nor broadcast in any manner.","The accused applied for a declaration that s.300 of the Criminal Code constitutes an unreasonable limitation of one or more of the rights and freedoms guaranteed by s.2, s.3(c) and s.11(d) of the Charter and a Declaration that section 300 and 301 of the Code fail to describe an offence known in law and are of no force. HELD: 1)The accused were found guilty of three counts of defamatory libel and one count of publishing without lawful justification or excuse that was likely to injure the reputation of the police officer knowing that the matter published was false. 2)There was no violation of s. 11(c), s. 2(b) or s. 3(d). Of the four provisions which the Crown could not force into law, only s. 300 had an adverse effect on free and democratic society. 3)The Court must consider all expression that is potentially restricted by ss.300 as a reasonable limit prescribed by law, not only the expressions involved in this particular case."

The parties agree that the calculation of the IRB as provided by s. 117 of the Act is the annualized sum of $28,889.75. The appellant takes issue with SGI's reduction of the amount determined in accordance with s. 117 of the Act by calculating the appellant's net income in accordance with s. 135 to s. 138 of the Act. HELD: SGI has correctly calculated the appellant's IRB when it made the requisite deductions as set out in s. 137 to find the appellant's net income, and then reduced the net income to 90% to determine his IRB. It would be neither a rational nor fair interpretation to reduce a full-time earner's IRB by 90% and not the other types of earners. It would be neither a rational nor fair interpretation to deduct income tax, employment insurance premiums and Canada Pension contributions from only full-time earners. All earners are subject to these payments being deducted from their income but for their inability to earn an income because of an automobile accident. The further deductions to obtain the non- earner's IRB are in keeping with his earning reality.","The respondent was paid an amount less than that of the respondent. The respondent appealed the decision of the trial judge which held that the respondent's IRB for the 181st and subsequent days following an accident should not be less than the IRB calculated for the first 180 days after the accident as determined pursuant to s. 116 of the Automobile Accident Insurance Act. The appellant argued that the Act is intended to correlate the non-earner's income replacement benefit (IRB) against which s. 117(4) is designed to be measured is that of a 'weighted average' calculation. The parties brought the matter back for further determination because SGI was paying the respondent an amount lesser than that. HELD: 1) The trial judge's determination of the calculation of the IRBs for the 180 day period was correctly calculated. 2) The respondent was paying an amount slightly less than what the respondent was receiving. The Court of Appeal referred the matter of determination of SGI's determination for the post 180 day periods to the Saskatchewan Court of appeal. The Saskatchewan court of appeal referred to s136(1) as meaning 'governed by' or 'affected by' the other provisions of the Act. 3) The interpretation of s117 of the act and Regulations was upheld by the Saskatchewan court. 4) SGI is subservient to s117 and no further reduction ought to be made. 5) The provision of section 117, in effect at the relevant time, states: 'If, as result of an accident, a victim is entitled to an income replacement benefits and disability benefit pursuant to the Canada Pension Plan or any similar program in jurisdiction outside Saskatchewan, the insurer shall reduce the income replacement beneficiary by the amount of the disability benefit payable to the victim.' 6) The hearing judge raised no concern with respect to the 'weighting average approach' used by SGI in calculating the IRBT for the nonearner. The Act is to be calculated in accordance with the pre-judgment interest act. It strives for one's earning reality. non-income earners are subject to these payments being deducted from their income but for their inability to earn an income because of an automobile accident.

4_2004nsfc6.txt,"The Agency brought an application for a finding that the Respondent had abused a child, for the purposes of entering his name in the Child Abuse Register. The complainant described certain incidents that amounted to sexual assault when she was under the age of 16. The Respondent had previously been acquitted of charges based on the same allegations in criminal court. The Respondent has abused a child within the meaning of the Act. Although the standard of proof is on the balance of probabilities, it is elevated with the seriousness of the allegations and their implications. However, it is considerably less than proof beyond a reasonable doubt.","The Agency applied for a finding that the father had abused a child pursuant to s. 62(a) or (c) of the Children and Family Services Act. The mother of the child, who was fifteen years old at the time of the alleged sexual assault, testified that she had been sexually assaulted by the father. The father was seventy-seven years old and had never been married or lived with a woman, just the father; he was never a married man, had been a person under sixteen years of age; and he had sexual contact with the daughter when she was eleven or twelve years old. The evidence of the daughter's alleged sexual assaults had more probability of truth than disbelief."
4_2000canlii2633.txt,"The parties were married for 14 years and separated in 1995, entering into a detailed Separation Agreement in 1998. The two children of the marriage are 16 and 8 years of age. There was a long history of relatively short terms of employment and several moves to take employment. The respondent had a grade 12 education and some university courses but no practical skills or training. For the past 3 years, the respondent had made no reasonable efforts for employment, developed no skills of a practical nature, and derived her income from child support payments and the Child Tax Credit and by incurring debt in excess of $20,000.00 The parties had entered bankruptcy during the course of the marriage and had no assets or savings or pension entitlement at the time of separation or acquired since. The petitioner now earned an annual salary of $115,500.00. The Agreement did not address the level of child support in accordance with the Federal Child Support Guidelines, nor did it provide for practical retaining by the Respondent to facilitate employment. This was an exceptional situation that required some adjustment to the Agreement reached by the parties. The court ordered the establishment of a retraining fund of $6,500.00 with direct payments to whatever institution the Respondent may choose. Limited spousal support was to terminate on the earlier of completion of the retraining allowance or transfer of the balance of the outstanding to the Respondent on September 1st, 2001. An adjustment was also made to account for arrears in child support and child support payments.","The parties were married for 14 years and had two children, ages 16 and 8. There had been a number of interim applications and interim orders since the separation, most of which related to the respondent's failure to pay child support which was related to previous access costs. The respondent now plans to pay $150,000 of child support available through employment which provides 80% coverage for his children and 20% for his common-law spouse. The Corollary Relief Judgment will be incorporated into the judgment. HELD: 1) The parties have never had any financial stability in part because they far too readily accessed credit based on future expectations of capacity that have never been realized and they would be wise to cease utilization of credit for short term relief. Doing so in the long run imperils the ability to provide properly for the children. 2) The respondent's income for child support is fixed at $6,875 U.S. per month and the amount is $4,800 for holidays with his sons. The amount of travel expenses is $83.00 per month for the transfer of American funds to Canada by draft. Access costs as agreed to are entirely and solely the responsibility of the respondent. He must keep himself current with respect to child support. His use of credit card for access and other expenses is entirely his personal choice. It is very clear that these parties had never had a financial stability, either because they have been far too accustomed to credit for their income and to the fact that they have not had any stability in the entire 14 years of cohabitation or since. 3) There is no legal requirement of a party having independent legal advice. When the parties fail to direct their attention to a significant feature, the court may address such an omission. If there has been extreme emotional turmoil so that one can conclude a reasonable person in the absence of such turmoil would have addressed a specific concern, then such an Agreement is open to variation by the court. It must be acknowledged that if the Agreement contained a level of support consistent with the Federal Child Support Guidelines and had been in form acceptable to the Prothonotary Office, then quite probably the Divorce Judgment would have been granted as of that date. Alternatively, s.15(3) of the divorce act would have invoked."

The defendants had previously been permitted to re-open judgments obtained against them and had filed defences. Prior to that they had consistently failed to attend examinations in aid of execution. Contempt proceedings had been commenced against them but were adjourned sine die at the time the defendants were permitted to defend.

The examinations had been scheduled unilaterally because the defendants' solicitor consistently refused or neglected to return phone calls or correspondence from the plaintiff's solicitors. HELD: The judge refused to strike the defences holding that in the circumstances Queen's Bench Rule 231 did not apply. He also held that the defendants, considering their conduct throughout the whole course of the lawsuit, were in contempt and ordered them to attend without conduct money any examinations unilaterally scheduled by the plaintiff failing agreement between counsel as to dates. Costs were fixed at $1,500 in any event of the cause and were ordered to be paid within two weeks.","The plaintiff applied to strike the statement of defence of the corporate defendant on the ground that the designated officer of the corporation failed to appear at an examination for discovery on the same grounds. The corporate defendant solicitor had on several occasions telephoned the plaintiff's solicitors to schedule examinations for discovery and to obtain statements as to documents. The plaintiff had then withdrawn his solicitor and the defendants became represented by their current solicitor. HELD: The applications were dismissed. 1)The corporate defendant was to serve and file its statements of defence. 2)The non-attendances did not constitute'refusing or neglecting to attend' within the meaning of Rule 231. It could not be utilized respecting the particular non- attendances to strike their statement of defense. On the basis of their conduct throughout the whole of these proceedings, the defendants were guilty of contempt of court. The contempt proceedings were still before the court even though they were adjourned sine die at the time the defendants had permitted to file statements of Defence. 3)As the plaintiff now apparently resided out of province, they were not compellable to attend the scheduled examinations. 4)The defendants were to serve their statements asto documents within 14 days of the date of this order. 5)The plaintiff was awarded costs of the applications in any event of the cause."
1998canlii3382.txt,"The appellant employer and the respondent union are parties to a collective agreement with effect from January 1, 1994 to December 31, 1996. The collective agreement established employee salaries for that period, with annual adjustments on January 1st of each year. Shortly before the agreement was signed, the Public Sector Compensation Act was passed, which rolled back and froze public sector salaries. In a letter to the union, the employer confirmed the wage increases provided for in the agreement would be paid to the employees as a lump sum following the expiration of the legislated wage freeze. After the expiration of the wage freeze, however, the employer refused to pay the lump sum on the grounds that it would contravene the Act. The union sued the employer in the Supreme Court, claiming the lump sum or, in the alternative, damages for negligent misrepresentation. The employer applied to strike the Statement of Claim on the grounds that the union's claims were within the exclusive jurisdiction of an arbitrator. The Chambers judge dismissed the application. The employer appealed. Allowing the appeal and staying the action pending submission to arbitration as provided for in the collective agreement, that the Chambers judge erred in allowing the action to continue. Where there is a doubt about the arbitrability of a dispute, that issue should generally be determined at arbitration. This reflects the central role of arbitration in collective bargaining labour relations, recognizes that arbitration is the forum best suited to conducting the necessary inquiry, and helps ensure that no one, absent sound reasons, will be left with rights but no effective remedy.","The appellant was an employer and the respondent union. By successorship, they were parties to a collective agreement signed in 1994. The collective agreement establishes employee salaries for that period, with annual adjustments for each year. The union opposed the employer's application to strike the union's statement of claim on the grounds that the claims were outside the exclusive jurisdiction of an arbitrator. The employer appealed, seeking leave for this purpose. At issue was whether the letter of July 22 was an ancillary document and whether it forms part of the collective agreement. Appeal allowed; the Chambers judge dismissed the application; the appeal was directed to arbitration. There were four considerations that supported the conclusion that, where there is a doubt about the arbitrability of the dispute, that issue should generally be determined initially at arbitration."
