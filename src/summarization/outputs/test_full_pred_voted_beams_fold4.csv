1991canlii4370.txt,"The defendant lawyer was retained for the purpose of obtaining and disbursing mortgage funds. The plaintiffs, creditors of the defendant's client, sued the defendant for negligent misrepresentation, breach of trust and breach of undertaking. The defendant initially received three irrevocable letters of direction for payment of amounts owing on a construction project. When the project got into financial difficulty the defendant advised his client to seek separate counsel to deal with the creditors - suppliers. At a creditors meeting the defendant advised the creditors' counsel of the initial three letters of direction. The project was considered viable by the creditors and continued, with the defendant obtaining postponements of the three letters of direction. Further creditors' meetings were held, a Creditors' Committee struck, and subsequent letters of direction sent to the defendant by the client and certain creditors. The defendant, in acknowledging a subsequent letter of direction, made no mention of the earlier three letters, nor any explanation of 'all of the proceeds'. One member of the Committee was aware of the initial irrevocable letters of direction. On what was to be the final mortgage draw, the defendant requested and was refused a postponement of the initial three letters. With his client's consent, the defendant disbursed the funds, to pay off the initial three creditors, a mechanics' lien referred in one of the subsequent letters of direction, his legal fees and the balance as per a letter of direction received from two of three members of the Creditors' Committee. Dismissing the action, that (1) there was no negligent misrepresentation as the creditors had continued to advance supplies, not on the basis of the defendant's letter of acknowledgement, but because they considered the project viable. Further, certain other plaintiffs were not aware of the letter, and could not have relied on it. Other plaintiffs did not supply after the letter and therefore did not rely on it. The Court noted that on a balance of probabilities, the defendant's disbursement did not cause the demise of the project. At the time of the disbursement the project was still viable and the plaintiffs made their own decision to cease supplying and to lien the project;  (2) there was no breach of trust as the defendant had no fiduciary duty and had at no time acted for the plaintiffs;  and  (3) there was no breach of undertaking as the undertaking must be considered in all the circumstances, including knowledge of the plaintiffs, the other letters and meetings. The Court concluded that the member of the Creditors' Committee who was aware of the initial irrevocable letters had a duty to advise the other members. The documentation was clear that legal fees would be deducted and the Committee was also aware of the direction to pay the mechanics' lien.","The plaintiff sought to have the defendant's counsel disburse funds from mortgage advances made to various creditors. The defendant had received a number of irrevocable letters of direction which he acknowledged were in fact in fact written by him. The plaintiff had also received a letter of direction from the defendant that stated that he would disburse the funds to the creditors. Dismissing the claim, that the plaintiff disbursed funds contrary to the irrevocables letter of directions. The plaintiffs have not established the basis for a claim under breach of trust and cannot succeed on this ground. Any claim under this ground is therefore dismissed.","The plaintiffs, who were suppliers and creditors to the project, have now sued Mr. Brookes claiming that, in early April of 1987, he disbursed funds contrary to the irrevocable letter of direction dated March 9, 1987. The plaintiffs have also raised an allegation of breach of trust on the part of Mr. Brookes; however, there is no evidence Mr. Brookes was ever in a fiduciary relationship with the plaintiffs, nor was he ever retained by the plaintiffs or purport in any way to act for them or on their behalf. In my respectful opinion the plaintiffs have not established the basis for a claim under breach of trust and cannot succeed on this ground. Any claim under this ground is therefore dismissed. Firstly, I am not persuaded that the creditors continued to advance supplies to the project on the basis of Mr. Brookes\' letter of March 11, 1987 and, on a balance of probabilities, I find that the suppliers continued advancing to the project because they concluded that the project was still viable. Therefore, on this basis there can be no reliance by these latter creditors and it is impossible to see how they could have a claim for breach of an undertaking which is not communicated or directed to them before they provided their services or materials. In my respectful opinion, in the case at bar, one cannot interpret Mr. Brookes\' letter of March 11, 1987 in the abstract or in a vacuum and one must consider all of the surrounding circumstances, including the knowledge of the plaintiffs, through the Creditors\'Committee and their representatives, the letters of March 12, March 13 and March 16, 1987 and the various meetings resulting in those letters.

The plaintiffs, creditors of the defendant's client, sued the defendant for negligent misrepresentation, breach of trust and breach of undertaking.

1997canlii9636.txt,The applicant sought an order pursuant to s.130 of the Land Titles Act and s.56 of the Enforcement of Maintenance Orders Act for an order relieving the estate from payment of maintenance ordered in 1972. The respondent objected to the application being brought on behalf of the estate as Olson was neither executrix nor a beneficiary under the Will. The Will had not been admitted to probate. The respondent had divorced testator in 1972 and was granted child support of $60 per month and monthly spousal support of $40. The applicant who cohabited with the deceased since 1978 transferred her home to him in 1980 as joint tenants and he transferred his two and one-half quarter sections of farm land to the applicant. The applicant suggested there was an agreement whereby the respondent lived rent free in the matrimonial home in lieu of support. The respondent received welfare to support herself and the children and had had no funds to pursue enforcement of the unpaid support payments.

The respondent was not misled and there was no prejudice. 2)The Land Titles Act was of no assistance to the applicant. The application was to be determined upon s.56 of the EMOA and whether it would be grossly unfair and inequitable to refuse the application. 3)The maintenance order constitutes a charge upon the land and the applicant obtained title to the land subject to that charge. There was no evidence presented either of consideration being paid nor of what became of the income generated by the land prior to the deceased's death.  4)A trial of an issue was ordered to determine what if any portion of the arrears should remain a charge upon the lands.

The respondent will assert her right to recover arrears of maintenance pursuant to the order of November 1972. She will assert the right to discharge of the order pursuant pursuant to S.56. The court will determine whether it would be 'grossly unfair and inequitable' from the applicants perspective to refuse the application and whether such an order can be 'justified' in so far as the respondent is concerned. 1)The respondent will defend the action and assert her rights to discharge the order under s. 56 of the EMOA. The application fails to be determined upon s.55 of the Act. The question for resolution in whether it is 'gross' and inequititable' to refuse an application and if such an Order can be justified in so as the Respondent is concerned is whether such a order can only be'simplyified' by the respondent. 2)The maintenance order constitutes a charge upon the land and the applicant obtained title to the land subject to that charge.

It is convenient to deal with these applications by first considering the Union's request to be join as an interlocutor, pursuant to Rules 62.35; secondly, as party to an application pursuant to rule 8.05; and finally as party pursuant to the Rule 62.31. 5) There is no evidence that the Union was directly affected by the provisions of Rule 7 nor that the Court has any jurisdiction to entertain an application for joinder under Rule 5(e). 6) The union was not part of the proceedings in Adams and was not party to any of the proposed applications. 7) The proposed application by the union to be substituted by an amici, or an interveneur, is not supported by the application of the Union. 8) The alternative application that it be joined by an interested person or an interested party should be dismissed as well.",0.46800731261425965

Mabel, mother of the plaintiff and the defendant, set aside $20,000 in a bank account. Prior to her death, Mabel gave written instructions to the defendant to give $5,000 to each granddaughter. The defendant claimed that the money was to be held to pay the estate's expenses and then be divided among Mabel's children. The money was never issued to the granddaughters. The plaintiff claims that the written instructions to the defendant constituted the establishment of a trust and that the defendant is the trustee of the money for the benefit of the granddaughters.

The fact that the defendant did not take the necessary steps to complete the intended gifts during Mabel's lifetime does not result in that intention being converted into a declaration of trust.

The Jabours, the third parties who acquired title to the house, firmly bolted a wheelchair lift loaned to them by the Abilities Council by anchor bolts in a concrete slab. The Jabours sold to the Kapronczais who in turn sold the property 2 years later to the respondent, San Diego, but made no mention about ownership of the wheelchair lift. The lift ceased to operate and San Diego contacted the Abilities Council which claimed ownership to the lift. San Diego was awarded judgment for the depreciated value against Kapronczai who joined the Jabours as third parties claiming over against them for the San Diego claim. HELD: The appeal was dismissed against the plaintiff and the third party. 1)The wheelchair lift never became part of the realty notwithstanding how it was affixed. It was not the intention of either party that it become part of the realty. The intention of the parties is a prime factor in determining whether something is affixed to and becomes part of the realty. 2)The manner of attaching the lift only to the concrete slab arguably showed an intention that it not be permanent and part of the property.  3)Section 237(2) of the Land Titles Act protects a purchaser of realty against an unregistered interest in that realty. Interest is defined in s.237(1)(a)as any estate or interest in land. It is not intended to protect the purchaser of realty to which something is affixed that is not intended to the knowledge of the purchaser to be part of the realty.

The wheelchair lift never became part of the realty and the intention of the parties was a prime factor in determining whether something affixed to a realty becomes a part of it. Although it was not a finding of the trial judge the manner in which it was dealt with, the appeal was not directed at the plaintiff. The plaintiff and third party appealed. In the circumstances the appeal is dismissed. As between the Jabours and the Abilities Council, the wheelchair lift was never owned by it but San Diego negotiated purchase of the lift at a depreciated value for a total of $2,769.29 for which she got judgment and for which the defendant joined the third parties claiming over against them for the claim made by San Diego. The intention of both parties is a prime factors in determining if something affined to the real estate becomes a Part of the Realty. The Jabours sold the property to the respondent, Elsa San Diego (""San Diego""). The vendors advertised the property as being a good revenue care home wheelchair accessible. When selling the property, the vendors made no mention to the purchaser, the respondent San Diego, about ownership of such equipment. The defendants purported to sell that which was not theirs to sell which in my view, gives San Diego claim for damages to which they were found entitled by the Provincial Court Judge. The defendant, Kapronczai, claimed not to have known of the wheelchair's ownership and to never have been informed of such. The trial judge dismissed the claim against the defendant, who testified that he and Tania knew that the wheelchair was not part of that realty or was owned by the Abilities. There was evidence on which the judge could find as he did that the Abilities council apparently loans chair lifts such as this to families who have a disabled member.","[1] This is an appeal from a decision in the Provincial Court on a Small Claim.

The defence called the complainant's husband, who had just come out of Super Store, to assist the officer. The officer asked the complainant if he could assist the complainant and the complainant backed up to speak with the officer, who then backed up and struck him.

The defendant's vehicle did not move very short distance forward before striking the complainant; the Crown's evidence that neither seat belt, belonging to the officer or the Crown, locked upon striking the officer; the officer did exercise due diligence both before and after striking the victim. The court found that the accused drove careless. The Court found that both the complainant’s and the Crown’ s witnesses’ statements to the effect that the complainant was not shouting at the officer were not inconsistent. The issue was whether the Crown had proved that the defendant drove without due attention and care. The trial judge found that his vehicle rolled over only a short distance of not more than one foot and not at a fast or accelerating speed.

The court accepted the accused's evidence that his vehicle rolled forward only a short distance of not more than one foot and not at a fast or accelerated speed and that the pedestrian was crossing outside of the cross walk and that the accused applied his brakes as soon as he saw the pedestrian. The accused did exercise due diligence.","The accused was charged with driving without due care and attention contrary to s. 44(1) of the Highway Traffic Act. The accused had been on duty in a marked police car when he was struck by a vehicle. The Crown called three witnesses and the accused backed up to speak with the defence. The defence then called four witnesses. HELD: The accused was found not guilty of the charge. 1) The accused's vehicle rolled forward only a short distance, and not at a fast or accelerating speed, which was in effect careless driving, as distinguished from dangerous driving under the Criminal Code. The actions of the accused which could be considered careless are, firstly, the speed at which he drove past the stopped vehicle, and secondly, his driving forward into the accused. The evidence of the Crown witnesses was that the accused had an oblique motive for doing so, perhaps thinking that the police officer was being insolent and returning to set him straight. 2) The Court of Queen's Bench held that, given the situation, he could not have reasonably anticipated that a person would have been so close in front of him and the fact that the officer did exercise due diligence both before and after striking the accused, the Court of Appeal held that this driving was careless. 3) On a balance of probabilities, the Crown has proved that the driving by the accused was careless, as the Crown failed to prove state of mind, but the accused exercised due diligence and took reasonable care. The court found that the Crown had not proved that Mr. Tyndall's vehicle was moving too fast, as it did not accelerate and did not move forward quickly before striking the officer. The Court also held that the defendant did not have a due diligence defence including 'taking all reasonable steps to avoid the particular event'. The Court concluded that the trial judge erred in his assessment of the extent to which the accused's actions were careless.","[1] Todd Tyndall is charged with driving without due care and attention at Yorkton, Saskatchewan on February 18, 2004, contrary to section 44(1) of the Highway Traffic Act.

HELD: The accused is not guilty on all counts.  1) A breath test and demand should be made as soon as the officer forms the requisite grounds for making it. Those grounds did not change between the time the accused refused to provide an ASD sample at 8:17 a.m., when the officer arrested her for impaired driving and 8:40 a.m. when the officer read the accused the breathalyzer demand. There was no reason for the breath demand not being made forthwith. The rights of the accused under s. 8 and s. 9 of the Charter were breached. 2) The officer did not have reasonable and probable grounds for making the breathalyzer demand. The officer testified she gave the ASD demand to find out if the accused had alcohol in her system. When the accused refused, the officer arrested her for impaired driving. The officer was unsure of whether the accused had alcohol in her system when she read the accused the ASD demand and there was no new evidence gathered between 8:17 a.m. and 8:40 a.m. to justify the breath demand. The evidence does not support a subjective honest belief on the part of the officer that the ability of the accused to operate a motor vehicle was impaired by alcohol.

She said she knew the alcohol would kick in and that she was not really feeling the effects until she arrived at the police station. She offered an explanation for her difficulty in driving testifying that she was tired. The evidence of the officer, which was insufficient to support a belief of impairment as a prerequisite to a breath demand, cannot prove impaired driving. There is insufficient evidence to conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused's ability to drive was impaired by alcohol at the time she was driving.","The accused was charged with impaired driving and driving while her ability to operate a motor vehicle was impaired by alcohol or drug, operate a vehicle contrary to s.255(1) and s.253(a) of the Criminal Code. The accused was found not guilty of both charges. The evidence of the officer was insufficient to support a belief of impairment as prerequisite to a breath demand, cannot alone prove impaired driving beyond a reasonable doubt. The breath sample evidence was obtained as a consequence of the breach of s.8 and s9 of the Charter of Rights. The officer did not have reasonable and probable grounds for making the breathalyzer demand and the evidence did not support a subjective honest belief on the part of the police officer that the accused was impaired. The Court found that the evidence of an officer who had not been convinced of the accused's impairment as a prerequisite to the breath demand was insufficient. The Evidence of the Officer, which was insufficient insufficient to show a belief in impairment as required to a demand, could alone prove impairment driving beyond the reasonable doubt; the evidence does not support an honest belief. The court found that there was no subjective honest evidence on the officer that she was impaired at the time she made the breath request. The issue was whether the accused could operate a Motor Vehicle while impaired by the alcohol or drugs. The police officer was unsure of whether the complainant had alcohol in her system when she read the accused the ASD demand and there was nothing new evidence gathered between 8:17 a.m. and 8:45 a. m. to justify the breath refusal. The Crown did not establish that the officer had reasonable and reasonable grounds for the breath seizure demand. The defence argued that the certificate of analyses should not be admissible because the breathalyszer demand was not made forthwith or as soon as practicable. The certificate of analysis should not have been admissible as it was insufficiently supported a belief that impairment as pre-condition to a request to operate the motor vehicle. The respondent's defence argued the certificate was not admissible due to the officer's failure to take judicial notice of the fact that she would have been more impaired later at the detachment than she would been at the moment in time when she was parking the truck. The trial judge concluded that the respondent's own testimony that she had been drinking alcohol and was feeling the effects of the alcohol at the same time was not enough to prove impaired.","Count #3 and further that on or about the 21st day of July, A.D. 2004 at North Battleford, in the Province of Saskatchewan did while her ability to operate a motor vehicle was impaired by alcohol or a drug, operate a motor vehicle contrary to Section 255(1) and Section 253(a) of the Criminal Code.

As the breath sample evidence was obtained as a consequence of the breach of the s. 8 and s. 9 Charter rights of the accused, it should be excluded from evidence pursuant to s. 24(2).  3) The accused testified that she had been drinking alcohol and was feeling the effects of the alcohol at the time she was operating the vehicle. She said she knew the alcohol would kick in and that she was not really feeling the effects until she arrived at the police station. She offered an explanation for her difficulty in driving testifying that she was tired. The evidence of the officer, which was insufficient to support a belief of impairment as a prerequisite to a breath demand, cannot prove impaired driving. There is insufficient evidence to conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused's ability to drive was impaired by alcohol at the time she was driving.","The accused was charged with two counts of impaired driving while her ability to operate a motor vehicle was impaired by alcohol or drug, while her breath sample evidence was obtained as a consequence of the breach of s. 8 and s. 9 of the Charter of Rights. HELD: The accused was found not guilty of all counts. As there was no evidence before the Court of the undertaking alleged in Counts 1 and 2, the accused is not guilty. The evidence of the officer, which was insufficient to support a belief of impairment as prerequisite to a breath demand, cannot alone prove impaired driving beyond a reasonable doubt. The accused testified that she knew the alcohol would kick in and that she was not really feeling the effects until she arrived at the police station. The officer did not have reasonable and probable grounds for making the breathalyzer demand and the evidence did not support a subjective honest belief on the part of the police officer that the ability of the accused was impaired.","Count #3 and further that on or about the 21st day of July, A.D. 2004 at North Battleford, in the Province of Saskatchewan did while her ability to operate a motor vehicle was impaired by alcohol or a drug, operate a motor vehicle contrary to Section 255(1) and Section 253(a) of the Criminal Code. Count #4 and further that on or about the 21st day of July, A.D. 2004 at North Battleford, in the Province of Saskatchewan did having consumed alcohol in such quantity that the concentration thereof in her blood exceeded eighty milligrams of alcohol in one hundred millilitres of blood, operate a motor vehicle contrary to Section 253(b) and Section 255(1) of the Criminal Code. [2] As there was no evidence before the Court of the undertaking alleged in Counts 1 and 2, the accused is not guilty of those two charges. [26] I conclude that the demand was not made forthwith or as soon as practicable and consequently, her rights under sections 8 and 9 of the Charter of Rights were breached. [27] I also conclude that the officer did not have reasonable and probable grounds for making the breathalyzer demand. Therefore, the evidence does not support a subjective honest belief on the part of the officer that the ability of the accused to operate a motor vehicle was impaired by alcohol. [30] As the breath sample evidence was obtained as a consequence of the breach of the Section 8 and 9 Charter Rights of the accused, it should be excluded under Section 24(2). [33] The evidence of the officer, which I have found insufficient to support a belief of impairment as prerequisite to a breath demand, cannot alone prove impaired driving beyond a reasonable doubt. When I consider those explanations together with the uncertainty of the police officer as to whether or not she had alcohol in her system at the time she read her the ASD demand, I am unable to conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that the ability of the accused to operate a motor vehicle was impaired by alcohol at the time she was driving. CONCLUSION [37] I find the accused not guilty of all counts.",0.5834862385321101,0.5513698630136986,"The accused was charged with impaired driving and driving while her ability to operate a motor vehicle was impaired by alcohol or drug, operate a vehicle contrary to s.255(1) and s.253(a) of the Criminal Code. The accused was found not guilty of both charges. The evidence of the officer was insufficient to support a belief of impairment as prerequisite to a breath demand, cannot alone prove impaired driving beyond a reasonable doubt. The breath sample evidence was obtained as a consequence of the breach of s.8 and s9 of the Charter of Rights. The officer did not have reasonable and probable grounds for making the breathalyzer demand and the evidence did not support a subjective honest belief on the part of the police officer that the accused was impaired. The Court found that the evidence of an officer who had not been convinced of the accused's impairment as a prerequisite to the breath demand was insufficient. The Evidence of the Officer, which was insufficient insufficient to show a belief in impairment as required to a demand, could alone prove impairment driving beyond the reasonable doubt; the evidence does not support an honest belief. The court found that there was no subjective honest evidence on the officer that she was impaired at the time she made the breath request. The issue was whether the accused could operate a Motor Vehicle while impaired by the alcohol or drugs. The police officer was unsure of whether the complainant had alcohol in her system when she read the accused the ASD demand and there was nothing new evidence gathered between 8:17 a.m. and 8:45 a. m. to justify the breath refusal. The Crown did not establish that the officer had reasonable and reasonable grounds for the breath seizure demand. The defence argued that the certificate of analyses should not be admissible because the breathalyszer demand was not made forthwith or as soon as practicable. The certificate of analysis should not have been admissible as it was insufficiently supported a belief that impairment as pre-condition to a request to operate the motor vehicle. The respondent's defence argued the certificate was not admissible due to the officer's failure to take judicial notice of the fact that she would have been more impaired later at the detachment than she would been at the moment in time when she was parking the truck. The trial judge concluded that the respondent's own testimony that she had been drinking alcohol and was feeling the effects of the alcohol at the same time was not enough to prove impaired.",0.691764705882353

These are appropriate sentences in the circumstances.  3) The sentences were increased to three months in secure custody, nine months of probation on each charge to be served concurrently and four years concurrent in the amount of time served in a federal penitentiary.  4) The offender's criminal record consists of two robbery convictions, one for robbery with intent to commit an indictable offence under s. 351(2) of the Criminal Code and four months of imprisonment consecutive to the sentence for the robbery.","He was sentenced to three months in secure custody and nine months of probation on each charge to be served concurrently.

He was sentenced to 5 years imprisonment after having been given credit of 1 year for the time served on remand. The appellant appeals both his conviction and sentence. On the conviction appeal the appellant raises a technical ground in relation to the manner in which the appellant was charged as well as issues of the propriety and fairness of the cross-examination of himself by Crown counsel, the admissibility of his criminal record at trial, and the admissibility of opinion evidence proved in the testimony of the Crown's expert witness on accident reconstruction. He also argues that the trial judge failed to find that the fact that the appellant was impaired at the time of the collision was the cause of the collision and that his conclusion was unreasonable and against the weight of the evidence. HELD: Appeal dismissed.  1) The trial judge has a discretion pursuant to R. v. Corbett, [1988] 1 S.C.R. 670, to exclude prejudicial evidence of prior convictions in an appropriate case. This discretion is exercised by the trial judge on the application of an accused at the close of the Crown's case. See R. v. Underwood, [1998] 1 S.C.R. 77. As such an application was not raised in this case, and the questioning about previous convictions by the Crown was not objected to when it occurred, and the issue of the appellant's previous alcohol related offences was raised in the appellant's own examination in chief, this court concludes that there is no basis for this Court to conclude that the cross-examination was inappropriate or that the evidence adduced was inadmissible.  2) It is not proper for Crown counsel to ask an accused on cross-examination to explain the testimony of a Crown witness, and that it is highly unfair and prejudicial to require an accused to agree with a Crown witness or stigmatize that witness as a 'liar'. Crown counsel should not have put these sorts of questions and the trial judge ought not to have permitted them. Defence counsel did not object to them. However, this Court is not satisfied that this error had any effect on the trial and this ground of appeal fails.  3) The Crown elicited opinion evidence from Constable Gibson in the area of accident reconstruction. No evidence was at any time offered as to his expertise to do so, other than his curriculum vitae, which was filed. This witness's evidence as to how the bodies might have moved in the vehicle in the course of the collision and its aftermath, and in particular, his conclusory opinion that Ms. McDermott was the passenger and Mr. Bear the driver, ought not to have been received in the absence of a ruling that he was qualified as an expert in relation to those matters, and that his expertise was necessary in relation to the subject matter of his testimony, and that his opinion was based on facts before the Court. 4) The appellant was charged and convicted with offences pursuant to s. 255(2) and s. 255(3) of the Criminal Code. The appellant argues that conviction requires that the appellant has been charged with an offence pursuant to s. 253(a). There is no merit in this ground of appeal. Impaired driving causing death and bodily harm are routinely charged in this manner. 5) This Court's review of the cross-examination of the appellant supports the trial judge's assessment of it as unbelievable. In light of the trial judge's findings of credibility, and the results of the DNA analysis of the samples taken, the evidence overwhelmingly supports the verdict reached by the trial judge that the appellant was driving. The conclusory opinions expressed by Constable Gibson in relation to the movements of the occupants in the truck, and as to who was driving the vehicle, played no meaningful role in a conclusion that was, compelled by the remaining evidence. Notwithstanding the errors apparent in the receipt of opinion evidence from Constable Gibson, there was no substantial miscarriage of justice. The appeal from conviction is dismissed. 6) The trial judge did not commit any error of principle in coming to the conclusion that an appropriate sentence was 6 years imprisonment. While the sentence is at the high end of the available range, it is not outside the range available in the circumstances of this case.","The appellant was convicted of operating a motor vehicle while his ability to operate the vehicle was impaired by alcohol, thereby causing the death of Tanya Bergen, contrary to s. 255(3) of the Criminal Code and causing bodily harm to Helen McDermott.

It cannot escape notice that there were two loaded firearms in the vehicle; cannot accept that they were loaded simply because there was a mere oversight by Mr. Kenny's companions, and him, in ensuring they were unloaded at the time he picked them up. What am left with are some uncontroverted facts, all of which are consistent only with an inescapable inference that the appellant was employing the search light as a hunting tool. The terms 'hunting' and 'wildlife' are all defined in the Act or Regulations. However, the moose caller was being used in this case. There was no evidence from anyone that any efforts whatsoever were being made to locate the individual other than shining the spotlight. If one were truly looking for an injured individual in large forest, certainly one would assume that the searching parties would have been yelling and making noise to attract the subject's attention.","[1] Mr. Kenny is charged under The Wildlife Act Regulations, 1981 with use of a searchlight when hunting. [10] Having gone through that analysis, and for the reasons that follow, I do not believe the evidence of the defendant, and I am not left in doubt by it. [20] On all the evidence, I am satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that Mr. Kenny was using the searchlight for the purposes of hunting wildlife, and I find him guilty.",0.2772277227722772,0.3289719626168225,"The defendant was charged under The Wildlife Act Regulations with use of a searchlight when hunting. HELD: The Court did not believe the evidence of the defendant and was not left in doubt by it. On all of the evidence, the Court was satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant was using the searchlight for the purposes of hunting wildlife. The Court held that the evidence was not supported by the Crown's argument that it was an unreliable story, one that was made up after the fact to fit a very suspicious set of circumstances. It was satisfied on the evidence that do accept the guilt of the accused beyond reasonable doubt in order to convict.",0.5663716814159292

There has to be a general interest in preserving confidential information.

HELD: The Public Trustees Act does not authorize the appointment of the Public trustee as a litigation guardian on the basis of s. 32 of the Act. The Minister relies on the Public Charter and the Child and Family Services Act. Pursuant to its parens patriae jurisdiction, this Court has a responsibility to protect the interests of the child and requires independent representation to ensure that her rights are protected (see: Child and Child Protection Act). The Public Charter does not permit the Public to act as a lawyer on behalf of a person who is of unsound mind in cases other than where a property interest is involved. If the court fails to intervene, the child will be left in limbo, a victim of the system. The Public is the appropriate person to act on behalf for the child.

The Minister contends the court can and should appoint the public trustee as a lawyer for H.B. Nowhere does the Act authorize the public trustee to act in the manner that it should. If the court fails to intervene in this regard, H.'s son will be left in limbo, a victim of the system. 3) The Public Truste Act does not authorize the Public trustee to act on behalf the person alleged to be of unsound mind in the matter of her son. It is intended to protect and administer the property of infants and dependant adults. Now there is a conflict (if such there be) between the Public and Queen's Bench Rules 22 and 46, the Act must prevail.","The Minister of Social Services has applied for an

The original order had been based on a written agreement between the parties. The respondent had custody of or access to the children for enough time to bring him within s. 9 of the Guidelines. Absent any evidence to the contrary, it seems to us that the activities were ordinary activities and the expenses were of an ordinary rather than an extraordinary nature, given the income of the children's parents. The judge erred in requiring the appellant to pay a portion of them under s. 7(1)(f) in addition to the table amount fixed under s3(1) as she thought that evidence was required on only three issues. The appellant objected to payment of these amounts only because the respondent never consulted him in respect of incurring the expenses.

The fact they each executed a will to give effect to that intention and the husband paid practically all of the day-to-day expenses led to the conclusion their verbal agreement should be considered binding, notwithstanding their marriage ended by separation rather than death. 2)The condominium purchased by the husband was the 'family home' as provided for in s.2(1)(a). There was no extraordinary circumstance as provided in s.22(1), which would prevent equal division of the value of the family home. The Melville residence owned by the wife at the time of the marriage was exempt in accordance with their agreement. It had not increased in value and the wife solely paid its maintenance. 3)No costs.","The petitioner seeks an order for equal distribution of matrimonial property. The parties married in 1988, each for a second time, and separated in 1997. Each had significant assets at the time of the marriage which increased in value since that date. They agreed to keep their assets separate and to not make claim on the assets of the other. After their deaths their entire estates would be left to their respective children. They each completed new wills shortly after the marriage leaving all of their assets to the petitioner. HELD: 1) The petitioner was entitled to judgment for half of the value of the assets acquired after marriage being: 1/2 of the amount of the condominium, $42,000.00, 1/4 of the furniture, vehicle and camper $12,000 and $54,000 respectively. There was no conflict in the evidence of the parties as to the verbal agreement they made at the marriage. Although it may be argued that the Melville home was at one time the 'family home' of the Parties, designate the Regina condominium to be the family home pursuant to s. 22(3) of the Act as the parties resided therein for most of their marriage. The petitioner's investments and assets increased significantly during the time the parties lived together. 2) There is no 'extraordinary circumstance' as provided in s22(1) of The Family Property Act which would prevent the value from being divided equally between the parties. 3) In the circumstances no order was ordered as to costs.","[1] The petitioner seeks an order for equal distribution of matrimonial property. [12] In the present circumstances where there is no conflict in the evidence of the parties as to their intention at the time of the marriage, the fact that they each executed a will to give effect to at least part of that intention and the respondent paid practically all of the day to day expenses of the marriage leads me to conclude that their verbal agreement should be considered binding upon each of them notwithstanding the fact the marriage ended by separation and not by death.

The parties are not candidates for joint custody and shared parenting.

There was no evidence or explanation as to why he has failed to pay child support, which creates the present arrears. The evidence with respect to the respondent's finances was unsworn and out of date. In oral argument, the respondent asserted that he contributed to his daughter's care and that he is contributing to her education trust fund.

The respondent's doctor was examined and, based on that medical evidence, the Court could not conclude that the respondent's generalized anxiety and depression disorder is beyond his control.

The court also reduced its sentence to four years imprisonment. The sentencing judge noted that the evidence was so extensive that a further reduction of one-half years would be justified.

The sentence was based on the factors outlined in the pre-sentence report. The offender had a previous criminal record.

HELD: 1) The claim is triggered. Whether a claim could trigger indemnity is a three step process. The onus of establishing that the terms of the policy obligate the insurer to defend rests with the applicant. If there is any possibility that the claim falls within liability coverage, the insurer is obliged to provide defence. 2) The pleadings determine whether or not the insurer has a duty to defend. It matters not whether Genex may or may not succeed in the action. The mere fact that Genex alleges both negligence and breach of contract is of no moment. The fact that the plaintiff subcontracted with the general contractor for the construction of the Tullymet Nucleus Unit does not, for the purpose of this appeal, change the intentional nature of the acts.",0.6254980079681275

The parties were unable to negotiate a further reduction in the combined child and spousal support after the third child moved out of the mother's home. Since the parties' separation and divorce, the mother had not seriously pursued any educational retraining or furthered her education in her field of expertise; since the children had become independent, she occupied herself with volunteer work. The father now applied to terminate spousal support. The father shall continue to pay the sum of $3,000 per month as spousal support for one year; for the following year, the support will be reduced to $2,500 per month; in the following year, support shall be reduced to $2,000 per month, after which support will cease completely; the father shall continue his direct support of the children remaining dependant as they complete their current courses. Although the mother's effort in looking after four children and her absence from the workplace during the children's early years were significant factors, she had ignored her responsibility to move towards some sort of self sufficiency; given the number of children, the court extended the formula under the Spousal Support Guidelines beyond the maximum 13 year period; however, the mother must develop a reasonable strategy immediately to ensure that she either begins work in an area with better employment prospects or immediately attends courses to upgrade, refresh or enhance her ability to support herself.","This application to terminate spousal support was commenced on the 22nd day of September, 2005. The parties were married in November 1980 and began living separate and apart in 1993. They entered into an agreement in February 1996 that the biweekly payments would be reduced to $2,000. There was no financial contribution by the mother to the children in the father's care. The father provided financial support directly to the mother, notwithstanding the fact that the children had left their mother's care and were moving to Nova Scotia to pursue their post-secondary pursuits. The husband continued to pay the full child and child support and the combined support increased to $52,561 per month. Given his circumstances and obligations, his monthly expenditures are not excessive. They include the secondary school expense for his children. There has been no variation of this order by court order since the Corollary Relief Judgment.","[1] This application to terminate spousal support was commenced on the 22nd day of September, 2005.

The effort and the Respondent’s absence from the workforce during their early childhood is a significant factor.

The mother must develop a reasonable strategy immediately to ensure September enrollment is possible.

ABank asserted a debt claim against the defendants. The defendants applied pursuant to s. 8 of The Enforcement of Money Judgments Act (EMJA) to terminate the preservation order, which prohibited any dealings with 850,000 shares, or alternatively they sought an order reducing the number of shares subject to the order and requiring the plaintiff to post $3 million as security pursuant to s. 5(7) of the EMJA and $40,000 security for costs. Regarding ABank’s application, it argued that its claim in debt against the defendant arose out of the same transaction based on the allegation that Arslan transferred the shares to a trust (the other defendant was the trustee) in June 2013, the time at which he stopped paying his debts in full and thus denied it the opportunity to collect its debt. ABank sought the same relief as Sekerbank: judgment against both defendants under The Fraudulent Preferences Act and The Fraudulent Conveyances Act. The defendants argued that the limitation period that applied to ABank’s claim had expired and the application should be denied. Regarding the defendants’ application, they argued that the plaintiff’s strategy in the Saskatchewan action was to await the outcome of the proceedings they had initiated in Turkey against the plaintiff. The Saskatchewan action was independent from the Turkish action, and the plaintiff’s approach was unacceptable in the circumstances of the preservation order made against them in 2014. The plaintiff had not prosecuted its actions against them without delay as required by s. 5(c) of the EMJA. The defendants asserted that the share prices increased since 2014 and were now worth $18 million more than the plaintiff’s claim. If the preservation was not terminated, they requested that the number of shares be reduced to 100,000. HELD: The proposed plaintiff’s application was granted. The defendants’ application to terminate the preservation order or to reduce the number of shares subject to the order was dismissed. The court ordered the plaintiff to post $1 million as security under the EMJA and an additional $40,000 as security for costs. The court found that although the limitation period had expired, it would add ABank as a plaintiff and amend the statement of claim pursuant to s. 20 of The Limitations Act, because to do so would not create a wholly new proceeding and the defendants had not provided evidence that they would suffer prejudice. The preservation order was not terminated after the court reviewed the history of the proceedings in both Saskatchewan and Turkey and found that the plaintiff had not failed to prosecute its action without delay. The court found that there was insufficient evidence to justify the reduction in the number of shares subject to the order.  The information of the value of the security fell short of demonstrating a sufficient change in circumstances, especially in light of the addition of ABank’s claim. The court found that the order should be modified under s. 5(7) of the EMJA to have the plaintiff provide security because there was evidence that the trust may have suffered and could suffer losses in the future as a result of the order. The order for security for costs was justified based on the considerations specified in Queen’s Bench rule 4-24.","The defendants applied to terminate the preservation order pursuant to s. 5 of The Enforcement of Money Judgments Act. In the alternative, they sought an order reducing the number of shares subject to the order and requiring the plaintiff to post $3,081,463.14 as security pursuant to ss. 5(7) and s. 7(2) of the EMJA. The defendants applied pursuant to Queen's Bench Rules for an order that ABank be added as a plaintiff, and to amend the Statement of Claim. HELD: The application was denied. 1)The court found that the plaintiff had failed to prosecute this action without delay. The amendments sought would not create a wholly new proceeding.  2)The Court found that neither of the defendants would suffer actual prejudice as a result of the proposed amendments. The Court found the following: 1)Absent the existence of a third action, the Court found there was sufficient temporal and factual relationship between the original and amended claims. 2)Absence of a fourth action, which would result in a final decision against the defendant, and amending the Statement, would not be a wholly different proceeding.","[1] On January 9, 2014, a preservation order was granted in this action [Order], pursuant to s. 5 of The Enforcement of Money Judgments Act, SS 2010, c E-9.22 [EMJA].

For the reasons that follow, that application is denied. The application to add ABank as a plaintiff, and to amend the draft Amended Statement of Claim which has been filed, is granted. The plaintiff alleges that the defendant Hüseyin Arslan has defaulted on his obligation to pay the plaintiff $13,813,544.88 pursuant to certain guarantees. The addition of ABank as a plaintiff, and amending the Statement of Claim in the manner proposed, would not create a wholly new proceeding.

ABank sought the same relief as Sekerbank: judgment against both defendants under The Fraudulent Preferences Act and The Fraudulent Conveyances Act. The defendants argued that the limitation period that applied to ABank’s claim had expired and the application should be denied. Regarding the defendants’ application, they argued that the plaintiff’s strategy in the Saskatchewan action was to await the outcome of the proceedings they had initiated in Turkey against the plaintiff. The Saskatchewan action was independent from the Turkish action, and the plaintiff’s approach was unacceptable in the circumstances of the preservation order made against them in 2014. The plaintiff had not prosecuted its actions against them without delay as required by s. 5(c) of the EMJA. The defendants asserted that the share prices increased since 2014 and were now worth $18 million more than the plaintiff’s claim. If the preservation was not terminated, they requested that the number of shares be reduced to 100,000. HELD: The proposed plaintiff’s application was granted. The defendants’ application to terminate the preservation order or to reduce the number of shares subject to the order was dismissed. The court ordered the plaintiff to post $1 million as security under the EMJA and an additional $40,000 as security for costs. The court found that although the limitation period had expired, it would add ABank as a plaintiff and amend the statement of claim pursuant to s. 20 of The Limitations Act, because to do so would not create a wholly new proceeding and the defendants had not provided evidence that they would suffer prejudice. The preservation order was not terminated after the court reviewed the history of the proceedings in both Saskatchewan and Turkey and found that the plaintiff had not failed to prosecute its action without delay. The court found that there was insufficient evidence to justify the reduction in the number of shares subject to the order.  The information of the value of the security fell short of demonstrating a sufficient change in circumstances, especially in light of the addition of ABank’s claim. The court found that the order should be modified under s. 5(7) of the EMJA to have the plaintiff provide security because there was evidence that the trust may have suffered and could suffer losses in the future as a result of the order. The order for security for costs was justified based on the considerations specified in Queen’s Bench rule 4-24.","The defendants applied to terminate the preservation order pursuant to s. 5 of The Enforcement of Money Judgments Act. In the alternative, they sought an order reducing the number of shares subject to the order and requiring the plaintiff to post $3,081,463.14 as security pursuant to ss. 5(7) and s. 7(2) of the EMJA and $40,000 security for costs. HELD: The application to add ABank as a plaintiff was denied. The two conditions specified in s. 20(a) and (b) did not exist. The addition of ABank would not create a wholly new proceeding.  1)Absent the expiration of the limitation period, the court may allow an amendment to the pleadings that asserts a new claim or adds or substitutes parties if the plaintiff has chosen to await the outcome of the Turkish Proceedings before taking any steps to advance this action. 2)The court should not terminate the order or revisit the issues which the parties intended to resolve through that order. There need only be some temporal and factual relationship between the occurrences on which the original claim was based and those on which a proposed counterclaim or similar claim is based.","[1] On January 9, 2014, a preservation order was granted in this action [Order], pursuant to s. 5 of The Enforcement of Money Judgments Act, SS 2010, c E-9.22 [EMJA]. The Order prohibited any dealings with 850,000 shares of Alliance Green Traders Inc. [AGT], pending a final decision on the merits of the plaintiff’s claims against the defendant Hṻseyin Arslan in Turkey, and the conclusion of this action. The following applications are now before me: 2. On March 8, 2016, the plaintiff Ṣekerbank T.A.S. [Ṣekerbank] and Alternatifbank A.S. [ABank], a second Turkish bank which asserts a debt claim against Mr. Arslan, applied pursuant to Rules 3-72 and 3-84 of The Queen’s Bench Rules for an order that ABank be added as a plaintiff, and to amend the Statement of Claim. For the reasons that follow, that application is denied. The application to add ABank as a plaintiff, and to amend the draft Amended Statement of Claim which has been filed, is granted. The plaintiff alleges that the defendant Hüseyin Arslan has defaulted on his obligation to pay the plaintiff $13,813,544.88 pursuant to certain guarantees. The addition of ABank as a plaintiff, and amending the Statement of Claim in the manner proposed, would not create a wholly new proceeding. [27] In the result, the two conditions specified in ss. 20(a) and (b) exist. [46] For these reasons, the application to terminate the Order is dismissed. [52] The defendants’ evidence as to the value of the security also falls short of demonstrating a sufficient change in circumstances. There is accordingly insufficient evidence to conclude that the plaintiff’s claim, including interest and costs, would be secured for the necessary period and to the extent contemplated by this consent Order, by a lesser number of shares. CONCLUSION [65] For the foregoing reasons, it is ordered as follows: 1. The defendants’ application to terminate the preservation order dated January 9, 2014, as amended by the order dated October 30, 2014 [Order], is dismissed. 2. The Order shall be amended to provide that Ṣekerbank shall provide security in the amount of $1 million within 30 days of the date of this order, in a form to be agreed by the parties, and failing such agreement, in a form determined by this Court on further application by any party. 4. Alternatifbank A.S. shall be added as a plaintiff, and the Statement of Claim may be amended in the manner specified in the draft filed.",0.4416,0.3763837638376384,"The defendants applied to terminate the preservation order pursuant to s. 5 of The Enforcement of Money Judgments Act.

The Court found the following: 1)Absent the existence of a third action, the Court found there was sufficient temporal and factual relationship between the original and amended claims. 2)Absence of a fourth action, which would result in a final decision against the defendant, and amending the Statement, would not be a wholly different proceeding.",0.39800995024875613

HELD: The application to quash counts #1 and #2 is dismissed. There was clearly no promise by the Crown that it would be bound by the findings of Klebuc J. in the Schafer matter. It is important for the Court to examine the extent to which the conclusions of the judge in Schafer can be said to provide support for the argument, for, on proper reading, the findings are a permissible relaxation of its terms extending to exceptional cases in which number of acts each in itself constituting an offence is capable of being treated as one transaction. There is also a possibility that even if Schafer is acquitted we might still proceed against him.","[1] This is an application by the accused for: (1) an order pursuant to s. 581(1) of the Criminal Code of Canada quashing Count #1 of the indictment as now amended on the ground that it applies to more than one single transaction; (2) an order pursuant to ss. 7 and 24(1) of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms and the common law doctrine of abuse of process that portions of the indictment as amended be quashed or stayed on the basis of the judgment of Klebuc J. in the trial of the former co-accused, Reginald Schafer; and, alternatively, (3) an order staying the proceedings on the grounds of unreasonable delay in bringing the accused to trial. between the 13th day of October A.D. 1988 and the 26th day of March A.D. 1993 at the City of Saskatoon and elsewhere in the Province of Saskatchewan did by deceit falsehood or other fraudulent means, by using the funds of International Capital Corporation (ICC) to advance their personal business interests of Reginald Schafer and/or Richard Leibel over those of ICC, defraud the said Corporation and its preferred shareholders of money in excess of $1,000.00, contrary to s. 380(1)(a) of the Criminal Code by one or more of the following ways: (a) through (j) describe separate transactions, within the meaning of s. 581(1) and that count #1 of the indictment is therefore void.

The R.M. had agreed with the mortgagor that its mortgage would be subordinate to that of FCC. The appeal raises the application of the priority provisions of The Land Titles Act, 2000 and in particular the application of s. 54 of the Act. HELD: The mortgage of the respondent has priority over the mortgage of the appellant. The appeal is dismissed with costs.  1) It is not necessary in this case to consider whether the priority provisions of the Land Titles Act are overridden by commercial postponement agreements in mortgages, or whether reliance by the competing security holder is necessary in order to displace the doctrine of privity of contract in relation to a covenant to postpone, for the court consider the matter to be governed by a consideration of the nature of the interest created by the R.M. mortgage in light of s. 54(3) of the Act. 2) Registration does not and cannot alter the nature of the legal interest granted by the instrument registered. In the present case the mortgage instrument states that it is pursuant to the prior Grant Agreement executed by the parties. This agreement, in turn, clearly provides that any security granted by Mainline to the R.M. is subject to the prior security interest of the respondent to the extent of $3,125,000. In effect, Mainline granted to the R.M. a mortgage of a limited interest, being Mainline's equity of redemption after any mortgage held by the respondent, to the extent of $3,125,000. The appellant admits that it was never intended, as between itself and Mainline, that it would obtain a security interest in priority to that of the respondent.

The officer, who observed symptoms of impairment, asked the accused how much he had had to drink and was told he had consumed about 15 beers. The officer placed the accused under arrest for impaired operation of a motor vehicle, and read him his Charter rights, the Police Warning and a Demand for Blood Sample. The officer then detained the accused by remaining with him while awaiting the Blood Kit to arrive and for a blood technician to take the blood. During this time, the officer interrogated the accused about the accident and the accused provided additional information. The Crown contended that if he was given the police warning then it would be clear to the accused that he did not have to continue to answer questions the officer's questions. The Defence argued that since the arrest and the blood demand were based upon self-incriminating evidence obtained by breach of the accused's s. 7 rights, the arrest was illegal and all evidence obtained thereafter should be excluded; or, at least, that the information obtained was illegally obtained and the police could not rely on that information to make the demand. The accused testified that he talked to the police officer only because he believed he had a legal obligation to do so, based on advice he had received from others that there was a legal obligation to report the accident promptly to the police. The Crown conceded that the accused did have a legal obligation to report the accident promptly, and that if the accused believed he was reporting the accident when he gave self-incriminating statements to the police officer as a result of that belief, those statements must be excluded according to law. HELD: All of the statements of the accused, including those made after the arrest, are excluded and will not form part of the Crown's case. The evidence obtained, and the statements, in particular, were self-incriminating and conscriptive. The officer was acting in good faith, not with serious intentional disregard of the accused's rights. He was not taking a statement under the Traffic Safety Act. He did not know that the accused was only saying things because he believed he had to under compulsion of statute. Even though the investigator did nothing that violated the accused's rights, they were nevertheless violated. Because the violation resulted in the making of statements that amounted to self-incriminating evidence, following the logic of the case law, it is necessary to exclude those statements. The accused did approach the police officer with the intention of reporting the accident as is required by the Traffic Safety Act. As such, and as the Crown correctly concedes, his initial statement, anything said by the accused while providing his personal information and the answer to any question while registering at the hospital are excluded from this trial. As the self-incriminating statements made under compulsion of statute have been excluded, it follows that any evidence that came about as a result of the officer following up on those excluded statements are also in breach of the accused's s. 7 rights.","The accused was charged with impaired operation of motor vehicle and driving while intoxicated. The Crown appealed the voir dire decision following a voir de dire on the admissibility of statements made by the accused to a police officer. The accused testified that after the roll-over, he received a ride to Saskatoon with truck driver, who dropped him off near his cousin's home. While walking there he phoned his father, cousin and 9-1-1 operator. He received advice that there was a legal obligation to report the accident promptly to the police. He then went to the hospital to attend to his injuries. The officer detained the accused and detained him while awaiting the Blood Kit to arrive and for a blood technician to take the blood. During this time the accused was also awaiting treatment for his injuries and provided additional information to the officer. HELD: The accused's statements were not admissible. The evidence obtained was as a result of self-incriminating statements made to the arresting officer as a matter of fact. The police could not rely on that information to make the demand. The defence argued that if the accused's statement was made as a consequence of the arrest, it would be clear to the accused that he did not have to continue to answer questions of the officer and that he had no right to make a demand. It was not clear to him that he was making these statements because he was afraid of being arrested. The Court held that the arrest was illegal and excluded all evidence obtained thereafter. The arrest was not illegal and the information obtained was illegally obtained. The information obtained by the information was illegally obtain and the police cannot rely on it to make that demand. There was nothing to prevent the accused from making these self- incriminating statements. The Police were instructed to look into the injuries and to contact the accused. The Accused's statements made after the arrest were self-initiative and self-confirming. The court concluded that the evidence received by the officer was as the result of breach of his section rights. The trial judge concluded that this was the case. The admission would render the trial unfair. The only conclusion that the officer made was that the accused believed he was reporting the accident and gave self-insulting statements to the officers as a reason for his belief. The fact that the police were instructed not to make these statements was irrelevant. The officers were instructed by the Crown to not make these self incriminating statement.

If the Crown accepted that the officer gave the police a warning, the accused would not have been able to continue answering questions. 4)The defence argued the arrest was illegal and excluded all evidence obtained thereafter, or at least that the information obtained was illegally obtained and the police cannot rely on that information to make the demand. 5)The court concluded that the evidence received, the statements in particular were self incriminating and conscriptive. It was not necessary to consider the seriousness of the violation or the repute of the administration of justice to exclude those statements. 6)The officer was not acting in good faith. Indeed, the officer did not know that the complainant was only saying things because he felt he had to under compulsion of statute. Perhaps, perhaps, that is why he approached the officer in the way he did and was co-operative throughout. However the officer detained the accused, by remaining with him while awaiting the Blood Kit to arrive and for blood technician to take the blood. During this time they were also awaiting treatment for his injuries. 7) The evidence obtained, the self-initiative statements, that were made under the guise of a warning and the demand for a blood sample have been excluded from the trial pursuant to s. 24(2) of the Charter. The evidence must only be excluded based upon the factors expressed in R. v. Collins, [1987] SCC, 113 C.C. (3d) 321. In making this analysis it is important for me to state that believe the officer was acting in a good faith manner. He did not act with serious, intentional disregard of the complainant's rights nor was he taking statement",0.7055276381909548
5_2008nssc77.txt,"The claimant brought an action in the Small Claims Court to enforce a default judgment it had been granted against the defendant in Alberta for breach of contract. The claimant attempted to proceed in Nova Scotia on the basis of reciprocal enforcement under the common law or enforcement of the debt as a contract. The adjudicator dismissed the action, finding that the Small Claims Court did not have the authority to enforce an order arising from a foreign jurisdiction and that it could not proceed with the claim for breach of the agreement under the contract as there was no evidence that the Alberta action had been withdrawn, struck or transferred out. The adjudicator also found that the defendant had not attorned to the jurisdiction of the Alberta court. The claimant appealed. Appeal dismissed; although the adjudicator's interpretation of sec. 15 of the Act and his finding that the defendant had not attorned to the jurisdiction of the Alberta court when there was no evidence before him on that issue constituted errors in law, the present claim was beyond the scope of the Small Claims Court Act, given that the adjudicator would first be called upon to settle a dispute regarding the original court's jurisdiction, the locus of the original contract and a factual dispute concerning attornment.","The parties appeared before the Small Claims Court adjudicator for hearing on the issue of whether the Small claims court had jurisdiction to hear the claim filed by the Claimants. The Adjudicator found that Section 9 of the Act did not provide the Court with authority to enforce an Order arising from foreign jurisdiction. Rather than determine a claim based on a fixed amount, it is apparent an adjudicator would be called upon first to settle a dispute regarding the original Court's jurisdiction, the locus of the original contract, and a factual dispute concerning attornment. The claim was reduced from the amount of its judgment to fall within the monetary limits established by the Small's Court Act and the fact that the debt so created was simple contract debt and not specialty debt, and was subject to the appropriate limitation period. The applicant appealed. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. The adjudicator erred in finding that the Small’s jurisdiction did not attorn to the Alberta jurisdiction. The appellant’ s interpretation of the Small Act was an error in law. The trial judge erred by finding that Eastside did not have jurisdiction to render the judgment. The issue was whether the Court had jurisdiction in Nova Scotia and Alberta. The court found the claim extends beyond the authority of the small claims court. The fact that default judgment may be set aside at some time in the future, as argued by the Respondent, does not make it any less final or conclusive. Once judgment is rendered there is no proceeding that can be withdrawn, abandoned, struck out or transferred as contemplated by the Act. The present claim extends into the authority and extent of the Alberta Small Claims court Act.","[1] This is an appeal from the decision of the Small Claims Court Adjudicator wherein he determined that he lacked jurisdiction to hear the action filed by the Claimants.

The issue if whether the applicant's two bills fall with the said 30 days or if this is a case where it is appropriate to abridge the time for allowing an assessment. HELD: It is in the interest of justice to order an assessment. The bills were issued in two separate matters. In the first matter, the final bill was rendered and the applicant had a lengthy opportunity to raise the issue. There will be no extension of time for the first bill. The second bill is different in that the applicant disputed the amount of the bill when he first received it. He was advised that the bill would be adjusted. An initial adjustment was made and when still not satisfied, ongoing discussions about the bill continued. The Court held that the last document received by the applicant was not the final bill as it was still subject to change.

5_2016skqb384.txt,"Criminal Law – Motor Vehicle Offences – Driving with Blood Alcohol Exceeding .08 – Conviction – AppealConstitutional Law – Charter of Rights, Section 10(b) – Appeal The accused appealed her conviction under s. 253(1)(b) of the Criminal Code of driving with a blood alcohol content over .08 on the grounds that the trial judge erred in law finding that there was no breach of her s. 8 Charter rights or of a breach of her s. 10(b) Charter rights. The first ground pertained to the defence’s contention that the officer who stopped the accused and made the breath demand did not have sufficient evidence of impaired driving. The officer testified that he was patrolling for impaired drivers on the night in question and observed the accused make a very tight right-hand turn, entering the untraveled portion of the road where the snow was soft. He noticed that her eyes were glassy and she was slurring her speech. She had just lit a cigarette, which suspects often do to mask the smell of alcohol. When she did put the cigarette out, he smelled alcohol on her breath. He asked her to step out of the vehicle and noticed that she swayed while standing still. She walked with a wide stance to the police cruiser and had to lean against it to maintain her balance. When he first asked the appellant if she had had anything to drink, she said that she’d had three but later said that she’d had five. He arrested her and made the breath demand. The defence argued that the trial judge erred in failing to consider other evidence that other vehicles had made similar turns and that the appellant did not require any assistance in leaving her vehicle and walking to the police cruiser, among other things. With respect to the second ground, the appellant advised the officer that she wanted to speak to a specific lawyer after being arrested. At the detachment, the appellant located the lawyer’s number and the officer dialed it. A voice message was left on the lawyer’s telephone but no return call was received. The officer advised the appellant she could call another lawyer, and initially she responded that she did not want to but wished to provide a breath sample. The officer was about to read her a waiver of her right when the appellant indicated that she wanted to call another lawyer. The officer called the number but received an after-hours message. He asked the appellant if she wanted to try another lawyer and she declined, stating that she was satisfied with leaving a message. She then provided her first breath sample. The defence argued at trial that the officer failed to advise the appellant of the availability of Legal Aid and failed to provide the Prosper warning, thereby breaching s. 10(b) of the Charter.  HELD: The appeal was dismissed. The court found that the trial judge had not erred: 1) by finding there was no s. 8 breach. The judge had not made any findings of fact that were not supported by the evidence nor did he fail to consider relevant evidence when he found that the officer had sufficient evidence that objectively supported his belief that the appellant’s ability to drive was impaired; and 2) by finding that there had been no breach of s. 10(b). The appellant had failed to act diligently in pursuing her right to speak with a lawyer and provided a clear and unequivocal indication that she had abandoned her right to counsel when she said she was happy leaving a message.",The appellant appeals her conviction under s. 253(1)(b) of the Criminal Code for driving with a blood alcohol content over.08. The trial judge erred in finding there was no breach of s. 10(b) Charter rights. The appellant contends the failure of the officer to provide the appellant with a Prosper warning resulted in a breach of her s. 9(b)(c) Charter right. The officer noted that other cars had previously made a tight turn as evidenced by other tire tracks in the soft snow. The police had an obligation to refrain from eliciting any incriminating evidence until the detainee was given the opportunity to consult with legal counsel. The appeal court dismissed the appeal. The court found that the trial judge did not make any findings of fact that were unsupported by the evidence nor did he fail to consider relevant evidence when he held that the officer had sufficient evidence that objectively supported the officer's belief that the appellant's ability to drive a motor vehicle was impaired. The evidence provided by the officer was sufficient to support the officer’s conclusion that the breath sample was positive. The respondent’ s. 8 Charter rights were breached. The Court dismissed the appellant’S appeal. It was not found that there was a breach in s. 11(b). The trial court found the trial court erred by failing to consider the factors articulated by the police as forming the factual basis for making the breath demand were reliable and capable of supporting the officer. The error was not the only reason the appellant appealed. The Appeal Court found that it was not a breach because the trial officer had not been trained in the field of sobriety and the officer did not have sufficient evidence to objectively support the appellant. The issue was whether the trial Judge erred on the facts of the case. The test for a Charter breach is whether the officer has had sufficient experience to make a determination that there is a reasonable and probable basis for the officer making a determination. The errors of fact are listed as follows: 1) The trial officer failed to consider that other car tracks in soft snow constituted evidence of impairment. The second issue is whether there was sufficient evidence upon which the officer could reasonably reach the verdict. The standard required for an effective waiver of counsel is very high. 2) The appellant”s appeal is dismissed. The failure of Cst. Schmidt to provide her with a warning resulted.

Conclusion [62] For the reasons previously stated, Ms. Drake’s appeal is dismissed in its entirety.",0.6057142857142858,0.5119305856832972,"Criminal Law – Motor Vehicle Offences – Driving with Blood Alcohol Exceeding .08 – Conviction – AppealConstitutional Law – Charter of Rights, Section 10(b) – Appeal The accused appealed her conviction under s. 253(1)(b) of the Criminal Code of driving with a blood alcohol content over .08 on the grounds that the trial judge erred in law finding that there was no breach of her s. 8 Charter rights or of a breach of her s. 10(b) Charter rights. The first ground pertained to the defence’s contention that the officer who stopped the accused and made the breath demand did not have sufficient evidence of impaired driving. The officer testified that he was patrolling for impaired drivers on the night in question and observed the accused make a very tight right-hand turn, entering the untraveled portion of the road where the snow was soft. He noticed that her eyes were glassy and she was slurring her speech. She had just lit a cigarette, which suspects often do to mask the smell of alcohol. When she did put the cigarette out, he smelled alcohol on her breath. He asked her to step out of the vehicle and noticed that she swayed while standing still. She walked with a wide stance to the police cruiser and had to lean against it to maintain her balance. When he first asked the appellant if she had had anything to drink, she said that she’d had three but later said that she’d had five. He arrested her and made the breath demand. The defence argued that the trial judge erred in failing to consider other evidence that other vehicles had made similar turns and that the appellant did not require any assistance in leaving her vehicle and walking to the police cruiser, among other things. With respect to the second ground, the appellant advised the officer that she wanted to speak to a specific lawyer after being arrested. At the detachment, the appellant located the lawyer’s number and the officer dialed it. A voice message was left on the lawyer’s telephone but no return call was received. The officer advised the appellant she could call another lawyer, and initially she responded that she did not want to but wished to provide a breath sample. The officer was about to read her a waiver of her right when the appellant indicated that she wanted to call another lawyer. The officer called the number but received an after-hours message. He asked the appellant if she wanted to try another lawyer and she declined, stating that she was satisfied with leaving a message. She then provided her first breath sample. The defence argued at trial that the officer failed to advise the appellant of the availability of Legal Aid and failed to provide the Prosper warning, thereby breaching s. 10(b) of the Charter.  HELD: The appeal was dismissed. The court found that the trial judge had not erred: 1) by finding there was no s. 8 breach. The judge had not made any findings of fact that were not supported by the evidence nor did he fail to consider relevant evidence when he found that the officer had sufficient evidence that objectively supported his belief that the appellant’s ability to drive was impaired; and 2) by finding that there had been no breach of s. 10(b). The appellant had failed to act diligently in pursuing her right to speak with a lawyer and provided a clear and unequivocal indication that she had abandoned her right to counsel when she said she was happy leaving a message.","The appellant appeals her conviction under s. 253(1)(b) of the Criminal Code for driving with a blood alcohol content over.08 on the following grounds: 1) The trial judge ignored evidence that the appellant did not require assistance for her to exit the vehicle and walk to the police cruiser. However, there was evidence provided by the officer that she was smoking a freshly lit cigarette which, in the officer's experience, was a tactic sometimes used by people to hide the smell of something. The officer noted that other cars had previously made a tight turn as evidenced by other tire tracks in the soft snow and the appellant pulled over appropriately after being signalled to do so. Smokers will light up cigarette not solely for the purpose of masking the odour of alcohol on their breath but out of nervousness or other cause. The judge did not make any findings of fact that were unsupported by the evidence nor did he fail to consider relevant evidence when he held that the officer had sufficient evidence that objectively supported the appellant's belief that her ability to drive a motor vehicle was impaired. 2) The appellant contends that the trial judge erred in law in finding there was no breach of her s. 10(b) Charter rights. The court dismissed ground one of the appeal on the basis that there was an error in law. There was insufficient evidence upon which a trier of fact, properly instructed, could reasonably reach the verdict. The standard required for an effective waiver of counsel is very high. 3) On the first ground, which is factual one, the test is based on an error of law, failure to consider the evidence in its totality and/or an error respecting specific piece of relevant evidence may ground a successful appeal.","[1] Chantelle Drake [Ms. Drake] appeals her conviction under s. 253(1)(b) of the Criminal Code, RSC 1985, c C-46, of driving with a blood alcohol content of over .08, on the following grounds:

b) The learned trial judge erred in law in finding that there was no breach of the s. 10(b) Charter giving everyone the right on arrest or detention the right to retain and instruct counsel without delay. The alleged errors of fact are listed as follows:
a) The trial judge failed to consider that other cars had previously made a tight turn as evidenced by other tire tracks in the soft snow; [31] The trial judge, in attributing four and half years’ experience to the officer when in fact the officer had only three years’ experience at the time of the offence, did not commit material error.

5_2018skqb209.txt,"Contract Law – Sale of Land – FormationReal Property – Sale of Land – Oral Contract The plaintiff brought an action against the defendant for specific performance and damages. The plaintiff claimed that the defendant agreed to sell him three quarters of land. The defendant’s position was that there was no agreement and if there was, it was not in writing as required by The Statute of Frauds. The plaintiff made this application for a resolution of the initial question of liability as to whether an agreement was created and if it was, then proof of damages would follow. The plaintiff argued that a contract was created and that it complied with the statute because he made his offer in writing, via an internet-based land auction program, and the acceptance was orally communicated by a telephone conversation. Therefore, all the requisite elements of a valid land sale were present. The defendant had used a website to list 17 quarters of land for sale, including six quarters of relevance to the action. The website was intended to connect sellers of farmland with interested buyers in a type of “non-binding auction” to permit sellers to gauge interest in their land, find the best possible price and avoid realtor’s commissions if a sale were completed. The listing showed three groups of the farmland for sale, described as 1) three adjoining quarters (the subject quarters); 2) two quarters (the adjacent quarters) and 3) one quarter (unsold quarter). In his online comments to the defendant during the auction, the plaintiff said that he wanted all five quarters (the subject and adjacent quarters). The plaintiff bid on each of the above parcels and had the highest bid on the subject quarters, but that in itself did not guarantee the purchase under the terms of the online auction program. He stopped bidding on the adjacent quarters because he thought they were becoming overpriced. After the auction, the plaintiff consulted with family members regarding whether to pursue negotiations with any of the bidders. They discussed the problems that would occur if the subject quarters were separated from the adjacent quarters because the two blocks were owned by different individuals. The defendant then telephoned the plaintiff and gave him two package options for the sale, both of which resolved the identified problem by including the purchase of the adjacent quarters. The package options were to purchase the subject and the adjacent quarters for $1,050,000 (which was 5 percent more than the $625,000 the plaintiff offered for the subject quarters and his last bid of $375,000 on the adjacent quarters) or the subject quarters and one of the adjacent quarters for $840,000. At the end of the conversation, the plaintiff testified that he wanted to be sure that regardless of his response to the package option offers, he would be able to buy the subject quarters for $625,000. The plaintiff did not have concerns about the purchase because he said that the defendant told him that “we had them”. He believed that this indicated the defendant’s willingness to accept his bid on the subject quarters and that if he accepted either of the two options, then either of the newly accepted offers would replace the agreement respecting the subject quarters. The defendant’s interpretation of the conversation was that he declined to accept the offer on the subject quarters until he heard back from the plaintiff respecting the package options and then he would decide whether or not he would sell the subject quarters. He either misheard or misunderstood the plaintiff’s question about the subject quarters and denied that he gave any assurance that he would sell them to him regardless of his response to the package offers. The plaintiff called the defendant shortly after the first conversation and advised that he would not accept either of the package option offers but would immediately bring the deposit for the purchase of the subject quarters. The defendant told him to “hold off”. The plaintiff interpreted that to mean that there was no urgency regarding the deposit rather than that no agreement existed respecting the subject quarters. The defendant testified that he said he was not prepared to accept the deposit at this time, which meant that he was not prepared to accept the plaintiff’s bid on the subject quarters. Three days later, the defendant emailed the plaintiff and said that he would not be accepting the bid. The issues were: 1) whether a contract was formed; 2) if so, did the Statute of Frauds apply.  HELD: The plaintiff’s action was dismissed. He had not established on a balance of probabilities that he and the defendant were parties to a valid and enforceable agreement of sale regarding the subject quarters.

The Court held that the contract was valid and that the respondent had not made any errors in the contract. The court also held that there was no evidence that the agreement was created between the respondent and the respondent in any event. The respondent”s submission was not supported by the evidence. The evidence was that the parties had exchanged information during the bidding process and that they had not discussed the terms of the contract in any way. The plaintiff was also awarded specific performance and damages. The issue was whether the agreement existed between the parties and whether the respondent was entitled to receive the appropriate deposit respecting the purchase of the respondent property. The petitioner was awarded general damages.,"[34] The court must determine whether a contract was created between Mr. Petrie and Mr. Ziola respecting the Subject Quarters.

The plaintiff claimed that the defendant agreed to sell him three quarters of land. The defendant’s position was that there was no agreement and if there was, it was not in writing as required by The Statute of Frauds. The plaintiff made this application for a resolution of the initial question of liability as to whether an agreement was created and if it was, then proof of damages would follow. The plaintiff argued that a contract was created and that it complied with the statute because he made his offer in writing, via an internet-based land auction program, and the acceptance was orally communicated by a telephone conversation. Therefore, all the requisite elements of a valid land sale were present. The defendant had used a website to list 17 quarters of land for sale, including six quarters of relevance to the action. The website was intended to connect sellers of farmland with interested buyers in a type of “non-binding auction” to permit sellers to gauge interest in their land, find the best possible price and avoid realtor’s commissions if a sale were completed. The listing showed three groups of the farmland for sale, described as 1) three adjoining quarters (the subject quarters); 2) two quarters (the adjacent quarters) and 3) one quarter (unsold quarter). In his online comments to the defendant during the auction, the plaintiff said that he wanted all five quarters (the subject and adjacent quarters). The plaintiff bid on each of the above parcels and had the highest bid on the subject quarters, but that in itself did not guarantee the purchase under the terms of the online auction program. He stopped bidding on the adjacent quarters because he thought they were becoming overpriced. After the auction, the plaintiff consulted with family members regarding whether to pursue negotiations with any of the bidders. They discussed the problems that would occur if the subject quarters were separated from the adjacent quarters because the two blocks were owned by different individuals. The defendant then telephoned the plaintiff and gave him two package options for the sale, both of which resolved the identified problem by including the purchase of the adjacent quarters. The package options were to purchase the subject and the adjacent quarters for $1,050,000 (which was 5 percent more than the $625,000 the plaintiff offered for the subject quarters and his last bid of $375,000 on the adjacent quarters) or the subject quarters and one of the adjacent quarters for $840,000. At the end of the conversation, the plaintiff testified that he wanted to be sure that regardless of his response to the package option offers, he would be able to buy the subject quarters for $625,000. The plaintiff did not have concerns about the purchase because he said that the defendant told him that “we had them”. He believed that this indicated the defendant’s willingness to accept his bid on the subject quarters and that if he accepted either of the two options, then either of the newly accepted offers would replace the agreement respecting the subject quarters. The defendant’s interpretation of the conversation was that he declined to accept the offer on the subject quarters until he heard back from the plaintiff respecting the package options and then he would decide whether or not he would sell the subject quarters. He either misheard or misunderstood the plaintiff’s question about the subject quarters and denied that he gave any assurance that he would sell them to him regardless of his response to the package offers. The plaintiff called the defendant shortly after the first conversation and advised that he would not accept either of the package option offers but would immediately bring the deposit for the purchase of the subject quarters. The defendant told him to “hold off”. The plaintiff interpreted that to mean that there was no urgency regarding the deposit rather than that no agreement existed respecting the subject quarters. The defendant testified that he said he was not prepared to accept the deposit at this time, which meant that he was not prepared to accept the plaintiff’s bid on the subject quarters. Three days later, the defendant emailed the plaintiff and said that he would not be accepting the bid. The issues were: 1) whether a contract was formed; 2) if so, did the Statute of Frauds apply.

6_2011nssc48.txt,"The two plaintiffs were forced to jump from the window of their third-floor apartment after a fire erupted in the building. The fire alarm system was not functioning and, despite being aware of previous problems with the 25-year-old system, the defendant had never maintained or inspected it; the self-closing hallway fire doors were continually in an open position; the battery-operated fire alarm in the plaintiffs' apartment was not functioning; and the plaintiffs were unaware of whether their smoke detector was wired into the building or was their responsibility. The male plaintiff suffered serious fractures to both ankles and a fractured fibula. He underwent four surgeries, was non-weight bearing for three months and was unable to run or engage in various sports. Although he had returned to work as a production worker, his condition would continue to deteriorate due to post-traumatic arthritis, most likely resulting in a future ankle fusion. The female plaintiff suffered a pelvic ring injury with bilateral pelvic and sacral fractures, a fractured elbow and a broken rib. She underwent surgery on her pelvis, was unable to look after her own hygiene for five months and developed bursitis in the hip. She continued to experience pain in the tailbone with extensive sitting and in the elbow with extension of the arm, had a permanent loss of elbow extension and walked with a limp. The worsening of her pre-existing anxiety and depression led to the diagnosis of post-traumatic stress disorder. The landlord argued that the plaintiffs' injuries had not been caused by any of its actions. Male plaintiff awarded the sum of $75,000 for general damages, $15,000 for past and future loss of valuable services and $45,000 for loss of earning capacity; female plaintiff awarded the sum of $55,000 for general damages, $35,000 for past and future loss of valuable services and $75,000 for future loss of income. Although there was no evidence that the defendant was responsible for the fire, its conduct created an unreasonable risk of harm in the event of a fire.

and Humboldt in two reefer trailers. The Issue [5] The issue to be determined is what is meant by the
term ""possession"" in s. 34(2)(a) and when, in the
circumstances of this case, Lake Air obtained possession or
constructive possession of the trailers within the meaning of
s. 34(2)(a). [19] In my view, a person is not in constructive
possession of collateral within s. 34(2)(a) unless that person
is a ""debtor"" as defined, unless the collateral is
""collateral"" as defined, and unless another person ""obtained""
physical possession of the collateral ""at the request of ""
that debtor. Such a clause is
inconsistent with the submission that Lake Air had actual or
constructive possession at an earlier date. [22] I also conclude that Lake Air did not have
constructive possession of the trailers prior to December 22,
1997, through either GJ Bell or Mid-Canada. Conclusion [25] The application of Associates is allowed.",0.6034912718204489,0.5520361990950227,"Humboldt applied for an order declaring the priority of competing security interests held by Associates in two reefer trailers pursuant to s. 63 of the Personal Property Security Act. The parties filed an agreed statement of facts and focussed their submissions solely on the priority issue as if the application had been brought under s. 66. The application was allowed and the respondent was ordered that its purchase-money security interests in the two trailers had priority over those of the secured party with the prior interest. The issue to be determined is what is meant by the term 'possession' in s. 34(2)(a) and when, in the circumstances of this case, Lake Air obtained possession orconstructive possession of the trailers within the meaning of s.34(2). Humboldts did not become debtor in possession until December 22, 1997, through either GJ Bell or Mid-Canada. The respondent was entitled to its costs from the University of Regina. The court concluded that the application of Associates was allowed. The terms of the agreement were not contained in either s. 21 or s.33(1) of the previous Act. There was no dispute that the 15-day period in section 22 begins to run from the date the lessee obtained possession as lessee and not the date that the the prior party became buyer of the goods.",0.5476190476190476

7_2003skqb255.txt,"The father was unemployed by reason of health problems and was in arrears on the December 13, 2002 child support order for $454 per month. He was seeking damages against the federal government for alleged abuses suffered while attending an Indian Residential School. The mother sought to attach the possible damage award for child support. HELD: The first $50,000 of any settlement proceeds, after payment of reasonable solicitor fees and disbursements, shall be paid into Court by his counsel. The Court agreed with the conclusion in Anderson that an order can be made with respect to damage awards even though, at the moment of the order, there is only a cause of action in existence and no precise amount of damages are known. There was no question that a cause of action or chose in action is property and thus the subject of an order under the Family Maintenance Act s.8. It is of no consequence that the order may be in another form such as money. To adopt any different analysis would be to unnecessarily limit the remedial application of s.8. Given the overarching purpose to ensure property is not wasted, thus impairing or defeating a claim under the FMA, it was logical orders can be made by the Court that are ancillary or a natural incident of the primary order preserving the property. The mother was awarded costs of the application set at $350.","The parties have three children aged four to eight years. The respondent is involved in a litigation against the Government of Canada regarding alleged abuse he allegedly suffered while attending an Indian Residential School. The parties have been unemployed for the most part. Arrears of child support are constantly accruing. The father is restrained from disposing of any money he has received or may receive in relation to the lawsuit without an order from the Court. HELD: 1) The respondent's counsel is required to report to the Court forthwith as to the potential for damage to the respondent's property. 2) The court concluded in Anderson that it was not necessary to find predilection or intention on the part of the respondent to waste assets in order to issue an order under s. 8. The threshold to be met in such an application was simply that the disposition or wasting of the asset would impair or defeat claim under the Act. 3) In the event the respondent receives damages from the Government he may well be his only significant asset and, more to the point, the only asset that can be used to meet the respondent’s outstanding and ever accruating child support obligations. 4) In Anderson, the section relied upon by the petitioner is s.7 of The Family Maintenance Act, 1997, S.S. 1997, c.F6.2 (the “Act”). Section 8(1) of the Act only authorizes restraining orders against those against whom claim under a certain Act may be made and therefore made no order vis-a-vis the respondent. The petitioner bases her application on the ground that if the respondent received damages from Canada that may well well be the only significant object that can reasonably become source of satisfying claim under this Act. The only asset to meet his outstanding and always accruation child support obligation is the one asset that could reasonably become a source of source of income for the respondent and society as a whole. The first $50,000.00 after payment of reasonable solicitor fees and disbursements shall be paid into Court so that the parties might speak to the distribution of same. It is further ordered that the respondent shall pay the settlement proceeds into Court in accordance with the foregoing.","[2] Since the issuance of the order the respondent has been, for the most part, unemployed by reason of health problems and, as a result, arrears of child support are constantly accruing. (b) the Respondent, [M.E.H.], is hereby restrained from disposing of any money that he has received or may receive in relation to the lawsuit without further Order of the Court with the exception of paying any and all legal fees and disbursements plus taxes owing to his solicitors.

[11] There is no question that a cause of action or chose in action is property and thus the subject of an order of s. 8 of the Act. [15] Accordingly, it is ordered that in the event the respondent receives a settlement in his law suit against the Government based on his claim of abuse suffered at the Indian Residential School, the first $50,000.00, after payment of reasonable solicitor fees and disbursements, shall be paid into Court so that the parties might speak to the distribution of same. It is further ordered that the respondent’s counsel, the Merchant Law Group or any new counsel shall pay the settlement proceeds into Court, in accordance with the foregoing.",0.5567651632970451,0.5112540192926045,"The father was unemployed by reason of health problems and was in arrears on the December 13, 2002 child support order for $454 per month.

The requested relief cannot be granted unless the court has authority to order that a subdivision of land be effected outside the requirements of The Planning and Development Act. HELD: 1) Even if this was a proper case for the making of a vesting order, there is a further difficulty presented by the fact that the applicant school division is asking the court to order that a subdivision be effected, as a pre-condition to the vesting order. Whether under the former legislation or the present, the court is not free to subvert the statutory requirements in the exercise of its authority to make vesting orders. The court reviewed the relevant caselaw. 2) While the court is precluded from directing the Registrar to effect a subdivision that is prohibited by the legislation, a resolution of the matter could be achieved if, for example, after adjudicating on all the rights and obligations at issue, the Court was prepared to direct that the pre-conditions to subdivision approval be met by a party to the proceedings. Once the proposed subdivision meets the required standards and is approved, then a vesting order can be made in the appropriate circumstances under the provisions of s. 6.5 of The Land Titles Conversion Facilitation Regulations, or under The Improvements Under Mistake of Title Act. The court reviewed the applicable caselaw. 3) The court requested that further written submissions be provided by the parties on the matter of directing a trial of the issues.","FIAT. The applicant asks for a vesting order regarding a presently unsubdivided parcel of land owned by the respondent. The respondent argues that the provisions of the Planning and Development Act must, of necessity, be considered merged in conveyance. HELD: The appeal is allowed. 1) The respondent's claim is totally separate from the claim. The landowner has no title save to the extent that he initiated complaints about the livestock operations and the damages it was causing to his land. The proposed subdivision is in contravention of the Act, the regulations and the Zoning bylaw. 2) The applicant, the School Division, is asking the court to order subdivision of Parcel G as precondition to the vesting of the order. The application in question is tantamount to a judicially ordered partition of land to avoid the effect of legislation. The Court was obliged to prevent such wholesale frustration of the legislature's objects. 3) The original transaction between the School and the Flads was concluded in 1996, conditional on subdivision approval, which the Court was to continue until further order of the Court.

Adjoining cottage owners had all built on lots one removed from the lot to which they had title. As the school was built directly adjacent to church (Parcel D), the confusion was shared by the church. The Flads were in occupation of proposed Parcel G, using the property as a residence and constructing corrals for use in their livestock operation.

He was suspended from the program in 1997. Since then, there have been a number of legal proceedings between the applicant and the University, both internally and externally. The College of Medicine insists that the applicant must find a third party sponsor prior to being allowed to resume his residency program. The applicant has not yet exhausted his appeals within the internal laws of the University and there is no evidence that the College of Management has any say in the matter. HELD: The applicant's status was changed to suspension with pay pending the completion of the Investigative Committee reviews. The University insisted that the appellant must find another sponsor prior before being allowed back to his program. 1) The applicant had not yet concluded his appeals. The college insisted that he must find his third party sponsors prior to be allowed to return to his residency. 2) The College was in no position to waive the provisions of the collective agreement because it cannot unilaterally change the terms of the agreement. The fact that the respondent was such a student and for reasons which will be outlined hereafter, his third parties funding was depleted during the period he was suspended. The appeal committee recommended that the appeal committee recommend that the student be allowed back on probation. The university insisted that this decision was properly decided. 3) The respondent was not in any position to be a party to the appeal process. The respondent's third party funding was not depleted during his suspension. The Court of Queen's Bench determined that the petitioner should not have been dismissed prior to an investigation into the matters that led to him being placed on probation to begin with. The court found that the Crown had jurisdiction to determine disputes which were governed by the internal law, policies, and procedures of the university. The petitioner was entitled to seek the assistance of a judge of the Court of the Queen's Court. The judge was not to be interfered with. 4) The petitioner had not exhausted his appeal process within the past 5 years. The appellant was not a party in the appeal. The parties were largely agreed the applicant had exclusive jurisdiction to decide disputes which are governed by internal law and policies of the school. The Judge was to perform her role as visitor. The evidence of the appellant's failure to comply with the appeal panel decision was not established. The trial judge was to determine whether the petitioner had a right to appeal. 5) The court was to consider the appellant’s application to have the Court determine his jurisdiction.

His third party sponsorship was depleted. The college insisted he was the only student who had been allowed to continue training without a salary during the time that he had been suspended. 4) It was not clear whether the College had any say in the decision to place the applicant on probation. 5) The evidence of the appeal committee did not show that the College was in any way influenced by the appellant’ s views on the subject matter. It was clear that systemic forces were at work beyond the control of the appellant. The appellant was such a student that for reasons which were outlined hereafter the College would have funded his education through to its conclusion.

The court may exercise its jurisdiction and powers of the court if it wishes. 3) There is no dispute that general visitatorial jurisdiction extends not only to judging that the university satisfy standards which are fundamental to the administration of justice in every sphere but also to assessing the objective reasonableness of the exercise of discretion by those persons charged with administering the internal laws and policies of the university on the facts of any matter. The fact that the applicant chose to have resort to the courts on two occasions suggests that the jurisdiction is more original than traditional supervisory or appellate jurisdiction. 4) There are a number of cases in which the College was granted status to appear at the hearing and did so.

The parties are largely agreed the visitor has exclusive jurisdiction to determine disputes which are governed by the internal law, policies, and procedures of the university. The University has policies and procedures related to such supernumerary residents directed at ensuring that wealthy students simply not be permitted to 'buy' their way into one of the training programs.

7_2006nspc61.txt,"A young person who suffered from considerable mental health issues and was in the permanent care of the Minister of Community Services applied to have the court exclude the public and the media from her court convened pre- sentencing conference. The purpose of the conference was to assemble various professionals from diverse fields to discuss the complex issues surrounding the young person and to provide recommendations to the court as to an appropriate sentence. Various of the professionals had expressed their concern as to their ability to participate in the conference if the media was present. Application for access by the media denied; order granted excluding the public and the media from the pre-sentencing conference; the benefits of an exclusion order outweigh the deleterious effect of restricting the public's right to freedom of expression and the freedom of the press. Although the court convened hearing is a public proceeding to which, prima facie, the open court principle applies, the attendance, cooperation and participation of the invitees to the conference (all professionals who were bound by laws, policies and agreements of confidentiality) was strictly voluntary and many, if not all, would be unable and unwilling to participate in a conference that was open to the public and the media. The administration of justice was furthered by the court obtaining the best possible information from those identified as best able to provide it so that recommendations flowing from the conference would lead to the best sentence for the youth.

The Crown sought a ruling from the Court as to whether the public, including the media, should be permitted to attend the pre-sentencing conference scheduled for December 11, 2006. The crown, the young person and the parent argued that the conference should not be open to the public and the media. The court took the position that this was a public proceeding to which they should have access. The Court found that the public's interest was at the forefront of the discussions and that the only thing that would compromise the public’s understanding of the justice system was the adequacy of government programs and support for the young offender. The public was also encouraged to participate in the discussions. The exclusion order was upheld. The appeal court found that it had discretion to exclude the public from the conference. The evidence before the court rebutted the open court principle and supported an order pursuant to s. 132 of the Act. The judge found that this case was a “public proceeding to be of interest to the court.” The court found the following: 1) the public was entitled to participate; 2) the court found there was a danger to the general public and that it would be in the public interest to exclude them; 3) the Court found the public had a right to participate and that public participation was not to be discouraged. The general rule of openness was not absolute. The courts were required to consider the interests of society in the protection and rehabilitation of young people involved in youth court proceedings.

That order had been made pursuant to s. 242 of The Planning and Development Act and required the respondent to comply with the zoning bylaw by desisting from operating an equipment storage yard on a parcel of land owned by him and to restore it to the condition it was in prior to his use of it. The respondent had purchased the land in 2009 and immediately began storing equipment and leaving junk cars and other materials on it. The applicant had tried to encourage the respondent’s voluntary cooperation with the bylaw but eventually issued the order. After the court granted the order, the respondent took no steps to comply with it and in August 2014, the applicant applied for an order declaring the respondent to be in contempt of court. The application was heard in September at which time the respondent submitted by affidavit that he had removed the old cars but believed that he was allowed to keep his equipment. He requested that he receive additional time. The respondent was given until December 2014 to comply with the order. At the hearing he deposed that he had spent a significant amount of time and money removing materials from the land and that he had found out from his counsel that his belief regarding the permitted use of the land was incorrect. Based on the appearance of the site, the applicant was not satisfied but agreed to adjourn the matter until May 2015 as nothing could be done during the winter. When the matter was reviewed in May, the respondent had removed more equipment but said that he was not able to move it all as he had no place to put the rest of it. The applicant requested that the court find the respondent in contempt and to impose appropriate penalties, authorize it to remove any remaining machinery and to add the costs of this removal and disposal to the taxes on the land and to make an order for solicitor-client costs in its favour. HELD: The respondent was found to be in contempt of court pursuant to Queen’s Bench rule 11-16(3) for his failure, without reasonable excuse, to comply with the terms of the May 2014 court order. The court authorized the applicant to remove and dispose of the equipment if the respondent had not done so within 30 days of the order issued. The court awarded solicitor-client costs to the applicant in the amount of $15,000 because of the respondent’s continued and unjustified failure to comply with the zoning bylaw. As the applicant might incur additional costs to remove the equipment, those costs would be added to the tax rolls of the property and become payable by the respondent if he had not purged his contempt within the allotted time.","The respondent was found in contempt of court for failing to comply with a court order requiring him to remove all of his equipment from his property. The respondent had taken no significant steps to comply and was now in contempt. The court ordered the respondent to pay solicitor/client costs. The defendant was to appear in court on February 2, 2014. The Court ordered the defendant to pay court costs. It also ordered the plaintiff to dispose of any equipment that remained on his property beyond the time stipulated in the order. The plaintiff was to pay costs to the defendant. The costs of the contempt application were to be assessed at $15,000. The applicant had made significant progress in complying with the order and was prepared to continue to remove the offending equipment. The trial judge erred in finding that the respondent had not shown reasonable concern for his safety and that the court had not fettered its discretion in awarding costs.","[12] The RM asks the court to:
1. Find Gregory George Schmidt in contempt of court;
2. Impose appropriate penalties or sanctions on Mr. Schmidt;
3. Authorize the RM to enter onto Parcel A to remove any remaining machinery, vehicles, equipment and other materials stored on the land contrary to the Zoning Bylaw; to arrange for disposal of those materials; and to add the costs of this removal and disposal to the taxes on the lands; and
4. Make an order for solicitor/client costs in favour of the RM. [26] In the result, and pursuant to Queen’s Bench Rule 11-16(3), this court declares the respondent, Gregory George Schmidt to be in contempt of court for failure, without reasonable excuse, to comply with the terms of the order of Mr. Justice M.T.

In the event Mr. Schmidt remains in contempt of court following the expiration of 30 days after personal service of the order issued pursuant to this decision, the RM is hereby authorized to enter upon Parcel A and remove and dispose of the machinery, commercial vehicles, equipment and other items that remain stored thereon contrary to the Zoning Bylaw and thereafter dispose of those items. By limiting solicitor-client costs to circumstances where there is both exceptional circumstances and scandalous, outrageous or reprehensible conduct, the Chambers judge incorrectly fettered her discretion.

7_2018skca42.txt,"Criminal Law – Murder – Second Degree Murder – Conviction – AppealEvidence – Unsavoury Witnesses – Vetrovec Warning – Charge to Jury The appellant had been found guilty of second degree murder following a trial before a judge and jury. He appealed on the ground that the trial judge had failed to give the jury a Vetrovec warning regarding the testimony of his former common law spouse (S.S.) and a witness who had been his friend (W.D.) who was the source of the gun used in the shooting of the victim. The appellant’s trial counsel had initially identified the need for the judge to issue the warning because W.D. had an interest in the outcome because there were outstanding charges against him and because there was the potential that S.S.would be charged too, she would also have an interest in the case as well. During the pre-charge conference with defence counsel and the Crown, the trial judge noted that in giving the warning to the jury he would also have to convey a summary of the Crown’s confirmatory evidence. The defence counsel then withdrew his application. The victim had been a friend of the appellant. According to S.S.’s testimony, the appellant and the victim had pre-arranged a meeting in an abandoned farmyard. The victim worked as an automated teller machine (ATM) technician and as part of his job, he travelled between ATMs carrying cash. S.S. did not see what happened between the two men but heard two gunshots and then saw the appellant and the victim point guns at each other. She saw the victim on his knees pleading with the appellant and offering money in exchange for his life. The appellant instructed her to collect the money and the victim’s cellphone and place them in his truck and while she was doing so, she heard another gunshot and saw the victim lying face down and the appellant standing over him holding a gun. As she and the appellant left the scene, the appellant gave her the victim’s gun. The appellant hid the other guns and the money at another farm site and then dumped the victim’s cellphone and ammunition in a farm field. Apart from the handguns, none of the other items were ever recovered. The witness remained in a relationship with the appellant for another four years following the crime until November 2013. She was contacted by the police in February 2013 and denied any knowledge of the incident. At trial, S.S. testified that she was afraid of the appellant and he had warned her that as an accomplice, she was as involved as he was. When the RCMP contacted her again in May 2014, she again denied any knowledge but then told the officer what she knew because she felt safer and would receive protection from the appellant. S.S. did not have a criminal record, nor was she charged with any offence arising from this incident. The appellant testified that during the meeting in the farmyard, the victim produced two handguns and they began to test fire the weapons. The victim suggested that they stage a fake robbery. The appellant would rough up his friend and then take the cash from his truck. The victim became quite aggressive after the appellant hit him too hard and began chasing him with one of his guns. S.S. then took one of the guns and shot the victim three times. She took $23,000 in cash from his truck because she had financial problems. The testimony of W.D. was that the appellant had acquired two handguns, a Glock and a .22 calibre handgun, from him, ostensibly on behalf of another friend. Several days later, the appellant returned both handguns and reported that after his friend began to shoot at him with the .22 calibre, he had returned fired and shot him three times. On the appellant’s insistence, the witness changed the barrel of the Glock handgun several months later. The police arrested W.D. and charged him with unspecified offences arising from the incident. In the appellant’s version, he testified that the victim brought the guns to the meeting and assumed that he acquired them from W.D. He therefore returned them to W.D. after the incident and requested that he change the barrel on the Glock to protect W.D. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. The court found that the trial judge had not erred by not giving the Vetrovec warning. It was not mandatory for him to do so regardless of the position of the defence counsel. The judge was aware of the need for such a warning in the circumstances and after consulting with the Crown and the defence, he exercised his discretion to decide that he would not instruct the jury. The judge was aware that the defence counsel withdrew his application as a tactical decision to avoid having the judge repeat the Crown’s confirmatory evidence to the jury. The judge’s exercise of his discretion was entitled to deference.","The defendant was found guilty of the second degree murder of his common law spouse. The trial judge sought input from counsel as to whether Vetrovec warning should be given in relation to either witness. The Crown's expert testified that the barrel of the handgun was not the original factory barrel and other indicia from the evidence at the scene did not support the appellant's version of events. The defence argued that Vetrove warning was mandatory, regardless of the position taken by the defendant at the time of trial. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. 1) The trial court found that the trial judge did not give a Vetrochio warning in relation the testimony of either witness, regardless if the defendant's position was taken at the trial. The Court found that this was an error of law. 2) The Court held that the evidence was not so circumstantial as to suggest that the appellant had made an error in law. The evidence was so strong that it could not be excluded. The court found the appellant was guilty of both counts. The appellant's evidence was unreliable and the Court found the trial court did not err in failing to give a warning. The appeal court found there was no evidence that the jury was misled. The jury was left to decide whether the appellant should give a verbal warning. 3) The court dismissed the appellant’s appeal. The decision was based upon a fundamental misunderstanding of the strength of the ballistic and scientific evidence and the importance of the witness’ evidence to the Crown. The test of credibility was not a factor on its own. The judge was not required to give the appellant a warning in the circumstances. The issue was whether the trial officer should have given a warning to either witnesses. The error was not made lightly. The verdict could only have been salvaged under the curative provision set forth in s. 686(1)(b)(iii) of the Criminal Code if he concluded that the appeal court concluded that he had erred in law by failing to provide a warning when the circumstances required one to be given. The Appeal Court found there were other considerations that inform the decision. The only issue that the Court raised was whether it was an appropriate level of concern and caution.","Appeal dismissed [1] Daniel Smith was found guilty of the second degree murder of Roger Byer following a trial before a judge and jury.

I am also satisfied that, in exercising his discretion not to give a Vetrovec warning, he was particularly alert to the position advanced by defence counsel, which he clearly understood to be a tactical choice.

However, the decision to give the warning is discretionary in nature, as is the content of the warning itself, and a trial judge’s exercise of this discretion is entitled to deference: He took a measured approach with regard to the need for a Vetrovec warning in the circumstances and he carefully solicited input from both Crown and defence counsel. I am also satisfied that, in exercising his discretion not to give a Vetrovec warning, he was particularly alert to the position advanced by defence counsel, which he clearly understood to be a tactical choice. [99] The appeal must, therefore, be dismissed.",0.4387755102040816,0.26305609284332687,"Criminal Law – Murder – Second Degree Murder – Conviction – AppealEvidence – Unsavoury Witnesses – Vetrovec Warning – Charge to Jury The appellant had been found guilty of second degree murder following a trial before a judge and jury. He appealed on the ground that the trial judge had failed to give the jury a Vetrovec warning regarding the testimony of his former common law spouse (S.S.) and a witness who had been his friend (W.D.) who was the source of the gun used in the shooting of the victim. The appellant’s trial counsel had initially identified the need for the judge to issue the warning because W.D. had an interest in the outcome because there were outstanding charges against him and because there was the potential that S.S.would be charged too, she would also have an interest in the case as well. During the pre-charge conference with defence counsel and the Crown, the trial judge noted that in giving the warning to the jury he would also have to convey a summary of the Crown’s confirmatory evidence. The defence counsel then withdrew his application. The victim had been a friend of the appellant. According to S.S.’s testimony, the appellant and the victim had pre-arranged a meeting in an abandoned farmyard. The victim worked as an automated teller machine (ATM) technician and as part of his job, he travelled between ATMs carrying cash. S.S. did not see what happened between the two men but heard two gunshots and then saw the appellant and the victim point guns at each other. She saw the victim on his knees pleading with the appellant and offering money in exchange for his life. The appellant instructed her to collect the money and the victim’s cellphone and place them in his truck and while she was doing so, she heard another gunshot and saw the victim lying face down and the appellant standing over him holding a gun. As she and the appellant left the scene, the appellant gave her the victim’s gun. The appellant hid the other guns and the money at another farm site and then dumped the victim’s cellphone and ammunition in a farm field. Apart from the handguns, none of the other items were ever recovered. The witness remained in a relationship with the appellant for another four years following the crime until November 2013. She was contacted by the police in February 2013 and denied any knowledge of the incident. At trial, S.S. testified that she was afraid of the appellant and he had warned her that as an accomplice, she was as involved as he was. When the RCMP contacted her again in May 2014, she again denied any knowledge but then told the officer what she knew because she felt safer and would receive protection from the appellant. S.S. did not have a criminal record, nor was she charged with any offence arising from this incident. The appellant testified that during the meeting in the farmyard, the victim produced two handguns and they began to test fire the weapons. The victim suggested that they stage a fake robbery. The appellant would rough up his friend and then take the cash from his truck. The victim became quite aggressive after the appellant hit him too hard and began chasing him with one of his guns. S.S. then took one of the guns and shot the victim three times. She took $23,000 in cash from his truck because she had financial problems. The testimony of W.D. was that the appellant had acquired two handguns, a Glock and a .22 calibre handgun, from him, ostensibly on behalf of another friend. Several days later, the appellant returned both handguns and reported that after his friend began to shoot at him with the .22 calibre, he had returned fired and shot him three times. On the appellant’s insistence, the witness changed the barrel of the Glock handgun several months later. The police arrested W.D. and charged him with unspecified offences arising from the incident. In the appellant’s version, he testified that the victim brought the guns to the meeting and assumed that he acquired them from W.D. He therefore returned them to W.D. after the incident and requested that he change the barrel on the Glock to protect W.D. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. The court found that the trial judge had not erred by not giving the Vetrovec warning. It was not mandatory for him to do so regardless of the position of the defence counsel. The judge was aware of the need for such a warning in the circumstances and after consulting with the Crown and the defence, he exercised his discretion to decide that he would not instruct the jury. The judge was aware that the defence counsel withdrew his application as a tactical decision to avoid having the judge repeat the Crown’s confirmatory evidence to the jury. The judge’s exercise of his discretion was entitled to deference.","The defendant was found guilty of the second degree murder of his common law spouse and friend following a trial before a judge and jury.

The applicant disputes liability for the amount set out in the wage assessment and claim that he inadvertently and innocently missed the time within which to file an appeal. The issues are whether this Court has jurisdiction to set aside the Director's certificate filed with the Court of Queen's Bench, if so what criteria ought to be applied in determining whether the Court should exercise its discretion and whether the applicant has satisfied the criteria. HELD: 1) Even though an appeal from a wage assessment to the appeals board and an appeal from an adjudicator to the Court of Queen's Bench both require 'appeals' within '21 days', an appeal to the Court of Queen's Bench is a true appeal while an 'appeal' to the appeals board is essentially a request for a de novo hearing. Consequently, this Court concludes that the consequences of missing the time limitation are not necessarily the same. 2) This Court does have jurisdiction to deal with an applicant's request, on a director appeal, because it is not a 'true appeal' that questions a decision made by an independent adjudicator after a hearing. Accordingly, the reasoning of this Court in Farmers of North America Inc. v. Langridge, 2004 SKQB 375, is not applicable. A finding that this Court is without jurisdiction to set aside a judgment, obtained without any independent adjudicative process, regardless of the basis upon which that judgment was obtained, is inequitable and at odds with existing practices and procedures. Section 62.4(4) of The Labour Standards Act states that a certificate filed pursuant to s. 62.4(3) has the same force and effect as if it were a judgment obtained in the Court of Queen's Bench for the recovery of a debt. This Court certainly would have jurisdiction to determine whether or not the applicant's application to open up a noting for default should be granted pursuant to Rule 114(3), Rule 271 and Rule 346. It follows that this Court is able to look behind the filing and examine the circumstances under which that judgment was entered. The Court of Queen's Bench is a superior Court charged with the administration of justice and enjoys inherent as well as statutory jurisdiction. This inherent jurisdiction cannot be removed by either level of government without constitutional amendment. 3) It is fair and equitable to apply, by analogy, the principles and resulting rules formulated relating to opening up a default judgment to the applicant's request to set aside the judgment registered in circumstances where he has failed to file an appeal disputing a wage assessment to the registrar of appeals.  4) The evidence is that the applicant is a businessman running a commercial enterprise in Foam Lake. It is expected that somebody in his position would have the savvy to read, review and understand the document, or at least seek assistance from someone who could help him. The applicant either failed or declined to read, or chose to ignore, the plain language of the documents served on him by registered mail. This amounts to wilful blindness at the very least. Numerous cases hold that wilful blindness is not sufficient reason to set aside a noting for default.

ISSUES [2] The issues raised in this application are:

(1) Does this Court have jurisdiction to set aside the Director’s certificate filed with the Court of Queen’s Bench?

(2) If so, what criteria ought to be applied in determining whether the Court should exercise its discretion in favour of setting aside the wage assessment certificate?

(3) Has the applicant satisfied the criteria? [34] Accordingly, even though an appeal from a wage assessment to the appeals board and an appeal from an adjudicator to the Court of Queen’s Bench both require “appeals” within “21 days” an appeal to the Court of Queen’s Bench is a true appeal while an “appeal” to the appeals board is essentially a request for a de novo hearing. Consequently, I conclude that the consequences of missing the time limitation are not necessarily the same. [37] I conclude that this Court does have jurisdiction to deal with an applicant’s request, on a director appeal, because it is not a “true appeal” that questions a decision made by an independent adjudicator after a hearing. A finding that this Court is without jurisdiction to set aside a judgment, obtained without any independent adjudicative process, regardless of the basis upon which that judgment was obtained, is inequitable and at odds with existing practices and procedures. If the employee had sued the employer for the wages, which it would be her right to do, and if a statement of claim had been served, but not defended, and the matter was noted for default, this Court certainly would have jurisdiction to determine whether or not the defendant/employer’s application to open up of a noting for default should be granted. The Queen’s Bench Rules provide for the opening up of a noting for default. It logically follows, therefore, that where a judgment is filed in this Court that this Court would be able to look behind the filing and examine the circumstances under which that judgment was entered. [44] Accordingly, I find that it is fair and equitable to apply, by analogy, the principles and resulting rules formulated relating to opening up a default judgment to the applicant’s request to set aside the judgment registered in circumstances where he has failed to file an appeal disputing a wage assessment to the registrar of appeals.

8_2012skqb249.txt,"The accused was convicted of aggravated assault after stabbing another person several times in the mid-section. The Crown brought a dangerous offender application. The accused was 22 years old at the time of sentencing. His prior criminal record consisted of mostly youth convictions. The offender was a known member of an aboriginal gang. The evidence suggested he was somewhere in the middle of the gang hierarchy. The accused had professed some desire to leave the gang. He had written an article directed at other youth warning them of the pitfalls of gang affiliation. The article was published in a book distributed to at risk youth. The accused had looked into getting help to leave the gang, but admitted on the stand that he was not prepared to take steps to leave because he might need protection from the gang in the penitentiary. While incarcerated, he had gang drawings confiscated from him and he had been jumped by members of a rival gang while in custody. The accused had shown some initiative in taking anger management courses and had completed his GED while incarcerated. HELD: The offence was a serious personal injury offence within the meaning of s. 752 of the Criminal Code. The criminal record together with the evidence heard at the hearing establishes that when the accused has committed violent offences he has been under the influence of alcohol or drugs, under supervision by court orders in the community, has used a knife or had one in his possession and most of the offences were a result of the accused's affiliation with the Indian Posse gang. The Crown has established a pattern of repetitive behaviour within the meaning of s. 753(1)(a)(i). Dr. Holden assessed the accused and found him to be a high risk to re-offend violently. The Crown has also proven that the accused constitutes a threat to the life, safety, and physical or mental well-being of other persons as set out in s. 753(1)(a)(ii). The accused was declared a dangerous offender. However, the Court found that given the accused's youth, the fact that he had not had any of the intensive programming that is available in a federal institution and the fact that there was some chance the accused might leave the gang, a determinate sentence and long term supervision order would adequately protect the public. In imposing a determinate sentence, the Court also considered that the accused's acts of violence, with the exception of the predicate offence, had generally resulted in less than severe injuries to the victim and the accused had voluntarily taken some steps to address his issues while incarcerated. The accused was sentenced 6 years or 72 months in custody, less credit for remand, to be followed by a 9 year supervision order under s. 753.4(b).",The accused was found guilty of aggravated assault contrary to s. 268 of the Criminal Code and breach of an undertaking contrary to S. 145(3) of the Code.

The predicate offence was a serious personal injury offence within the meaning of s. 752 of the criminal Code.,"[1] On November 9, 2010 after trial, I found the accused, Michael Gamble, guilty of aggravated assault contrary to s. 268 of the Criminal Code and breach of an undertaking contrary to s. 145(3) of the Criminal Code.

[18] Given the conviction and the Criminal Code provisions for imprisonment, I am satisfied that the predicate offence is a serious personal injury offence within the meaning of s. 752 of the Criminal Code. Sentenced to six months secure custody and three months supervision in the community followed by one year probation. Sentence twelve months custody followed by six months supervision in the community. Sentence concurrent sentence of twenty-one months custody and supervision, twelve months secure custody followed by two months of open custody followed by seven month supervision in the community.

2) He committed the violent offences while under supervision under court orders in the community;

4) Most of the violent offences were as a result with his affiliation with the Indian Posse. [60] On a review of the circumstances of each of the six violent offences, including a review of the trial decisions, I am satisfied that the Crown has proven a pattern of repetitive behavior within the meaning of s. 753(1)(a)(i). I therefore find that the Crown has proven beyond a reasonable doubt that Mr. Gamble constitutes a threat to the life, safety, physical or mental well-being of other persons as set out in s. 753.(1)(a)(i) and I find him a dangerous offender. The evidence is that Mr. Gamble has not had any intensive programming that is available at a federal institution. Also of significance is his youthful age and Foss indicated that young individuals on their first admission to a penitentiary are more likely to leave a gang. [67] I am satisfied, when one considers all the factors, that there is a reasonable expectation that a determinate sentence followed by a lengthy period of supervision will adequately protect the public. [79] I am satisfied given the accused’s record as an adult and as a young offender plus the circumstances of the unprovoked attack by Gamble on the victim in this instance that an appropriate sentence is six years or seventy-two months. He is entitled to a one for one credit for remand time for a credit of twenty-six months. I therefore sentence the accused as follows:

[67] I am satisfied, when one considers all the factors, that there is a reasonable expectation that a determinate sentence followed by a lengthy period of supervision will adequately protect the public. [79] I am satisfied given the accused’s record as an adult and as a young offender plus the circumstances of the unprovoked attack by Gamble on the victim in this instance that an appropriate sentence is six years or seventy-two months. He is entitled to a one for one credit for remand time for a credit of twenty-six months. I therefore sentence the accused as follows:
a) To forty-six months in a federal penitentiary;
b) To an order under s. 753.(4)(b) of the Criminal Code that Mr. Gamble be supervised in the community for a period of nine years from the date of his release;",0.3593314763231198,0.3450381679389313,"The accused was convicted of aggravated assault after stabbing another person several times in the mid-section. The Crown brought a dangerous offender application. The accused was 22 years old at the time of sentencing. His prior criminal record consisted of mostly youth convictions. The offender was a known member of an aboriginal gang. The evidence suggested he was somewhere in the middle of the gang hierarchy. The accused had professed some desire to leave the gang. He had written an article directed at other youth warning them of the pitfalls of gang affiliation. The article was published in a book distributed to at risk youth. The accused had looked into getting help to leave the gang, but admitted on the stand that he was not prepared to take steps to leave because he might need protection from the gang in the penitentiary. While incarcerated, he had gang drawings confiscated from him and he had been jumped by members of a rival gang while in custody. The accused had shown some initiative in taking anger management courses and had completed his GED while incarcerated. HELD: The offence was a serious personal injury offence within the meaning of s. 752 of the Criminal Code. The criminal record together with the evidence heard at the hearing establishes that when the accused has committed violent offences he has been under the influence of alcohol or drugs, under supervision by court orders in the community, has used a knife or had one in his possession and most of the offences were a result of the accused's affiliation with the Indian Posse gang. The Crown has established a pattern of repetitive behaviour within the meaning of s. 753(1)(a)(i). Dr. Holden assessed the accused and found him to be a high risk to re-offend violently. The Crown has also proven that the accused constitutes a threat to the life, safety, and physical or mental well-being of other persons as set out in s. 753(1)(a)(ii). The accused was declared a dangerous offender. However, the Court found that given the accused's youth, the fact that he had not had any of the intensive programming that is available in a federal institution and the fact that there was some chance the accused might leave the gang, a determinate sentence and long term supervision order would adequately protect the public. In imposing a determinate sentence, the Court also considered that the accused's acts of violence, with the exception of the predicate offence, had generally resulted in less than severe injuries to the victim and the accused had voluntarily taken some steps to address his issues while incarcerated. The accused was sentenced 6 years or 72 months in custody, less credit for remand, to be followed by a 9 year supervision order under s. 753.4(b).","The accused was found guilty of aggravated assault and breach of an undertaking contrary to s. 268 of the Criminal Code. The Crown applied to have the accused declared a dangerous offender. HELD: The predicate offence was a serious personal injury offence within the meaning of s. 752(a)(i). The Court found that the accused had less active role and he did not smash windows or inflict any blows. He had acted in threatening manner and held in his possession bear spray. The accused was sentenced to 12 months secure custody followed by 2 months open custody and 7 month supervision in the community. 1) Given the conviction and Criminal Code provisions for imprisonment, the sentence was a sentence of imprisonment for term not exceeding fourteen years. 2) Sentence concurrent with a concurrent sentence of twenty-one months custody and supervision.  3) Penalties for an indeterminate period of time.","[1] On November 9, 2010 after trial, I found the accused, Michael Gamble, guilty of aggravated assault contrary to s. 268 of the Criminal Code and breach of an undertaking contrary to s. 145(3) of the Criminal Code. The Crown then applied to have Mr. Gamble declared a dangerous offender. [17] In my judgment of November 9, 2010 reported as R. v. Gamble, 2010 SKQB 414 (CanLII), 363 Sask. R. 311 (Q.B.), I found that Mr. Gamble stabbed the victim, Wesley Delaronde, several times on the right side of his mid-section with a knife. [18] Given the conviction and the Criminal Code provisions for imprisonment, I am satisfied that the predicate offence is a serious personal injury offence within the meaning of s. 752 of the Criminal Code. Sentenced to six months secure custody and three months supervision in the community followed by one year probation. Sentence twelve months custody followed by six months supervision in the community. Sentence concurrent sentence of twenty-one months custody and supervision, twelve months secure custody followed by two months of open custody followed by seven month supervision in the community. [59] The similarities of the violent offences are as follows:
1) He had been under the influence of alcohol or drugs at the time;


2) He committed the violent offences while under supervision under court orders in the community;
3) While carrying out the violent offences, he used or had in his possession a knife;
4) Most of the violent offences were as a result with his affiliation with the Indian Posse. [60] On a review of the circumstances of each of the six violent offences, including a review of the trial decisions, I am satisfied that the Crown has proven a pattern of repetitive behavior within the meaning of s. 753(1)(a)(i). I therefore find that the Crown has proven beyond a reasonable doubt that Mr. Gamble constitutes a threat to the life, safety, physical or mental well-being of other persons as set out in s. 753.(1)(a)(i) and I find him a dangerous offender. The evidence is that Mr. Gamble has not had any intensive programming that is available at a federal institution. Also of significance is his youthful age and Foss indicated that young individuals on their first admission to a penitentiary are more likely to leave a gang. [67] I am satisfied, when one considers all the factors, that there is a reasonable expectation that a determinate sentence followed by a lengthy period of supervision will adequately protect the public.

The petitioner did not appear at the pre trial or the proceeding. The court reviewed the evidence and found that the respondent had not shown any signs of mental or emotional distress. The evidence was that the child had been in the presence of his parents for several days and that he had been exposed to a lot of drugs and alcohol. The Court found that there was no evidence that the appellant had been involved in any violence. The child was placed in the care of the Department for three months. The Department of Child andFamily Services sought an order placing the appellant with the respondent until age 16 pursuant to s. 37(2) of the Act.

The children were placed with the appellant until age 17 pursuant to the Child and Child Services Act. HELD: The Court held that the application was not supported by the evidence. The application was dismissed. The matter was set to be reviewed and the trial date was fixed. The mother was to give 60 days notice of her appointment. The father was to provide counsel to the court. The judge ordered that the children remain in their care until the time of their 18th birthday. The order was made to ensure that the court would consider all the factors that the applicant had to say in the application and that it would be appropriate to include in the order the respondent was to be supervised. The Children were placed in their custody until the expiry of period of 1 year. The trial judge ordered the return the respondent to her care. The issue was whether the Court should consider the appellant's best interests in the best circumstances. The issues were whether the respondent should be placed in a foster home or in a Departmental foster home. The imputed costs of the court's application were $1,000.

Over a period of approximately 10 years, the Government withheld payment in relation to what eventually amounted to some 12,000 of the appellant's accounts. The Government indicated through the use of a billing code, that the accounts would not be paid until further information was provided. The appellant believed the use of the billing code was unlawful and chose not to provide additional information. He started an action in the Court of Queen's Bench to compel payment of his accounts. His claim was largely dismissed on the basis that the action was premature. The appellant appeals from the Queen's Bench ruling and the Government cross-appeal in relation to the limited aspect of the case in which Dr. Huerto enjoyed success. HELD: Appeal and Cross-appeal dismissed.  1) Section 17(1)(c) of The Saskatchewan Medical Care Insurance Act is to the effect that the intention and purpose of the Act is not to establish a medical care insurance plan under which 'the exercise of professional judgment by physicians is in any way diminished'. This broad statement of principle should not be read so aggressively as to mean the Government, as the payor in a publicly funded health care system, has no right to ask questions about the accounts presented for payment by physicians. The Government has not denied payment of the appellant's accounts. Nor has it received the requested information from the appellant. The actions (the Protocol) taken by the Government cannot be characterized as an amendment of the Payment Schedule. The Protocol is an administrative tool which sets out the situations in which the appellant will be asked for further information about the provision of specific services. This is fully in line with the terms of the Schedule. 2) Section 5(1) of the Regulations should not be read as meaning the Government is entitled to ask for additional information about a service if, and only if, the nature of the service is 'unusual'. Rather, it simply stipulates that additional remarks must be included in an account rendered with respect to an unusual service. This does not imply the government can request extra information only in relation to an unusual service. A physician's obligation to include certain material in an account and the Government's authority to ask for additional information are ultimately two quite different things. 3) The Court does not accept that the appellant's claims were barred by s. 16(1) of the Act. It would be perverse to read the Act as requiring that, in order for an account to be paid, every bit of information demanded by the Government through the use of a billing code, or otherwise, must be supplied before the expiration of the 6 month period established by the Regulations. An account submitted the day before the expiration of the 6 month deadline would be voided by the application of the billing code. An account submitted well in advance of the expiration of the 6 month period would also be effectively denied if a request for further information was not made until at or near the end of the six month time limit, with the result that there was insufficient time for a physician to respond before that limit was exceeded. These potential problems are especially troublesome because there is an element of subjectivity in the application of the Protocol and even the most diligent physician might not accurately anticipate when an account or accounts will attract a request for extra comment. 4) The Court cannot accept the Government's submission that the trial judge should have declined to deal with the appellant's claim because the appellant had not fully pursued possible appeals to the Medical assessment Board. The Legislature in s. 40(3) of the Act has expressly provided that the appeal procedure established pursuant to the Act does not prejudice a physician's right to pursue matters in the courts. It stands entirely at odds with the notion that the appeal procedures in the Act should be read as being comprehensive and exhaustive.","HELD: Appeal dismissed. The cross-appeal was dismissed. Both the appeal and the appeal must be dismissed. 1) The principles of the Protocol and the Government's use of the AU code are not inconsistent with the standard procedure. The Protocol is not inconsistent. 2) The Protocol provides for the payment of physician services by way of a particular billing code. The principles are not consistent with the Standard Procedure. 3) The standard procedure is not the same as the one used in the trial. The standard tests are standard tests and not unusual. 4) The AU code is not applicable to the accounts submitted by a physician. The only exception is the ECG and Holter monitor procedures which are at the root of this appeal are standard test. The ECG is not an amendment of the Payment Schedule by way that the Protocol does not apply. 5) The protocols are not the central feature of the payment regime. The real world effect of applying the AU Code to some 12,000 accounts was to refuse compensation. The trial judge began his decision by rejecting the Government’s argument that the payment schedule was designed to facilitate the payment and, in appropriate situations, to deny payment. The appeal and cross-examination were necessary to properly assess its merit. The court found that both the appeal/cross-appaleal and the application of the appeal were not inconsistent and the principles of a standard procedure were not in any way inconsistent with s. 17(1)(c) of the MCIA. The protocols were designed to provide an individualized administrative process. The provisions set out in the Protocol were not consistent. The protocol was designed in an individual way to facilitate payment of the physician’ s. 3(d) and 6(1) of The Saskatchewan Medical Care Insurance Payment Regulations. The Court found that the standard tests, standard tests which are not 'unusual' in and of themselves, caused that result. The aspects of the protocol relating to the AU codes operationalize that right in the circumstances of the patient’S unusual practice. The Act provides for a wide range of services. The physician”s ability to pay for these services is limited by the nature of the service provided. The medical doctor’d be entitled to receive compensation for services provided by him. The payment schedule is designed to be an individualization process. However, the principles in the protocol are not fundamentally different.

Over a period of approximately 10 years, the Government withheld payment in relation to what eventually amounted to some 12,000 of the appellant's accounts. The Government indicated through the use of a billing code, that the accounts would not be paid until further information was provided. The appellant believed the use of the billing code was unlawful and chose not to provide additional information. He started an action in the Court of Queen's Bench to compel payment of his accounts. His claim was largely dismissed on the basis that the action was premature. The appellant appeals from the Queen's Bench ruling and the Government cross-appeal in relation to the limited aspect of the case in which Dr. Huerto enjoyed success. HELD: Appeal and Cross-appeal dismissed.  1) Section 17(1)(c) of The Saskatchewan Medical Care Insurance Act is to the effect that the intention and purpose of the Act is not to establish a medical care insurance plan under which 'the exercise of professional judgment by physicians is in any way diminished'. This broad statement of principle should not be read so aggressively as to mean the Government, as the payor in a publicly funded health care system, has no right to ask questions about the accounts presented for payment by physicians. The Government has not denied payment of the appellant's accounts. Nor has it received the requested information from the appellant. The actions (the Protocol) taken by the Government cannot be characterized as an amendment of the Payment Schedule. The Protocol is an administrative tool which sets out the situations in which the appellant will be asked for further information about the provision of specific services. This is fully in line with the terms of the Schedule. 2) Section 5(1) of the Regulations should not be read as meaning the Government is entitled to ask for additional information about a service if, and only if, the nature of the service is 'unusual'. Rather, it simply stipulates that additional remarks must be included in an account rendered with respect to an unusual service. This does not imply the government can request extra information only in relation to an unusual service. A physician's obligation to include certain material in an account and the Government's authority to ask for additional information are ultimately two quite different things. 3) The Court does not accept that the appellant's claims were barred by s. 16(1) of the Act. It would be perverse to read the Act as requiring that, in order for an account to be paid, every bit of information demanded by the Government through the use of a billing code, or otherwise, must be supplied before the expiration of the 6 month period established by the Regulations. An account submitted the day before the expiration of the 6 month deadline would be voided by the application of the billing code. An account submitted well in advance of the expiration of the 6 month period would also be effectively denied if a request for further information was not made until at or near the end of the six month time limit, with the result that there was insufficient time for a physician to respond before that limit was exceeded. These potential problems are especially troublesome because there is an element of subjectivity in the application of the Protocol and even the most diligent physician might not accurately anticipate when an account or accounts will attract a request for extra comment. 4) The Court cannot accept the Government's submission that the trial judge should have declined to deal with the appellant's claim because the appellant had not fully pursued possible appeals to the Medical assessment Board. The Legislature in s. 40(3) of the Act has expressly provided that the appeal procedure established pursuant to the Act does not prejudice a physician's right to pursue matters in the courts.

9_2012skpc49.txt,"The accused plead guilty to two counts of sexual assault. The victims were his granddaughters. The assaults were alleged to have occurred between 1983 and 1991. A sentencing hearing was held because there was significant disagreement on the facts. The Crown alleged three aggravating factors: 1) that the sexual assaults were numerous, 2) that the accused touched the victims directly on their skin and not just on their clothing and 3) that there was digital penetration by the accused on both victims. HELD: At a sentencing hearing, the Crown must prove aggravating factors beyond a reasonable doubt. The Court held that the two victims were sexually assaulted by the accused on numerous occasions over a period of a number of years. The Court was satisfied these sexual assaults were a common occurrence on every occasion that the accused was in the company of his granddaughters. The Court found that the accused touched the victims under their clothing on numerous occasions and that there were a couple of occasions that the accused digitally penetrated each victim. Finally, the Court concluded that the accused got bolder over time and took more liberties and chances with his victims.","The accused was charged with committing sexual assaults on two young girls. The Crown alleged that the accused touched the victims' skin and touched their genitals, and that there was digital penetration. The accused admitted to touching the victims under their clothes. The evidence of the victims was sufficiently credible to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that digital penetration occurred. The Court concluded that the sexual assaults were frequent occurrences and that the offences were repeated.

[17] From all of the evidence, I am satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that both victims were sexually assaulted by Mr. Therrien on numerous occasions. I am satisfied that these sexual assaults were a common occurrence on every occasion Mr. Therrien was in the company of the girls.

The union had alleged the employer violated the collective agreement by the way positions for the rank of lieutenant were filled in the fire department two years prior. As a result of the arbitration award, several lieutenants were demoted to the rank of firefighter. Denying the stay, that (1) there was no arguable issue to be tried on appeal; (2) there was no evidence the applicants would suffer irreparable harm if the stay were not granted; (3) the balance of convenience weighed against the applicants; and (4) there were no exceptional circumstances.","The union applied to have the arbitrator's award set aside. The union argued that the arbitrators had not acted in good faith and that the grievance was not in the category of irreparable harm. The employer had not provided sufficient detail to the union as to the extent that it had conducted promotional routines for the positions of lieutenants. The Union alleged that the employer had violated Article 23.01 of the collective agreement by the manner in which the employer conducted promotional routine for the position of lieutenant. The grievance was brought forward through arbitration pursuant to collective agreement between the parties. The unions alleged that this was an attempt to use inexperienced personnel. The arbitrator awarded the contract to the lieutenant who had elected to return to the rank of fire fighter and continue as such. The lieutenancy award was set aside and the union appealed. The appeal court held that the union's position was that only the suitability aspect of the testing procedure was being challenged. The court held the following: 1) the arbitration award was not set aside; 2) the union was awarded the award for 'gross loss of revenue' and the arbiter's award was for 'loss of profits'. The union's argument that the award was unreasonable and unjustified was dismissed. The Court held that as difficult as it is for these individuals who have done nothing wrong, that it is not in any category of 'parable harm'. The movement that might have been brought about if those who were demoted could not act as acting lieutenans and were required to return from the platoons in which they were, prior to being promoted, has not materialized and is not likely to materialize in any real measure until after this matter has been heard. The balance of convenience was not at issue.","It seems to me that as difficult as it is for these individuals who have done nothing wrong, that it is not in the category of irreparable harm, and so I then turn to the balance of convenience.

The accused had been charged at trial with the first, unlawful assault against a peace officer, with intent to prevent the peace officer from lawfully arresting the complainant, and the third, unlawful resisting the same peace officer who was engaged in the lawful execution of his duty, contrary to s. 270(1)(b). The trial was over, the rulings had been made after lengthy argument and supplementary reasons delivered only by reason of appeal. The appellant refers to both the reasons given orally at the conclusion of the case, as well as the document entitled 'Supplementary Reasons' filed after the notice of appeal; the quote in Quicklaw is different. It contains a thorough review of the facts and finding based upon credibility in favour of the accused. The Crown submitted in argument that the apparent preconception of the Learned Trial Judge against the police generally, created the appearance of unfairness and with such preconceptions, Constable Stienburg could not hope for fair hearing. The respondent submits the Constable was not on trial, that the Learned trial Judge's comments dealt with the police in general and not the specific actions of Constable Stiensburg, and that the respondent hoped for and received a fair trial.

The Court found that a sentence in a provincial correctional centre would seriously affect the accused's ability to rehabilitate. Taking all of the factors of sentencing into account, it was the sentence of the Court that it was sentenced to serve a term of 18 months in a Provincial correctional centre. Taking the factors into account it was a sentence that was served in a province correctional centre, as the accused was a model citizen until the offence and had voluntarily quit using alcohol. The sentence must be increased or decreased from the three year term based on the circumstances of the individual case. The court found that the sentence must not be in the range of three years. The victim was harassed and had her property damaged and was forced to go for counselling. The offence had grave consequences for the victim because some people appeared to treat her as the offender rather than the victim. The defence claimed the Crown failed to prove this assertion. The evidence showed the victim had lost her job, lost her position in the community and was ostracized in the town. The damage and vandalism had no connection to the offence.

b_1999canlii12533.txt,"The primary issue was the appropriate parenting arrangement for the two children. The 1997 interim order awarded joint custody with the primary residence with the mother and reasonable access to the father including alternating weekends, reasonable telephone access and equal sharing of holidays. The father initially failed to pay child support as ordered then paid $250 per month rather than the $424.72 ordered. The parties no longer communicated directly with each other except by e-mail so that there was a record. HELD: 1)It was in the best interests of the children that their primary residence be with their mother. She had demonstrated greater flexibility and sensitivity to their needs. The father was granted access two weekends out of every three and additional time as they may agree upon. Although both were very good parents the parties had not demonstrated an ability to co-parent effectively as illustrated by their communication problems. The father's access initially went beyond the minimum required by the interim order. He failed to make support payments as ordered. The father was to pay child support of $449. Pursuant to s.7 of the Federal Child Support Guidelines he was to pay 54% of the net cost of child care expenses incurred as a result of the mother's employment and for health related expenses in excess of $100 of the insurance reimbursement upon production of receipts.  2)The automobile constituted matrimonial property and was valued at $200. 3)Either could speak to costs.","The primary issue was the appropriate parenting arrangement for the two children.

During their separation the respondent's access went beyond the minimum required by the interim order. The child was placed in the primary residence of the petitioner.

Twenty-two months passed between the laying of the charge and the trial date. Cote was not responsible for the delay and actively pursued a speedy trial. The delay was caused by the Crown's failure to provide timely disclosure. HELD: The charge was stayed. In applying the decision of the SCC in R. v. Morin, the court found that 22 months is an unreasonable and exceptional period of delay and is of sufficient length to warrant an inquiry.

The Court was not satisfied that the inherent time requirements of the case require 22-month delay from charge to trial. 8) The fact that the defence failed to provide sufficient disclosure was not a sufficient reason to grant an application for a stay. 9) The trial judge was not able to determine whether the accused was prejudiced by the delay. The court was not convinced that the evidence was so compelling that it would be unreasonable to grant a stay of proceedings. The accused was not entitled to compensation for the delay and the Court was unable to determine if the Crown was negligent in making timely disclosure or not.

b_2000skqb572.txt,"The accused was charged with sexual assault under s.271 of the Criminal Code. Although the DNA evidence established he had sexual intercourse with the complainant, neither had any memory of it due to their self-induced states of intoxication. Defences raised were consent, an honest but mistaken belief that she gave her consent, and extreme drunkenness such that he was so intoxicated that he was not in a conscious state and was incapable of forming any intent to have sexual intercourse without consent. HELD: The accused was found guilty.  1)Although the defence of 'extreme intoxication' is successful in the rarest of cases, the accused established the Daviault 'extreme intoxication' on a balance of probabilities. He would have been acquitted had it not been for s.33.1 which does away with this defence in sexual assault cases.  2)The court was satisfied on a balance of probabilities that his extreme level of self-induced intoxication rendered him incapable of making a conscious decision to have sexual intercourse with the complainant with or without her consent. The court was satisfied that the complainant had not done anything to suggest that she would consent. The accused was incapable of considering the issue of consent and accordingly did not have a mistaken belief or reasonable grounds for such a belief. It was clear from the testimony of an 11 year old that the intercourse took place long after the complainant passed out. She was incapable of giving consent after that time. Her assertion of lack of consent was inherently unreliable due to her lack of any memory of events that occurred before, during and after the alleged assault and would have been more in the nature of an assumption than a fact, but was found to be consistent with all the other evidence. It was not relevant that she may have withdrawn consent. 3)There was no evidence to give his second defence (that he honestly believed he had her consent) an air of reality. His assertion that she must have consented or he would not have done it was speculative assumption, not evidence. 4)Section 33.1 provides that the act of becoming voluntarily intoxicated to the extent of being incapable of controlling one's behaviour constitutes criminal culpability sufficient to found criminal liability for offences committed against the bodily integrity of others. The public outcry and Parliamentary response to Daviault strongly indicate that s.33.1 is not only consistent with the objectives of the Charter but is justifiable and essential in a free and democratic society. Of four recent cases that held Criminal Code s.33.1 violates the Charter, two held it was saved by s.1 while two held it was not saved by s.1 of the Charter. 5)Section 33.1(1) provides the lack of general intent or voluntariness is not a defence to an assault charge described in ss.(3)if it resulted from self-induced intoxication or the accused departed markedly from the standard of reasonable care generally recognized in Canadian society. The three sub-conditions described in ss.(2) concerning marked departure constitute criminal culpability similar to recklessness. Criminal culpability is not dependent on wilful intention to cause harm but on the wilful intention to engage in conduct that incurs the risk of harm without caring whether or not harm ensues. 6)The strong dissent in Daviault indicated those who render themselves incapable of knowing what they are doing through voluntary consumption of alcohol or drugs possess a sufficiently blameworthy state of mind that their imprisonment does not offend the principle of fundamental justice which prohibits the imprisonment of the innocent.

The DNA evidence established that the accused had sexual intercourse with the complainant. However, neither the accused nor the complainant had any memory of the sexual intercourse. The Court held that the evidence of the complainant was unreliable and that the trial judge failed to charge the jury with the defence of honest but mistaken belief in consent. The accused was acquitted on a balance of probabilities. The court reviewed the various cases and found that the defence was not saved by s. 1 of the Code. HELD: The accused's conviction was upheld on a trial on the basis that the Court had broad discretion to differentiate in sentences imposed for offences that were deliberately committed and those that were committed involuntarily because of self-induced intoxication. The defence of extreme drunkenness was successful in almost every case of intoxication that arose from drinking alcohol as beverage or abusing drugs. The only defence raised by the accused was that he honestly believed he had the consent of the person to have sexual intercourse; the Court held the accused's belief arose from self- induced intoxication and was not a reasonable inference. The evidence of his 11-year old son was inconsistent with the accused’s evidence. The conclusion that the self-inflicted intoxication of the accused and the complainant is caused by the automatic state arises from self induced intoxication is not a defence to an assault type of charge. The fact that the complainant’ s. 33.1 defence is not saved because it is not supported by the evidence.","[1] The accused is charged with sexual assault pursuant to s. 271 of the Criminal Code.

Now, the journalists wish to view that evidence. The applicant applies for an order for mandamus, or a declaration.

The Attorney General does not oppose the application. 3) There is a presumption in favour of public access but that access must be supervised by the Court to ensure the integrity of the exhibit is preserved and that no abuse or harm occurs to innocent parties. 4) The court must be concerned that no harm befalls innocent parties but the defendant will invariably hold conversations made by innocent persons. 5) This right is tempered somewhat by other factors. As stated in RJR v. S.J.S., the right of access to judicial records has never been considered absolute. The governing principle is that there is an inherent presumption in favor of the public access and the presumption is in favour, and the burden to the contrary proof lies upon the person who would deny the exercise of the right. 6) The Supreme Court of Nova Scotia has jurisdiction to determine the issue of access.","[1] Saskatoon’s daily newspaper applies for access to a CD-ROM entered in evidence at a sentencing hearing in the matter of R. v.

The defendant applied for an order requiring the plaintiff to provide security for costs in the amount of $50,000. The plaintiff contracted to build a pipeline for Interprovincial Pipelines Inc. in 1998. In carrying out that contract the plaintiff engaged the defendant as a sub-contractor to construct a directionally drilled crossing under the South Saskatchewan River. The defendants embarked upon the project but after time ceased the work. The plaintiffs counterclaim alleged negligence by the defendant. The respondent argued that the plaintiff failed to rectify certain sub-soil conditions which were frustrating the work and eventually directed the defendant to vacate the site. The judge granted the application for security for the costs in a lesser amount of money. The court found that the respondent had a duty to post security for cost in the event of a counterclaim. The counterclaim was dismissed and the court ordered security for $18,000 to be posted. The Court found that there was no absolute prohibition on the granting of security for a cost. The issue was whether the respondent was liable for any award of costs. The question was whether it was. The answer was that the question was: 'Is there a duty of protection?' The court concluded that the answer was yes. The evidence was that there had been a breach of trust and the respondent should be held liable for the award of any award. The fact that the counterclaim had already been filed in Alberta did not preclude the granting an order for security. The only issue that the court could not decide was whether to issue a security for an costs order. The order was made in the absence of any evidence that the claim was not wholly distinct from the claim. The applicant was entitled to security for any costs.","[1] This is an application wherein the defendant, The Crossing Company Inc., seeks an order requiring the plaintiff, Banister Pipelines Inc., to provide security for costs in the amount of $50,000.00.

A new trial is ordered.  1) There is no fixed rule or formula that an officer must follow when determining whether or not to wait 15 minutes prior to administering a road side test. In this case, the trial judge appears to have concluded that the officer who administered the ASD would not have relied on the results, or should not have so relied, if her partner had informed her of the empty beer can with fresh suds in it that he found at the scene. Implicit in this finding is the conclusion that the existence of the beer can would make a difference to the officer's assessment of whether she should wait 15 minutes for any mouth alcohol to dissipate before she could rely on ASD test results. 2) The trial judge made the same error that was dealt with by the Ontario Court of Appeal in R. v. Einarson. 3) The accused told the officer that he had been drinking in the car 'earlier'. Even if the officer had been told of her partner's discovery of an empty beer can at the scene, it would not constitute 'credible evidence' that the accused consumed alcohol within that 15 minute time frame. Whether or not the accused had consumed beer within 15 minutes of taking the test on the ASD is pure speculation.","The appellant was found not guilty of having care or control of a motor vehicle while his blood alcohol content was over.08. The trial judge found that contrary to s. 8 of the Charter, contrary to the trial judge's finding that the officer did not have reasonable and probable grounds to make the breathalyzer demand, the officer was not obliged to wait 15 minutes on the grounds that the driver had just left a bar. The appellant appealed. HELD: The appeal was allowed and the acquittal set aside. The court found that the trial court erred in determining that in the totality of the circumstances it was not objectively reasonable for the officer to have relied on the accuracy of the ASD test. The officer who administered the ASD would not have relied upon the results, or should not have so relied, if her partner had informed her of the empty beer can at the scene. The Court found that under s. 24(2) of the charter the certificate of analysis should be excluded from evidence. The appeal court found the trial officer was entitled to rely on the results of the screening device test in deciding whether he had reasonable and possible grounds to arrest the appellant when he knew there was a possibility that the respondent had consumed alcohol within the 15 minutes prior to the administration of the test and that if she had, the result of the Test could be inaccurate. The respondent appealed. Appeal allowed. The issue of whether the officer should rely on a breathalyze demand was raised. The evidence was not found to be that the appellant had not shown any reasonable and reasonable grounds to rely upon the accuracy. The certificate of Analysis was not tendered as evidence at trial. The Crown appealed. The Appeal Court found the appellant was entitled, but not required, to rely solely on the ASD results. The error was not made in the manner the trial Judge concluded. The test was administered within 15 minutes of the appellant's vehicle leaving the bar.","[1] On August 9, 2006 Mr. Lundrigan was found not guilty of having care or control of a motor vehicle while his blood alcohol content was over .08.

The chambers judge held that the separation agreement did not revoke the will nor did it affect the appellant's entitlement to the gift. The respondent's mother appealed. The court found that in the circumstances, the appellant had not produced any legal evidence that a verbal promise to not renounce or refuse a testamentarian gift after the death of her former spouse had resulted in the appellant renouncing any claim against the estate of her late husband and any right to share in the estate with the respondent. The appellant failed in this respect to the extent to which a contractual pledge to renounced a testamentative gift after death had been made by the appellant. The Court found that there was no evidence that the respondent had contractually bound herself to renouncing the gift after her death. The evidence did not support the appellant’s position that the gift to the respondent was a contractual obligation and therefore not binding.","Summary: A couple signed a separation agreement which included a provision whereby they agreed to renounce and waive any claim in the estate of the other and any right to share in the estate of the other.

Initially unable to locate the residence, they spoke to the girlfriend on the phone, who advised them that she was fine and did not require the police.

The daughter opened the door and told them everything was fine, there had been no assault and she had simply wanted a ride home. From where they entered, the officers could see a person lying down in the bedroom. They approached the man, searched him for officer safety and then conducted a warrantless search to locate any other occupants. During the search, certain items were noted that caused them to obtain a search warrant, following which drugs were found. The defendant's argument that the search was illegal was unsuccessful as the court found that, in these particular circumstances, the police had a responsibility to enter the home without a warrant, do a pat down search of the accused and search for other occupants. Once drugs were seen in plain view, they proceeded to obtain a search warrant.

Initially unable to locate the residence, they spoke to the girlfriend on the phone, who advised them that she was fine and did not require the police. They nevertheless continued to the residence, where they heard a scream from inside. Knowing that the defendant was a suspected drug dealer and potentially violent, they demanded entry into the home. The daughter opened the door and told them everything was fine, there had been no assault and she had simply wanted a ride home. From where they entered, the officers could see a person lying down in the bedroom. They approached the man, searched him for officer safety and then conducted a warrantless search to locate any other occupants. During the search, certain items were noted that caused them to obtain a search warrant, following which drugs were found. The defendant's argument that the search was illegal was unsuccessful as the court found that, in these particular circumstances, the police had a responsibility to enter the home without a warrant, do a pat down search of the accused and search for other occupants. Once drugs were seen in plain view, they proceeded to obtain a search warrant. Judicial notice was taken of the fact that complainants in domestic situations often recant due to threats of coercion by their partners. The defendant appealed. Appeal allowed; conviction set aside; although a violation of the defendant's Charter rights had occurred, the record was insufficient for this court to engage in a s. 24(2) analysis. Although it was reasonable, in the circumstances, for the police to search for the girl, go to the defendant's home and not simply leave once she told them she was fine, the trial judge erred in failing to consider alternatives short of police entry (such as conferring with the girl after they had her step outside and close the door) and the search of the home, without a warrant. Police authority to investigate such a call includes locating the alleged victim and determining if their assistance is required, but, without more, does not extend to the entry or search of the premises.","HELD: Leave to appeal was granted, the appeal allowed and the conviction set aside.

The court was required to take into account the potential distraction of the trier of fact from its proper focus on the facts charged, and to allow the evidence of all 14 complainants to apply to all 17 charges. The issue in this case is not identification but the actus reus of the offence. The point is not that the degree of similarity in such case must be higher or lower than in an identification case. It is rather that the trial judge should evaluate the degree and extent of the similarity of the alleged acts and decide whether the objective improbability of coincidence has been established. The relative importance of the issue in the particular trial may also have bearing on the weighing up of factors for and against admissibility. The issues in question are not identification, but the acts which occurred in their childhood often become embellished and distorted and blamed for many of our personal shortcomings or personal failures later in life. The degree of similarities between the similar facts and the offences alleged is far too high. The Court reserved its decision respecting the application and undertook to render decision on this issue at the time of its final judgment.","[1] The accused has been charged with 14 counts of indecent assault and three counts of gross indecency against 14 individuals, all of whom were boys who attended the Beauval Indian Residential School between January 1, 1959 and December 31, 1967. A conviction shall be entered to Count 1. This count is dismissed. A conviction shall be entered on Count 3. The court does enter a conviction to Count 4. The court does dismiss Count 6.

Therefore, the court does dismiss Count 10. Therefore a conviction is entered on Count 11. A conviction will be entered to both Counts 12 and 13. Whether there was an indecent assault of M.V.P. in the shower or whether there was only an attempt, the court accepts the evidence of M.V.P. that there was in fact an indecent assault in the bedroom of the accused when M.V.P. was approximately 15 years of age, and I find the Crown has proven the charge beyond a reasonable doubt and a conviction shall be entered to Count 14.

The residential school was located at Beauval in the Province of Saskatchewan. The accused was considered the golden-haired boy of the priests and nuns and was very popular with the boys at the school. He developed the intermural hockey, competitive fastball and softball teams, and the Warriors, which was the regional champion hockey team through most of the years. The court was also required to take into account the potential distraction of the trier of fact from its proper focus on the facts charged, the potential for undue prejudice, reasoning prejudice and propensity reasoning in judge alone trial as opposed to jury trial. The issue in this case is not identification but the actus reus of the offence. The point is not that the degree of similarity in such case must be higher or lower than in an identification case. It is rather that the trial judge should consider the probative value/prejudice balance, but is in fact essential to it.","[1] The accused has been charged with 14 counts of indecent assault and three counts of gross indecency against 14 individuals, all of whom were boys who attended the Beauval Indian Residential School between January 1, 1959 and December 31, 1967.

A temporary order would be appropriate.","In this proceeding, the Minister of Social Services [Ministry] seeks an order, pursuant to s. 37(1)(b) of the CFSA, that C.T. be committed to the care of A.R.’s parents for an indefinite period of time. In its place, A.T. suggests a temporary
order, of up to one year, under s. 37(7) of the CFSA. A.T. contends that,
with this additional time, he will be able to demonstrate sufficient stability, both in his lifestyle and behaviour, that he would be able to resume parenting C.T. Accordingly, A.R. also suggests that a temporary order would be appropriate. In other words, while the proposed order would not be a temporary order, it would not be as potentially immutable as a s. 37(2) order. These were opportunities for the parents to demonstrate a reasonable prospect for change – something more palpable and more meaningful than any statements of good intentions could ever be. It necessarily follows that an indefinite order under s. 37(1)(b), as requested by the Ministry, should issue. CONCLUSION [56] In the result, there will be an order placing C.T. in
the custody of the persons of sufficient interest, Mr. and Ms. R., on an indefinite basis.",0.5207756232686981,0.3926096997690531,"HELD: In this proceeding, the Minister of Social Services seeks an order, pursuant to s. 37(1)(b) of the CFSA, that C.T. be committed to the care of A.R.'s parents for an indefinite period of time. The Minister also suggests a temporary order for custody to be placed with the maternal grandparents as persons of sufficient interest. The issues in this matter are relatively straightforward and can be identified with two questions: 1) Is the child in need of protection? and 2) if so, what is the appropriate order to serve C.R.’s best interests.  2) The evidence was presented through the testimony of six witnesses: the two child protection workers assigned to the case, both of whom are now deceased; the Ministry assigned child protection worker, Ms. R. (who is in her late 50s and has retired from her previous occupations); the Ministry submits that neither of the parents have been able and willing to provide sufficient stability, both in their lifestyle and behaviour, that they would be able to resume parenting. 3) A temporary order was suggested, of up to 1 year, under s.37(7) of CFSA. The Ministry's position was presented primarily through her testimony.

The accused, a status Indian with Aboriginal and Treaty 10 rights, was fishing for food. He had used a net in the restricted area and had caught eight suckers, two walleye and one northern pike. The Bay was very close to the residence of the accused on the Canoe Lake First Nation and was his preferred area to fish. The remainder of Canoe Lake was subject to restrictions governing all fishing but open to unlimited Treaty sustenance fishing all year round. The accused admitted to the actus reus of the offence. Under the Constitutional Questions Act, 2012 the accused gave notice that he would argue that s. 7(2)(b) of the regulations was invalid because it restricted his Treaty and Aboriginal right to fish food in the restricted area as defined by the Regulations; infringed his Treaty and Aboriginal right to fish for food as protected by s. 35(1) of the Constitution Act, 1982; and infringed his Treaty and Aboriginal right to fish for food as protected by s. 25 of the Charter of Rights.

A one-year concurrent sentence was imposed for the conviction of prohibited possession of a firearm. The court gave him credit at the rate of 1:1.5 for his time on remand, resulting in a net global sentence of six years, five months to be served in a federal penitentiary. The Gladue report was considered and the background of the accused was assessed as an enormous mitigating factor. The court found that this was not an appropriate case to make an order pursuant to s. 743.6 of the Code both because of the multiple Gladue factors and because it had addressed the principles of denunciation and deterrence in the global sentence.","HELD: The Court found that a global sentence of 10 years was appropriate in this case to be served in a federal institution on the manslaughter conviction. The Crown had changed its counsel and requested a dedicated Gladue Report. The court reviewed the cases provided to it by counsel and the Crown and agreed that a 15 year global sentence was appropriate. The Court reviewed the three cases provided by counsel but the Crown had not provided any evidence as to Gladue factors. The evidence was clear that the Crown did not intend to rely specifically on the Gladue factor. The trial judge had indicated that he did not have the up-to-date record of the accused and that he was not aboriginal. The sentencing judge had also indicated that the accused had a history of violent offending and that the evidence did not show that he had a significant remorse. The sentence for the manslaughter was increased to that of 10. The judge noted that the Gladues factors were not considered in the sentencing decision. The sentences for the offence were reduced to that for the first time in the history of the offence. The accused was given credit for 3 years, 7 months and 1.5 years on remand for the time he spent on remands since being arrested. The amount of time he had spent on a remand was reduced to 1.25 to 1 year. The length of time that he would have been out of the country was reduced by the amount of remand. The average sentence for a manslaughter conviction is between 4 years and 5 months. The maximum sentence for manslaughter is 10 years. The offence is unique in that it covers a broad spectrum of circumstances. There are numerous Gladue Factors relevant to the offence and the degree of responsibility of the offender. The defendant was found not guilty of manslaughter but guilty of second degree murder. The factors relevant to him were the combination of Gladue and manslaughter factors.","[16] On the other hand there is one huge mitigating factor and that is the multiple Gladue factors relevant to Gordon taken as a whole.

The plaintiff asserted that the documents sought, and indeed all of the defendants' evidence, ought to be excluded on the basis that it is subject to solicitor client privilege. In this factual situation, the waiver may be reasonably inferred.","[1] The origin of this action was a mortgage foreclosure commenced by Canada Life Mortgage Services (""Canada Life"") against Leeside Estates Ltd. and Byung K. Lee. In this factual situation I find that waiver may be reasonably inferred. CONCLUSION [29] On the basis of these various grounds I am prepared to order disclosure. The production ordered will be Mr. Muttart's documents which relate to:

(a) the terms of Mr. Muttart's retainer;
(b) the content of Mr. Muttart's advice given to Lee and the timing of that advice with respect to:
(i) the alleged failure by the plaintiffs and defendants by counterclaim to comply with the terms of a ""commitment letter"" as alleged by Lee, or any other perceived failure to comply with the terms of a contract as alleged by Lee; and
(ii) any of the other allegations contained in para. 2 of the counterclaim herein.",0.3893129770992366,0.36201780415430257,"The borrower in a mortgage foreclosure action counterclaimed against the lender and joined the insurer of the mortgage and experts he had retained for advice in the development on the basis of negligent misrepresentation. During discovery of the borrower's former solicitor it was revealed that the solicitor may have given the borrower a warning that the financing arranged was inadequate. No privilege was claimed during the discovery process. The defendant brought an application for production of the solicitor's files and a copy of the borrower's employer and bank records intended to show his familiarity with business and financial affairs. Application allowed in part; solicitor's files with respect to terms of solicitor's retainer and non-legal advice or services are to be produced; employer's and banker's records not to be produced. The claim of negligent misrepresentation raised the question of reliance; evidence of knowledge would go to the borrower's state of mind and the solicitor's warning, if timely, would be relevant. The conduct of the borrower's present counsel in making no objection at the discovery amounted to waiver. There were no special circumstances existing with respect to the employer's and bank's records; the applicant made no effort to obtain the records until too late and the documents would have little, if any, relevance.","The plaintiff sought to insure the mortgage with Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation (CMHC) through its mortgage insurance program.

c_2009skpc31.txt,"The accused, Chisum Log Homes and its sole director Gary Varga, are charged with operating a processing facility without a licence contrary to s. 18.1(1) of The Forest Resources Management Act. The accused corporation assembles log home packages. The packages are sold to customers across Canada. The accused corporation buys wood from area operators such as L&amp;M to be used in its packages. L&amp;M through its contractor P&amp;E, harvest wood from the forest and sell the wood to pulp mills, saw mills and other customers such as the accused. These area operators and their contractors have Forest Management Agreements and Forest Product Processing Facility Licences. In August and September 2007, the area operator L&amp;M delivered logs to the accused. The accused took additional steps to prepare the logs for inclusion in their log home packages which they sold. The accused does not have a Forest Product Processing Facility Licence. The issue in this case is whether the Crown has shown that the accused requires such a licence. HELD: 1) The definition of 'manufacture' in the Act is extremely broad as it says, 'means any step taken'. Given this definition is not difficult to find based on the evidence presented that the steps taken by the contractor in cutting the logs is more than simply harvesting as it is defined in the legislation.

It was also concluded that the Court had a moral and legal duty to ensure that foster homes had the necessary physical requirements to properly care for the children placed in such a home. This was a somewhat unorthodox household, insofar as the accused regularly walked around naked, as did the mother, and there were no touching surfaces.

The best interests standard was necessarily an individualistic approach as explained in A.C. v. Manitoba (Director Child andFamily Services), 2009 SCC 30 (CanLII). The Court concluded that it had a duty to look firstly at the Criminal Code convictions and the parenting of children for a short period of time.

Essentially, the charge was welfare fraud; 7) In 2007, the child was placed with his parents, who were living with him and his sister, who was living with his father and his mother to raise. 8) The children were placed with the father and the mother of the two girls. 9) In 2008, the children were apprehended with their mother and their sister.

He would charge no fee. Although he had no social skills and did not know how to play with other children, he did know he was the father of two children. He did not have a criminal record. The photographs were taken in the process of taking those photos. Although his wife was always in attendance, it was he that would attend to that aspect of preparation. The business ended in 1999. 3) The court found that it was incumbent upon the parents to look firstly at s. 37(1) which requires determination of whether or not the children should be returned to parent, placed with person of sufficient interest, or with the Minister for a temporary period not exceeding 6 months.

HELD: 1) The father was ordered to pay the required amount for two children based on an income of $140,000 for the months from May 2008 to August 2009. The parties did not define how such a guideline income is to be determined. It is well established that severance pay represents an acceleration of income that would have been paid over a period of months. 2) The capital gain is a non-reoccurring amount which should not be included in the determination of the father's 2008 income. 3) The parties were working from the husband's income for 2007. At that time the husband was working for Conexus and had gross annual income in the sum of $117,000. The father spent his severance funds on legal fees and to set up his new home in Alberta. The mother had substantial legal fees to pay as result of the court proceedings. The severance is included as part of the dad's income. 4) With respect to the capital gain shown on the father’s 2008 income tax return, it is clear that there has been a change in the residency of one of the children of the marriage. This gain does not reflect income actually received by the father and there will be no year to year capital gain unless the father has gains on other property.","[2] The mother has filed a motion in this matter requesting an order quantifying child support arrears which she says are due and owing pursuant to the Gunn J. order of September 26, 2008.

The accused in this case was found fit to stand trial because he had a memory of what happened during the alleged offence despite having virtually no ability to participate in the proceeding.","The accused was charged with three counts of assault. The court found that the accused had a limited cognitive capacity, namely, that he could not recall the events of the alleged shooting, but that he was able to communicate with counsel. The Court found that he met the fitness test on the first two counts, namely understanding the nature of the proceedings and understanding the possible outcomes. The only issue was whether the accused met the test on a third count. The accused was found to have a major cognitive problem, which would make a fitness test fit in any event. The test for fitness to stand trial was 'limited cognitive capacity'. The Court held that the test for whether the Court could reasonably conclude that the Court was satisfied that the defendant met the criteria for fitness was'mutually unintelligible'. The court also held that, given the accused's extensive training and experience, he was not only able to comprehend the nature and the possible consequences of each of the allegations but also to communicate effectively with counsel and to make a determination on the fitness of the accused. The evidence showed that the court could not find the fitness to participate test fit with the test of 'limited capacity' as defined in R. v. Taylor. The conclusion that the trial judge was unable to determine whether the defendant's cognitive capacity met the requirement for fitness is not supported by the test. The trial judge's failure to make the determination was due to a lack of clarity and lack of ability to communicate.

The plaintiff discovered that one of the defendants had shares being held at the defendants' solicitor's office and instructions were given to the sheriff to seize and sell the shares. The sheriff attended to seize the shares but the defendants' lawyer objected. At issue was whether the legal office could refuse to hand over the shares to the sheriff pursuant to a solicitor's lien and whether the shares were exempt from seizure pursuant to the Saskatchewan Farm Security Act.

There was no evidence to determine the amount owing from the defendant or the third corporation for legal work; a valid solicitor's lien was not demonstrated. 2) There is a difference between the seizure and sale of shares in a company and the seizure and sale of a piece of farmland and the argument that the Executions Act or the Saskatchewan Farm Security Act restricts the seizure fails.,"FIAT. The court sought an order from the Saskatchewan Court of Appeal requiring the legal office of Eggum, Abrametz and Eggum to produce to the sheriff of Prince Albert, the shares owned by the respondent company by the solicitor of the plaintiff for the indebtedness of the respondent's father and the corporation by the amount owing on the judgment. The solicitor had been advised by Eggum and Abrametz that his claim for a solicitor's lien against the shares in question was a writ of execution pursuant to a judgment in the Judicial Centre of Prince Alberta. The sheriff had been unable to enforce the judgment and the balance owing on it was $28,163.97 plus interest. The lawyer was also ordered to produce and deliver to the court the shares of the defendant company by way of a solicitor’s lien. The judge ordered the lawyer to produce the shares to the Sheriff within seven days of service. The plaintiff was advised to sell the shares. The defendant solicitor was to produce. The Court of Queen’S Bench found that the solicitor”s liens were valid and the court ordered the solicitor to produce, to the county sheriff, the outstanding solicitor‘s lian against the company and the shares that the plaintiff held in the company. The s. 21(1) of The Legal Profession Act had an application. The Sheriff was unable to obtain the shares and the plaintiff was ordered to pay the solicitor. The order was upheld. The issue was whether the solicitor had a valid solicitor“s lia (lien) on his shares and whether the shares were exempt from seizure pursuant to the Saskatchewan Farm Security Act. The only claim against the plaintiff” s. 66(3) of the Legal Profession act arose out of s. 1990. The Solicitor’ s. 1 of the Saskatchewan farm security act was also an application and the sheriff was unable, on application by the execution creditor, to enforce it. The matter was adjourned to September 2016. The trial judge was unable and the judge was unsuccessful in finding that the defendant solicitor had not breached his solicitor‚s lan. The issues before the court were whether the lawyer’d lien to prevail against the sheriff would afford the solicitor greater right than his clients to withhold documents from the receiver. The question was whether, under the Saskatchewan Act, the solicitor was exempt from seizures pursuant to The Saskatchewan Farm security Act.

At issue was the accused's sentence. The Crown sought a global sentence of 5 years plus a forfeiture order of items seized, a fine in lieu of forfeiture for all cash used for legal fees, a mandatory weapons prohibition and sought bodily substances for DNA analysis. As the accused had been denied bail and had pre- trial detention of 15 months and 24 days, the defence sought one and one-half times credit for time served on remand.HELD: The accused had 9 prior drug convictions since 1999, two for trafficking in 2000 for which he received a 12 month sentence of incarceration and, in 2007, one trafficking and conspiracy to traffic which resulted in his receiving a 5 year penitentiary sentence. As the accused had been a compliant prisoner on remand, the Court granted him credit for 1.5 days for each day spent on remand for a total of 23 months and 21 days credit. The Court imposed a sentence of 30 months imprisonment, and ordered a DNA sample as well as a fine in lieu of forfeiture in the sum of $16,326 (being the sum transferred to the accused's legal counsel to pay his legal fees) to be paid within 60 days and, in default of payment, a term of imprisonment of 6 months consecutive to the term of imprisonment otherwise imposed.","The accused was found guilty of three counts contained in an amended Indictment dated December 12, 2011. The accused had been in custody since he was arrested and was charged with trafficking. The offences were found to be proceeds of crime. The amount of marijuana and cocaine found in the accused's possession was in addition to the amount found in his possession for the purposes of trafficking. He was convicted of trafficking and possession of cocaine. The court awarded him credit for 6 months, 9 days, the same to be served unless otherwise permitted at a provincial correctional centre in Saskatchewan. The Court also awarded him one and one-half days credit for the time he had spent on remand awaiting trial. The sentencing judge found that the accused was a compliant prisoner, had no disciplinary issues or problems while on remanded awaiting trial and that he would have qualified for a one-third reduction in his sentence for good behaviour. The sentence imposed was not increased or reduced. The offender could and should have been brought to trial sooner. The aggravating circumstances in this case were that the nature and quantity of the drugs found in Mr. Mullins' possession for purposes of the trafficking constitute an aggravating factor. The defendant had a previous drug related record and had nine prior drug convictions since 1999, two for trafficking and one for conspiracy to do so. The evidence as came out in evidence did not show a sophisticated commercial enterprise that would warrant an extremely lengthy period of incarceration. The judge also gave the accused credit for his compliance with the terms of his sentence. The sentences imposed were in the range of 18 months to 4 years. The maximum credit for remand was given to the accused for 6.5 months. The remaining sentence was 6 months. 9 days.","[1] On December 13, 2011, the accused, Philip Edward Mullins was found guilty of three counts contained in an Amended Indictment dated December 12, 2011, charging him with the following offences: Count 1: That he, on or about the 25th day of August, 2010, at or near Estevan Saskatchewan, did unlawfully possess a controlled substance included in Schedule 1 to wit: cocaine (benzoylmethylecgonine) for the purpose of trafficking, contrary to section 5(3)(a) of the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act. Count 2: That he, on or about the 25th day of August, 2010, at or near Estevan Saskatchewan, did unlawfully possess a controlled substance included in Schedule I to wit: cannabis (marihuana) for the purpose of trafficking, contrary to section 5(3)(a) of the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act. Count 3: That he, on or about the 25th day of August, 2010, at or near Estevan Saskatchewan, did unlawfully have in his possession property (or proceeds of property), to wit: cash of a value exceeding $5,000.00 knowing that all (or part) of the property was obtained (or derived directly or indirectly) as a result of the commission in Canada of an offence punishable by indictment contrary to section 354 and 355 (a) of the Criminal Code.

I grant a credit against that sentence for the time served by Mr. Mullins on remand at the rate of one and one-half days for each day spent in remand custody to a total of 23 months and 21 days. In the result, I impose a remaining sentence to be served by Mr. Mullins of 6 months, 9 days, the same to be served unless otherwise permitted at a provincial correctional centre in Saskatchewan. 4) pursuant to s. 462.37(3) of the Criminal Code, Philip Edward Mullins is ordered to pay a fine in lieu of forfeiture in the sum of $16,325.98 to be paid within 60 days and, in default of payment, pursuant to s. 462.37(4)(ii), a term of imprisonment of six months consecutive to the term of imprisonment imposed by this judgment is ordered. The court concludes that it is in the interest of justice that such an order be made.",0.44524669073405526,0.528957528957529,"The accused was found guilty of possession of cocaine for the purpose of trafficking and possession of marijuana for the purpose of trafficking contrary to s. 5(3)(a) the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act, and having in his possession cash (almost $30,000) knowing it was obtained through the commission of an offence contrary to s. 354 and 355(a) of the Criminal Code. At issue was the accused's sentence. The Crown sought a global sentence of 5 years plus a forfeiture order of items seized, a fine in lieu of forfeiture for all cash used for legal fees, a mandatory weapons prohibition and sought bodily substances for DNA analysis. As the accused had been denied bail and had pre- trial detention of 15 months and 24 days, the defence sought one and one-half times credit for time served on remand.HELD: The accused had 9 prior drug convictions since 1999, two for trafficking in 2000 for which he received a 12 month sentence of incarceration and, in 2007, one trafficking and conspiracy to traffic which resulted in his receiving a 5 year penitentiary sentence. As the accused had been a compliant prisoner on remand, the Court granted him credit for 1.5 days for each day spent on remand for a total of 23 months and 21 days credit. The Court imposed a sentence of 30 months imprisonment, and ordered a DNA sample as well as a fine in lieu of forfeiture in the sum of $16,326 (being the sum transferred to the accused's legal counsel to pay his legal fees) to be paid within 60 days and, in default of payment, a term of imprisonment of 6 months consecutive to the term of imprisonment otherwise imposed.","The accused was found guilty of three counts contained in an amended Indictment dated December 12, 2011, charging him with trafficking. The accused had spent just short of 16 months on remand since being arrested. He had been in custody for 15 months and was charged with various drug trafficking offences. HELD: The Court gave the accused a credit of one and one-half days for each day he spent in custody. The amount involved was $16,325.98 which was transferred to the accused's lawyer at his request to pay his legal fees. A sentencing hearing was subsequently held after which the court reserved its sentencing judgment. The Court awarded the accused credit for 6 months, 9 days, the same to be served unless otherwise permitted at a provincial correctional centre in Saskatchewan.","[1] On December 13, 2011, the accused, Philip Edward Mullins was found guilty of three counts contained in an Amended Indictment dated December 12, 2011, charging him with the following offences: Count 1: That he, on or about the 25th day of August, 2010, at or near Estevan Saskatchewan, did unlawfully possess a controlled substance included in Schedule 1 to wit: cocaine (benzoylmethylecgonine) for the purpose of trafficking, contrary to section 5(3)(a) of the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act. Count 2: That he, on or about the 25th day of August, 2010, at or near Estevan Saskatchewan, did unlawfully possess a controlled substance included in Schedule I to wit: cannabis (marihuana) for the purpose of trafficking, contrary to section 5(3)(a) of the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act. Count 3: That he, on or about the 25th day of August, 2010, at or near Estevan Saskatchewan, did unlawfully have in his possession property (or proceeds of property), to wit: cash of a value exceeding $5,000.00 knowing that all (or part) of the property was obtained (or derived directly or indirectly) as a result of the commission in Canada of an offence punishable by indictment contrary to section 354 and 355 (a) of the Criminal Code. [2] A sentencing hearing was subsequently held December 19, 2011 after which the court reserved its sentencing judgment now delivered. The court concludes, in the circumstances of this case, that it would not be appropriate to impose an overall sentence less than two years in the circumstances of this case or this offender. [32] I accept Mr. Mullins’ deposition that he was a compliant prisoner, had no disciplinary issues or problems while on remand and that he would have qualified, had he been in the regular prison population, for a one-third reduction in his sentence for good behaviour.

The accused had been in custody since he was arrested and was charged with trafficking. The offences were found to be proceeds of crime. The amount of marijuana and cocaine found in the accused's possession was in addition to the amount found in his possession for the purposes of trafficking. He was convicted of trafficking and possession of cocaine. The court awarded him credit for 6 months, 9 days, the same to be served unless otherwise permitted at a provincial correctional centre in Saskatchewan. The Court also awarded him one and one-half days credit for the time he had spent on remand awaiting trial. The sentencing judge found that the accused was a compliant prisoner, had no disciplinary issues or problems while on remanded awaiting trial and that he would have qualified for a one-third reduction in his sentence for good behaviour. The sentence imposed was not increased or reduced. The offender could and should have been brought to trial sooner. The aggravating circumstances in this case were that the nature and quantity of the drugs found in Mr. Mullins' possession for purposes of the trafficking constitute an aggravating factor. The defendant had a previous drug related record and had nine prior drug convictions since 1999, two for trafficking and one for conspiracy to do so. The evidence as came out in evidence did not show a sophisticated commercial enterprise that would warrant an extremely lengthy period of incarceration. The judge also gave the accused credit for his compliance with the terms of his sentence. The sentences imposed were in the range of 18 months to 4 years. The maximum credit for remand was given to the accused for 6.5 months. The remaining sentence was 6 months. 9 days.",0.5339966832504146

The context in which the delay occurred is not in the public's eye and therefore very few people would even know that it is currently in existence.

Here, some time would be expended in determining what undertakings could be responded to and what should be resisted. As examination for discovery were completed this is at an early stage that it would lead the Court on its Own to strike the claim.","[1] The applicant, Ernest Hoeppner, brings an application for relief in the alternative as follows:

(a) that the plaintiff’s action be dismissed for want of prosecution; or
(b) that the plaintiff be required to disclose the amount recovered from its lawsuit with Wawanesa Insurance, Q.B. No. 1074 of 2001. On March 7, 2000, Mr. Kozak suffered a fire at his farm. On May 7, 2001, Mr. Kozak issued a statement of claim against one James Neigum, his tenant, and Wawanesa Mutual Insurance Company under Q.B. No. 1074 of 2001 in the Judicial Centre of Saskatoon. I find that the delay was inordinate. [8] As examinations for discovery are completed this matter is at a point where it could well go to pre-trial conference. [10] The delay from June 2010 to May 2012 really is a delay from May 2011 until May 2012 and solely on the head of counsel for the plaintiff for not responding in a timely fashion to the undertakings. [11] The only reason offered by counsel for the plaintiff for the delay in responding to the undertakings was a busy schedule and determination was to be made about which undertakings could be answered and which were not answerable pursuant to the Rules. It could form the basis of a disclosure order in this case should the trial judge ultimately determine that the communications sought here were relevant and necessary to avoid double recovery in this case. SUMMARY [20] Regarding the application to strike the plaintiff’s claim for want of prosecution, I find that for the initial period of May 2006 to May 2010 the delay was inordinate but excusable. With regard to the period of time June 2010 to May 2012 I find the period of delay not to be inordinate but even if inordinate and inexcusable, I would find that having regard to the principles set down by the Court of Appeal in International Capital Corp. v.

As examinations for discovery are completed this matter is at a point where it could lead the court on its own to strike. The amount of settlement amounts arrived at in the minutes of settlement be disclosed. The Court found the delay was inordinate but excusable. The plaintiff's action could form the basis of a disclosure order in this case should the trial judge ultimately determine that the communications sought here were relevant and necessary to avoid double recovery. The delay was inexcusable. The defendant has made its case and ordered those specific amounts for each structure for which Wawanesa settled its claim to be disclosed to the court. The stage of litigation is at which it could well go to pre-trial conference. The public policy behind settlement privilege is compelling one. It is so compelling that even threats arising in the context of settlement negotiations may not justify an exception. As the defendant is retired from active business, this delay is not causing him any professional embarrassment or damage to reputation. This is not matter that is in the public's eye and therefore very few people would even know that it is currently in existence. The context in which the delay occurred is inordinate. The length of the delay is simply be the one-year period that it took the plaintiff's counsel to respond to the undertaking. While one year is an excessive period of time it is not such as to lead me to the position that this claim should be strike on that basis. The Stage of litigation","[1] The applicant, Ernest Hoeppner, brings an application for relief in the alternative as follows:

(a) that the plaintiff’s action be dismissed for want of prosecution; or
(b) that the plaintiff be required to disclose the amount recovered from its lawsuit with Wawanesa Insurance, Q.B. No. 1074 of 2001. On March 7, 2000, Mr. Kozak suffered a fire at his farm. On May 7, 2001, Mr. Kozak issued a statement of claim against one James Neigum, his tenant, and Wawanesa Mutual Insurance Company under Q.B. No. 1074 of 2001 in the Judicial Centre of Saskatoon. I find that the delay was inordinate. [8] As examinations for discovery are completed this matter is at a point where it could well go to pre-trial conference.

[11] The only reason offered by counsel for the plaintiff for the delay in responding to the undertakings was a busy schedule and determination was to be made about which undertakings could be answered and which were not answerable pursuant to the Rules. It could form the basis of a disclosure order in this case should the trial judge ultimately determine that the communications sought here were relevant and necessary to avoid double recovery in this case. SUMMARY [20] Regarding the application to strike the plaintiff’s claim for want of prosecution, I find that for the initial period of May 2006 to May 2010 the delay was inordinate but excusable. With regard to the period of time June 2010 to May 2012 I find the period of delay not to be inordinate but even if inordinate and inexcusable, I would find that having regard to the principles set down by the Court of Appeal in International Capital Corp. v. Robinson Twigg & Ketilson that I would not strike the plaintiff’s claim. [21] With regard to the disclosure of settlement amounts I find that the defendant has made its case and order those specific amounts for each structure for which Wawanesa settled its claim to be disclosed.",0.6601941747572816,0.5815950920245399,"The plaintiff purchased insurance from the defendant. In 2000, the plaintiff's farm was damaged by a fire. He commenced an action against Wawanesa Insurance Company in 2001. In 2006, the plaintiff commenced an action against the defendant, alleging that the defendant was in breach of contract or negligent for failing to obtain full replacement value insurance coverage for the plaintiff. The defendant filed his defence in April 2007. Mediation took place in September 2010 and examinations for discovery were held in May 2011. At that time, the defendant asked the plaintiff to disclose the amount recovered in the Wawanesa lawsuit and the plaintiff refused. The defendant brought this application for relief that: 1) The plaintiff's action be dismissed for want of prosecution; or 2) The plaintiff be required to disclose the amount recovered in the other lawsuit. The defendant argued that the delays between the issuance of the statement of claim to the examination for discovery and then the delay between the time of mediation to May 2012 when the plaintiff's counsel filed the reply to undertakings were both inordinate.HELD: The Court applied the test established in International Capitol Corp. v. Robinson Twigg &amp; Ketilson to determine whether or not a matter should be struck for want of prosecution. The Court found that the first delay was inordinate but because the plaintiff and defendant both acknowledged that the action against the defendant would only proceed depending on the outcome of the claim against Wawanesa, the delay was excusable. The Court found that the second delay was excessive, but was not sufficient to strike the claim on that basis. Applying the factors provided in Capitol, the Court found:1. Stage of litigation: It did not occur at an early stage of the litigation as the matter could well go to pre-trial conference. 2. Impact of delay: The delay was not causing any problems for the defendant. 3. The context in which the delay occurred: the delay in question was actually only one year during which the plaintiff's counsel did not respond in a timely fashion to undertakings. 4. Reasons offered for delay: Counsel was busy and it had to determine which undertaking could or could not be answered. 5. The role of counsel in causing the delay: The Court held that the delay caused by the plaintiff's counsel should not be a reason to deprive the plaintiff of his claim for actions beyond his control. The Court denied the application to strike the plaintiff's claim but ordered that the plaintiff disclose the amount obtained in the Wawanesa action on the basis that this case fell into the exception to the policy which protects settlement communications.

c_2013skqb155.txt,"The Crown appealed a decision of the Provincial Court dismissing an application for a recognizance pursuant to s. 810.2 of the Criminal Code. The judge held that the usual rules of evidence pertaining to criminal trials apply to a s. 810.2 hearing and that records kept by the Correctional Services of Canada (CSC) were inadmissible as business records under s. 30 of the Canada Evidence Act. The respondent had been convicted in 2009 of robbery with violence, assault causing bodily harm, assault and three counts of violating bail. He was sentenced to three years' imprisonment. In May 2010, the CSC referred the respondent's case to the National Parole Board (NPB) with a recommendation that he be detained until warrant expiry, in accordance with s. 129(2) of the Corrections and Conditional Release Act (CCRA). The recommendation was based upon the character of the respondent's offences and where there are reasonable grounds to believe that the offender is likely to commit another offence causing death or serious harm if released on parole. The NPB ordered that the respondent be detained in custody until the expiry of the sentence. Reviewed annually under the CCRA, the CSC prepared another assessment in 2011 and the respondent was not released from custody until March 2012. At that point, a 'warrant expiry package' was prepared by a parole officer, comprised of CSC records relating to the respondent, including a criminal profile report, the assessment for decision reports and copies of the NPB's reasons for ordering detention. These records were sent to the RCMP in Saskatchewan. The officer concerned then swore the information under s. 810.2, stating that he believed that there were reasonable grounds to believe that the respondent would commit a serious personal offence as defined by s. 752 of the Code. The application for a hearing was commenced in August 2012. The parole officer and the RCMP officer were called to testify and the Crown applied to have the documents in the package admitted into evidence, and the respondent opposed the application. The judge refused to allow the admission of the report, the assessment and the NPB reasons for ordering detention based upon R. v. Fontaine and R. v. Toulejour. Based on the business rules exception, the judge held that the criminal report profile was inadmissible because it was a copy and not accompanied by supporting affidavits as required by s. 30(3) of the CEA.

The judge held that the usual rules of evidence pertaining to criminal trials apply to a s. 810.2 hearing and that records kept by the Correctional Services of Canada (CSC) were inadmissible as business records under s. 30 of the Canada Evidence Act. The respondent had been convicted in 2009 of robbery with violence, assault causing bodily harm, assault and three counts of violating bail. He was sentenced to three years' imprisonment. In May 2010, the CSC referred the respondent's case to the National Parole Board (NPB) with a recommendation that he be detained until warrant expiry, in accordance with s. 129(2) of the Corrections and Conditional Release Act (CCRA). The recommendation was based upon the character of the respondent's offences and where there are reasonable grounds to believe that the offender is likely to commit another offence causing death or serious harm if released on parole. The NPB ordered that the respondent be detained in custody until the expiry of the sentence. Reviewed annually under the CCRA, the CSC prepared another assessment in 2011 and the respondent was not released from custody until March 2012. At that point, a 'warrant expiry package' was prepared by a parole officer, comprised of CSC records relating to the respondent, including a criminal profile report, the assessment for decision reports and copies of the NPB's reasons for ordering detention. These records were sent to the RCMP in Saskatchewan. The officer concerned then swore the information under s. 810.2, stating that he believed that there were reasonable grounds to believe that the respondent would commit a serious personal offence as defined by s. 752 of the Code. The application for a hearing was commenced in August 2012. The parole officer and the RCMP officer were called to testify and the Crown applied to have the documents in the package admitted into evidence, and the respondent opposed the application. The judge refused to allow the admission of the report, the assessment and the NPB reasons for ordering detention based upon R. v. Fontaine and R. v. Toulejour. Based on the business rules exception, the judge held that the criminal report profile was inadmissible because it was a copy and not accompanied by supporting affidavits as required by s. 30(3) of the CEA. HELD: The Court held that the application was allowed. The Supreme Court had confirmed that s. 810 hearings are not criminal trials and that the rules of evidence in criminal trials do not apply. Hearsay evidence is admissible and the judge is to determine whether or not sufficient weight can be given to the hearsay evidence to establish reasonable and probable grounds required for the individual to swear the information to justify the fear of harm to others by the respondent. The Court held that all of the CSC records submitted as part of the package were admissible under the CEA. The Court directed that the matter be returned for a new hearing of the original application.","This is an appeal from the decision of the Provincial Court dismissing an application for a recognizance pursuant to s. 810.2 of the Criminal Code. The issue is whether the usual rules of evidence pertaining to criminal trials apply and that hearsay evidence is inadmissible. HELD: The appeal is dismissed. 1) The normal criminal rules of law apply. The usual criminal rule of evidence does not apply. It is not necessary to follow previous decisions of this court which held that CSC documents are admissible business records under s. 30 of the Canada Evidence Act. 2) There are many proceedings in our criminal law and Criminal Code that allow evidence that does not meet the admissibility rules prescribed for criminal trials to be admitted and serve as the basis for decision. The Crown applied to have the criminal profile report, the assessment for decision reports and the NPB's reasons for ordering detention admitted into evidence. The court found that the Crown did not call the authors of the reports nor did the defence seek to cross-examine them. 3) The Court held that the usual rule of law applies in s810 hearings. The Court found that s. 723 hearings are not criminal trials. It held that records kept by the Correctional Service of Canada (CSC) were in admissible as business records. 4) Hearsay evidence was not admissible in the hearing. The test was both subjective and objective. It must be established (1) that the victim actually fears that the defendant will cause personal injury to him; and (2) that there are reasonable grounds for the fear. The standard of review is correctness on a question of law. 5) Inference where information not in a business record (e.g. a bank statement or bank statement) is admissible, it is not a profit or loss statement. 6) The court concluded that the standard of proof for the trier of fact is reasonable ground to believe. 7) The test of proof in a hearing is subjective. Its objective is objective; namely, the Crown must establish subjectively the informant's belief and whether his belief is objectively founded.","[1] This is an appeal from the decision of the Provincial Court dismissing an application for a recognizance pursuant to s. 810.2 of the Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1985, c.

HELD: Appeal dismissed. 1)An exclusionary clause in a written agreement between the parties precludes giving effect to acts and statements made by the agents of the appellant to the respondent. 2)The appellant's conduct was not conducted in an effort to entice prospective franchise operators. It was conducted to inform prospective franchisees that the franchise was not viable on its own merits and ultimately to induce them to come into the franchise program if they were otherwise suitable. 3)There was no evidence that the appellant was aware of the existence of the Atlas business or that it was being run by the appellant's regional manager. 4)The trial judge did not find any palpable and overriding error which affected his assessment of the facts.","THE COURT: Appeal dismissed per reasons for judgment of Matthews, J.A.; Freeman, J.A. concurring; Hallett, J.A. dissenting by separate reasons The appellant is a wholly owned subsidiary of Imperial Oil involved in the distribution and sale of automotive parts and related products.

HELD: 1) The plaintiff is entitled to enter judgment for the damages which flow from this dismissal without having just cause as set out hereafter. 2) In the case of a person in the plaintiff's position, who occupied a junior managerial position in a very specific industry, the notice period should reflect that management positions are fewer in number than non-management positions, there is a considerable wage difference between a management position and a non-manager one. 3) Taking all factors into account, the plaintiff was awarded an appropriate notice period of 7.5 months.  4) In this case the alleged misconduct of the plaintiff would have justified him being warned to not continue such conduct, but it falls far short of conduct justifying cause for termination. 5) The employer has the right to expect employees will not disparage their immediate supervisors or other employees in the course of their employment, and certainly not to clients or customers of the employer. However, griping is not exactly unusual in a work place, and the type of conduct alleged against the defendant would not justify dismissal the first time it came to the employer's attention, if he had been guilty of such conduct while performing only his own job function.

This is where the appellant's nightmare began.","[1] This is an appeal by Lee Keating (Keating) pursuant to the provisions of the Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy Act, S.N.S. 1993, c.5 (the Act). The appeal is taken from a decision of Robert Doherty, Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy Coordinator of the Department of Justice, dated October 16, 1998, whereby the appellant was denied access to information requested. [43] For the purposes of this appeal I have considered all of the above material including Robert P. Doherty's decision of April 12, 1999 which latter item I have considered to be the decision appealed from in the context of a de novo process. Section 15(1)(a) and (c): For the reasons set forth in my consideration of s.23(b), the disclosure of the information sought will not harm law enforcement and I am not convinced it will harm investigative techniques or procedures. (2) Keating has proved to my satisfaction that disclosure of the information sought, notwithstanding that it may be personal information about a third party, would not be an unreasonable invasion of the third party's personal privacy. 3) the evidence collected in relation to investigations undertaken as a result of the allegations; [63] In complying with this decision the Department of Justice is to take care not to identify by name any other alleged perpetrators of abuse.",0.4884210526315789,0.4754716981132075,"The applicant was aware that allegations of abuse had been made against him in an alternative dispute resolution process undertaken by the Province with respect to his former employment. He applied under the Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy Act for certain information concerning these allegations. The FOIPOP Privacy Coordinator denied access and the applicant appealed. Appeal allowed; in all cases where the claimants had signed release forms the applicant is to be supplied with information as to the number and nature of allegations made against him and the names of the complainants; the specific dates and times of all allegations made against him; the evidence collected in relation to the investigations undertaken as a result of the allegations; the number and dollar amount of payouts made for actions attributable only to the applicant; and information as to whether any of the allegations leveled were dismissed or unproven. The appeal should proceed as an appeal de novo. The applicant was not seeking information from R.C.M.P. files and the release of information which the police had passed on to the Department of Justice would not harm law enforcement as the information was compiled by the Province for its own purposes. The complainants had been required to execute releases whereby the information supplied could be used for various specified purposes, all of which potentially involved public disclosure or disclosure to the applicant. Law enforcement protection was lost when a release was obtained from the complainants and the information was passed to the Province. There was no unreasonable invasion of the claimants' privacy. The applicant was entitled to know what he had been accused of and should have the right to correct the record.","This was an appeal pursuant to the provisions of the Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy Act. The appellant had made an application for information pursuant to s. 40 of the Act pursuant to which the appellant was denied access to information requested. HELD: The appeal is taken from a decision of the Department of Justice, dated October 16, 1998. 1) The appellant is a retired Chief Supervisor of the Nova Scotia School for Boys at Shelburne, Nova Scotia. He was aware of the Stratton Inquiry and the findings of that Inquiry. 2) During the course of the investigation, the appellant arranged to have statements taken from former residents of the institutions. The statements were to be signed by all persons interviewed which releases contained consent for use. 3) Throughout the entire ADR process there was much publicity and media attention. While the claimants were being spared the publicity of a public trial and more importantly cross-examination by experienced defence counsel as to the validity of their claims, they did not anticipate that virtually no effort would be made to ascertain whether or not the allegations being levelled were true. 4) There was a conflict between the obligation undertaken pursuant to instructions of the former Chief Justice of New Brunswick and those of the Justice Minister. This conflict arose as a result of the undertakings of confidentiality originally extended as part of the amended undertakings extended by the Department. 5) In many respects as of December 6, 1996, the process may be considered a nightmare for the appellant and other former employees of the school for boys.","[1] This is an appeal by Lee Keating (Keating) pursuant to the provisions of the Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy Act, S.N.S. 1993, c.5 (the Act).

Appeal allowed; certain provisions of the Order struck or temporarily lifted to permit the parties a reasonable opportunity to make timely alternative arrangements to resolve the matters in issue consensually, short of selling the matrimonial home; the court's intervention was necessary to prevent a patent injustice. There was no mention of any division of matrimonial assets in the notice filed by the husband and in the unique circumstances of this case, it was unrealistic and unfair to address the issue of selling the house without at the same time taking into account its value and the parties' individual contributions to that value.","HELD: Appeal allowed with costs and case remitted to the Supreme Court for a rehearing on an expedited basis.

(i) she arrived unexpectedly at her neighbour’s apartment, around 11:30 at night;

(ii) she was upset and crying;

(iii) she asked that the police be called;

(iv) she spontaneously described and demonstrated the incident which brought her to her neighbours and prompted the report to the police;

(v) she repeated a consistent version to the police;

(vi) she had fresh red marks on her neck and chest, which corresponded with her description;

(vii) she reported that the incident began with a quarrel about a bank card;

(viii) the accused verified this aspect of her complaint with his comments about the bank card;

(ix) a bank card in the name of [A.G.] was found in the possession of the accused; and



(x) the evidence supports the inference that the complainant and the accused were alone in their apartment from the time Ms. [D.P.] arrived home to the time Ms. [A.G.] came to her door.

HELD: The statements made by the complainant are found to be reliable and are therefore admissible.  1) Hearsay statement may be admitted on a principled basis, the governing principles are reliability and necessity. A number of cases have held that necessity is met when a witness recants or in some other fashion effectively holds hostage evidence that cannot be obtained from another source. 2) There is no other way to obtain the complainant's evidence. Whether her alcohol consumption that night erased her recollection of events or whether she is a hostile witness is immaterial at this stage. Either way she effectively holds hostage that evidence and the court need not determine the reason for the purpose of this application. The test of necessity has been met.  3) With regard to reliability, the question becomes whether there are sufficient indicia of reliability in a particular case to substitute the lack of oath, lack of cross-examination and absence of video taping. Where the hearsay statement was made in circumstances which provide some guarantees of trustworthiness, the test for reliability will be met. The following circumstances are evidence of trustworthiness: the complainant arrived unexpectedly at her neighbor's apartment, she was upset and crying, she asked that police be called, she spontaneously described the assault, she repeated a consistent version to the police, she had fresh red marks which corresponded with her description of the assault and the accused verified aspects of her complaint with comments he made.","The accused was charged with assault contrary to s. 266 of the Criminal Code.

The accused is charged with abuse of a position of trust contrary to s. 153(1)(a) of the Code. HELD: The evidence is admissible. The accused's application is dismissed. 1) After examining the transcript of the conversation, it is immediately evident that the contents of the communication are relevant. The complainant and the accused are discussing the intimate details of their relationship. The conversation is logically probative to the charge. 2) The learned provincial court judge did in fact have sufficient evidence before him to issue the telephone intercept authorization. The complainant was prepared to initiate a telephone call to the accused and engage him in a conversation which would likely cause the accused to make admissions or statements which could be confirmatory of her allegations. 3) The authorization clearly permits the police to intercept private communications in relation to an offence under s. 271(1) of the Code. That investigation was live and bona fide at the time that the authorization was obtained. The law in this country is that evidence of other crimes revealed during the course of a lawful intercept process does not render the evidence obtained inadmissible in relation to an offence not named in the authorization. The focus is on whether the interception was lawfully obtained and executed, not on what is discovered. Here the police obtained a valid authorization to intercept private communications in relation to an offence under s. 271(1) of the Code. During the investigation of that charge, they obtained evidence which is relevant to an offence under s. 153(1)(a) of the Code. The fact that the offence of s. 153(1)(a) is not named in the authorization nor included as an offence for which an authorization to intercept private communications could be obtained, does not affect the admissibility of the evidence. Therefore, there is no Charter breach. 4) Even if the evidence was obtained in violation of s. 8 of the Charter, such evidence is considered non-conscriptive evidence. Where the evidence is non-conscriptive, the court ought to go on to do a balancing as to whether or not the evidence ought to be excluded pursuant to s. 24(2) of the Charter. The factors to be considered are trial fairness, seriousness of the breach and the effect of exclusion. In this case if there is a breach, it was not serious and was inadvertent, the result of unmindful draftsmanship. There is no evidence of bad faith. There is no evidence of manipulation. The seriousness of the breach, if there was one, was minimal, and to admit the evidence would not bring the administration of justice into disrepute.","The accused applied for an order that evidence obtained by way of a telephone interception be ruled inadmissible because it is irrelevant. HELD: The evidence was inadmissible because it was not reasonably supported by the Crown's argument that the police purposely navigated around the fact that offences under s. 153(1)(a) are not eligible for intercept authorizations. The Crown argued that evidence of the offence was inadvertent and that admitting the evidence would not bring the administration of justice into disrepute. The accused argued that there was no Charter breach and that the evidence was admissible because the breach was not serious and was inadvertence. The evidence did not violate the accused's s. 8 rights. The Court of Appeal held that there is no Charter violation. The respondent's applications were dismissed. 1)The evidence was relevant and admissible in that it did not breach the accused s.8 rights. 2)The respondent's evidence was non-conscriptive and did not constitute a breach of s.7(1) of the Charter. The court concluded that there had been no Charter breaches and that there were no Charter violations. The appellant's application was dismissed. 3)The Court of Queen's Bench concluded that the respondent's argument was not supported by any evidence obtained pursuant to s.24(2) of The Charter. It was concluded that it was inadvertently and the evidence is admissible and ought not to be excluded. The trial fairness, seriousness of the breach, and the effect of exclusion were all considerations. The judge did not have sufficient evidence before him to issue the telephone intercept authorization. The matter was resolved in the Court of Justice's favour. 4)The Crown's arguments were not supported. The complainant consented to the interception of private communications and consented. The police believed that the accused sexually assaulted the complainant or alternatively had sexual contact with her while in position of trust and that it would be advantageous to their investigation to intercept telephone communication between the complainant and the accused wherein the complainant would attempt to engage the accused in conversation concerning the alleged improper activity. 5)The court concluded there was a Charter breach. The officer who issued the authorization did not appear to have sufficient information before him. The issue was whether the evidence obtained under s8(2)(c) was admissible. 6)The appellant's evidence is relevant and inadadmissible. The information obtained as result of the telephone conversation is non-consecutive.

During the investigation of that charge, they obtained evidence which is relevant to an offence under s. 153(1)(a) of the Code. The fact that the offence of s. 153(1)(a) is not named in the authorization nor included as an offence for which an authorization to intercept private communications could be obtained, does not affect the admissibility of the evidence. Therefore, there is no Charter breach. 4) Even if the evidence was obtained in violation of s. 8 of the Charter, such evidence is considered non-conscriptive evidence. Where the evidence is non-conscriptive, the court ought to go on to do a balancing as to whether or not the evidence ought to be excluded pursuant to s. 24(2) of the Charter. The factors to be considered are trial fairness, seriousness of the breach and the effect of exclusion. In this case if there is a breach, it was not serious and was inadvertent, the result of unmindful draftsmanship. There is no evidence of bad faith. There is no evidence of manipulation. The seriousness of the breach, if there was one, was minimal, and to admit the evidence would not bring the administration of justice into disrepute.",The accused applied for an order that evidence obtained by way of a telephone interception be ruled inadmissible because it is irrelevant. The accused argued that the evidence was non-conscriptive and that it was the result of unmindful draftsmanship.

HELD: The evidence was inadmissible because it was not reasonably supported by the Crown's argument that the police purposely navigated around the fact that offences under s. 153(1)(a) are not eligible for intercept authorizations. The Crown argued that evidence of the offence was inadvertent and that admitting the evidence would not bring the administration of justice into disrepute. The accused argued that there was no Charter breach and that the evidence was admissible because the breach was not serious and was inadvertence. The evidence did not violate the accused's s. 8 rights. The Court of Appeal held that there is no Charter violation. The respondent's applications were dismissed. 1)The evidence was relevant and admissible in that it did not breach the accused s.8 rights. 2)The respondent's evidence was non-conscriptive and did not constitute a breach of s.7(1) of the Charter. The court concluded that there had been no Charter breaches and that there were no Charter violations. The appellant's application was dismissed. 3)The Court of Queen's Bench concluded that the respondent's argument was not supported by any evidence obtained pursuant to s.24(2) of The Charter. It was concluded that it was inadvertently and the evidence is admissible and ought not to be excluded. The trial fairness, seriousness of the breach, and the effect of exclusion were all considerations. The judge did not have sufficient evidence before him to issue the telephone intercept authorization. The matter was resolved in the Court of Justice's favour. 4)The Crown's arguments were not supported. The complainant consented to the interception of private communications and consented. The police believed that the accused sexually assaulted the complainant or alternatively had sexual contact with her while in position of trust and that it would be advantageous to their investigation to intercept telephone communication between the complainant and the accused wherein the complainant would attempt to engage the accused in conversation concerning the alleged improper activity. 5)The court concluded there was a Charter breach. The officer who issued the authorization did not appear to have sufficient information before him. The issue was whether the evidence obtained under s8(2)(c) was admissible. 6)The appellant's evidence is relevant and inadadmissible. The information obtained as result of the telephone conversation is non-consecutive. The applicant's application for exclusion was dismissed",0.6135629709364908

d_2013skca21.txt,"The appellant appealed the Queen's Bench decision that denied him damages for defamation (see: 2010 SKQB 249). The trial judge held that the defence of qualified privilege protected the Union and its representatives (the defendants in the action) when the latter republished a grievance defaming the appellant by falsely accusing him of having participated in the harassment of an employee. The trial judge fixed a provisional award of $25,000. The appellant's grounds of appeal were that the trial judge erred in finding that the defence applied and by assessing damages at $25,000. The respondents cross-appealed on the ground that the trial judge had erred in denying them costs. HELD: The Court held that the trial judge had erred in finding that the defence of qualified privilege applied. Although she correctly identified the law, she had not correctly applied it because she had not given sufficient effect to 1) the wording of the defamatory expressions; 2) the circumstances in which they were published and, in particular, the chronology of events and the separate instances of publication; 3) the persons to whom the words were published; and 4) whether what was published on each occasion was germane and reasonably appropriate to the specific occasion. In general, the Court noted that the respondents could have fulfilled their duty to notify its membership of the grievance filed by the member who alleged the harassment and made its effort to find witnesses to support the member's grievance by sending out a general notice. It did not need to name the appellant and make the allegations it did to achieve its goal. The respondent overreached, thereby placing the statement that the appellant had participated in the harassment of the employee outside the ambit of the defence of qualified privilege. The Court awarded general damages in the amount of $100,000. It held that the trial judge's assessment of damages was erroneous and founded upon mistaken principles of law. The Court was not bound by the range of damages mentioned by the Supreme Court in the Church of Scientology decision but only to apply the principles established in it to the context of this case. The provisional award of $25,000 for general damages was erroneous because the respondents published the documents by mailing them and placing them on the Union's website, over the strong objections of the employer. The respondents left the documents on the website for 6 months after the employer demanded that they be removed. The respondents had never offered an apology and appeared not to have recognized the harm that had been caused to the appellant. An award of aggravated damages was subsumed in the general award and the Court agreed with the trial judge that punitive damages were not warranted because the respondent had not been motivated by malice. The respondent's cross-appeal was dismissed without costs. However, their position was clearly correct in the circumstances: it was not appropriate for the trial judge to decline to order costs in their favour on the basis of 'mixed results', because in defamation cases, the results are invariably mixed.","The trial judge held that the principle of qualified privilege protected the union and its representatives when the latter republished a grievance defaming a member of management by falsely accusing him of having participated in the harassment of an employee. He fixed a provisional award of damages of $25,000. The parties argued that the trial judge erred by finding the defamatory statements protected by qualified privilege. The trial judge found the defamed statements were not defamatories but of being untrue. The plaintiff was awarded damages of approximately $50,000 for the defamation. The court also fixed general damages at $100,000 as the plaintiff's reputation would be lowered. The Court concluded that the defence of qualified privileged applies in this case. The claim for general damages was dismissed. The award of general damages is $100. The respondent's claim for damages is dismissed.","Disposition: Appeal allowed Cross-appeal dismissed [1] This appeal concerns the extent to which the principle of qualified privilege applies to defamatory statements made by a union regarding a member of the employer’s management. The trial judge held that the principle of qualified privilege protected the union and its representatives when the latter republished a grievance defaming a member of management by falsely accusing him of having participated in the harassment of an employee. He fixed a provisional award of damages of $25,000 (see: 2010 SKQB 249 (CanLII), [2010] 12 W.W.R. 271). [2] I have concluded that the trial judge erred by finding the defamatory statements are protected by qualified privilege. I would allow the appeal and fix general damages at $100,000. [48] Based on my review of the authorities, I conclude that the trial judge did not give sufficient effect to: (i) the wording of the defamatory expressions; (ii) the circumstances under which they were published and, in particular, the chronology of events and the separate instances of publication; (iii) the persons to whom the words were published; and (iv) whether what was published on each occasion was germane and reasonably appropriate to that specific occasion.  In any event, I am satisfied that in the whole of the circumstances, which I have reviewed extensively in connection with the Respondents’ claim for qualified privilege, $25,000 is a wholly erroneous assessment of the damages in this case. [82] Having regard for the same factors that caused me to conclude that $25,000 is a wholly erroneous assessment of general damages, including what was said, how it was published and the effect on Dr. Rubin, I conclude that general damages should be fixed in this case at $100,000. In fixing this amount, I have considered that: (i) the Respondents published the two documents by mailing them and placing them on the website—over the strong objections of the University; (ii) the documents remained on the website some six months after the University demanded that they be removed; (iii) no apology or retraction has ever been made; and (iv) the Union appears to have had no conception of the harm caused to Dr. Rubin. [85] Having regard for all of the above facts and factors, I have concluded that an award of $100,000 provides sufficient compensation and appropriately balances the positions of the parties. That does not mean that a trial judge in such circumstances could not decline to order costs to a successful defendant, but it is not appropriate to decline to do so on the basis of “mixed results.” [93] The appeal is allowed with costs to Dr. Rubin in this Court and in the Court of Queen’s Bench. Dr. Rubin shall have general damages against the Respondents in the amount of $100,000.

It did not need to name the appellant and make the allegations it did to achieve its goal. The respondent overreached, thereby placing the statement that the appellant had participated in the harassment of the employee outside the ambit of the defence of qualified privilege. The Court awarded general damages in the amount of $100,000. It held that the trial judge's assessment of damages was erroneous and founded upon mistaken principles of law. The Court was not bound by the range of damages mentioned by the Supreme Court in the Church of Scientology decision but only to apply the principles established in it to the context of this case. The provisional award of $25,000 for general damages was erroneous because the respondents published the documents by mailing them and placing them on the Union's website, over the strong objections of the employer. The respondents left the documents on the website for 6 months after the employer demanded that they be removed. The respondents had never offered an apology and appeared not to have recognized the harm that had been caused to the appellant. An award of aggravated damages was subsumed in the general award and the Court agreed with the trial judge that punitive damages were not warranted because the respondent had not been motivated by malice. The respondent's cross-appeal was dismissed without costs. However, their position was clearly correct in the circumstances: it was not appropriate for the trial judge to decline to order costs in their favour on the basis of 'mixed results', because in defamation cases, the results are invariably mixed.","The trial judge held that the principle of qualified privilege protected the union and its representatives when the latter republished a grievance defaming a member of management by falsely accusing him of having participated in the harassment of an employee. He fixed a provisional award of damages of $25,000. HELD: Appeal allowed. Cross-appeal dismissed. 1) The trial judge erred by finding the defamatory statements are protected by qualified privilege. 2) The evidence demonstrated that the Union rarely operated in the manner in which it did in this case. 3) The plaintiff's second grievance, while it remained within the confines of its original intended purpose (i.e. the originating document in grievance procedure mandated by The Trade Union Act), would be in my view protected by absolute privilege. However, the impugned words in that document ceased to enjoy that protection once the document was published in such a broad way and for the purposes stated above.","Disposition: Appeal allowed Cross-appeal dismissed [1] This appeal concerns the extent to which the principle of qualified privilege applies to defamatory statements made by a union regarding a member of the employer’s management. The trial judge held that the principle of qualified privilege protected the union and its representatives when the latter republished a grievance defaming a member of management by falsely accusing him of having participated in the harassment of an employee.

In fixing this amount, I have considered that: (i) the Respondents published the two documents by mailing them and placing them on the website—over the strong objections of the University; (ii) the documents remained on the website some six months after the University demanded that they be removed; (iii) no apology or retraction has ever been made; and (iv) the Union appears to have had no conception of the harm caused to Dr. Rubin.

d_2013skqb394.txt,"HELD: The Court held that the replacement of former Queen’s Bench rule 212 requiring the production of documents “relating” to any matter in question and rule 222 permitting examination for discovery “touching” the matter in issue in the action by new rules 5-6, 5-18 and 5-25, which use the phrase: “relevant to any matter in issue”, showed the intention that the broad relevance test was no longer applicable. The test under the new Rules was whether the matter qualifies as being material to the action based upon the matter as pled and whether the evidence tends to prove or disprove the matter in issue. This inquiry must be balanced against the notion of proportionality set out in the foundational rules. The Court dismissed the application, excepting the requested order under 3) wherein the defendant would fulfill its undertaking to have certain employees provide responses. With respect to the rest of the relief requested under 1), which involved the undertaking that the defendant would search its records regarding the loading of railcars, the Court held that the as matter was not an issue in the action, based upon a review of the claim as pled. Having regard to proportionality under the new rules, the defendant should not be required to answer the question in light of the effort and expense required versus the possible benefits. The Court held that the plaintiffs were not entitled to ask the defendants to review a binder containing hundreds of pages of invoices assembled by the plaintiff regarding its expenditures incurred as a result of the derailment in order for it to advise the plaintiff which invoices the defendant believed were not related to it. It was the plaintiff’s burden to prove its damages and the defendant was not required to assist the plaintiff to do so. The plaintiff’s requested undertaking for the defendant to provide any background documents and information that went into the preparation of sketch of the railcar in question by the defendant’s adjuster was also denied. The adjuster’s file was subject to litigation privilege and unless it was tendered as evidence at trial, there was no implied waiver of that privilege. Regarding the plaintiff’s request in 2), the Court agreed with the defendants that that plaintiff’s request that the defendant answer questions now, rather than after it had completed questioning of the plaintiff, was premature. The defendant had not yet taken a position on the cause of the derailment and they would advise the plaintiff when they had developed one. Rule 5-31 makes it an ongoing obligation to correct answers and there was no evidence in this application that the rules had not been complied with. The Court awarded costs in the amount of $1,500 to the defendants due to the complexity of the application, requiring the submission of briefs of law and the amount of time taken to argue them matters in Chambers.","FIAT: The plaintiff asks the court to order the defendants answer certain questions. The plaintiff argues that the defendants, Clarke Transport and Clarke Transport Inc., advised in respect of undertaking 28 that they did not have a position on what caused the derailment and advised CN that they would advise. CN argues that this advice was improper and that the plaintiff's file would be subject to a litigation privilege. HELD: The court found that the questions posed were not an issue in the action. The court ordered the defendants to provide answers to the questions. It was clear that the insurance adjuster's file was subject to litigation privilege and that for proportionality reasons the plaintiff should not be required to answer the question. The Court found that when the defendants moved from the words of touching and relating to any matter in issue, it intended to move away from the broad relevance test that existed under the former Queen's Bench Rules. The claim for negligence was not an important issue and the plaintiff was not required to provide proper responses.","[18] I am satisfied that when this Court moved from the words of touching and relating to any matter in issue, it intended to move away from the broad relevance test that existed under the former Queen’s Bench Rules. Based on a review of the claim as pled, matters relating to railcars previously loaded by Clarke are not an issue in the action. I am also of the opinion that for proportionality reasons Clarke should not be required to answer the question. [31] The requested undertakings 32 and 33 are to review a binder containing several hundred pages of invoices and other documents assembled by CN that it says are expenditures incurred as a result of the derailment, and to advise which invoices Clarke says are not related to the derailment or which Clarke is currently aware do not relate to the derailment. I find Clarke’s refusal to accept this requested undertaking to be appropriate. However, it is ultimately a plaintiff’s burden to prove its damages, and a defendant is not required to assist plaintiffs to do so. [36] It is clear that the insurance adjuster’s file would be subject to a litigation privilege. Unless and until the sketch is tendered as evidence at trial, I am of the opinion that there is no implied waiver of the litigation privilege that otherwise attaches to the foundational information leading to the preparation of this sketch. But, for the present and in the context of pre-trial questioning, I conclude that Clarke’s refusal to provide a response to requested undertaking 38 was appropriate. [45] Prior to undertaking 28 being taken under advisement, Clarke, through its counsel, advised in respect of undertaking 28 that they did not have a position on what caused the derailment and if they developed a position they would advise. [49] I agree with the position taken by counsel for CN that:

i. Undertaking 34 calls for Mr. Swainson himself to say what he meant or did, as opposed to Mr. Thompson saying what Mr. Swainson meant or did; and that

The history of some 445 cars previously loaded by Clarke are not pled as an issue in the action.  10) The questions were asked while the former court was in effect. The plaintiff's third party liability insurer and its adjuster were involved because of the obligation of Clarke's liability insurer to provide either a defence to the claim or an indemnity. CN says it has its own records that show cars that were not balanced and thus the topic is relevant to its allegation of negligence. In any event, the Court was unable to find much to assist the respondent in this regard.  11) The application is dismissed.  12) The matter of railcars previously loaded is not within the proper jurisdiction of the Court.","[18] I am satisfied that when this Court moved from the words of touching and relating to any matter in issue, it intended to move away from the broad relevance test that existed under the former Queen’s Bench Rules.

The plaintiff claimed for injunctive relief ordering the trees to be removed. The Court had no jurisdiction to grant this relief. The amended claim could proceed limited to the claim for damages from any overhanging trees into the plaintiff’s property and whether the trees invaded the plaintiff’s air space.",The plaintiff claimed damages from overhanging trees on his property. The defendant argued that the trees were part of the natural characteristic of Moose Jaw and that their particular neighbourhood was generally in favour of them. HELD: The plaintiff's claim was dismissed. The court held that an injunction ordering the trees to be removed was beyond the authority of the Small Claims Act. This was clearly a remedy this Court had no jurisdiction to grant. The plaintiff also brought an application to have the opposing parties' counsel disqualified. The issue here was whether this was a case involving the law of private nuisance or a field of liability that focuses on the harm suffered rather than on prohibited conduct. The Court held that both the above noted remedies should be used sparingly.,[18] I am prepared to strike the portion of the Labuick claim with respect to damages from debris falling from the Sykes’ property onto the Labuick property.

The central issue was whether the Agreement was a lease and liquidated damages should be awarded in accordance with clause two, or a conditional sales security agreement whereby the dealer was restricted to repossession and sale by s.46(2) of the Saskatchewan Farm Security Act. HELD: The plaintiff's claim was dismissed with costs on Column 3. 1)The Agreement was a conditional sales contract whereby title was reserved until the defendant elected to make the final payment. The transaction falls within the ambit of the Saskatchewan Farm Security Act and the dealer's right to recover the unpaid purchase price is restricted to repossession and sale. Although the dealer framed the Agreement as a lease the Agreement itself used notions of retail financing and secured party. Nomenclature such as principal, past due interest, conditional sales contract, purchase of equipment, and retail sales contract were used. The construction and interpretation of the nature of the Agreement is a question of law. The Agreement had many attributes of ownership and collectively showed that the defendant acquired a substantial interest in the sprayer. He had possession and unrestricted right to use the sprayer with high base hours. The total payments were equivalent to the total payments under sales contract. The defendant had the option to acquire title by making the final payment. He bore the risk of loss and obligation for maintenance and insurance. 2)The court could not determine whether the option price would be substantially less, equal or more than the June 2002 fair market value of the sprayer. 3)If the Agreement is lease the defendant's consent to give up possession was conditional upon his release from further liability. Case Credit cannot foreclose the entitlement to 40 days notice and take possession of the sprayer by relying upon conditional unwritten consent. To validate early repossession would defeat the intention of the legislation to protect creditors. Case could take possession only in accordance with Part IV of the SFSA. 4)If the Agreement is lease and covered by the SFSA, the defendant would be released from all liability under s.55. It would be unjust to make any further order in a summary trial without the benefit of discoveries or pre-trial conference and without evidence of the fair market value at the time of seizure. 5)If the Agreement is lease and not covered by the SFSA, it would be held that the dealer was not barred by implied acceptance of the condition the defendant be released from further liability because of the exclusionary clause. Judgment would have been granted for $42,089 with costs on Column 3.","The dealer and the defendant farm cooperated in 1997 and 1997. The defendant farm was reduced to 2000 acres in 1997. In 1997, the defendant acquired a sprayer. Its value was agreed to be $94,600. The dealer and defendant entered into a standard form Finance Lease Agreement (FLEA) in 1997, which provided for an advance payment of $9,320 and the same amount by semi-annual installments commencing December 15, 1997 and continuing until December 15 2001. The trade-in was agreed for $23,650. The plaintiff argued it was a lease and that Case Credit's right was restricted to repossession and sale by s. 46(2) of the Saskatchewan Farm Security Act. The evidence was clear that the parties treated the trade-ins as the advance payment even though the value of the trade did not equal the amount of the advance. The agreement was a conditional sales contract whereby title was reserved until the defendant elected to pay the final payment. The central issue was whether the Agreement was a leasing or a security agreement. The parties framed the Agreement as a lease, but the Agreement itself used notions such as retail financing and secured party. The construction and interpretation of the nature of the Agreement is a question of law. The primary incidents of ownership are use of the sprayer for all of its useful life with the obligation to pay a capital cost plus the cost of investment, acquisition of substantial interest in the spray, and loss or gain from unusual depreciation or appreciation of the value. Ergo, the transaction falls within the ambit of the Act and the liquidated damages should be awarded in accordance with clause two. The issues were whether the agreement is a lease or a lease. The issue was the central issue. The plaintiffs claim it is a 'lease' and that it is restricted to the repossession by s.(2) s.46(2). The construction of the agreement was not a question for the court to determine. The Agreement has many of the attributes of ownership and collectively show that Mr. Poirier acquired a substantial interest. The terms of the contract were a 'conditional sales contract' whereby title reserved until Mr. Prentice elected to make the final payments. The Court must be able to ascertain the probable value of a spray in June 2002 and in June 2001, to be paid at Mr. Mr.Poirier's option if he elected to purchase the spray. The termination value was not determined by the anticipated value of new unit. The value of option payment was not","The dealer and Mr. Poirier entered into a standard form Finance Lease Agreement which provided for an ""advance payment"" of $9,320.67 and the same amount by semi-annual installments commencing December 15, 1997, and continuing until December 15, 2001, with the final ""termination value"" payment of $23,650.00 due on June 15, 2002, to be paid at Mr. Poirier's option if he elected to purchase the sprayer.

The Crown sought to admit into evidence a number of statements that were made by the deceased to several crown witnesses concerning two previous incidents she had with the accused in the weeks prior to her death. In the first incident, the accused is alleged to have choked the victim after he confronted her about where she had been. In the second incident the accused confronted the victim and beat and choked her and then sexually assaulted and threatened to kill her. The Crown seeks to admit this similar fact evidence and several hearsay statements to prove the issues of motive, intent and modus operandi. HELD: The statements by the deceased are not admissible. The prejudicial nature of the similar fact evidence has not been overcome by its probative value. It is well established law that similar acts and other discreditable conduct evidence is presumptively inadmissible and that similar fact evidence is the exception to this. To determine its admissibility, three things need examination, 1) the probative weight of the evidence, 2) the assessment of the prejudice and 3) the weighing of the probative value versus prejudicial value. In examining the probative weight of the evidence, factors to be considered include the issues in question, the presence or absence of collusion, similarities and dissimilarities between the facts charged and the similar fact evidence and the strength of the evidence that the events occurred. The two previous incidents are extremely prejudicial in nature leading to potential moral prejudice. That is, reprehensible nature of the assaults could lead the jury to rely on the prohibited inference that the accused is the type of person who could have committed the crime. There is also a great risk of reasoning prejudice. That is, admitting the similar fact evidence may distract the jury from their proper focus which is the second degree murder charge. There is a possibility that the jury will equate the intention to harm with the mens rea required for a murder conviction. With respect to the hearsay evidence, the Court held that statements made by the deceased to her friends, family and colleagues concerning the threats and assaults will not be admitted. The test of necessity is clearly met by the fact that the person making the statements in now deceased and not able to testify. However, the Court was concerned about the reliability of the statements since there is nothing that would serve as convincing indicia of reliability adequate to offset the absence of an oath.",The accused was charged with second degree murder.

Nothing in the union's By-laws precludes the plaintiff from seeking relief from the Courts before making final appeal.","1) In June, 2004, the plaintiff, an employee of the City of Saskatoon and member of the Saskatoon Civic Employees’ Union, CUPE Local No. 59 (hereinafter the “Union”) commenced this action under the simplified procedure of Part 40 of The Queen’s Bench Rules, seeking judgment for $50,000. 2) The plaintiff’s claim is grounded on a provision of the Union’s by-laws which reads:
Article XII - Indemnity Clause
 45) The plaintiff’s application for summary judgment is dismissed. Further, the within action brought by the plaintiff is dismissed, in full.",0.4329268292682926,0.5166666666666667,"The plaintiff is an employee of the City of Saskatoon and member of the Union. He commenced this claim based on the Indemnity Clause contained in the Union's bylaws. The plaintiff asserts he is involved in Union related litigation and is thus entitled to the benefit of the indemnity clause. HELD: The plaintiff's application for summary judgment is dismissed. The within action is dismissed in full. 1) The essential nature of the debate between the plaintiff and the Union relates to the interpretation of the indemnity clause in the Union bylaws. This is precisely the type of internal dispute that is not within the exclusive realm of the Labour Relations Board. The forum for this contest is the Queen's Bench Court and this Court has jurisdiction to entertain his claim under Queen's Bench Rule 485 for summary judgment. 2) The plaintiff represents himself. He has incurred no legal fees, other than disbursements, but he nonetheless asserts that he is entitled to $50,000. The figure of $50,000 is proffered by the plaintiff as an appropriate sum as he expects the defendant has spent at least that much defending all four actions. 3) It is plain and obvious that the plaintiff's claim is grounded on an interpretation of the indemnity clause that is so illogical and inconsistent with its plain wording that it cannot succeed. The plaintiff's claim for reimbursement of costs not incurred is equally incapable of success.","The plaintiff, an employee of the City of Saskatoon and member of the Saskatoon Civic Employees' Union, commenced this action under the simplified procedure of Part 40 of The Queen's Bench Rules seeking judgment for $50,000. The plaintiff asserts he is involved in Union related litigation and is entitled to the benefit of the indemnity clause in the Union's by-laws. The union resists the claim asserting various defences, the primary being that the plaintiff misconstrues and misinterprets the by-law and, more to the point, the Court should decline to become involved in the dispute because the Union is a voluntary association. Exhausting internal remedies The plaintiff sought guidance from the Court of Appeal in McNairn v. United Association of Journeymen and Apprentices of the Plumbing and Pipe Fitting Industry. Rule 485(1) provides that a party may apply with supporting affidavit material either by notice of motion for summary judgment or application for summary trial. HELD: The court found that the dispute was not within the exclusive realm of the Labour Relations Board. The issue was whether the plaintiff was entitled to benefit from an indemnity by the Union in the first, second and third actions. The dispute distills to an interpretation of the terms of the Union membership contract in sum, the very type of debate contemplated by the Supreme Court in Berry v. Pulley. 1) In the absence of a statutory regime precluding the Court's involvement, the debate in the Fourth Action is totally appropriate for disposition by the Court. It is illustrative of the shock and awe litigation strategy employed by the plaintiff. 2) The dispute is, in its essential character, contractual. This is substantially different from an internecine dispute in a voluntary sports organization respecting the disciplining of high school coach over recruiting practices. The analysis in Street v. B.C. School Sports is not germane to the within debate. However, it is worth noting that in that case the Court did exercise supervisory jurisdiction to ensure the process was fair. 3) The plaintiff is engaged in litigation respecting the Union and its members is contractual and is governed by a written set of 'Working Rules and Bylaws' constituting the union's contract between the parties. The Union is the contracting party, the liability of the union is limited to the assets of the individual member and cannot extend to its members personally. 4) The Court is merely upholding the basic term of the membership contract.","1) In June, 2004, the plaintiff, an employee of the City of Saskatoon and member of the Saskatoon Civic Employees’ Union, CUPE Local No. 59 (hereinafter the “Union”) commenced this action under the simplified procedure of Part 40 of The Queen’s Bench Rules, seeking judgment for $50,000. 2) The plaintiff’s claim is grounded on a provision of the Union’s by-laws which reads:

e_2009nssc318.txt,"The mother applied for retroactive support (table amounts and s. 7 expenses) for two adult children. The father resisted the application in relation to the oldest son on the basis that he was no longer a dependant child when it was filed. The evidence showed the son finished university before the application was filed. His graduation took place after, at which time he was already working full time and living with his girlfriend. He lived with his mother for few months because of relationship problems, but later moved back in with the girlfriend. He also received some assistance from his parents when he took time off work to retrain. The father felt the mother's application in relation to the younger son should be limited because of her unreasonable delay in making it. He argued retroactivity should be limited to three years from the date he received the application (months after it was filed). The mother argued formal notice was given when her lawyer sent a letter requesting additional support several years earlier. She asked the court for support retroactive to three years before that date, or longer (based on what she alleged was blameworthy conduct on the father's part). The evidence showed the mother was slow in responding to the father's request for particulars. Despite threatening legal action several times, it took her years to file the application. The wife's application for retroactive support in relation to the oldest son dismissed. He was no longer a child of the marriage when it was filed. He became independent when his schooling finished and he started working and living with his girlfriend.

The mother unreasonably delayed her claim by allowing it to languish for years.

The father did not engage in blameworthy conduct: he made efforts to respond to and settle the mother's claims; he paid a significant level of support; and he reasonably believed he was meeting his obligations. Here, the need for certainty for a payor parent weighs in favour of the father.","The parties were married for seven years and had two children. The respondent argued that the court did not have jurisdiction to grant any relief respecting the older child because the older was not, at the time of the application, a child of the marriage. The parties' corollary relief judgment provided for shared parenting arrangement and equal sharing of all special and extraordinary expenses. The petitioner argued that retroactive support should be limited to three years prior to October 9, 2008. The appellant argued that this was the year the respondent first applied for the change in circumstances and that the respondent should disclose the material change in circumstance to the court. The court did have jurisdiction, however, to deal with the claim for retroactive child support and s.7 expenses for the petitioner's older child. The Court held that the Court had jurisdiction to consider the application of the respondent for retroactivity of child support if any will be calculated for the younger child. It held that jurisdiction was not required to grant the respondent any relief. The issue was whether the respondent had the means to justify his/her obligation to pay child support. The evidence established that the petitioner and her partner took up residence in a downtown Toronto apartment. The trial judge was not blind to prevailing social and economic conditions; bachelor's degree no longer assures self-sufficiency. The issues raised by the petitioner were whether the appellant's obligation to contribute to the support of the younger children was increased, whether the petitioner had a blameworthy conduct conviction, and whether the conduct of the petitioner could be acquitted by buying his/ her child a bicycle. The question was whether there was a sufficient basis for the respondent to make an application for retroactively child support, and if so, what the basis for that application was. The only conclusion was that the appellant had not made a sufficient case for the retroactive award. The fact that the parties' children had not been independent, financially and otherwise from their parents was irrelevant. The matter was whether retroactive payments should be made to the petitioner if the respondent's obligation changed but his payments did not. The applicant's evidence was speculative and conjecture. The judge was unable to provide any other evidence as to the respondent’s financial situation. The respondents’ evidence was not speculative and speculative.","He argued that the court did not have jurisdiction to grant any relief respecting the older child because the older child was not, at the time of the application, a child of the marriage.

e_2009skca138.txt,"This appeal concerns the assessment for municipal purposes of a building located in the City of Regina and used commercially as an enclosed shopping mall. The building was assessed in each of the years 2003 and 2004 on the basis of its 'fair value' as determined by the City Assessor. The owner of the building, the corporate appellant, was dissatisfied with the Assessor's determination of fair value and appealed the assessment to the local Board of Revision, then to the Assessment Appeals Committee of the Saskatchewan Municipal board. The appeals were allowed in part, but the corporate appellant remained dissatisfied. It applied for leave to appeal to this Court pursuant to s. 33.1 of The Municipal Board Act. The issues on appeal all relate to the determination of the fair value of the building and, more particularly, to the market adjustment factor used in that determination. The grounds take issue one way or another with the inclusion of the sales of the Southland and Victoria Square Malls in the array of sales from which the MAF was derived, or alternatively, with the adjustment of the sale price of these properties. HELD: Appeal dismissed. The appeal in relation to the treatment of the sale of the Victoria Square Mall fails, as does the appeal concerning the sale of the Southland Mall. The Court notes that other companies, owning or operating similar malls, also took issue with their 2003 and 2004 assessments. They, too, appealed to the Board of Revision and then to the Assessment Appeals Committee. They too were granted leave to appeal to this Court on the same grounds as the appellant in this case. Counsel for the companies agreed to treat this appeal as representative of the other appeals and to be bound by the result of this appeal. These other appeals are also dismissed.","The appellant company sought and obtained information relating to the sale of a shopping mall. The company was dissatisfied with the City Assessor's determination of the fair value of the property and appealed the assessment to the local Board of Revision, then to the Assessment Appeals Committee. The Committee did not reach the conclusion that the sale was an arm's length sale, as the sale price did not reflect typical market value transactions as required by the adjustment provisions of the Assessment Manual. The appellant company appealed its 2003 assessment. The appeal was dismissed on several grounds alleging error of law on the part of the Committee. HELD: Appeal dismissed. 1) The Committee failed to misapprehend the importance, generally, of the sale verification process and the information it yields. The importance lies in the fact municipal assessors are highly dependent on this information in the performance of their assessment duties and are called upon to make number of decisions largely on the basis of fact that emerges through this process, process provided for by sections 171 and 172 of The Cities Act. Nor was the Committee convinced the Committee had erred in relation to the determination of a sale price. 2) The committee did not misappreciate the importance of the sales verification process. The committee failed to take into account the importance the sale's information and the accuracy of the information provided by the parties to the transaction. The fact that Cadillac Fairview transferred an undivided one half interest in the mall to the appellant company was not a material error. The assessment of the Normanview Mall came to rest on the City assessor's determination and application of the Sale Verification Information. The sale price was determined by the City's assessment of its fair value. The City's decision to transfer the remaining interest in a shopping centre was not based on the sale sale price but rather on the assessment of a mall. 3) The assessment was based on a single sale price and the sale value was determined using the sale sales of four enclosed shopping malls. The city's decision was based upon the sale prices of the four enclosed malls. 4) The appeal to the assessor was dismissed. The Court was not persuaded that the Committee erred. The court was not convinced that the committee erred when it concluded that the City had not properly considered the sale. The issue was whether the Committee's conclusions were correct. The evidence presented in the form of the Sales Agreement for the mall was not part of that sale. 5) The Court found that the assessment was not in error.","Disposition: Appeal Dismissed

He did not remain at the scene of the collision. He admitted consuming alcohol and striking the victim. Romania charged him with criminally negligent homicide and leaving the scene. The respondent appealed the decision of the Romanian court, which overturned the sentence of his previous conviction. The appellant appealed the sentence and the trial judge sentenced him to 12 years imprisonment. The trial judge in Saskatoon found that the appellant had not committed any crimes and the appellant's current circumstances did not raise the risk of his non-appearance. The application was dismissed. The court found that there was insufficient evidence to support the appellant’s claim for a judicial interim detention. The petitioner’ s. 43 statement was not frivolous and the court found the respondent’d submissions to be not frivolous. The issue was whether the appellant should be released from custody pending the Minister’S decision on his surrender to Romania. The Court found that it would be non-sensical for the appellant to flee prior to the Minister making his decision on surrender. The appeal court judge also found that his appeal was not motivated by the appellant. The Crown conceded that the petitioner had met this low threshold.

The applicant offered surety from the Romania community in Saskatchewan who did not appear to have known the accused for long and offered to put up his car as bond. The applicant had common law spouse in Saskatchewan but owned no real property. HELD: Although the Crown conceded that the applicant had met the relatively low threshold of showing that his application for leave to appeal his extradition order was not frivolous, the Court of Appeal declined to release the applicant. The Court of Appeal held that there is an elevated risk of flight in light of the fact that the applicant has exhausted all appeals in Romania and is facing a 3 year prison sentence. Canada's international obligations in extradition proceedings require the Court to look more severely at the risk of non-appearance than it would if the application was made solely under s. 679 in respect of criminal proceeding in Canada.
