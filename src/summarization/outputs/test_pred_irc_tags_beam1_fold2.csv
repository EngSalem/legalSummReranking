1993canlii3174.txt,"This was an appeal from a decision varying the appellant's maintenance downwards. The parties had a traditional marriage, with the wife remaining at home and caring for their three children. Upon separation, they entered into a settlement agreement whereby maintenance was set al. $2000 monthly while the appellant remained in the matrimonial home. The agreement stipulated that the settlement was a full and final settlement on all corollary matters between the parties. The respondent subsequently remarried, underwent some difficult financial times and made the application which was the subject of this appeal. The appellant contended the terms of the agreement were final. Per Jones, J.A. and Chipman, J.A. (concurring for separate reasons), allowing the appeal and setting aside the lower court order, that while courts have ultimate jurisdiction in the matter of support, settlement agreements must be respected. There is no difference between an agreement which provides for long term maintenance and one that does not contain such a provision. The effect is to permanently settle the issue in both cases. To review the agreement, particularly after the lapse of a substantial period of time, could lead to grave injustices to one or both parties. Per Hallett, J.A., (dissenting), dismissing the appeal, that a settlement agreement which provides for periodic support payments indefinitely is very different than one which contains provisions for termination of support after a specified period. The causal connection test established in Pelech v. Pelech (1987), 38 D.L.R. (4th) 641, should not apply to payors of periodic support for an indefinite period. Such agreements do not have the degree of finality that was effected by the settlement agreement under consideration in the Pelech decision.","This was an appeal from a decision of Hall, L.J.S.C. reducing the appellant's support from $2,000 to $1200. The appellant had been married for 18 months and had remarried. The parties separated in 1983. The respondent had remitted $28,760. over 13 months to the appellant. The wife had not worked during the marriage and had not any specific skills. The marriage was now in crisis. The court was concerned that the respondent's income was declining and that he was unable to work as hard as he did previously. The Court was concerned with the effect of a valid and enforceable settlement agreement on the Court's discretionary power under s. 11(2) to vary maintenance orders. The appeal should be allowed."

The Court of Appeal had ordered the Crown to produce an itemized inventory of the information in its possession to enable the Queen's Bench to review the information the Crown should disclose to the defence. This fiat concerned several documents. The Crown had already disclosed the contents of each of these documents and the only matter remaining in issue was the name of the lawyer who released the information. This arose as a result of the action of a Regina lawyer who had improperly revealed information from two of his divorce clients with respect to the charges against LaPorte et al. The Crown quite properly disclosed these statements which had been conveyed to the investigating officer. HELD: It was not necessary to reveal the name of the solicitor and, therefore, unless the Crown intended to call the informant solicitor as a witness, his name was not to be disclosed.","FIAT. The only matters reserved were the names of the Crown's solicitor and the lawyer who released the information. The Crown had already disclosed the contents of the solicitor's memorandum and the names and addresses of the defence counsel. The solicitor had not been called as a witness. HELD: The Crown ordered production of the report. 1)The contents of this report are marginally relevant and as there is no legal reason why they should not be disclosed, the Crown ordered their production. 2)The solicitor's name was not to be disclosed."

1994canlii4195.txt,"The defendants applied at the opening of the trial for dismissal alleging the plaintiffs had been misleading and had deliberately failed to disclose important information. Dismissing the application, that while the plaintiffs had failed to comply with Civil Procedure Rule 20.07, dismissal of the action was not warranted. The plaintiff was held liable for solicitor-client costs associated with the application and discoveries.","The plaintiff sought dismissal of the action pursuant to Rule 20.09. The plaintiff alleged that the defendant had deprived its interest in a fishing vessel, Sealife III, and the contribution to overhead and profit margin which that vessel would have made to the plaintiff's seafood plant by its landings. The defendant argued that the weight of the fish received at the plant was not relevant to the calculation of the value of the landings and that the only record of the weight was from the plant. The defendants argued that they had made a reasonable effort to produce the scales and that they were not used to calculate the value. The plaintiffs argued that there was a pattern to the scales used by the defendants and that it was not appropriate to have them in the plant because the weight information was not available to the fishermen. The evidence showed that the scales were kept in the truck and were not kept in a warehouse. The court found that the plaintiff had not made any effort to obtain the information requested by the defendant. The Court found that there were inconsistencies in the methods used by both parties. The only record that the defendants had produced was the one that was not produced. The discovery evidence showed the defendant's failure to make a reasonable attempt to produce a record of weight of fish received. The fact that the evidence was not obtained by the parties' experts and that there had been no record of fish actually being weighed at the plaintiff plant was significant. The failure of the defendant to provide the necessary information was a serious issue."

The Crown appealed. HELD: Appeal allowed. The sentence neither reflected the seriousness of the offences nor provided adequate deterrence. The 2 new sentences totalling 2 years were made consecutive to the remaining term of 18 months as well as to each other.","The accused was sentenced to a one year in closed custody for two armed robberies. He had escaped from the youth centre serving out a two year term of closed custody. He was convicted of the robberies. The Crown appealed the sentence.

The sentence did not meet either the interests of rehabilitation or the requirements of deterrence. An additional 6 month period of secure custody for these armed robberies did not satisfy either the requirements for re-habilitation or the requirement of deterrence and the court found that the sentence did meet the requirements."

Changes in circumstances included the fact that the child was developmentally delayed and required a special program. A pediatrician testified that inconsistency in parenting approaches would further delay the child's development. HELD: Custody was awarded to the father. 1)Each parent was a capable caregiver. However, the father was available to provide full-time care due to an employment disability and exhibited a strong desire to do so. The past physical abuse of his former spouse was not considered relevant as it did not affect his ability to parent the child. 2)The mother was to have weekly access on two non-consecutive days for eight hours and two hours on a third day.

1997canlii11078.txt,"The applicant sought to be appointed as property guardian for his uncle pursuant to s19 of the Dependent Adults Act. The proposed dependent adult resisted the application and attributed his previous difficulty managing his affairs to a severe drinking problem but indicated that he had not been drinking for six years. The uncle had never been declared incompetent to manage his affairs. He voluntarily transferred the land left to him by his father and had allowed the trust arrangement to continue since 1951. Over the years, the land was transferred from the original trustees to various other family members and was presently registered in the name of the applicant nephew. There was no dispute that the uncle was the beneficial owner.HELD: The land was vested directly in the name of Selwyn Hand. The conditional stay in place pending the resolution of this application for the appointment of a property guardian was lifted. 1)The proposed dependent adult was capable of managing a significant portion of his business affairs and matters relating to his estate and property. However he required significant independent assistance in the management of the land held for his benefit. His suggestions and proposal to sell the land and travel were reasonable and financially modest. 2)The criteria set forth in s18 for the appointment of a property guardian was met and the Public Trustee was appointed to administer the balance of the proceeds from the land sale remaining after the uncle pursued his financial commitments and his dreams.  3)Costs in the amount of $7,000 were to be paid to the applicant in the event the uncle chose to sell his land. 4)Any proposed sale would be subject to the approval of the Court upon application of Hand. One half of the proceeds were to be provided directly to Hand to be dealt with as he chooses and the remaining half were to be administered by the Public Trustee in his longer term best interests according to the normal powers and procedures of that office.","The applicant sought the appointment of the property guardian for a dependent adult.

1998canlii13596.txt,"Administrative Law - Judicial Review - Bias/Institutional BiasAdministrative Law - Medical Care Insurance - Medical Fees - Repayment - AppealProfessions and Occupations - Physicians and Surgeons - Cardiologist - Medical Fees_____ A cardiologist appealed an order made against him by the Joint Medical Professional Review Committee for repayment of  $207,821.03 in medical fees he received over a fifteen month period from the Medical Care Insurance Branch (MCIB). Alleged errors of law included improperly placing the burden of proof on the doctor; failing to take into account all relevant factors including the doctor's statistical analysis; considering it beyond his mandate to provide cost effective services in keeping patients out of the hospital; by using and relying on the knowledge of the Committee in preference to the expert evidence; the orders made concerning various medical services were not reasonably supported by the evidence. The numerous grounds of appeal also included breach of the rules of natural justice by reason of a lack of institutional independence. The application under Part 52 of the Rules of Court for a judicial review was brought to determine whether there was a reasonable apprehension of bias raised by the statutory roles of the Committee and Director or lack of institutional impartiality of the Committee or its lack of independence from the Director or MCIB. _____ HELD: The judicial review application was dismissed. The appeal was allowed and the repayment orders were set aside except for the orders respecting surcharges. 1)Natural justice issues: A reasonable apprehension of bias or institutional bias were not proven. The Committee provided adequate written reasons for its decision. The chairman refuted the allegations that the Committee heard and relied on evidence outside the presence the appellant about which he was not advised. Neither the Director nor the Committee acted in a prosecutorial fashion. Examples included the adjournment granted when the appellant failed to attend and the concession to his request that no cardiologist be placed on the Committee. 2)Errors of law issues: The statistical evidence could be considered by the Committee as a prima facie case. It was then open for it to call on the doctor to rebut the presumed departure from an acceptable pattern of medical practice. This did not shift the overall burden of proof to the doctor nor did it require him to prove his pattern of medical practice was acceptable to the Committee. The Committee did not err in law in misconstruing its mandate or by ignoring the statistical analysis presented by the appellant whose definition of the mandate was much narrower than envisaged by the legislation. It was not agreed that the Committee is not bound to follow the rules of evidence and the proceedings were of an investigative nature. The phrase 'balance of probabilities' means 'more likely than not'. To hold otherwise would make nonsense of administrative law and would violate the rules of natural justice. The distinction between the pattern of the doctor's billings and the pattern of his medical practice was more a matter of semantics than substance. If economics were the only consideration the review process would be a useless exercise and the statistical comparative evidence would be conclusive of the issue. There was no credible evidence that the members of  the Committee misused their expertise and relied on it rather than determining the issues from the evidence presented. 3)The appellant established that for the most part the decision of the Committee was not reasonably supported by but was contrary to the evidence. The MCIB statistics were flawed as a reliable comparison tool and the appellant's adjusted statistics were more reliable even if based on estimates rather than substantiated data. The appellant's medical practice was unique in three respects. He did not have hospital privileges and  had staff and diagnostic equipment equivalent to a cardiac care unit in the hospital; he ordered more diagnostic tests and did more follow up than other cardiologists and had extended office hours. 4)The decision of the Committee was varied to quash all repayment orders except for $14,239.76. The appellant admitted that many of the surcharges had been billed because of his erroneous interpretation of the tariff.  5)Leave was granted to bring the issue of costs back for determination if necessary.","The cardiologist appealed an order made by the Joint Medical Professional Review Committee (JMPRC) that he repay $207,821.03 in medical fees he received over a fifteen month period from the Medical Care Insurance Branch. The Committee alleged that there was a reasonable apprehension of bias raised by the roles of the Director of Professional Review and the Committee assigned to them by the Act. The Director of the JMPRC argued that the statistics were unreliable and that his billings to medicare were out of line with the billings by the other cardiologists in Saskatchewan. The director of the review committee also applied under Part 52 of the Rules of Court for a judicial review of the proceedings. HELD: The appeal was allowed. 1)The Committee made the following errors of law: the Committee heard and relied on evidence outside the presence of the appellant, and it refused to advise the appellant of such. 2)The Director of professional review raised a reasonable suspicion of institutional bias. The lack of institutional independence raised a reasonably reasonable apprehension that institutional bias raised.  3)The Court reviewed the case law and found that the Committee made errors of the law. The committee made the errors of omission by improperly placing the burden of proof on the appellant and the Director and the committee in preference to the uncontroverted expert evidence.  4)The court found that there were reasonable apprehension and institutional independence of the Committee."

The insure denied liability on the policy alleging the plaintiff deliberately started the fire or caused it to be started. HELD: The plaintiff's claim was dismissed. 1)When the evidence of the three independant witnesses was considered, the defendant insurer met the onus referred to Grover Holdings and established that the fire was deliberately set. While there was no direct evidence to establish the plaintiff set the fire himself, the inference was drawn that he did or, in the alternative, caused someone else to do so.  2)Had the plaintiff been in the mobile home he should have been suffering to some degree from carbon monoxide poisoning, he should have been coughing, his hair should have been singed, he would have had soot on his face and his clothes would have smelled of smoke. 3)The plaintiff did not call evidence to rebut the fire investigator's opinion that a significant quantity of fire accelerant had been used nor was his brother called to confirm his testimony that he attempted to re-enter the mobile home after arranging for the fire department to be called.","The defendant claimed responsibility for the fire. The plaintiff's residence, mobile home and contents were insured with the defendant. The defendant claimed that the plaintiff intentionally started the fire or caused it to be started. The evidence of three independent witnesses was also found to be suspect. The Defendant met the onus referred to in the Grover Holding case and established that the fire was deliberately set.

1998canlii3382.txt,"The appellant employer and the respondent union are parties to a collective agreement with effect from January 1, 1994 to December 31, 1996. The collective agreement established employee salaries for that period, with annual adjustments on January 1st of each year. Shortly before the agreement was signed, the Public Sector Compensation Act was passed, which rolled back and froze public sector salaries. In a letter to the union, the employer confirmed the wage increases provided for in the agreement would be paid to the employees as a lump sum following the expiration of the legislated wage freeze. After the expiration of the wage freeze, however, the employer refused to pay the lump sum on the grounds that it would contravene the Act. The union sued the employer in the Supreme Court, claiming the lump sum or, in the alternative, damages for negligent misrepresentation. The employer applied to strike the Statement of Claim on the grounds that the union's claims were within the exclusive jurisdiction of an arbitrator. The Chambers judge dismissed the application. The employer appealed. Allowing the appeal and staying the action pending submission to arbitration as provided for in the collective agreement, that the Chambers judge erred in allowing the action to continue. Where there is a doubt about the arbitrability of a dispute, that issue should generally be determined at arbitration. This reflects the central role of arbitration in collective bargaining labour relations, recognizes that arbitration is the forum best suited to conducting the necessary inquiry, and helps ensure that no one, absent sound reasons, will be left with rights but no effective remedy.",The appellant and respondent union entered into a collective agreement in 1994. The collective agreement establishes employee salaries for that period. The employer sought to strike the union's statement of claim on the ground that the claims were within the exclusive jurisdiction of an arbitrator. The respondent appealed. Appeal allowed; the court ordered the action to be stayed pending submission to arbitration as provided for the in the collective agreement. The appellant appealed. The court found that the collective agreements have an exclusive jurisdiction and that the arbitrator's power to determine whether a matter is arbitrable is limited to the scope of the collective bargaining agreement. Appeal permitted; the Court ordered the matter to be held pending submission of arbitration as required by the in-laws.
1999skqb142.txt,"FIAT. The former registered representative of TFPG was terminated for selling unapproved investments in breach of a Shareholder Advisor Agreement which permitted the sale of TFPG's financial products and services only. TFPG sought an interim mandatory injunction requiring the respondent to return all materials and files respecting TFPG's clients, to cease any contact with its clients, and to make no attempt to solicit any current or prospective client. HELD: The respondent was ordered to immediately cease all contact with TFPG clients whose account the respondent, or anyone associated with him, had administered with a view to soliciting or directing a client, affiliate or associate away from TFPG. The restriction would not prevent a client or prospective client from engaging in any business with the respondent nor was he prevented from advertising his services. 1)It was agreed that the respondent should return all of TFPG's files and materials with a right to make and keep a copy.  2)TFPG abandoned the relief sought respecting solicitation of any business of any nature similar to that of TFPG from any TFPG client or prospective client. 3)The agreement merely set out the terms both parties agreed to for valuable consideration. It was not unconscionable nor against public policy. The respondent had warranted that he had an opportunity to seek independent legal advice prior to signing the agreement. The applicant met the test for injunctive relief but the relief as set out in the draft order was too restrictive and denied others freedom of choice as to which party they wished to deal with. 4)A contractual right to injunctive relief is only one factor. The applicant must establish that the right to interlocutory injunction is clear; there is a serious question to be tried and a strong prima facie case; that irreparable harm will result; if there is a doubt as to whether there is an adequate remedy in damages there must be a determination, on a balance of convenience, which party is likely to suffer a greater harm.","FIAT. The plaintiff sought an interim mandatory injunction requiring the defendant to deliver up to TFPG, or its authorized representative, all files, documents, statements of account, records, plans, software or other TFPGs related material respecting clients of TFPGB. The defendant refused to turn over its property and client files. HELD: The order was granted. The issues were resolved in paragraph (ii) of the draft order. The respondent was registered representative of the applicant and entered into a Shareholder Advisor Agreement whereby the respondent agreed he would sell and represent only the applicant's financial products and services which the applicant approved. In exchange for this the respondent received commissions from the applicant. The applicant claims the respondent continues to refuse to turn the applicant’s property and clients files. The court found that the provision for an injunction was important in its influence upon an exercise of the discretionary power of the court to grant an injunction. The order also required that the defendant make and keep copies of the documents turned over to the applicant, and that the applicant make no attempt, either direct or indirect, with those clients of the said account. The injunction was too restrictive and denied other individuals freedom of choice as to which party they wish to deal with on their investments."

She also stated that just prior to this she was awakened by the feeling of someone touching her vagina. The accused was charged with sexual assault and sexual touching of the complainant., accused found not guilty; the complainant's testimony was internally inconsistent and her cross-examination revealed obvious errors which were never corrected to rehabilitate her credit.

She later awoke and felt something inside her pyjamas, about her vaginalarea, about the vaginal area, about where she had been sleeping and touched the complainant. The complainant did not recognize the accused's name and did not object. The Court found that the complainant was not conscious of her immediate surroundings.

2003skqb248.txt,"An appeal from conviction and sentence for theft of an electricity generator valued at under $5,000 contrary to Criminal Code s.334(b). On the first appearance in October, 2001, the Crown advised it would proceed by summary conviction. The appellant pled not guilty. Defence argued that, in the absence of evidence to the contrary, it should be inferred that the accused acquiesced or implicitly consented to proceeding by way of summary conviction. Counsel agreed pursuant to s.786(2) to proceed by way of summary conviction and invited the court to treat the agreement as having been in place when the trial began. Both preferred the appeal to be heard in this Court or in the Court of Appeal. The appellant sought to have the conviction set aside on the grounds the verdict was unreasonable and not supported by the evidence; the trial judge failed to properly apply the doctrine of recent possession and did not provide adequate reasons for his decision. HELD: The conviction appeal was dismissed.  1)This Court had jurisdiction to entertain the appeal. The Provincial Court judge had jurisdiction as the trial proceedings did not violate s.786(2). 2)The trial judge did not misconstrue nor misapplied the doctrine of recent possession. The unexplained recent possession of stolen goods standing alone will permit, but not necessarily require, an inference that the possessor was the person who stole the goods. The elements of recent possession must be strictly proven if possession is the only evidence connecting the accused with the theft. Otherwise possession should be considered circumstantial evidence and weighed accordingly. There was no palpable and manifest or overriding error made by the trial judge in weighing the evidence.  3)Criminal Code s.687 appears to permit this Court to set aside the 9 month suspended sentence and to grant a conditional or absolute discharge. However, there was no transcript of the sentencing proceedings except for a few lines. If the transcript is not available, this Court may be reconvened to address the applicability of s.687 and whether it would be appropriate to vacate the sentence and embark on the sentencing process afresh.","HELD: The appeal was dismissed. The Court found that the trial judge in the Provincial Court did not err in his decision regarding the jurisdiction of the Provincial court to proceed with the trial. The appellant argued on the appeal that the question of the jurisdiction was limited to the range of sentencing upon conviction. The trial judge did not correctly state that the Crown was proceeding by summary conviction. Therefore, the Court allowed the appeal and set aside the sentence. The appeal should be allowed in the Court of Appeal. The court found that it did not have jurisdiction to proceed by summary trial."
2005nsca64.txt,"The chambers judge refused to grant an adoption to a single mother of her own daughter as he determined that the child would not gain anything vis a vis the mother by such an adoption but would lose the potential for a relationship and support from her father. The evidence before the chambers judge was meagre but showed that the father had not seen the child for the past four years. The mother appealed., appeal dismissed; the chambers judge focused on the best interests of the child and did not fail to give appropriate consideration to the factors set out in the Act. He did not place too much emphasis on the child's loss of a potential relationship with and support from the father on the facts of this case.","The single mother appealed the November 2004 decision of the Children and Family Services Act judge refusing to grant her the adoption she sought with respect to her four year old daughter. The appellant argued the decision was biased in favour of the appellant and her father. The chambers judge did not take into account the neutral impact the adoption would have on the child's relationship with her father and the child, and instead placed too much emphasis on irrelevant factors in his determination of whether it was in the best interests of the child. Appeal dismissed; the appellant did not satisfy on the meagre facts; the chambers judge failed to take into consideration the applicable enumerated factors in s.3(2) of the Act in determining whether the proposed adoption was in best interests. The court found that the appellant's evidence before the chambers court was the usual documentation provided to the Minister of Community Services as required by s.76(1) of The Children andFamily Services Act. The Court found that without the adoption the child would continue to be in exactly the same position in terms of her relationship with the appellant whether the adoption is granted or not. The adoption will not change that relationship."
2006skqb189.txt,"FIAT: The issues on this application are with respect to extraordinary expenses and the quantum of spousal support. HELD: 1) The petitioner's income is $73,000 versus $29,000 for the respondent. The parties cannot agree if any of the expenses fall into s. 7 of the Guidelines as being extraordinary: $975 for child care, $500 for dance, $350 for school activities, and $1,140 for asthma medication. 2) The court does not believe that the 'reasonable coverage' definition contained in the May 1, 2006 amendment is new law. At best, it is a single test now enunciated in legislative form which should provide for more consistency and predictability as opposed to the many attempts to articulate a definition of extraordinary which is found in the case law. What items claimed are necessary to attain the child's best interests and yet are reasonable given the economic circumstances of the child and her parents? Which items might be reasonably covered by the sum of the parent's income plus child support? 2) The child care costs and asthma medication costs are of sufficient amount and peculiar to this child as to be extraordinary or not expected to be reasonably covered from the table amount of child support and the respondent's income.  3) With respect to spousal support, neither counsel referred to the spousal support guidelines and the formula for spouses with children which measures the difference between the individual net disposable incomes of each former spouse. These guidelines suggest that an award of between 40% to 46% of that difference in individual net disposable income be paid by the spouse with the higher INDI to the former spouse with the lower INDI. These guidelines create a rough ballpark of $900 to $1,100 per month in this particular case. However, the petitioner is bearing the full responsibility for family debt repayment in the interim. In order to pay creditors in a timely fashion, the petitioner has taken this responsibility onto his shoulders. In the circumstances, it is ordered that the petitioner pay to the respondent interim spousal support of $700. The consequent reduction of family debt is therefore a factor of this particular interim spousal support order and should not cause confusion when addressing any property issue in the future.","FIAT.

The petitioner is bearing the full responsibility for family debt repayment in the interim. HELD: The respondent is ordered to pay interim spousal support of $700 per month. 1) The childcare costs and asthma medication costs are of sufficient amount and peculiar to the child as to be extraordinary or not expected to be reasonably covered from the table amount of child support and the respondent's income. The consequent reduction of family debt is a factor of this particular interim spouse support order and should not cause confusion when addressing any property issues in the future. 2) The respondent was ordered to provide interim spousesal support in the sum of $800 per month commencing April 1, 2006 and on the first day of each and every month hereafter until further order.  3) The petitioner was ordered pay to the respondent $625 per month and 71% of special or extraordinary expenses as hereafter described."
2006skqb462.txt,"FIAT: In October 2005, a referendum was held within the student body of the University of Saskatchewan to determine whether the University of Saskatchewan Students Union should join the Canadian Federation of Students and its related corporation, the Canadian Federation of Students-Services. The result favoured joining the federation. The applicant applies under The Non-Profit Corporations Act, 1995 seeking sundry relief, the net result of which would set aside the outcome of the referendum. HELD: 1) The test emanating from the Controverted elections cases are not applicable. In debates of this type, the preferred guidance is from the test articulated in Walton (Litigation Guardian of) v. Saskatchewan Hockey Association and the related cases dealing with non-profit organizations. In those cases, the Court does not ask itself whether the results have been skewed, but rather has the organization acted in good faith and generally in accord with the concepts of natural justice? This does not mean that there must be an exacting legal process or an application of the full 'panoply' of procedural natural justice issues. The question is has the organization acted in a fashion that meets the legitimate expectations of a fair-minded observer? 2) No reasonable observer could conclude that the USC approached the post-vote process in good faith or in a fashion that is in harmony with the broad rules of natural justice. When faced with a result (rendered by a procedure which it had specifically established for the referendum) which was not consistent with its wishes, the USC simply ignored its own rules and imposed its own preordained outcome. Accordingly, the Court concluded that the USC breached its obligation to act in good faith and conducted itself in a fashion inconsistent with natural justice. The applicant is entitled to a portion of the relief he seeks. The referendum held by the USSU on the issue of whether it should join the CFS is of no force or effect.","FIAT. In October 2005 a referendum was held within the student body of the University of Saskatchewan to determine if the University OF Saskatchewan Students Union should join the Canadian Federation of Students and its related corporation, The Canadian Federation Of Students-Services. The result favoured joining the federation. The applicant applies under The Non-Profit Corporations Act, 1995, seeking sundry relief, the net result of which would set aside the outcome of the referendum. HELD: 1) An order pursuant to s. 135(2)(b) of The Non Profit Corporations act, 1995 declaring the referendum to be of no force or effect is granted. 2) An application by the applicant to add CFS as a party to the application is dismissed. 3) The applicant has another barrier which he cannot clear. He convocated from the University in the spring of 2006. As this matter was argued in September 2006, he is no longer member of the USSU, nor is he director. The respondent has found that it could not ratify the result, given what it sees as a seriously flawed referendum process. 4) The respondent is not a party. The court has jurisdiction to deal with this issue. 5) The court is not obliged to add the respondent as a third party. It is not necessary to address those complaints. 6) The application to strike portions of the affidavits submitted by the respondent is academic given the relief available to the applicant under s. 225. Section 225 addresses an application by a complainant. The complainant is defined in s. 222 and can be former director. It would be counterintuitive not to add a party as a result of this application. The Court is not required to decide what approach it should take in the context of overturning a vote. 7) The Court has jurisdiction in the circumstances to deal directly with the respondent's application. 8) The respondents have a common ground that it would be a mistake not to include CFS in the application. 9) The applicants have another barrier that they cannot clear: the respondent has another obstacle which they cannot get clear. The respondents are not the only party. 10) The applications to strike the offending portions of affidavits are academic given that the respondents have another obstacle that they can't clear. It will be an error, and clear misreading of the Act to provide an expansive definition of election so as to encompass a referendum by non-profit corporation seeking membership in a third-party. The application by CFS to add an additional party is discretionary."
2006skqb536.txt,"The primary issue is whether the plaintiff, the owner of certain farm equipment consigned for sale at unreserved auction, has indirectly allowed another individual to bid on its behalf, or for its own benefit. The plaintiff corporation agreed to sell its entire inventory of farm equipment at unreserved auction for a guaranteed return of $577,500. The guarantee was given by the defendant corporate auctioneers (Ritchie). The auction was to be conducted by the defendant corporate auctioneers (LeBlanc), a newly formed division of Ritchie. After the auction sale was concluded, the defendant refused to pay the plaintiff the guaranteed price. The defendant declared the guarantee unenforceable under provisions of the 'Contract to Auction' and ultimately charged the plaintiff a commission of 14% on the gross proceeds. The defendant alleges that the plaintiff indirectly allowed another individual to bid on its behalf or for its own benefit. HELD: 1) Clause 3.07 of the Contract to Auction prohibits an owner from bidding directly or indirectly, and from allowing any other person to bid on his behalf. The issue here is whether the plaintiff allowed a family member to bid for the plaintiff's benefit. A family member can be a bona fide purchaser as well as anyone else, but the nature of an unreserved auction dictate that such relationships be disclosed to the public. The essence of the problem and the underlying purpose behind clause 3.07 is to protect bona fide bidders, and to ensure that there be no surreptitious bidding by another for the owner's benefit. 2) The plaintiff allowed Mr. Caruk to bid at the sale for the plaintiff's benefit. It went beyond the passive act of allowing him to bid. It actively facilitated bidding. Mr. Caruk acknowledged he had no money to buy equipment. The plaintiff lent him up to $100,000 for that express purpose. It is immaterial that the loan came from Mr. Tkachuk personally rather than from the plaintiff company he controls and directs. The plaintiff corporation benefited. It has leased all its cattle to Mr. Caruk and the equipment will be of significant value to the fulfillment of that contract. 'For the benefit of the owner' does not have to mean for the exclusive benefit of the owner. 3) The undisclosed arrangement between Mr. Tkatchuk and Mr. Caruk gave the nephew a significant advantage at auction. That advantage was magnified by the fact that he possessed insider information. He knew his uncle had a guaranteed price from Ritchie's for the equipment, because that information had been imparted to him by his uncle. All one needs to add is that Mr. Tkachuk would have profited very significantly had his arrangement with the nephew gone undiscovered. He would have secured a guaranteed price, while procuring the commercial advantages of having his cattle lease fulfilled using equipment the nephew could not otherwise have afforded to purchase. 4) In an area such as this where bona fides are of fundamental importance, and particularly where an owner has the advantage of a guaranteed price from the auctioneer, a deliberate non-disclosure of material information can have an impact every bit as significant as a deliberate and obvious misrepresentation. The plaintiff should have disclosed the arrangement with Mr. Caruk to the defendants. In not doing so, and in allowing and enabling Mr. Caruk to bid at the auction, the plaintiff breached clause 3.07.  5) The provision for a 14% commission on the gross proceeds of sale as a consequence of breach of a fundamental term of the contract is not extravagant or unconscionable and, as the defendants pointed out, they did not elect to exercise their conjunctive right in clause 4.05 to additional amounts as liquidated damages. The concluding paragraph would have entitled them, in addition to all other rights and remedies, to re-sell the property acquired by Mr. Caruk and to retain an amount equal to 20% of the proceeds realized. The provision for a 14% commission on the gross proceeds of sale does not constitute a penalty. 6) The defendants' claim solicitor and client costs pursuant to clause 4.03 of the contract. The defendants are prima facie entitled to costs on a solicitor and client basis, but in the circumstances there are issues whether they should be restricted to one set of costs, and other issues relating to appropriate quantum. The issue of costs will be assessed by this Court pursuant to Rule 565, with the defendants serving and filing a draft bill in the form required for a solicitor and client bill, an affidavit of disbursements, and written argument. The plaintiff shall have 14 days to reply. 7) The plaintiff will have a judgment against the defendants in the amount of $1,316.64 representing the power washing bill wrongfully deducted from the auction sale proceeds payable to the plaintiff. In all other respects, the plaintiff's action is dismissed with costs.","The plaintiff agreed to sell its entire inventory of farm equipment at an unreserved auction for a guaranteed return of $577,500. The defendant agreed to supply the plaintiff with a guarantee that the plaintiff would pay the plaintiff commission of 14% on the gross proceeds of sale. The plaintiff was also seeking to obtain a share of the proceeds of the sale from a third party. The defendants proceeded to advertise the auction as a share acquisition, such that the defendant became wholly owned subsidiary of Ritchie Bros. The contract between the plaintiff and the defendants was apparently a share purchase, such the plaintiff had actually been paid in full, and the plaintiff was first approached to become a potential customer. The contractual negotiations between the defendant and the plaintiffs generated two standard form agreements, preliminary 'LeBlanc' contract dated December 23, 2003 and subsequent 'Ritchie Bros.' contract dated March 28, 2004. The first issue was whether clause 4.05, and its 14% commission rate, amounts to penalty clause, and whether the plaintiff should be relieved of its consequences. HELD: The plaintiff's action was dismissed. The court found that the contract was not in breach of any of the provisions of the previous contract. The only breach was that the defendants had not provided the plaintiff the necessary financial support to complete the auction. The second issue was the issue of whether the defendant had indirectly allowed another individual to bid on its behalf, or for its own benefit. The Court found that there were no breaches of the contract between plaintiff and defendant. The breach was not the result of any breach of the prior contract."
2008nssc310.txt,"Despite the court's finding of no clear winner and that both parties had contributed to the circumstances that led to the trial, the plaintiff sought costs on the basis that the defendant had refused its offer to settle. Each party will bear their own costs; the court had no confidence that any offer made by either party, short of 100 per cent vindication, could have resolved the case in advance of trial.","The plaintiff brought a counterclaim against the defendant. The defendant sought to recover costs and the plaintiff recovered $64,147.85. The court held that both parties contributed to the length of the trial, the complexities of the issues and the attitude of the parties leading up to and during the trial. The plaintiff also claimed that the defendant contributed to her failure to recognize proper deficiencies that should have been resolved pursuant to the building contract. The Court held that the plaintiff contributed to costs by not paying anything for the house construction notwithstanding she took possession. The judge also held that there was no clear winner in this case. The only exception to the rule is that the court reviewed the costs of the construction of this home and found that both the plaintiff and defendant contributed significantly to the circumstances that led to the trial and the parties will bear their own costs."
2008skqb146.txt,"FIAT: The parties have three children, Jill born December 1981, Luke born May 1986 and Keegan born November 1989. The respondent states that he has paid child support pursuant to the court order of February 2000 but, when the children reached the age of majority, he reduced the amount of child support payable as the children became independent and moved out on their own. The petitioner takes issue with the respondent's unilateral reduction in child support and submits the children remained children within the meaning of the Divorce Act so long as they were attending university. The parties agree that given the age of the children there has been a change in circumstance sufficient to allow a review of the existing child support order. HELD: 1) The parties agree that Jill, age 26 is no longer a child of the marriage and that Luke, age 21 is not presently a child of the marriage but could once again become a child of the marriage if he attends university in the fall of 2008. The parties also agree Keegan is 18 and remains a child of the marriage by virtue of the fact that he is taking classes at the university. 2) While the respondent asks that he be allowed to pay child support directly to the children, there is nothing in the material filed which would indicate that the petitioner is not providing support to the child in an appropriate fashion. Further, the difficulties that would arise in respect to enforcement of the order if the child support payments were not made directly to the petitioner would mitigate against such a variation.","FIAT. The parties agreed that given the age of the children, and the change in the amount of support they were receiving from the parties, that there had been a change in circumstances sufficient to allow a review of the existing child support order. HELD: 1) The parties agree that given their income and the fact that the children were attending university, that they have been a child of the marriage within the meaning of the Divorce Act. 2) The Court of Appeal suggested a three-step process in dealing with support orders for children who have reached the age where support automatically terminates. 3) The court reviewed the law concerning the payment of child support assuming that the child is of the age group within the Meaning of the Act. It was well-settled that full time attendance in post-secondary education may result in a child over the age that the parties are no longer a child within the means of the act. The Court also agreed that the respondent's obligation to pay proportional amount of post-primary school expenses for the children was no longer appropriate. The difficulties that could arise in respect to enforcement of the order if child support payments were not made directly to the respondent would mitigate against such a variation. 4) The father was to pay $500 per month towards the ongoing child support for the child. The father's income was $44,781. The court agreed that he was not providing support to the child in an appropriate fashion. The child was to become a child in the meaning the Diva Act. The issues were whether the respondent was providing support in an adequate fashion to the children. The children were to become children within the definition of the diva act. 5) The difficulties could arise if the child support were not paid directly to him. The Father was to be allowed to pay any maintenance payable directly to his child. 6) The children remained children of the marital relationship within the meanings of the s. 2(1) of the Code. The mother was to receive child support from the father. The application for child support concerning the father was adjourned until November 1, 2008. The order was to apply firstly towards ongoing child and then towards the arrears."

They were not habitually resident in Saskatchewan and had been here only 3 months. They were not living with their mother with the implied consent or acquiescence of their father.

2_2003skpc44.txt,"The plaintiff sought to recover the purchase price and repair and inspection costs of a used vehicle pursuant to the Consumer Protection Act s.57(1)(b). Mr. Russell sold the vehicle under consignment to the plaintiff for $1,600. The sales agreement indicated the vehicle was sold 'as is'. The purchaser returned the vehicle the next day because of a problem with the seat belt, a vibration or pulsation from the brakes and the 'check engine soon light' had come on. The plaintiff paid for the sensor replacement. Triple R absorbed the other costs of repair. The plaintiff's daughter continued to have problems with the car including with lower ball joints, exhaust system and motor mounts. At issue was whether or not a consignee is a 'retail seller' as defined in the Consumer Protection Act. HELD: The plaintiff was entitled to recover the $1,600 purchase price plus foreseeable damages which included costs of repairs and inspection totalling $242.35 and costs of $20 less a reduction of $1,542.35 for the 5,000 km it was driven. 1)A consignee is a retail seller within the meaning of the CPA and accordingly Triple R was deemed to have given the warranties set out in the CPA. If the legislature had intended that consignees were not to be considered retail sellers, it would have listed them in the excluded group. Persons may be considered retail sellers even though they have no contractual relationship to the purchaser in s.55. 2)While the plaintiff did not pay a large sum of money, he could still expect this vehicle to be safe to drive. It was not safe and accordingly was not of acceptable quality. The retail seller bears the burden of establishing the exceptions enumerated in the statutory warranty and failed to do so. The vehicle was unsafe from the outset and could not be considered suitable for the purpose of providing transportation. It was unnecessary to make a finding with respect to warranty s. 48(g) (durable for a reasonable period of time). 3)This auto was substantially unfit for all the usual purposes for which, to the knowledge of the retail seller, it was being bought and accordingly the breach was of a substantial character. 4)The plaintiff rejected the goods within a reasonable period. The commencement of the present action was treated as the rejection of the product. The bulk of delay was caused by the defendant's failure to pick up and look at the vehicle (and implication this would involve repair) as agreed.","The plaintiff was not a partner in Triple R. He was engaged in consignment auto sales upon the business premises of Triple R with Triple R's knowledge and consent. The sole financial benefit for this activity was to go to the plaintiff.

2_2005skqb513.txt,"FIAT: The parties are the parents of a son born April 10, 2003. They are married and the family home is in Connecticut. The respondent mother is a Canadian citizen and has returned to Canada and now resides in Laird, Saskatchewan. The petitioner is an American citizen and continues to reside in Connecticut and brings an application under The International Child Abduction Act for an order directing the child to be returned to Connecticut. HELD: The respondent is directed to return the child to the State of Connecticut by January 8, 2006.  1) The child was born in Canada. He and his mother joined his father in Connecticut one month later in May 2003. In February 2004 the child and his mother returned to Canada for a planned one-month visit. It is clear that the petitioner did not consent to the prolonged absence of the respondent and the child. In about November 2004 the respondent and the child returned to Connecticut and resumed living with the petitioner. Reconciliation was attempted. The respondent and child left in December 2004 and have not returned. The crystallizing moment was in March 2004 when the respondent did not return from her trip to Canada. For the purposes of the Convention, circumstances should be examined to determine habitual residence. At this point the parties had adopted traditional roles. The respondent was at home raising the child and the petitioner was attending his duties in the navy. Through their conduct the parties had evidenced a settled intention to make their home in Connecticut. The respondent chose to unilaterally remove the child from that home. 2) The petitioner had obtained an interim order in February 2005 directing the child to be returned to Connecticut. He also pursued his case in the Superior Court in Connecticut and on October 2005 obtained an order dissolving the marriage, directing the respondent to return the child to Connecticut and granted the petitioner sole custody. The respondent now asks that any order directing her and the child to return should be conditional on the petitioner varying the order he obtained in October 2005, vacating the award of sole custody to the petitioner and replacing it with something in the nature of joint custody. The conditional return order proposed by the respondent is inappropriate. Having determined that an order for return is warranted under the Convention, it does not lie with a Saskatchewan Court to impose a revised starting point for the process of determining custody in Connecticut. This Court's role concludes upon the determination the petitioner has made out a case for an order for return.","FIAT: The parties were the parents of a child born in Canada. The respondent mother, an American citizen, had returned to Canada and brought an application under The International Child Abduction Act for an order directing the child to be returned to Connecticut. The petitioner father, an Australian citizen, brought an action under The Children's Law Act 1996 for an Order directing the return of the child. HELD: The application was granted. 1) The Court found that the respondent's conduct was inconsistent with the Convention. 2) The respondent's actions were not in conflict with the Act. 3) The court found that it was appropriate to require undertakings of the requesting party provided that such undertakings were made within the spirit of the Convention and that the parties were to cooperate with the Family Relations Division for mediation. 4) The petitioner was granted custody. The Court reviewed the circumstances of the parties' relationship and found that they were now settled into their new environment.

2_2006nsfc7.txt,"Although the mother initially had sole custody of the parties' two children, they were placed in the joint custody of both parents, with primary care and control with the father, when the mother was hospitalized due to mental health disturbances. When the children were not later returned to her care, the mother brought an application to vary the primary care arrangements, alleging that the children were not receiving suitable and appropriate parenting while in the father's care. The father, who lived close to the maternal grandparents and relied upon them extensively for the care of the children, questioned the mother's emotional and mental health and stability. The transfer of primary care of the children to the mother is conditional upon the fulfillment of several provisions and prohibitions, including the mother's disclosure to her mental health caregivers of any alcohol consumption and the recent harassing phone calls made by her; should the parents be unable or unwilling to cooperate with the court directives, the court will consider filing a report of neglect under the Children and Family Services Act; primary care and access will be reviewed by the court in six months time. The children were at considerable risk if placed in the primary care of either parent; the evidence showed that the father was unable to meet the children's needs on a daily basis; in addition to his questionable parenting judgment, his regular daily drug use in circumstances where the family lived in poverty and one child had an asthmatic medical condition showed that he placed a higher priority on his relationship with marijuana than his primary responsibility as protector of his children. Although the mother's parenting plan was well-conceived, the court questioned whether she could withstand the daily pressure of raising the children and noted her past habit of consuming alcohol while taking medication.","The father is currently providing the physical amenities of life for the two growing boys. The mother is currently residing with her maternal grandparents. The father is working as a roofer and is unable to drive a motor vehicle, having accumulated myriad of driving infractions to add to his already lengthy criminal record. The children are at considerable risk if placed in the primary care and control of either parent. The circumstances of violence and intimidation by the father have compromised his emotional bond with the children. The parents have a common interest in providing physical amenities for the children, but the father is not presently providing the necessary amenities for these two growing children. HELD: The Court found that the father was unable to provide the physical necessities of life to the children and that the primary concern was the mother's drug use. The Court also found that if a parent struggling at the poverty level is smoking drugs regularly, and financially supporting a drug habit, this will automatically divert from already meager funds available to adequately provide amenities for their children."
2_2007nsca122.txt,"Two days after the wife commenced a divorce action in Nova Scotia, the husband commenced one in Texas. He successfully applied to have the wife's divorce petition set aside on the grounds that she had not been ordinarily resident in Nova Scotia for at least one year immediately prior to the commencement of the proceeding. The wife applied for a stay of execution pending her appeal of this decision. She argued irreparable harm to herself and the parties' child on the basis that if the stay was refused, she would be required to travel to take part in the Texas proceeding, leaving her law practice for an extended time and uprooting the child who was settled in school here. She also feared that she would be found in contempt for failing to obey the Texas custody orders and be imprisoned. Application for stay pending appeal dismissed; the irreparable harm claimed by the appellant was entirely speculative at this point as if the Texas court did grant custody to the father, under the Child Abduction Act, a Nova Scotia court would have jurisdiction to determine the child's habitual residence and whether the appellant was wrongfully detaining him here. Given that the Texas court would be free to continue its proceeding even if a stay was granted, until such time as the conflict of laws issue was resolved, it would be risky for the appellant not to participate in the process there. Furthermore, the order under appeal was not one that lent itself to being stayed under Rule 62.20.","The appellant appeals from a stay of execution of an order setting aside her petition for divorce made by the Supreme Court of Canada (Family Division). On an application by the respondent to set aside the divorce petition on the basis that Nova Scotia lacked jurisdiction, the judge determined that the appellant had not been ordinarily resident in Nova Scotia for at least one year prior to the filing of the petition. The appellant argues that if the stay is not granted and the appeal is successful, Nova Scotia will have jurisdiction to determine whether the appellant was wrongfully retaining the child in Nova Scotia. HELD: The application for a stay pending appeal is dismissed with costs in the cause. 1) While there is no comprehensive definition of what may constitute 'exceptional circumstances' which may justify a stay even if the applicant cannot meet the primary test, those exceptional circumstances must show that it is unjust to permit the immediate enforcement of an ordered obtained after trial. 2) While the Supreme court is not a reciprocating state pursuant to the Reciprocal Enforcement of Custody Orders Act, 1989, R.S.NS, c. 387, the Child Abduction Act, which implements the Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abductation would be applicable. 3) The Court of Appeal has jurisdiction to decide whether the child's habitual residence was in Nova or Texas and if the appellant is wrongfully keeping the child. Since the respondent is not an extradition agent pursuant to either the Recipient Enforcement of custody Orders Act or the ChildAbduction Act (Criminal Procedure Act, 1990), the Court of Appeals has jurisdiction in Nova and the respondent has jurisdiction pursuant to that statute to determine the child’s habitual residence in Nova. 4) The application is dismissed."

The wife applied to vary the Corollary Relief Judgment (CRJ) following the termination of spousal support. The termination had occurred pursuant to the terms of the CRJ which provided that support would terminate either twelve months after her graduation from the M.B.A. program in which she was enrolled, six months after she withdrew from the program, or when she found employment. The wife had graduated from the program later than expected and a further six months after her course work was completed. Both parties applied to vary child support. The oldest child had completed his first university degree and was currently attending law school. Pursuant to the father's employment, until the completion of their first degree, the children qualified for a program which reimbursed the father for 75 per cent of the child's educational expenses. The CRJ had provided that the father's responsibility to pay all of the oldest child's educational expenses was conditional upon compliance and eligibility for the education reimbursement policies. The middle child was attending university and lived in the wife's home over the summer months. Spousal support application denied; given the family history of an emphasis on education and the oldest child's career plans and apparent aptitudes, he remained a child of the marriage; the father is to pay $10,000 per year directly to the oldest child for the next two years. The father will pay 25 per cent of the core university costs which are not covered by the plan for the middle child as well as the difference in the Table amount of support for two children versus one child; the father shall pay the Table amount of support for one child to the wife for the youngest child as well as that child's expenses for private school; the wife will be responsible for any extra-curricular activities or tutoring outside the private school; the youngest child will be entitled to the same post-secondary benefits in the same fashion as the two older children; the CRJ is amended to provide that the two oldest children are in the joint care of their parents and will not include any other reference to custody or access; the husband is entitled to specified block access with the youngest child; if flight arrangements are made for this child and she does not fly (and there is no medical reason confirmed in writing by a doctor for that failure), the husband's block access shall be expanded for one week at the next access period and the cost of any penalty from the missed flight will be deducted dollar for dollar from the child support payable by the husband.","The parties brought a variation application under the Divorce Act, 1985. The parties had been married for 23 years. The respondent husband paid child support in the amount of $3,550 per month. The mother was working for the United Nations. The father was working as a consultant for the UN. The husband was working in South Africa. The children were in the mother's care. The wife was working part-time and the children were attending school in the father's home. The child support was adjusted to reflect the respondent's current income. The court found that the respondent was paying spousal support based on his current income and that the children had been living in the wife's care for some time. The Court found that this was not appropriate. The application to vary spousals was dismissed. The evidence showed that the mother had been working long hours and was suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder. The order contemplated her parenting the girls she was receiving significant amount of child support. The Corollary Relief Judgment contemplates the “late” completion of the respondent’s M.B.A. program. It placed the children in her care. There was no change in the children’ circumstances. The relationship was not defined by the Corollaries Relief Judgment. The only change in circumstances was that the husband had a post-crash condition that impacted on the children. The marriage was not in danger of being re-divorce. The applicant was entitled to vary support."

An inspection of the mall roof revealed that 10.5 per cent of the joists inspected had at least one panel point with a broken or missing weld and the same remediation scheme as that implemented by the Province for the government's own buildings was recommended. The plaintiff, concerned with safety issues arising from the report, followed the consultant's recommendations and undertook remediation of the mall and then claimed against the defendant, which was the parent company of the corporate entity which had fabricated the joists. The defendant's expert took the position that although the actual repairs to the welding and webs of the open steel joists was necessary, the reinforcing of the joists undertaken in the remediation was not required in order to mitigate the danger. Judgment for the plaintiff; there were defects in the open web steel joists at the mall which constituted a real and substantial danger to the occupants; this danger was caused by the defendant's negligence and the remediation program carried out at the mall was necessary to alleviate the real and substantial danger. There were internal problems with the welds which could not be discovered by non-destructive inspection and the lack of proper welding procedures and quality control issues at the company prevented one from having confidence in any welds fabricated by them, at least based on external observations.","The plaintiff sought reimbursement for the inspection and remediation of the defendant's open web steel joists. The defendant claimed the actual repairs were necessary, but the reinforcing of the joists undertaken in the remediation was not necessary to repair defects to the joist. The plaintiff claimed the defendant had misrepresented the quality of the open web joists and that the repairs and remedial were required. The plaintiffs claimed the defendants had misrepresentated the quality control of the quality during the fabrication of the plaintiff's open- web steel joints. The defendants claimed the plaintiff had misrepresentered the quality and the repairs were not necessary. The court found that the plaintiff was entitled to reimbursement for all of the inspection costs. The issue was whether the plaintiff’s open web-steel joists were subject to defects caused by the defendant’ s negligence. The evidence showed that many of the cracks were consistent with cracks caused by shielded metal arc welding. The failure rate was 1.28%. The plaintiff”s evidence was that the defendant was negligent in failing to inspect the joisting. The Court found that there were no defects in the open-web steel joist line. The only defects were cracks in the top and bottom chord of the six-panel joists, which were all in the same class. The problems were not service related. The joists in length categories and (10 to 14 m) had more cracks on percentage basis. The amount of work in the plant determined how much the plaintiff inspected. The average for buildings inspected in Nova Scotia was 2.28% and only failed welds or members would be repaired. The damage to the plaintiff would be mitigated by the repairs to the defendant. The remedy for the plaintiff is to have the joism deslagged to allow for routine inspection for weld quality and fit up. The error in the plaintiff to have his joist deslagging done was not supported by the evidence. The errors were so serious that the plaintiffs were unable to pay the plaintiff for the costs of the remedial. The fault lines were so deep that the joisted could not be seen. The defects were so obvious that the court could not see them. The judge concluded that the remedy was to have all of his joists deslag and that he was satisfied that the defects were not caused by his negligence."

HELD: The application for intervention is allowed on condition that it meet the filing deadline, that its material not exceed 12 pages and that it may make oral argument only if requested to do so by the Court.  1) The intervenor is a non-profit corporation and its members are mutual fund dealers. Its stated purpose is to regulate the mutual fund distribution industry and its members contractually bind themselves to submit to regulation by the Association. It contends its purpose in bringing the application is to bring to the Court's attention 'some of the broader policy and contextual considerations that have informed the development of the Mutual Fund Dealers Association (MFDA) and the self-regulatory organizations (SROs) generally. 2) There is no prejudice to the respondent if the applicant's proposed arguments are presented to the Court on the appeal. The applicant's arguments should simply put the regulatory scheme in context and may assist the Court in its deliberations. The applicant's arguments are confined to a relatively narrow issue.","The Mutual Fund Dealers Association seeks leave to intervene in the stated appeal. The Mutual Fund is the respondent and the proposed intervenor seeks leave. The MFDA consents to the intervention while the respondents oppose the application. The central issue on the appeal is whether the appellant has jurisdiction to discipline former representatives of one of its member firms for acts done by the representatives prior to their resignation or termination. There is a second issue by way of cross-appeal raised by one respondent in regard to matters of delay and abuse of process. The proposed intervener has additional arguments to make. However, the applicant's arguments are confined to a relatively narrow issue and the applicant’s arguments are limited to a narrow issue. I am prepared to allow the application with some strict conditions. The respondent may file a reply if it chooses to do so on or before March 8, 2007. The mere fact the proposed intervention has additional argument to make is not determinative of the issue. However the applicant has no prejudice to the respondent if the applicant makes its proposed arguments on the Appeal."
2_2007skqb378.txt,"The outstanding issue is child support, past and future. The dispute largely centered on what monies were owed from the past. Central to this was the determination of the respondent's income. HELD: 1) The respondent is a farmer. His income tax returns for the years 2004, 2005 and 2006 have been filed, but certain adjustments must be made. The purpose of the capital cost allowance is to provide money to purchase replacement equipment. However, not all of the money is needed and is not used for that purpose. It is that unused portion which should be allocated as part of the respondent's income. In this case, 40% of the allowance should be treated as income for the purpose of calculating child support. The personal portion of the utility costs should be included as part of his income, an appropriate percentage is 25%. An amount of the legal and accounting costs should be attributed to the respondent personally and added to his income, in 2004 $1,000 is added, in 2005 $5,000 is added and in 2006 $1,000 is added. The respondent has taken advantage of the optional inventory adjustment and that must be factored back into his income using the methodology set out in Tamke v. Tamke, 2001 SKQB 528. As the respondent's income has undergone serious fluctuation over the years, it is therefore appropriate that his income for calculating child support be based on the average of his income in the years 2004 and 2005. 2) The respondent will not have to pay half of the cost of Stacey joining a school trip to Europe. This is because Stacey paid half of the cost herself and because the respondent was asked to contribute at the time but refused. The petitioner knew the respondent had refused to contribute and, when she elected to pay the balance, she did so unilaterally. It would be inappropriate to compel the respondent to contribute now. 3) The school fees paid by the petitioner are not extraordinary and should be encompassed in the basis child support. The health costs in the form of orthodontic treatments are extraordinary and the parties shall contribute equally as their incomes are presently comparable. 3) On five occasions the respondent failed to attend at the agreed meeting spot with the result that the petitioner had to make the entire trip to deliver the children to the respondent so he could exercise access. She will be compensated for the actual lost wages and fuel costs that she incurred on the respondent's behalf, but not for costs she would have incurred in any event.  4) The respondent shall pay costs of $1,200.","The parties have three children. The parties separated in 2003 and the usual relief was claimed, namely: divorce, joint custody, access, child support, spousal support and division of family property. Central to this was the determination of the respondent's income. The respondent has been paying child support for the past and the children resided with him on alternate weeks. During that time incomes varied somewhat and it could be said that the contributions would have varied somewhat. The petitioner claimed for lost wages and the cost of fuel. The court found that the respondent should pay one-half of the sum. The Court rejected the respondent’s claim for the fee, which was ordinary, and not extraordinary expenses and would be encompassed in the basic child support. The same applies to the cost and fees of certain activities provided to the children. HELD: The Court found that an appropriate retroactive variation was effected. The amount of child support payable was reduced by 40%. The Court reviewed the circumstances and found that 40% of the allowance should be treated as income for the purposes of the capital cost allowance. The costs were to be compensated for lost wage and the loss of income."
2_2011skpc5.txt,"The accused was charged with impaired driving and driving over. 08. The sole issue to be determined was whether the accused was the person operating the vehicle at the time of the stop. The police testified that they had walked through the bar before closing time and then returned to the bar at closing time. The evidence was that the accused had been seen playing drinking games in the bar. The police observed the people they had seen in the bar get into a truck and back up. The police activated their emergency equipment and approached the vehicle. The accused was sitting in the driver's seat when the police approached the vehicle. The defence suggested that another individual had been driving the truck when it backed up but had gone inside the bar to purchase off sale before the police approached the truck. HELD: The accused was convicted of both counts and a judicial stay was entered on the impaired driving count. The Court found that the evidence of the accused was unreliable as a result of her alcohol consumption on the offence date. The evidence of the person that the defence suggested was the driver was inconsistent and caused the Court concern about its reliability. The Court found that at the time the individuals got into the truck, the accused was behind the wheel and that she was the one who backed the vehicle up and pulled it forward. The keys were in the vehicle and it was running when the police came to the driver's door. The accused's blood alcohol content at the time of driving as shown by the Certificate of Analysis was 150 milligrams of alcohol in 100 millilitres of blood.","The accused was charged with impaired driving and driving over.08. The defence evidence was that the accused was the driver of the vehicle at the time of the incident. The accused was found not guilty of both charges. The evidence lacked reliability. The officer was polite and cooperative both in examination-in-chief and cross-examination. The keys were in the ignition when the police arrived at the vehicle. The complainant was not drinking at the scene. The officers observed the vehicle being driven by the accused and observed her get into the vehicle and then back out. The vehicle was stopped at approximately 2:00 a.m. The police officer testified that he saw the vehicle start to back up and then the vehicle backed up again. The Crown suggested that another individual, who was the vehicle's driver, was the driving officer. The court found as a fact that the keys were on the ignition since the time the group entered the vehicle, and had been in the vehicle since the incident occurred. The Court found as an exception that the evidence did not leave the court with a reasonable doubt as to the guilt of the accused."

The defence appealed the sentence. Appeal allowed; sentence varied to 6 months imprisonment; the Crown ordered that the respondent perform 150 hours of community service and 150 hours probation.

3_1991canlii4569.txt,"The appellant appealed his conviction for sexual assault using a weapon and his sentence of eight years. The appellant contended that his counsel had failed to call the complainant's boyfriend as a witness even though he was in the courthouse under a defence subpoena. The appellant also raised on appeal the fact that he had lost his right to a jury trial. He had failed to appear at the jury trial scheduled and a bench warrant had been issued. The Crown had then applied for an order that the appellant was no longer entitled to a jury trial and the record showed that his counsel had agreed to forfeit the right to a jury trial. The appellant contended that his counsel and the Crown both advised him he had lost his right by failing to appear and that he was not told that he could avoid losing his right if he had a legitimate excuse for failing to appear. He put forth the excuse of having had no counsel at the time of the trial. Dismissing the appeal, (1) that there was nothing to show that the witness would have given relevant evidence bearing on a decisive issue in the trial and the appellant failed to meet the burden of showing that the evidence, if believed, could reasonably have been expected to affect the result of the trial when considered with all the other evidence; counsel's decision not to call the witness where the witness was hostile and counsel did not know what he would say was not inappropriate, and, the court noted, in the circumstances, seemed to have been the right decision; (2) the excuse of failing to appear because he did not have counsel was not a legitimate excuse within the meaning of s. 598(1)(a) of the Criminal Code; moreover, the appellant only raised this issue in his oral submissions and gave no notice to the Crown respecting this issue nor did he provide any supporting evidence by way of affidavit; it was seen by the Court as another unsupported and unjustified criticism of counsel and the Court concluded that the record showed that the appellant had agreed to forfeit his right to a jury trial; and (3) that an eight year sentence, although at the high end of the scale for sexual assault, was not manifestly excessive, having regard to deterrence, the circumstances of the offence, and the appellant's record which included three minor offences.","The appellant was convicted after trial of assault with a weapon contrary to s.253.2 of the Criminal Code. He applied for leave to appeal against the sentence of 8 years imprisonment and for leave granted, appeal dismissed, and firearms prohibition order. Dismissing the appeal, that although the appellant had intercourse with the complainant, such was with her consent. The appellant had not made an effort to elicit a confession. The evidence was that the appellant did not know what evidence he would give and was not at all sure that the latter would say that he had assaulted the complainant. The trial judge refused to call a witness that was present in the courthouse to prove the appellant's allegations against him. The Court reviewed the evidence, examined the evidence of the complainant and found that the evidence would be reasonably capable of belief and in addition, his evidence could reasonably be expected to affect the result of the trial. Disminding the conviction and sentence, that the burden was on the appellant to demonstrate that his evidence would reasonably capable and could affect the outcome of the case."
3_1993canlii4594.txt,"The appellant was detained after leaving a suspected 'after hours' club which was under surveillance by police. He was charged with a breathalyzer offence, and was convicted. He appealed, arguing his s. 9 Charter rights had been violated. He also contended the evidence of the amount of alcohol he had consumed on the night in question constituted 'evidence to the contrary' which rebutted the presumption in s. 258 of the Criminal Code. Dismissing the appeal, that the police officers were not acting arbitrarily or in a random fashion when they detained the appellant, and had a reasonable basis for stopping his vehicle. The appellant's contention he consumed only two small bottles (1-1/2 ounces each) of rum, plus some cough syrup and mints, did not constitute evidence to the contrary to rebut the presumption of the breathalyzer offence. On Appeal.","The accused was arrested for impaired driving and breathalyser tests. The accused agreed to take the usual two breathalysers tests. At trial, the accused was convicted of impaired driving. The evidence of the amount of alcohol he had to drink was found to be reasonable and had an articulable cause for stopping the vehicle. The Provincial Court Judge erred in law by failing to give effect to the opinion of the crown expert that the amount consumed by the accused would not have given readings which were contained on the Certificate of Analysis. The defence argued that the Provincial Court judge misinterpreted the evidence by admitting evidence of alcohol consumption. Dismissing the appeal, that the Court of Appeal applied the proper principles of law to the facts of the particular case in excluding evidence. The Court of Appeals found that the arrest was not random and was not a deliberate breach of the Charter. The police officers involved were not acting arbitrarily or in a random fashion. The findings of the alcohol consumption were proven through the Crown expert to be such that it should result in a reading significantly less than the alcohol concentration forbidden under s. 258. The court found that Judge Potts was not in error in law or in her finding of facts in her decision."

Sub-questions to be determined included: what are the statutory schemes of the Trade Union Act and the Saskatchewan Human Rights Code; what has the Supreme of Canada decided about the exclusive jurisdiction of an arbitrator to resolve disputes in the context of labour law; the essential character of the dispute and ambit of the collective agreement; whether either the Code or the Act has exclusive jurisdiction to decide the dispute and if not, which statute takes priority or is paramount. HELD: The order of the Court of Queen's Bench was set aside and the matter was remitted to the Board of Inquiry appointed under the provisions of the Code. 1)The chambers judge correctly decided that the issue in this case is confined to a determination of the correct forum in which to bring the complaint of sexual harassment. 2)Human rights are fundamental, quasi-constitutional rights which embody fundamental values and public policy. Because human rights are not private rights, but public rights which constitute fundamental public policy, parties are not able to contract out of, alter, amend, or repeal or create exceptions to human rights provisions. To do otherwise would permit the denigration of the rights and obviate the protection of the rights the statute seeks to protect. 3)The mere fact that a collective agreement includes an article or clause which complies with the Code or a provision which covenants not to discriminate on the basis of the grounds set out in the Code, does not in and of itself transform the nature of the dispute from a human rights violation to a breach of the collective agreement. The ambit of the collective agreement does not affect the finding that the essential nature of the dispute is a human rights violation particularly when the public interest component and wide powers granted under the Code to redress a violation are taken into account. It is not in its essential character a complaint arising out of the employment relationship under the collective agreement.  4)The Commission was awarded its costs on double column V in this Court and on the appropriate Court of Queen's Bench tariff. No costs were requested by the intervenor.ADDENDUM: Paragraphs number 25 and 31 are substituted as follows: [25] This position was reinforced by Weber v. Ontario Hydro and New Brunswick v. O'Leary. The policy driving such decisions is that the dispute resolution process, established by the various labour statutes, should not be duplicated or undermined by concurrent common law actions in the courts. This also conforms to the theory of deference that courts accord decisions of specialized tribunals. For a complete discussion of the issue see Parr and Prince Albert District Health Board v. Saskatchewan Federation of Labour released concurrently with this judgment. The Ambit of the Collective Agreement [31] One must not lose sight of the fact that the terms of the collective agreement itself can play an important role in the determination of whether the jurisdiction of the court has been ousted in favour of an arbitrator. The fact that parties have included an anti-discrimination clause in the collective agreement does not alter the fundamental nature of the dispute or have the effect of extending the scope of the arbitrator's jurisdiction. It may play a role in determining whether the statutory tribunal would decide to hear the complaint, but it cannot affect the determination of the essential nature of the dispute or the question of jurisdiction. The essential issue is whether this complaint is a dispute between the parties with respect to the meaning, application or alleged violation of the collective agreement. To find that it is, with the result that the dispute must be arbitrated, would permit the parties to contract out of the Code, something they cannot do.",The appellant appealed a decision which overturned the respondent's right to a hearing under the provisions of the collective agreement and to a Board of Inquiry established under the Act. The respondent argued that the collective agreements do not address the fundamental human right of an employee to be guaranteed by the collective contract. The Board of inquiry was appointed under the terms of the agreement to investigate the alleged discrimination. The appellant appealed. Appeal allowed; the matter remitted to the Board of Investigation established under Act in accordance with the provisions under the act. The decision was that the respondent had exclusive jurisdiction to hear the complaint. The mere fact that a collective agreement includes an article or clause which complies with the Code or a provision which covenants not to discriminate on the basis of the grounds set out in the Code does not in and of itself transform the nature of the dispute from a human rights violation to a breach of the contract.
3_1999canlii12362.txt,"The appellant appeals his conviction of sexual assault causing bodily harm on the ground the trial judge erred in preventing cross-examination of the complainant. The trial judge prevented the cross-examination of the complainant in relation to a previous allegation she had made relating to this sexual assault. The offence is alleged to have taken place at home of the appellant's brother. The appellant was asked by his brother and sister-in-law to babysit their daughter. The allegation was that the appellant had entered her parent's bedroom where she was sleeping and sexually assaulted her. The appellant, who has no previous record, was convicted of the charge and sentenced to three years imprisonment. The appellant during cross-examination of the complainant attempted to question her regarding a previous allegation regarding the same sexual assault against another person. The trial judge did not permit this line of questioning as he held it pertained to her past sexual history. HELD: Appeal allowed. The failure of the trial judge to allow this cross-examination has prevented the appellant from having a fair trial as he has been denied the opportunity to make full answer and defence. It seems the question that should have been put to the trial judge on this occasion was whether this section was applicable to a situation involving non-consensual sex. The complainant was not being questioned about her consensual sexual activities but rather a previous complainant of a sexual assault. It is understood the intent was to indicate the complainant had implicated someone else as the assailant and after investigation the complaint had not been acted upon. That evidence could have placed in doubt the reliability of the complainant's identification of the person who assaulted her since the room was dark when the assault was alleged to have occurred. The relevance of such a question pertaining to the existence of another complaint made by the complainant in respect of the same assault is obvious. That question has a direct bearing on her credibility.",The appellant was found guilty of having sexually assaulted the complainant contrary to s. 272(c) of the Criminal Code. He appealed the conviction on the ground that the trial judge erroneously interpreted s. 276 of the Code to prevent proper cross-examination of the complainant in relation to a previous allegation she had made relating to this sexual assault. HELD: The appeal was allowed and a new trial ordered. The Court found that the failure to allow the cross-examine of the complainant regarding another complaint of a sexual assault prevented the appellant from having a fair trial as he had been denied the opportunity to make full answer and defence. The court also found that s. 277 of the code was not applicable to non-consensual sex. The appellant was not being questioned about her consensual sexual activities but rather about a previous complaint of sexual assault which had occurred. The complainant was not asked about a prior complaint of the sexual assault and that question had a direct bearing on her credibility. The appeal is allowed and the new trial order is ordered.

The remaining payments set out in the schedule will commence January 2001 with the change in rate of interest from that provided under the Interest Act to one equivalent to pre-judgment interest.

3_2001nssc117.txt,"The plaintiffs were Sergeants in the Town of Bedford Police Department. Following amalgamation and before any collective agreement was concluded, the Chief of the amalgamated force issued a department order declaring that all persons in the position of the plaintiffs would be referred to as a level two Sergeant which created a two-tier structure within the Sergeant rank. The bargaining agent for the union declined to process a grievance on behalf of the plaintiffs and agreed with the two-tiered structure which was eventually incorporated into the collective agreement. After unsuccessfully complaining to the Nova Scotia Police Commission and the Halifax Regional Board of Police Commissioners, the plaintiffs commenced an action alleging that the creation of the two-tiered structure was a violation of the Police Act and adversely affected their employment rights. The intervenor union brought an application to strike the plaintiffs' proceeding on the basis that the court lacked jurisdiction to hear the matter. Application granted; proceeding stayed pending submission to arbitration or any other form of proceeding that is permitted under the statutory enactments applicable; if no application is made to lift the stay within two years, the action will stand dismissed. Where there is a threshold question of whether the dispute is arbitrable, that decision should initially be made, absent very limited exceptions, by an arbitrator and not by the court. It is irrelevant if the plaintiffs have now lost their rights to initiate the arbitration process.","The Halifax Regional Municipality Act provided for the amalgamation of the city and municipality police forces into the Halifax Regional municipality. The amalgamation included the joining together of the various municipal police forces under one administration. The plaintiffs were members of Bargaining Unit represented by MAPP. The issues raised by the plaintiffs were the nature of the dispute, the extent to which it is, in substance, regulated by the Police Act, and the extent of which the court's assumption of jurisdiction would be inconsistent with that scheme. The issue was whether the court should decline jurisdiction in favour of the grievance/arbitration process. HELD: The Court held that the issues were matters that fell within the exclusive dispute resolution process established under the Police act. The Court of Appeal held that s. 41 and 42 of the Trade Union Act do not apply because the cause of action pre-dates the collective agreement. The Act is the same as the Trade union Act. The only difference is that the Act is not designed to be exclusive to the individual employees. The provisions of the Act do, however, have an exclusive jurisdiction. The collective agreement does not explicitly or implicitly state that the rights of the plaintiff are guaranteed by the collective agreements. The fact that the plaintiff was reduced in rank does not preclude the plaintiff pursuing any common law rights in the courts. The court will know when it rules on the question of its jurisdiction the full implications of its decision. The test for determining whether the Court has jurisdiction is whether the Act has jurisdiction. In this case, the Court of Appeals held that it was not suggested that neither the arbitrator nor the court would have jurisdiction to determine the rights and obligations of the parties. The plaintiff was bound by the provisions of s. 43 of the collective bargaining agreement and s. 42 of s43. The same principles apply to the collective and collective agreement negotiations. The principles of the First and Second Amendments are applicable to the negotiation of a collective agreement and the provisions in s.43 of the TUA. The first amendment is an essential element of the Agreement. The second amendment is a fundamental component of the agreement."

4_1994canlii4625.txt,"At trial in Provincial Court, the accuseds called no evidence and were convicted. They appealed on the basis that the Crown's evidence was so insufficient that a verdict of guilty was unreasonable or was one which could not reasonably be supported on the evidence. HELD: Appeal dismissed. 1)No medical evidence was necessary to establish that the victim's injuries were caused by an assault, given the photographs admitted into evidence, the evidence of the police officer who was called to the scene of the assault and the evidence of the 7-11 clerk who was first approached by the victim for assistance. 2)Evidence of exclusive opportunity was unnecessary to sustain a conviction where there was other circumstantial evidence pointing to the identity of the accuseds. 3)Although a failure to permit an accused who calls no evidence to argue last in a jury trial might be a good ground of appeal, the failure to be permitted to argue last before a judge alone was merely a procedural error which could be cured under the curative provision contained in S.686(1)(b)(iv) of the Criminal Code.","The Crown and the appellants argued that the evidence adduced by the Crown was insufficient to such a degree that a guilty verdict ought to be found by this Court. The Court found that the defence called no evidence and the Court found the evidence either unreasonable or one that cannot be supported by the evidence. Appeal dismissed. The court found that there was sufficient circumstantial evidence to support the appellant's conclusion that the injuries were caused by blows to the face. The evidence was readily resolved by examining the circumstances immediately preceding the infliction of the injuries by the description of the injury given by the victim (although he did not remember how the injuries had been inflicted and called the police), the counterman at the 7-Eleven store who saw the victim shortly after the injuries occurred and called police, and the investigating officer who saw him shortly after that. HELD: The Court dismissed the appeal. 1)Circumstantial evidence of opportunity was sufficient to support a finding of identity beyond a reasonable doubt.  2)The Court found in favour of the appellation. The issue was whether the evidence of 'extraordinary evidence' of motive and hostility, which was sufficient evidence to warrant a finding that an assault, or indeed an offence of any kind, had been committed.  3)The court found the appellations guilty. The trial judge found that 'circumstantial and opportunity was necessary to sustain a finding on identity beyond the reasonable doubt.'  4)The appellants failed on all three of those submissions."

The hospital decided to release the full report. The appellant employees appealed the decision of the hospital, claiming that they had been assured confidentiality. Allowing the appeal, that the disclosure of personal information consisting of personal recommendations or evaluations, character references, or personal evaluations by the appellants and other hospital staff are presumed under s. 20(3)(g) of the Act to be an unreasonable invasion of a third party's personal privacy.

HELD: 1)Section 258(7) has been judicially amended to mean 'true copy' which presumably, though not logically, means something more than 'copy'. It has grown to the point that an affidavit may be disregarded if the police do not provide supplemental evidence when challenged as to the manner in which they assured the accuracy of the copy. 2)The trial judge further advanced the law to a point where, even when not challenged, there is an obligation to provide supplemental evidence of comparison in order to buttress the evidence of the affidavit. This is an error of law. A challenge under s258(7) should be based upon a discovered difference as between the copy and the original.

Application allowed in part; plaintiff awarded $250,000.00 as interim payment; spouse's application denied.

The issue relates to whether the applicant has demonstrated a basis for the order sought under Rule 30. 1) The applicant sought an order under Rule30(2) of Rule under the general rule under the Bruptcy & Insolventcy Act pursuant to s.187(11). 2) The respondent consented to the extension of the time to bring the appeal. 3) The issue is whether the application of the security agreement by the applicant prior to the proposal was contrary to the statutory stay provision as set out in s.69(1)(a) of S. 187. The trustee is statutorily charged to determine the claims of creditors. This can only be accomplished by the trustee performing various registry searches relevant to fixed date to determine a ranking of creditors' claims. The proposal is developed based upon the trustee's due diligence in this regard and recommendations are made to the creditors concerning the viability of the proposal. 4) The proposal was developed based on the trustee’s due diligence and recommendations were made to creditors concerning their viability of a proposal. The respondent’ s. 66.(1) was not obtained for this purpose. 5) The application of this provision would permit the trustee to utilize both sections 135 and 72(1). 6) The trustee”s analysis that permits court to get to the PPSA is correct but the submission that section 20(2)(a is applicable to proposals is not supported by the legislation. This is a way to make efficient use of the proposals process. The application is supported by legislation and based upon his analysis the interpretation is reasonable. The interpretation is not reasonable.
4_2009skca44.txt,"The respondent Homeowners sued the respondents Sebastian and the TWC alleging negligence or breach of contract for failing to obtain the coverage for insurance as instructed by the Homeowners. Sebastian and TWC issued a third party claim against the appellant SGI and claimed SGI was negligent or in breach of contract or contributory negligence pursuant to the Contributory Negligence Act for failing to issue a policy of insurance in accordance with the application submitted to SGI by Sebastian on behalf of the Homeowners. The trial judge concluded Sebastian and TWC were negligent and liable for the loss suffered by the Homeowners. Further, the trial judge concluded that the insurer, SGI, owed a duty of care to both Sebastian and TWC and the Homeowners to properly underwrite and deal with the application for insurance. The trial judge concluded SGI contributed equally to the Homeowners' loss by 'their negligent acts' and was responsible to pay 50% of the judgment. The negligence of Sebastian and TWC is not disputed in this appeal. The Homeowners have been paid the amount owed under the judgment and advised they have no interest in the matter and did not participate in the appeal. SGI appeals and submits the trial judge erred in determining that SGI: (a) owed a duty of care to the insureds, Homeowners, and to the broker when it received an application for insurance in 'all the circumstances'; and (b) breached its duty of care. HELD: That portion of the judgment finding that SGI is liable for 50% of the damages payable to the Homeowners is set aside and the Third Party Claim is dismissed. Accordingly, the appeal is allowed with costs to the Appellant. The trial judge correctly placed the duty of care on the intermediary, Sebastian. It is clear the insurer relies on the broker to apply for the coverage in accordance with his clients' (i.e., the insureds') wishes and needs. There was no other evidence before the Court to establish the standard of care, the basis for imposing a duty at law where none has previously existed, or the subsequent breach of that duty by the insurer, SGI, in connection to the application for insurance submitted by Sebastian. The Court concluded there was nothing in this transaction which warrants the creation of a duty of care owed by the insurer to a broker applying for insurance on behalf of his clients.","The plaintiff insurer, SGI, applied to the court to issue insurance to the plaintiff for the accidental loss or damage to their Swarovski collection. The plaintiff argued that SGI was negligent or in breach of contract or contributory negligence pursuant to the Contributory Negligence Act for failing to issue a policy of insurance to its client on behalf of the plaintiff. The defendant argued that the plaintiff did not publish the availability of this special insurance coverage which it had extended to the Draders under the McCallum Hill SGI policy. The trial judge concluded that SGE was negligent and liable for the loss suffered by the plaintiff and that the insurer, the defendant, owed duty of care to both the plaintiff's and the defendants' Homeowners, to properly underwrite and deal with the application for insurance. The circumstances alone, combined with the insurance which SGI received, led the court that S.G. owed a duty of duty to the defendants (as well as to the plaintiffs) in respect of the policy it issued to replace the McCallionum Hill policy that expired the same date. The court found that SGS, as an insurer, owed a fiduciary duty to both SGI and the plaintiff to conduct its own review of the needs, wishes or desires of the applicant. The evidence also showed that SG did not post the availability for the special coverage which the plaintiff had for the Swarovsk collection."
4_2011skpc127.txt,"The Ministry brought an application for a permanent order for the child pursuant to s. 37 of The Child and Family Services Act. The Minister apprehended the child at birth. The mother's three older children had been apprehended with two other older children placed with a person of sufficient interest and the third child was made a permanent ward of the Ministry. The Minister argued that given the extensive past history of the three older children, the Minister properly apprehended the infant and the permanency planning committee was of the opinion that there was no use putting off the inevitable permanent order for the child. The mother and the child's father had separated with the father supporting the mother having the child returned to her care and the father having access to the child. HELD: There was no basis for the initial apprehension as the child was not in need of protection. The child shall be returned to the mother who is a person who has a right of custody of the child pursuant to s. 36(3) of the Child and Family Services Act. This shall be done on a transitional basis as determined by the Ministry with the child to be completely returned to the mother within 30 days of this order. There was no evidence presented at trial regarding attempts by the Ministry to pursue any less intrusive alternatives and instead proceeded directly to the most severe position being a permanent order. The evidence did not justify the Ministry's position.","The Ministry brings an application for a permanent order for the child, T.J.E.S., born April 19, 2010 pursuant to s. 37 of The Child and Family Services Act. The biological parents oppose the application and submit that the child should be returned to the mother. HELD: The application is granted. The court must look at various factors including (without meaning to be exhaustive of the possibilities) any changes in circumstance or conduct of the parent that has occurred or is proposed, any plan of corrective action that is being advanced, the nature of any resources suggested and the time frames which may be involved. The options in s.37(1) are premised upon a reasonable prospect of change, within reasonable length of time and reasonable use of resources if needed. The Court must consider the appropriate order under s. 36 in accordance with the principles set out in EK.S. The child is in need of protection and the burden is on the Ministry to establish its case on the balance of probabilities being the civil burden of proof. The children have been placed into the temporary custody of the Minister, and the parents wish to have the children returned to them, they must make efforts to improve or remove the conditions or circumstances in the home which have resulted in the children being taken from the parents. The mother is to supervise visits. The father is to be responsible for the visits. If the child is not in need protection, the court must order the mother to be permanently committed to the Minister. The parents are to be paid for the visitations. The Ministry is to provide support to the parents and the child's parents. HOLD: The Court is satisfied that the children are in need and that the appropriate orders are made pursuant to the Act. If there is a reasonable possibility that an adoption plan would be made for the children, the Court is of the opinion that the parents have altered their ways such that an adopted plan would not be made. The order is based on the parenting capacity assessments of Francis Stewart, Dr. Tim Greenough, the previous family history and decision to apply for a Permanent Order. The Order is an interim order that is subject to further order of superior court. The Children's Safety Act is an Act that provides that the best interests of the child are paramount.

4_2013skqb207.txt,"The issue to be determined was whether the parties' children should remain in La Ronge or be relocated to live with the respondent in Melville on an interim basis. The parties were in a common law relationship and had two children, aged 9 and 12. After separation, the children resided with their mother, the respondent, in La Ronge and they had access with the petitioner on the weekends. In January 2011, the parties agreed to a weekly co-parenting arrangement. In April 2013 the petitioner was advised by the respondent that she and the children had moved to Melville. Up until that point the child had always resided in the La Ronge area and attended only one school. HELD: The Court found the co-parenting arrangement to be the de facto parenting arrangement and that there was no risk to the children with either parent. The Court ordered that the parties were joint custodians of the children and that preservation of the status quo was in their best interests. The Court ordered that the children primarily reside in La Ronge with the petitioner and attend school there. The Court also ordered specified access for the respondent.","FIAT: The Court of Appeal granted interim custody. The parties were to be joint custodial parents for the two boys. The Court found on the evidence that the parties were going to be the joint custodians for the boys. HELD: The interim order was granted. The children were to have their primary residence with the petitioner in Air Ronge, Saskatchewan. The respondent was entitled to interim access every second weekend commencing Friday, May 31, 2013 to Sunday, June 2, 2013. This co-parenting was a de facto co- parenting arrangement between the parties. There was no risk for the children in the care of either the petitioner or the respondent. The preservation of the status quo was in the best interests of the two young boys."
4_2016skqb136.txt,"Family Law – Custody and Access – InterimThe petitioner and the respondent had four children during the course of their marriage. They separated in 2010 and the petitioner applied for interim orders, including arrangements for the parenting of the children. The court made an interim order that the parties would have joint custody with the primary residence of the children to be with the petitioner. The respondent would have access at reasonable times and on every other weekend. The parties reconciled for two years but then separated again. In 2012 the petitioner applied for an order enforcing the 2010 interim custody order. At that application, the court found that both parents were capable of parenting, but in the short term it confirmed terms of the 2010 order. A number of pre-trial conferences were held without resolving matters, and during that time, the parenting arrangements changed substantially. The oldest child began residing with the respondent in December 2014. In December 2015, the second oldest child began residing with the respondent. They stayed with the petitioner on alternate weekends. The applicant then brought this application for an order pursuant to ss. 23(1)(a) and (e) of The Children’s Law Act and pursuant to the 2012 court order, confirming the original interim order that the four children of the marriage have their interim primary residence with her and that the respondent have specified parenting time on one day each week and alternating weekends. The petitioner alleged that the respondent was attempting to influence the two youngest children to reside with him. HELD: The court ordered that the status quo parenting arrangement should remain in place until trial. In this case, the status quo was not the arrangements as they had been in 2010 and in 2012. The court found that the arrangements had evolved since the 2010 order by agreement of the parties and the changes had not occurred because the respondent was attempting to alienate the children from the petitioner.","The parties separated in July 2010. Since then they have had ongoing disputes about the parenting of their children and the division of family property. The petitioner applied for interim orders dealing with, inter alia, the parenting and spousal support, exclusive possession of the family home and division of Family Property. The respondent granted interim custody to the children, with primary residence to the petitioner and exclusive possession to the respondent. The parties have been cohabitating for approximately 3 and a half years. The children have primarily resided with the petitioner. The interim custody order for the children is in effect. The Court reviewed the circumstances of the children and found that the respondent was attempting to influence the children to reside with the respondent and that the parties had engaged in parental alienation. The court found that although the respondent's parenting arrangements evolved for the parties, they were not in any way intended to fetter a different conclusion based on evidence that may be available at trial. The order was in reality an application for an order substituting a completely different parenting regime for the four children. The parents had agreed to a two-week interim parenting period. The mother had indicated that she was concerned about the children's outbursts of anger and wanted them to spend more time with the father. The father had indicated to the mother that he would like the children for the last half of the school year. The child's primary residence was with the mother. The two parties had reconciled and the mother had agreed that the children would spend more of the time with her. The only reference to the parenting was to the father's parenting time. The agreement between the parties was that the mother would have the primary residence with the child. The Father was to have the interim residence with her until further order. The Children's Home was to remain with the husband. The Mother was to continue to have primary residence. The Family Property Act requires that all children have primary residences with the Father. The Order of the Judge states that the interim parenting time will be on Wednesdays from 3:20 until 7:00 PM and alternating weekends and weekday overnights. The primary residence of the petitioner shall be with the wife. The wife shall have interim exclusive possession until further orders. The husband shall have exclusive possession and the household goods contained therein until further court order. HELD: The interim parenting order of the respondent is in place. The application is to obtain an order eliminating the parenting arrangements that have evolved for children in a manner that would change the primary residency of the parties and severely restrict the"
4_2016skqb160.txt,"Criminal Law – Assault with a WeaponCriminal Law – Defences – Self-defence The accused was charged with assault by threatening to use a weapon, a butcher knife, contrary to s. 267(a) of the Criminal Code. The accused was panhandling outside a store when he and one of two security officers had a verbal confrontation. The accused walked towards the security officer with a butcher knife. The security officer ran to his vehicle and the accused followed him and slashed a tire on the security officer’s vehicle. The attending officer was directed to a yard where he located the accused. A knife was also located in the yard. A videotape from the store was entered as an exhibit and played for the court. The accused was considerably smaller than either of the security officers. The accused testified that he was homeless and had a lot to drink the day of the incident. He indicated that he “blacked out” and was in front of two security officers when he came to. He said that he offered them a cigarette for being in their personal space and one of the men told him that he would punch him out. The accused indicated that he got the knife out of the bag just to show the men that he was bigger than them. He said that he did not intend to stab them. At one point the accused admitted following the security officer to his vehicle and at another point said he did not. The accused said he then tried to get away from the area but was prevented from doing so by a large black vehicle. The accused said he eventually stabbed the vehicle’s tire because it was blocking his way and he went into panic mode. The accused raised the issue of self-defence. HELD: There was no question that the Crown established the offence beyond a reasonable doubt. The court found that the accused initiated the confrontation by walking up to the security officer and getting very close to him. The court found that the Crown witness’s evidence was preferred over the accused’s where it differed, namely the slashing of the vehicle tires. The court accepted the accused’s submission that the security officer told the accused to get out of his face or he would knock him out or something to that effect. The court considered the factors set out in s. 34(2) and concluded that the force or threat faced by the accused due to the size of the security officers and the words used by one of them did not warrant the action taken by the accused. The court offered numerous reasons for the conclusion: the accused initiated the confrontation; the security guard did not touch or further go after the accused; no physical force was used against the accused; and there was no history between the accused and security officer. The accused’s actions were out of proportion to any reasonable response to any threat. The court held that the Crown established, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the facts and circumstances of the case did not give rise to the defence of self-defence. The accused was found guilty as charged.","The accused was charged with assault contrary to s. 267(a) of the Criminal Code. The accused was a member of the First Nations community and was homeless at the time. He was in a car with his companion when the confrontation occurred. The complainant was injured in the confrontation and the accused chased him to his vehicle. The confrontation was described as a knife fight. The defendant was armed with a knife and the complainant was chased by the accused. The Crown called five witnesses who gave evidence at trial. The first witness testified that the complainant said words to the effect 'Get the fuck out of my face or I'll beat the fuck up of you' to the accused, who was armed and wearing a knife. The second witness testified the complainant threw a bottle of beer at the accused and the knife was in his hand. The third witness testified he saw the accused run into the back alley and the confrontation with the knife. HELD: The accused's actions were not reasonable in the circumstances and did not constitute lawful protection of himself from any use or threatened use of force against him. The Court concluded that the nature of the force or threat that was presented by the size of the complainant and the words used by the defendant were not of a nature that would warrant, as reasonable, the action subsequently taken by the complainant against the accused; the accused was found guilty of assault for a number of reasons. 1) When one considers the factors set out in s. 34(a), the Court concluded, in all of the circumstances, that the accused initiated the confrontation by walking up to him and in close quarters, as the complainant himself testified, getting into his personal space. The evidence proves that the defendant said something to the complainant that caused him to become upset, go to his dufflebag, retrieve the large butcher knife and to run towards the two men who were walking towards him. There was no question that the Crown had established that the offence charged occurred on the date and at the location alleged in the indictment and that the butcher knife entered as Exhibit P1 is clearly a weapon as defined by s. 2 of the Code. 2) The Court found that the Court found and concluded that it was the accused who initiated the encounter between the complainant, the accused in the parking lot and the two other men, who were in close proximity, that both the complainant's and the defendant's knives were not in the nature that a reasonable response to any threat that the person may have perceived was made by the person in the case of this case.

Quite apart from certification and voluntary recognition, the union could attain bargaining rights pursuant to Part II of the Trade Union Act, which allowed an employer in the construction industry to assign bargaining and negotiating rights to an 'accredited employers' association' such as the Construction Management Labour Bureau Ltd.

The defendants had previously been permitted to re-open judgments obtained against them and had filed defences. Prior to that they had consistently failed to attend examinations in aid of execution. Contempt proceedings had been commenced against them but were adjourned sine die at the time the defendants were permitted to defend. The defendants resisted the application on the basis that they were now non-residents and not compellable by an appointment, and that the designated officer of the defendant corporation was no longer an officer. This information had not been communicated to the plaintiff's solicitor who had acted in good faith on information given to him previously by the solicitors for the defendants. The examinations had been scheduled unilaterally because the defendants' solicitor consistently refused or neglected to return phone calls or correspondence from the plaintiff's solicitors. HELD: The judge refused to strike the defences holding that in the circumstances Queen's Bench Rule 231 did not apply. He also held that the defendants, considering their conduct throughout the whole course of the lawsuit, were in contempt and ordered them to attend without conduct money any examinations unilaterally scheduled by the plaintiff failing agreement between counsel as to dates. Costs were fixed at $1,500 in any event of the cause and were ordered to be paid within two weeks.","The plaintiff applied to strike the statement of defence of the corporate defendant, Great Canadian Bingo Corp. on the ground that the designated officer of the corporation failed to appear at an examination for discovery on November 23, 1993. The plaintiff's solicitors had on several occasions telephoned the defendant's solicitor to schedule examinations for discovery and to obtain statements as to documents. None of the calls were returned. The defendant's solicitor wrote to the plaintiff's solicitor proposing a range of dates for the examinations for which the plaintiff was to be examined. The solicitor replied that he was not aware that judgment had been entered against him and that he would need the appropriate conduct money. The defendants' solicitor responded that he had not received the necessary information and that the plaintiff had not made any enquiries as to the proper officer. The court found that the defendants had not followed proper procedure and that they had made inappropriate assumptions about the credibility of the officer. HELD: The application was dismissed. 1)The defendant's conduct exhibited throughout the whole of these proceedings was guilty of contempt of court. The contempt proceedings were still before the court even though they were adjourned sine die at the time the defendants were permitted to file statements of defence. The Court found that on the basis of the conduct of the defendants and their solicitor, the plaintiff could not strike the defence of their defence. 2)The defendants were not entitled to any conduct money for the initial attendances at the examinations and for any subsequent attendances required for the completion of the examinations. The conduct of these solicitors did not lead to the conclusion that the officer or director of the defendant corporation was no longer an officer or a director of it. The breach of the contract between the solicitors for the parties as to acceptable dates for examinations for the discovery and the proper officers for the examination was a serious breach of contract. The solicitors were not required to provide written notice of the person who it proposed was the proper police officer to be inspected on its behalf. 3)The plaintiff was not entitled any conduct for the first attendance at the examination for the purpose of setting the dates. The second reason was that the solicitor had not been properly advised of the proper duties of the officers. 4)The court found the defendants guilty of breach of probation."

HELD: The imposition of trust conditions on the disclosure of victim's statements and videotaped statements in cases of sexual assault does not prevent the accused from exercising his right to make full answer and defence as guaranteed by ss. 7 and 11 of the Charter. The obligation to disclose is not absolute.

In so doing, it asked that its solicitor, Mr. Hesje, be appointed as selling officer to conduct the sale and report to the Court. The court expressed its concern to Mr. Hesje during the course of his submissions as to the propriety of the applicant solicitor serving in such a dual function. He informed the court that some members of our Court have allowed this to be done, others have declined. In the court's respectful view, it is not appropriate for the Court to appoint, as selling officer, the solicitor for the applicant creditor. There are obvious difficulties with conflict of interest. Who does the selling officer serve: the Court, from which his or her authority originates; or the client? The matter is of sufficient importance that the court concluded it should reduce its thoughts to a fiat and direct that it be distributed to other members of the Court. To be fair, Mr. Hesje indicated he was perfectly willing to have another member of the Law Society unconnected to the proceedings appointed as selling officer.

5_2004skqb417.txt,"Each party has applied for a variation of the judgment granted by Gunn J. in April 1999. The judgment incorporates the terms of an Interspousal Contract dated April 1999 that provides for basic child support to be paid by the petitioner in the amount of $1,411 per month. The calculation of child support in the Interspousal Contract was based on the petitioner earning $110,000. The petitioner seeks to have child support reduced for Kimberly and discontinued for Ashley. The petitioner has unilaterally terminated support for Ashley on the basis that she is over 18 years of age and not in full time attendance at school. The respondent seeks an upward variation of ongoing child support for Kimberly on the basis that the petitioner's income is significantly higher than $110,000. She also seeks a retroactive variation of support paid for both girls. HELD: 1) The parties agree that much of the petitioner's income since the separation has included significant amounts of non-recurring income in the form of capital gains, stock options and severance pay. In accordance with s. 16 of the Guidelines, a payor's income for child support purposes is determined based on total income, adjusted in accordance with Schedule III, as shown on his or her income tax return. The petitioner has provided no compelling reason to exclude any of his non-recurring income. To the contrary, it is the fairest way of proceeding. The petitioner's income since separation discloses that non-recurring income can realistically be anticipated in the future, as it has constituted a significant portion of his income in four of the last five years. The fairest way of determining the appropriate level of child support is by calculating it based on his income during the previous year. 2) The petitioner's line 150 income on his 2003 income tax return was $199,922. This includes $114,454 of non-recurring capital gain income from the sale of shares in Poplar Hill Resources. It does not include the non-taxable portion of that capital gain in the same amount. Pursuant to Clause 6 of Schedule III referred to in s. 16 of the Guidelines, this non-taxable amount is to be included as an adjustment to income. This results in the petitioner's 2003 income for child support purposes being $314,376. However, in examining documents provided by the petitioner regarding his previous year's income, it is apparent that he incurred net capital losses in 2002 of $65,424. The Court imputed $150,000 of income to the petitioner for the year 2002 despite this net capital loss and his line 150 income being only $2,410. It is therefore reasonable that this capital loss be deducted from the non-taxable portion of the capital gain he realized in 2003. This results in only $49,030 of the non-taxable portion of the 2003 capital gain being added to income for total income of $248,952. Based on the Guidelines, child support of $1,928 would be payable for Kimberly.  3) During the same year that the petitioner was enjoying income in excess of $248,000, the respondent's income for herself and the two children was only $24,345. It is self-evident that the petitioner has a substantially greater ability to provide financial support for Kimberly than does the respondent. In the circumstances it is appropriate that one-half of the Guideline amount for the petitioner's income in excess of $150,000 be payable as child support. Effective January 1, 2004, the petitioner shall pay monthly child support for Kimberly of $1,557.  4) Ashley did not complete grade 12 until June 2003. In the normal course, she would have graduated in June 2002, but she was short some classes. The required classes were not available in September 2002 so she did not return to school until the new semester in January 2003. Although Ashley was not in full time attendance in school during the last six months of 2002, she had not yet completed her basic education and had every intention of doing so. She was not in a position to withdraw from her parent's support. Considering the disparity in the ability of each of her parent to contribute to her support, it is appropriate that support for Ashley be the amount determined by applying the Guidelines as if she were a child under the age of majority.  5) A written request by the respondent for the petitioner to provide copies of his income tax returns is not required because the parties incorporated a positive obligation to exchange tax returns in their Interspousal Contract. Consistent with the objectives of the Guidelines and implicit in the Interspousal Contract the parties must have understood that the petitioner's child support obligation could change if his income changed. 6) This is clearly a case where a retroactive variation is warranted. No variation can be considered for 1999, the year of the Interspousal Contract and the judgment. Given the various sources of the petitioner's income and the significant annual fluctuations in his income, it is appropriate to use his previous year's income as the basis for calculation of his child support payable in the subsequent year. The Court went on to calculate the petitioner's income and the child support payable for each year. 7) In 2002 the petitioner's line 150 income was only $2,410. Given the pattern of the petitioner's income in the three preceding years, along with the fact that he disposed of capital assets in 2003 that generated undisclosed cash flow, and, some 2 years later, he nevertheless retains significant net assets, the Court imputed additional income to the petitioner of $150,000 for child support purposes. 8) The respondent was awarded costs set at $2,600.","Each party applied for a variation of the 1999 Family Planning Guideline. The Family Planning Guidelines provide for basic child support to be paid by the respondent. The respondent acknowledges that he has unilaterally terminated support for his two children. The parties have not experienced the standard of living they enjoyed while the parties were together. The children have not been able to take vacations or participate in activities they might otherwise have chosen to do. HELD: 1) The respondent has a substantially greater ability to provide financial support for the children than the respondent does. It is self-evident that the respondent has substantially greater capacity to provide support for Kimberly than does the respondent, given the unpredictable, variable and to some degree speculative aspect of much of the respondent's post-separation income. 2) The Guideline amount or some other amount should be used to calculate child support on an income in excess of $150,000. The Court has discretion as to whether the Guideline amounts or some variation of support are warranted. The court found that this is clearly a case where a retroactive variation is warranted."
5_2005nssc172.txt,"The parents applied for leave to apply to terminate a permanent care and custody order respecting their three children. Proposed Notices of Adoption were filed for two of the children after the parents' application was filed but before it was heard. The order had been made due to, inter alia, issues of poor hygiene and nutrition; lack of supervision; domestic disputes; physical risk to the children due to inappropriate discipline; the mother's explosive temper and mental health; the father's anger; lack of insight, desire or inability to improve by the parents; inability to control themselves during access or exercise access meaningfully and an all-consuming anger and preoccupation with the Agency. Since the order was made, the mother was diagnosed with and now receiving medication for bipolar and obsessive compulsive disorders. Application for leave granted; access not ordered at the present time; supplemental affidavits and viva voce evidence were considered given that the parents had only obtained counsel after the application was filed and the nature of the issue at stake; the application could not be arrested simply because the Agency had taken steps to have the children adopted after the application was filed. Some of the factors leading to the permanent care order were being addressed by the parents, although they had not been fully dealt with; the main achievements so far appeared to be an improvement in the parents' relationship, the courses of counselling and parenting instruction they had embarked upon, an expressed willingness by the mother to undertake psychotherapy, the mother's diagnosis and medication and the parents' changed attitude towards cooperation with the Agency; these are significant building blocks on which to anchor intense parental counselling","The applicants applied for leave to terminate an order for permanent care and custody respecting their three children. The applicants had been diagnosed with bipolar disorder and obsessive compulsive disorder. Prior to January 2005 prospective adoptive parents for the children gave notice of proposed adoption. The applicant had taken parenting courses and had taken marriage counselling. She had deferred to her wife because she had prior dealings with the Agency. The Agency opposed the application on the basis that the applicants had not made sufficient progress sufficient to justify granting leave to apply to terminate the order. The application was adjourned several times and the applicants were not permitted to speak with the judge. The court found that the Court lacked jurisdiction to hear the application to terminate in respect of the applicants. The Court found that there was no new evidence of parenting courses, marriage counselling or parenting counselling. The affidavits provided by the applicants provided by their supervisor and the mother of the children were not correct. The affidavit provided by M.S. also stated that the applicant had not taken any courses in order to control her anger and that she had made significant changes since the beginning of the application. The mother of three children, who is also diagnosed with ADD, was diagnosed with ADHD and obsessive-compulsive disorder and had been prescribed medication. The father of three, who suffers from ADD, is now taking medication. He is taking medication to help him manage his anger and depression. The children are doing well and the father is doing well. The parents are doing very well. They are working hard to improve their parenting skills and are making a positive change. The child is doing very good. The only thing that is lacking is a positive attitude. The best parenting is for the child to be able to parent. The parenting is so important that it is not only for the parents but for the entire family. The agency is not interested in the children. It is not the Agency's job to provide parenting services. The family is not violent. The issues are the parenting of the three children and the children's best interests. The long-term best interests of the family are better served if they were in their parents' care. The evidence is that the Agency has made some positive changes. The prognosis may have been improved if the applicants demonstrated any level of cooperation with the agency. The"
5_2005skqb219.txt,"The accused has been in custody since November 17, 2004. After show cause hearings, the court refused to release the accused from detention. The accused apply for a review of the detention orders. HELD: 1) A review of the detention orders would ordinarily be cursory and the applications dismissed. The reasons for the decisions to refuse to release the accused cannot seriously be questioned. 2) However, a factor that causes concern is that 6 months after their arrest, not only has a preliminary hearing not been conducted, no date for a preliminary hearing has been set. No preliminary hearing date will be set before May 2005. The preliminary hearing will take 2 to 3 weeks.  It seems unlikely that the trial of these individuals will take place within a year of the date of their arrest. 3) They are ordered released on terms and upon the filing of security in the amount of $1,000.","The accused were charged with a multitude of offences pursuant to the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act, which include trafficking in cocaine and methamphetamine, conspiracy to do so with one another and several other individuals, and several Criminal Code offences, including possession of proceeds of crime. Both individuals were in custody since November 2004. HELD: The accused were released from detention. 1) The accused was released on a recognizance. The court ordered that the accused be released upon entering into a recognizaance. 2) The court noted that the defence had not indicated that the trial of the accused would take place within a year of the date of their arrest. 3) The Court noted that it was unlikely that the court would accommodate the accused's application for release. 4) The defence had indicated that it would be several weeks thereafter in view of the anticipated length of the preliminary hearing, before transcripts of the evidence are available. The accused's defence had stated that the hearing would consist of a new defence number. 5) The trial of these accused would not take place in a year. The Court was of the view that the Court could accommodate the application for a new hearing. 6) The judge's order to release the accused was to ensure his attendance in court and, having regard to all the circumstances presented to her, the substantial likelihood that the defendant would, if released from custody, commit a criminal offence. The judge would ordinarily be cursory in that respect."
5_2006nssc353.txt,"The claimant flooring dealer had supplied and installed a large amount of flooring in the defendant's new home. Although the defendant had visited the claimant's store and selected the flooring, the actual purchase was made by the defendant's contractor who did not pay the claimant and had now declared bankruptcy. The adjudicator found that although the three criteria for an unjust enrichment claim had been met, there was no special relationship between the parties and thus, denied the claim. The claimant appealed. Appeal allowed; the absence of a special relationship will not automatically defeat a claim of unjust enrichment; the Small Claims Court has the equitable jurisdiction to determine unjust enrichment claims.","This was an appeal from a decision by an Adjudicator of the Small Claims Court. The Court of Appeal held that there was a special relationship between the parties, frequently contractual at the outset, which relationship would have made it unjust for the defendant to retain the benefit conferred on him by the plaintiff benefit, that was not conferred 'officiously' and that such a relationship would not necessarily defeat a claim. The absence of a special bond will not necessarily destroy a claim and the absence of such a connection will not defeat it."
5_2009nspc10.txt,"The accused was arrested for possession of drugs and a weapon, and for breaching his probation. Police testified they saw him walking down the street at 10am and noticed a strong smell of marijuana. When approached, he was smoking a cigarette in front of the provincial courthouse. He said he had smoked marijuana on the street, but did not have any other drugs on him. After they spoke, he asked to leave, saying he was late for a court appointment. The police asked him to deal with this matter first, ran a CPIC check and discovered the accused was on probation and required to keep the peace and be of good behaviour. He was not cautioned/advised of his right to counsel until he was arrested on the basis of what the Crown claimed was a reasonable belief the accused possessed drugs. Police conducted a 'pat-down' search, and found drugs (marijuana and cocaine) and a weapon. The accused argued his Charter rights were violated (s. 8, 9 and 10(b)) and asked the court to exclude the evidence obtained in the search. He also argued his admission/statement was not voluntary and should be excluded on the basis that it was given in the context of a violation of his Charter rights. Motions to exclude the statement and evidence obtained in the search denied. The accused's s. 8 and 9 rights were not breached. While his s. 10(b) rights were violated when he asked to leave and the officers asked him to deal with this first (which amounted to detention), his admission/statement was made before the detention and was voluntary. Further, no evidence was obtained as a result of the breach since the search only took place after the arrest/cautioning. After reviewing the relevant jurisprudence, the court concluded: the Crown must prove the arresting officer subjectively believed they found an offence apparently being committed; that subjective belief must be objectively reasonable; police may rely on an inference in forming their belief (such as the inference that marijuana smokers typically carry a supply with them); and that inference must be objectively reasonable in light of the circumstances and facts of the case. Here, the officer's subjective belief that the accused was in possession of drugs was objectively reasonable. The court accepted her evidence that she had special training in identifying the smell of marijuana and distinguishing between a strong and faint smell of marijuana. The CPIC check showed he was on probation in relation to a drug charge. Since the officer had the authority to arrest under s. 495(1)(b) of the Criminal Code, the arrest was lawful. The search taking place incidental to the arrest was reasonable. In obiter, the court went on to say that, even if the accused's s. 8 and 9 Charter rights had been breached, an analysis under s. 24 would lead to a decision not to exclude the evidence: it was not conscriptive; the offence was serious; there was no bad faith on the part of police; and the accused could have lawfully been arrested for admitting to what was a breach of his probation.","The accused was charged with possession of marijuana for the purpose of trafficking and possession of cocaine for the purposes of trafficking. The accused was stopped by police on foot patrol on the sidewalk near the courthouse. The officers observed the accused walking east on the street and noticed a strong smell of marijuana coming from the accused. The officer observed the smell of cannabis in the accused's breath and noticed that he was smoking a cigarette. The police approached the accused and smelled marijuana. The arrest was found to be unlawful and the cannabis was excluded. The statement of the accused to the police occurred before the officer was detained and, therefore, before the triggering of a police duty to advise him of his rights. The Court of Appeal held that the accused believed that his statement to the officer constituted reasonable grounds. The court also held that there was no breach of the officer's s. 8 and s. 9 Charter rights. HELD: The accused's statement to police was found not to be free and voluntary. The evidence supported the defence's claim that the officer had reasonable grounds to detain the accused prior to his release. The fact that the police had no warning that the smell was coming from within the accused’s breath and that the breath was consistent with the smell, did not constitute a violation of the defence’ s. 10(b) rights."
5_2010nspc18.txt,"The on-site supervisor was convicted of two offences under the Fall Protection and Scaffolding Regulations (failing to ensure a guardrail was installed at the perimeter of the work area and failing to ensure that an intermediate or 'mid' guardrail was installed) after a mason was killed when he fell from scaffolding on the job site. Prior to the mason beginning work for the day and the supervisor temporarily leaving the site, he had told another employee to install a 'mid' guardrail but no such rail was in place when the mason fell. The court found that having decided to use guardrails, the defendant was required to make certain that those guardrails were, in fact, constructed in the manner prescribed in the regulations and to supervise and inspect the scaffolding before work was undertaken, no matter the experience level of his crew. In regard to the first count, what the supervisor thought might be a substitute for part of a proper guardrail system did not comply with the regulations. The defendant will donate $2,000 to the Public Education Trust Fund and make 18 presentations at various venues over the next 18 months; he will appear in court on a specified date to provide a status report on his progress in this regard. This was not a case of reckless disregard or deliberate indifference to the legislated safety measures and the defendant's degree of moral blameworthiness was at the lower end of the continuum as he neither created nor negligently left in place a hidden hazard. Both the actions of another workman and the deceased's own actions had contributed to the fall.","The defendant was found guilty of two counts of the Occupational Health and Safety Act and one count of failing to ensure a guardrail was installed as required by the Act and the Fall Protection and Scaffolding Regulations. He was working on a work platform supported by scaffolding that was approximately 13 feet above the concrete sidewalk. As he stepped out and reached to secure his block or level line, he placed one foot on the open edge of a false ceiling suspended by wires under the roof overhang. When he placed his weight on that false ceiling, it gave way and the defendant fell down onto the concrete. He suffered serious injuries and was hospitalized for a short time. The defendant was fined $8,050. The Court reviewed other cases and found that the defendant had a considerable degree of restraint as he turned his mind to the issue of safety concerns and the safety of the workers. The court found that he made an error in believing that the steel I-beam supporting the roof above the sidewalk could substitute as a top-rail in the circumstances of this case. The facts of the case and all of the legal issues were set out in the decision. The defendants were found guilty in both cases of failure to properly supervise the labourer and to inspect the guardrails before work was commenced in that area. The actions of the defendant contributed to the hazard of the worker working at heights without any fall protection measures in place. The failure of the labourerer to properly inspect the scaffolding when work re-commenced did not require the installation of a top guardrail. The lack of top-rails on the work platform was a result of the foreman actually turning his mind and making an error. The breach of the defendants' duty to properly monitor and inspect the guardsrails was not an accident waiting to happen. The breaches of the safety measures and the failure to take proper precautions contributed to a hazard of Mr. Myles working at a height of 16 floors. He died as a result. The Defendant was fined a fine of $8.050. Looking at those cases compared to this case and bearing in mind principles of proportionality and parity, the defendant did not create or negligently leave in place a hidden hazard, which caused Mr. Eagles to fall off the work platforms. The negligence of the Defendant was not a factor to be considered in the assessment in the penalty as it was relevant to the issues of moral blameworthiness and the specific results or consequences, which arose from the contraventions of the Act."

The original mortgage executed by the plaintiff was for $191,000 of which $176,000 was advanced to purchase her condominium and $15,000, eight per cent of the total, was advanced for other purchases. The property sold for $156,000 pursuant to a judicial sale. The sale proceeds were distributed to pay outstanding property taxes, commission, and the principal and interest due under the mortgage in the amount of $141,945 and the net sale proceeds were to be distributed pro rata. As at November 1, 2017, the principal and interest owing on the non-purchase money portion of the mortgage was $21,250. The plaintiff requested judgment for the deficiency in the amount of $9,900 with interest to the date of judgment. It claimed it was entitled to solicitor-client costs and other costs accrued by it under the mortgage. The issue was whether such costs should be subject to the pro rata calculation for the nonpurchase portion of the mortgage, that is, 8 percent of the total costs incurred.  HELD: The application was granted. The court found that the plaintiff was entitled to a deficiency judgment for principal and interest owed under the mortgage in the amount requested. It was also entitled to judgment against the mortgagee for eight percent of the solicitor-client costs, condominium fees and property management charges.","FIAT. The plaintiff applies by notice of application for a deficiency judgment against the defendant, Doreen Pearl Partridge, pertaining to the non-purchase money portion of the outstanding indebtedness to her mortgage. RBC applies to have solicitor's costs assessed on solicitor's and costs assessed. The issue is whether the pro rata distribution applies solely to the indebtedness of principal and accrued interest or applies to all costs of the mortgage including solicitor's fees. The condominium fees paid by the plaintiff are assessments levied against the mortgagor's land and are recoverable under the terms of the Mortgage. The pro rat calculation of the non‑purchase funds mortgage is 8% of the total outstanding mortgage amount. HELD: The plaintiff is entitled to a deficiency judgement for principal and interest owed under the mortgage in the amount requested.  1) The pro-rata calculation of a non-Purch money mortgage is a calculation of all costs which are part of the amount of the current mortgage amount and the pro-rate calculation of that same mortgage is 7% of that amount. 2) The cond condominium fee paid by RBC are assessments against the title of the condominium owner's unit for unpaid contributions to the common expense fund or the reserve fund. These are charges that are allowable pursuant to s. 11 of The Limitation of Civil Rights Act, RSS 1978, L‑16 [LCRA]. 3) The plaintiff also applies to the cond cond cond condo corporation to have its lawyers' costs assessed and to have the judgment for the deficiency amount set. The solicitor's cost is assessed on a solicitor's basis. The judgment for condominium costs and the solicitor's expenses are directed to the solicitor-client costs.  4) The issue in this case is whether such costs should be subject to the pro analysis calculation for the non‐purchase part of a mortgage is whether this is an issue that is squarely within the reference point referred to in CIBC Mortgages Inc. Greyeyes, 2017 SKQB 216. The issues are whether the solicitor‑client costs, condominiums and property management charges ought to be added to the deficiency judgment, along with the prorated principal and principal and Interest due.

HELD: Conviction set aside; absolute discharge granted.","The appellant appeals the sentence imposed by the trial judge after a trial where he was found guilty of assault contrary to s.267(1)(b) of the Code. He was fined $1200, with a surcharge of $120 and placed on probation for 12 months. The sole issue on the sentence appeal is whether the trial decision erred in not ordering an unconditional discharge in the circumstances of this essentially domestic altercation. The appellant is 38 years old and at the time of the offence was employed as a long distance trucker by Westcan Bulk Transport. He had no criminal record. He advised his employer that because of the nature of their business and uncertainty surrounding the appellant's ability to enter the United States as a driver of one of their trucks, they had no choice but to terminate his employment. The employer advised the appellant that because he could not gain entry to the United STATES as a trucker, they could terminate his job.

HELD: Appeal dismissed. 1)The legislation provides for an appeal to the Court of Queen's Bench and for no further appeal. Such an appeal can be taken on the following grounds: (a)the committee exceeded its jurisdiction; (b)it failed to observe the rules of natural justice; (c)it made an error of law; (d)its findings can not be reasonably supported by the evidence which it was entitled to consider. 2) The Court found no error of jurisdiction or failure to observe the rules of natural justice. 3)The Court found no palpable or overriding error in the facts as determined by the Committee based on the evidence.",This was another appeal in a series of cases wherein a medical doctor has been reassessed and ordered to repay money already received as a result of services provided to patients.

HELD: The Committee's decision was set aside on the merits. 1)The Committee exceeded its jurisdiction by basing its decision on irrelevant considerations and thereby abused its discretion and further acted on inadequate materials. 2)The committee did not have jurisdiction to enter into the investigation of the physician. The Committee did not exercise its discretion to determine whether the physician's pattern of medical practice was reasonable. The committee did have the power to refer matters to the Committee on the basis of money paid to the physician for services performed. 3)The Court was not entitled to interfere with the Committee's determination of the medical practice.
6_1997canlii9876.txt,"The respondent was hired as an account manager by the appellant. She did not reach her planned sales goals during her employment, and became depressed. She took six weeks off work on the advice of her doctor. When she returned from sick leave she was dismissed by the appellant, who had already decided to terminate her employment after concluding that she was not able to handle the job. She claimed damages for mental distress for the sudden and callous manner in which she had been dismissed. The jury awarded the respondent $20,000 in lieu of notice and $60,000 damages for mental distress. The appellant appealed the award for mental distress. Per Hallett, J.A., Roscoe, J.A., concurring, allowing the appeal, that the suddenness and callousness of a dismissal does not constitute conduct that gives rise to an actionable wrong separate and apart from the cause of action for the dismissal without notice. Per Freeman, J.A., dissenting, dismissing the appeal, that a degree of mental distress is always likely to accompany the termination of employment. However, when the employer's conduct aggravates the mental distress beyond the degree which can be remedied by agreement or reasonable notice, a right to further damages arises.","The appellant Healthvision Corporation appealed a jury award of $60,000 damages for mental distress brought by the respondent. The appellant had no history of sales in the Atlantic Provinces and it was expected to take three or four years to develop the territory. The respondent had been hired as account manager with sales territory consisting of the four Atlantic provinces. The trial judge awarded the appellant $10,000 for mental anguish and punitive damages. The court found that mental suffering would not have been in the reasonable contemplation of the parties at the time the dismissal was made, and that the jury's assessment of damages for the mental distress was inordinately and disproportionately high."
6_1999skqb124.txt,"The plaintiff who had been employed by the defendant's predecessor for 23 years as office manager and bookkeeper until 1997, brought an action for damages against her new employers for dismissal without adequate notice. The plaintiff took stress leave and requested to be relieved of her duties as office manager in 1998. The action proceeded under the simplified procedure in Part Forty of the Queen's Bench Rules. HELD: 1)The conduct amounted to constructive dismissal entitling her to withdraw services without a reduction in the notice period. Although the defendant had numerous complaints the plaintiff was not dismissed for cause. Her termination of employment related only to her reduced position as bookkeeper which was for an indefinite period of time. Her employment had already been terminated by notice of nearly a year. She remained entitled to notice to March 31, 1999 at her salary at the time of termination and to medical expenses that would have been covered but without bonuses or extra payments for sick pay. 2)The defendant did not establish the plaintiff ought to have done more to mitigate her loss. There was no basis for punitive damages nor for an extension of the period of notice.  3)The net earnings between May 1998 and March 1999 were deducted after deducting $50 for the cost of qualifying for that employment. Amounts owing by the plaintiff to the defendant were to be deducted. 4)The plaintiff was entitled to interest in accordance with the Pre-judgment Interest Act. 5)The defendant could make no deduction for insurance benefit payments. Sections 45 and 46 of the Employment Insurance Act was drawn to their attention. 6)The plaintiff was awarded costs. Fees were to be taxed on column 2. 7)The plaintiff was to deliver a copy of the calculation of the judgment. Either could issue judgment with the other's consent as to form and content. An application for further directions could be made.","The plaintiff's action was for wrongful dismissal or, stating it more correctly, for damages for dismissal from her employment without adequate notice. The action was under the simplified procedure in Part Forty of The Queen's Bench Rules. At trial, the affidavits-in-chief of the plaintiff's witnesses were marked as plaintiff exhibits and the witnesses were called for cross-examination by the defendant followed by redirect questions from plaintiff's counsel. At the conclusion of the action, the defendant can deduct the cost of qualifying for such employment, but the plaintiff is to be deducted the amounts owing by the plaintiff to the defendant.

6_2000skqb94.txt,"A jury determined the plaintiff was constructively dismissed from his employment as park superintendent in 1997 and awarded damages for failure to give reasonable notice. The defendant claimed the contract of employment was all inclusive; that the plaintiff exaggerated the amount of time he spent on the job in winter; that the reduced winter hours were not in lieu of overtime pay as he was a manager within the meaning of s.4(2) of the LSA; the doctrine of estoppel or waiver applied as he never claimed a right to holiday pay for 10 years and the employer relied on his not doing so; if the plaintiff is entitled to holiday pay he should only recover back to April 1990 as he is limited by the Limitation of Actions Act; it should not be based on wages plus truck allowance as wages as defined in the LSA does not include allowances for costs. The claim for unpaid holiday pay claimed from April 1988 to October 1997, based on his wages plus one-half his truck expense allowance, was reserved pending a decision by the Court of Appeal as to whether the Court of Queen's Bench has jurisdiction to determine the issue of entitlement to holiday pay. HELD: The claim was dismissed with costs.  1)The Court of Appeal held in Kolodziejski v. Auto Electric Service that the Queens' Bench has jurisdiction to entertain a civil action for non-payment of holiday pay. 2)The plaintiff may rely on s.30(1) of the LSA to establish he is entitled to holidays and on s.33 to establish he entitled to pay in lieu of taking holidays. The onus then shifts to the defendant to prove it complied with some exception in the LSA. Section 75 prevents an employee from waiving his or her entitlement. Whether the plaintiff asserted his right to holiday pay or not, he remained entitled to his annual holidays in accordance with the LSA. 3)The plaintiff can claim for any holiday pay in lieu of time off that he can establish he was entitled to from April 1990 to his termination date. Section 3(1)(f)of the LAA states that a cause of action for recovery of money under a contract, express or implied, must be commenced within 6 years of the date on which the cause arose. 4)The plaintiff clearly indicated that a portion of the truck allowance was made to avoid paying tax. As such it would be contrary to public policy for the Court to appear to endorse the plaintiff's actions by calculating his holiday pay on the basis of his wage and this portion of his truck allowance.  5)The defendant's position that the contract included a component of holiday pay each month was inconsistent with its position that the plaintiff took these days off as holidays during the year. The contract of employment did not include a component of holiday pay in lieu of time off.  6)Failure by the defendant to keep records for the purpose of inspection by the minister does not result in a reverse onus. The onus remains on the plaintiff to establish what holidays he did not take. 7)The plaintiff admitted to taking time away from his duties for personal time and for city business as mayor. The plaintiff was not there in his capacity as superintendent. Section 31(1)(b) indicates that an employee shall be permitted to take holidays in one uninterrupted period. The defendant allowed the plaintiff to take days off in any manner he chose. It was inconsistent that the plaintiff's failure to comply with the notice requirement meant for the benefit of the employer could be used by an employee to disclaim that his days off were holidays. 8)The plaintiff was clearly a manager within the meaning of LSA. Even if he were not a manager, he failed to prove, on a balance of probabilities that he worked overtime hours in excess of the statutory minimum in order to qualify for overtime. Any days off taken by the plaintiff could not be considered taken in lieu of overtime. The days he was away were holidays as defined in s.30 of the LSA. 9)He did not establish he did 3 weeks holidays.","The plaintiff sued for damages from the defendant alleging he was constructively wrongfully dismissed from his employment with the defendant. The plaintiff elected to have the determination of liability and the assessment of damages determined by a civil jury. The jury determined that the plaintiff was constructally dismissed and awarded the plaintiff damages. HELD: The jury trial was to be held in front of myself as judge alone and would deal with the issues, both factual and legal, with respect to holiday pay. The defendant claims that if the court finds that the defendant's holiday pay is not all-inclusive or that it did not exceed the minimum standards set out in the LSA, the plaintiff should only be entitled to recover back to April 1990 as the plaintiff is limited by the Limitation of Actions Act. The Defendant asserts that the $250.00 portion of the truck allowance was made to avoid paying tax. The court awarded the damages for loss of his truck allowance. The Court held that the doctrine of estoppel or waiver should apply to prevent the plaintiff from claiming his entitlement to holiday leave. The doctrine of s.75 should apply because the plaintiff never claimed his right to holiday compensation for 10 years and the defendant relied on the plaintiff's conduct over the years. The claim that the plaintiffs holiday pay should only have been entitled to back to May 1990 as plaintiff is restricted by the LAA only by the LIMIT Act is limited to 6 years after the cause of action arises."
6_2001canlii365.txt,"The accused was charged with impaired driving (Criminal Code ss.255(1) and 253(a)) and with operating a motor vehicle while having a blood alcohol concentration exceeding .08 (Criminal Code ss.253(b) and 255(1)). Issues included whether the Court should enter a stay of proceedings and award costs, given the failure of the Crown to produce a standard alcohol solution (SAS); could mouth alcohol have invalidated the roadside screening test; did the arresting officer have reasonable and probable grounds to demand a breath sample; was the accused denied his right to counsel; was the breathalyzer test administered as soon as practicable; was there evidence to the contrary? HELD: The accused was found not guilty on count #2 (exceeding .08). Count #1 (impaired driving) was dismissed during the trial.  1)The court was cognizant of the burden of proof and had reviewed the decision of R. v. Lifchus concerning reasonable doubt. 2)The accused's testimony was rejected as not being credible. 3)The burden lies with the applicant on an application pursuant to ss.7 and 24(1) of the Charter in which the defence alleges the accused's right to make full answer and defence has been infringed. The question remained whether once the defence established it sought the SAS but it was not provided for whatever reason, had it discharged its burden or must it prove the failure to produce the SAS solution could have a meaningful outcome on the trial. 4)The accused's s.7 Charter right to make full answer and defence was infringed by the failure of the Crown to produce a sample of the SAS solution in this case. In light of the Bourget and Kalafut decisions, the Crown has had ample opportunity to establish a system for routinely saving the solution until after a case has been concluded. It would bring the administration of justice into disrepute were the Certificate of Analysis admitted into evidence. It was more appropriate to exclude the Certificate of Analysis than to grant a stay of proceedings.  5)Costs are rarely awarded in criminal proceedings. Given the evidence presented concerning the usefulness of testing a representative SAS ampule had it been produced, the court was not persuaded costs should be awarded. 6)There was no evidence that created a reasonable doubt as to the time that elapsed or that there may have been mouth alcohol which may have invalidated the roadside screening test. Both the subjective and objective tests were met. The arresting officer, who has no reason to believe an accused has consumed alcohol in the last 15 minutes, may administer the roadside screening test without delay, but to do so carries with it a certain risk that there may be subsequently evidence which will invalidate the results (affecting the objective element of the test). Further, the officer has no duty to routinely wait 15 minutes before administering the test nor to ask the accused whether or not alcohol has been consumed in the preceding 15 minutes. However, if there are circumstances which suggest the officer should have waited or inquired about alcohol consumption, this may affect the reasonableness of the officer's belief (the subjective test). 7)There was nothing in the evidence to support the submission that the speedometers need to be checked to support the officer's evidence. The officer was acting in the lawful execution of his duty in stopping the accused's vehicle. While doing so he detected an odour of alcohol on the accused's breath which gave rise to the demand for a roadside screening. 8)The informational component of the right to counsel was satisfied. There was no evidence the accused misunderstood his right nor that he was not given sufficient opportunity to contact counsel. He declined twice, giving a clear and unequivocal waiver. Absent special circumstance, the police cannot be expected to draw information out of the accused. 9)The samples were taken as soon as practicable. It was accepted that there was typically no one available at the detachment in the small community and was sufficient reason to not consider attending there given the proximity of the city. The officer tried the closest detachment but found no one there. It may have been more important to question the judgment of the officer to return to the Saskatoon detachment if the delay had been more significant. On the face of it, the delay of 27 minutes did not seem unreasonable. 10)The statutory presumption applied. There was no evidence to the contrary as the accused's evidence was rejected. The court reviewed R. v. Gibson and considered s.258(1)(c) and (d.1) of the Criminal Code.","The accused was charged with impaired driving contrary to s.255(1) and  operating a motor vehicle contrary to ss.253(b) and 255(1). The accused was stopped by the RCMP at 1:40 a.m. when he observed the accused driving his vehicle 70 km per hour in 40 km zone in the town of Martensville. Upon coming into contact with the accused, the officer noted a distinct smell of liquor and a slight redness in the accused's eyes. The officer asked the accused if he wished to contact a lawyer and the accused responded that he did not wish to. The accused then proceeded to the RCMP detachment, where he was asked to provide a breath sample. The police officer asked him if he could call a lawyer. The defence lawyer advised that he could not because he was not familiar with the legal advice available to him. The court reviewed the decision of the Chief Justice of Queen's Bench written at the first level of appeal and found that the Court of Appeal described the same principle as 'live issue'. The Court of Appeals reviewed the trial decision written at trial and found the Court's approach to the issue of production of the accused was to render a decision once all the evidence is before the Court; this avoids unnecessary splitting of the case. The Court also reviewed the case of R. v. Bourget written at first level and found at the second level of Appeal that the accused had no right to refuse to supply a breathalyzer to the police. The application for production of a breathalyser was dismissed. The applicant's right to be heard and to have access to the accused is not infringed upon. The only reason the accused has a right to produce a breath analyser is because the officer failed the roadside screening. The evidence of the officer's certification is not relevant to the application. The test results are the same. The breathalysers are not the same as the test results. The result of the breathalyszer is that the breathalyer is not the only tool available to the defence. The respondent's Charter rights had been breached and the only remedy was stay of proceedings. The issue of the production of ampoules is whether the accused should be produced at the request of the defence or the Crown. The fact that the respondent's charter rights had not been established is a burden on the accused. The right to production of these products is not a burden that the defence must bear."

The father now applied for interim sole custody, alleging that the ongoing extreme conflict between the parties was adversely affecting the children. An assessment recommended that the children live with the father and have access with the mother. Father granted interim sole care, custody and control of the children. The serious concerns raised by the assessment satisfied the threshold requirement of a material change in circumstances; the urgency of the concerns required immediate action.",This was an application by the respondent to vary the terms of the 2001 Corollary Relief Judgment respecting parenting arrangements. The parties had shared custody of the children for six years. The respondent applied to vary this order to vary primary care and custody of their father. The applicant argued that the current custody/access dispute was a serious issue and that the children must be placed in the most stable environment with follow-up counselling and treatment. The court found that the respondent had failed to act in the best interests of the parties. The Court found that both parents were capable of caring for the children. The only way to assist the children by creating stability in their lives was by awarding primary care to one parent. The evidence disclosed that the mother's parenting was not capable of providing the children with the basic needs they needed. The father's refusal to implement the assessment recommendations and the assessment recommendation were flawed. The children's best interests were best served by being placed in primary care with the father.

The respondent companies that acquired an interest in the subject land subsequent to the caveat being removed opposed the application based, among other things, on the principle of indefeasibility of title, as did the Registrar of Land Titles. HELD: The application is dismissed with costs to the respondents. 1) Even if the caveat was removed improperly, the Court ought not to retroactively reinstate it, because to do so would defeat the fundamental principle of indefeasibility of title that has been continued in The Land Titles Act, 2000; and 2) it would not be appropriate to permit the applicants to attempt to access the assurance fund through the mechanism of a chambers application requesting declaratory relief. The process, if the applicants chose to pursue it, would be an action under Part XII of the Act.","The respondent companies applied for declaration that the caveat was wrongfully removed by the Registrar of Titles and that the retroactive reinstatement of the caveat be reinstated retroactively. The respondent companies had registered a caveat against the mineral title of the subject land in 1972. The caveat was lapsed by the land owner in 1974. In 1984 the respondent discovered that the caveats had been re-registered in 1986. In 1986 the respondent registered another caveat against land which he claimed was his current interest. The Registrar then applied for a declaration that caveat was correctfully removed and that retroactive reinstated the caveat retroactively would defeat the fundamental principle of indefeasibility of title that was maintained in The Land Titles Act. The respondents were entitled to costs of defending the application. The applicant companies argued that even if the caveat had been removed improperly, retroactive restoration was not a permissible remedy due to the principle of the indefeasible of title. HELD: The application was dismissed. The court found that even though the caveat could have been removed, it would simply not be appropriate to permit the applicants to attempt to access the assurance fund through the mechanism of a chambers application requesting declaratory relief. The application would be an action under Part XII of The Land Titles Act, 2000. The Court found that retroactively reinstatement was not the appropriate remedy.

7_1997canlii11172.txt,"An application pursuant to s232(4)(c) of the Income Tax Act for a determination of whether the applicants have solicitor-client privilege in respect of 25 documents for which Revenue Canada had sought disclosure. The applicants were husband and wife, their two sons and the companies in which they were principal shareholders and/or directors. The documents related to three separate occasions upon which the applicants sought the advice or assistance of a lawyer in relation to proposed transactions. The documents in issue were originally in the possession of their accounting firm. At issue was the extent to which solicitor-client privilege could be asserted in relation to communications with and documents prepared by third parties. HELD: 1)The privilege claimed in relation to all of the documents relating to the legal advice sought after January 1995 was upheld. 2)The claim was not upheld for copies of a letter setting out the proposal for the 1988 transaction. One letter appeared to be advice offered by the accountants to the applicants.  3)The applicants abandoned their claim for privilege with respect to handwritten notes summarizing share value and fair market value of assets which had been prepared by the accountants other than for the purpose of obtaining legal advice. The claim of privilege was abandoned for a declaration of gift and minutes of a director's meeting in 1991. 4)It has been clearly established in case law that even though a client may look to his/her accountant rather than a solicitor for advice in relation to the law of taxation, the applicants must show the documents were protected by solicitor-client privilege and not merely accountant-client privilege. 5)Although solicitor-client privilege is defined in s232(1)(e) of the ITA, the issue had to be resolved in light of the common law test for privilege. 6)Privilege may extend to accountant communications where the accountant is acting as agent or representative of the client for the purpose of seeking legal advice from a solicitor. Recent cases appear to diverge on the question of the circumstances necessary to found the requisite relationship of agency. 7)The accountants were clearly acting as agents for the applicants for the purpose of obtaining legal advice, as was found in Susan Hosiery. They were at all times acting in a confidential capacity on behalf of and on instructions of the applicants. 8)Solicitor-client privilege extended to items of accounting information obtained for the purpose of receiving legal advice.

The solicitor-general and the accountant were clearly acting as agents of their client for a purpose of seeking legal advice. The extent to which solicitor-privilege can be asserted in relationto communications with and documents preparing by the applicants accountants is at issue. The issue is the extent to what solicitor- client privilege can be claimed in relation the communications between solicitor and client. HELD: The application was dismissed. 1)The solicitor-server privilege extended beyond the communications for the intended purpose of getting legal advice and to the communications that were created in the context of anticipated litigation. The purpose of the solicitor-to-client communications is to ensure full and confidential disclosure. 2)The extent to the extent of solicitor- to-client privileged communications extend to communications made between the client's accountant (the accountant) and the accounting firm (the accounting firm) for the sake of obtaining the legal advice sought from them (the accountants).

There was no evidence that Saskatchewan Finance and the third party contractors entered into an agreement to alter the nature of the contracts so that Husky paid PST when it would not otherwise have been obligated to pay. The evidence established that Husky determined the way in which bids were submitted and the way Husky was invoiced. In each contract, Husky required that the bid include a price for service and price for materials. In each case, it was contemplated that PST was in addition to the price bid for the materials provided. The contracts between Husky and the third parties all contain provisions and terms that provide for the sale of materials to Husky. On the basis of the contracts, there was a sale of tangible property under the PST Act. Husky was the user or consumer of the cement. The third parties were providing materials and services to assist in the construction of the oil well. Husky has failed to establish that the contracts were supply and install contracts.

The sentence was imposed for robbery with threats of violence contrary to s.348(1)(b) and s.334(2) of the Criminal Code which were committed in March 2000 while the accused was on probation. The appellant and co-accused were convicted of breaking and entering a private residence. The accused took $25 from the premises and held the 68 year old victim while the co-accused went to look for a knife after threatening to cut off his fingers. The following day the two accused used threats of violence while robbing a pharmacy and a witness testified the accused yelled to the co-accused to kill the victims. The co-accused who was convicted of assault received 7 years in prison for the robbery concurrent with 5 years for the B &amp; E. The 23 year old aboriginal who had a Grade 3 education had a prior record of 42 criminal convictions including eight violent or weapons related offences. HELD: Leave was granted. The appeal was allowed. The sentence of 4 years in prison on each charge to be served concurrently took into account time served on remand and electronic monitoring. The sentence was demonstrably unfit and fell outside the range of sentences previously imposed. The sentencing judge relied solely on the principle of rehabilitation, essentially ignoring the other sentencing principles including the level of gravity, the principle of deterrence, the need to denounce such acts, the sentence imposed on the co-accused, and the need to protect the public. A sentencing circle was inappropriate given the level of violence, his risk to re-offend, his consistent ignoring or refusal to follow court orders, and the fact that a penitentiary term was called for in such circumstances. He had violated various forms of community release orders including bail and probation 16 times. He had a history of drug and alcohol abuse and had not attended treatment.","The Crown sought leave to appeal the sentence imposed on the respondent after a sentencing circle. The Crown sought a reduction in sentence imposed following a previous trial. HELD: Appeal allowed. The sentence imposed was not commensurate with the time the respondent had already served on probation. The court must be protected from this type of criminal behaviour and more severe sentences are called for. The accused committed the offences while on probation and the Crown appealed. The sentencing circle was inappropriate in these circumstances given the level of violence, the respondent's high risk to reoffend, his consistent ignoring of or refusing to follow court orders and the fact a penitentiary term was called for, and the public's high need to be protected. The offender was on drugs at the time of the offences and the main player was the co-accused. The co-occused received a sentence of seven years on the robbery and five years concurrent on the breaking and entering. The respondent was 23 years old aboriginal who has a prior record consisting of 42 criminal convictions including eight violent or weapons related offences. He has violated various forms of community release orders including bail and probation orders some 16 times. He had grade 3 education and does not have significant employment history. In pre-sentence report he was considered high risk. The ordering of a sentencing circles was inappropriate given the levels of violence and the level and nature of the offenders. The appeal was allowed and a sentence was set aside. The appellant was found not to be fit to serve the sentence he was given. The public must be unprotected from this kind of criminal conduct and more stringent sentences are required. The Court must be at a high risk of reoffending. The imposition of a penitiary sentence falls short of the public need to protect the public from this types of criminal activity and more severely sentences are ordered."
8_2005skca120.txt,"The deceased made a Will appointing her only son, the appellant, as executor. In her Will, she left her home to her son, and divided the rest and residue between her two daughters, the respondents. The deceased transferred title to her house to the names of herself and the appellant jointly. She also transferred some bank deposits totalling approximately $57,000 into the joint names of herself and the appellant and designated him as the person entitled to receive payments under a RRIF totalling approximately $29,000. After her death, the appellant took the position that the bank deposits and the proceeds of the RRIF did not pass under the Will but were given to him for the benefit of the deceased's grandchildren and himself. He paid out about $45,000 to the grandchildren and himself, but nothing to his sisters, the residuary beneficiaries under the Will. The sisters brought action against him, claiming the funds were part of the residue of the estate and obtained a judgment to that effect against him. He appeals against that judgment. HELD: Appeal dismissed with costs.  1) Section 75 of The Queen's Bench Act does not apply to this case. 2) The trial judge carefully reviewed the evidence and the law respecting the presumption of advancement and the presumption of resulting trust. The judge did not mention the possibility of and express trust in favour of the grandchildren. She must have considered whether an express trust existed because that was exactly what the appellant's evidence suggested and exactly what the trial judge rejected in her findings of fact. Since the funds in question were not given to the appellant as a gift, and were not given to him in trust for the grandchildren, they must of necessity revert to the estate. In the case of the bank deposits, the funds would revert to the estate on the basis of a resulting trust. In the case of the RRIF, the funds would revert to the estate on a different basis. Since there was no gift to the appellant, and no trust in favour of the grandchildren, the monies must revert to the estate. 3) While the appellant characterized this issue as being one of mixed law and fact, it was essentially one of fact alone, the issue was what the deceased intended when she transferred the bank deposits and designated the payee of the RRIF. The standard of review in respect of such an issue is palpable and overriding error. The judge made no such error.  4) The appellant asked for relief pursuant to s. 57 of The Trustee Act in respect of the money paid by him to the grandchildren. The appellant says he paid the monies to the grandchildren in the honest belief that he was carrying out the wishes of the deceased. The appellant knew from the outset that his sisters disagreed with his position and intended to take proceedings against him. The appellant's actions in distributing the funds without at least getting directions from the Court were imprudent for a trustee. The circumstances do not justify, on any equitable basis, compelling the innocent respondents to bear the loss to them occasioned by the trustee's imprudence","The appellant appealed the decision of the Queen's Bench judge to displace the appellant's evidence that the bank deposits and the proceeds of the RRIF did not pass under the will but were given to him for the benefit of his sisters. The appellant argued that the trial judge erred in law in failing to consider the effect of section 75 of The Queen's Banc and Investment Act, 1998, c. Q-1.01 upon the respondent's claim to the RRI. The appeal was dismissed with costs under Double Column V in the usual way. The circumstances did not justify, on any equitable basis, compelling the innocent respondents to bear the loss to them occasioned by the trustee's imprudence."
8_2005skca27.txt,"Fulltext of judgment follows:[1] It will not be necessary for us to hear from the respondent. The appellant has failed to persuade us that Mr. Justice Koch erred in any material respect. In other words, we see no tenable basis for interfering with his decision. [2] The debtor clearly committed an act of bankruptcy under ss. 42(1)(e) of the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act, R.S.C. 1985, c. B-3, as a result of the sheriff's return of nulla bona to the respondent's writ of execution against the debtor. [3] That left Justice Koch to consider whether to dismiss the petition pursuant to ss. 43(7) of the Act or to stay proceedings on the petition pursuant to ss. 43(11). [4] As for the first, the debtor did not satisfy Justice Koch that he was able to pay his debts or that there existed other sufficient cause to dismiss the petition. Based on the evidence adduced by the debtor, we are of the view there is no basis to conclude that Mr. Justice Koch should have been satisfied of these matters. [5] As for second, concerning ss. 43(11), we note that the subsection contains discretionary power to stay proceedings. That, of course, serves to narrow the basis for intervention on appeal. We cannot say Justice Koch erred in any requisite respect in the exercise of this discretionary power. [6] Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed, with costs on appeal to the respondent to be taxed in the usual way.","The debtor clearly committed an act of bankruptcy under s. 42(1)(e) of the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act as result of the sheriff's return of nulla bona to the respondent's writ of execution against the debtor. The sheriff's returned of null a bona to respondent's s. 43(11) writ of execute against the creditor. The appellant failed to persuade the court that the appellant erred in any material respect in the exercise of this discretionary power. Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed, with costs on appeal to the appellant to be taxed in the usual way."
8_2009nssc261.txt,"The Trustee opposed the bankrupt's application for a discharge on various grounds. The bankrupt supported four children and had been discharged from the military due to illness arising from her active service. The bankrupt will be entitled to an absolute discharge once certain conditions are met, including the payment of one month's rent, the value of the horses and surplus income for nine months to the Trustee. The bankrupt's disability pension from Veterans' Affairs was not included in the calculation of surplus income as the public policy reason behind the exemption for proceeds received due to personal injury and a soldier's danger pay applied to this disability pension. The Trustee had no claim to the insurance proceeds received by the bankrupt following the loss of her home by fire as it was a modest sum used to replace lost personal exempt assets; the three horses were found to be owned by the bankrupt as opposed to her children, for whom she had purchased them as pets and were included in the value of her estate; the court exercised its discretion in determining the amount of surplus income, noting that the administration of the estate had been unusually hostile and it was important that the bankrupt be able to stabilize her family finances.","The applicant sought an absolute discharge from bankruptcy. She owned a ride-on lawnmower and horse trailer. The Trustee had asked her to resolve the matter of the horse trailer and provided her with information regarding her health and pension. The applicant had been diagnosed with Post Traumatic Stress Disorder, Major Depression Disorder and Borderline Personality Organization. She had been discharged from the estate in October 2007. She now asked that she be discharged from bankruptcy because she suffers from Post Trauma Stress Disorder and Post Traumas. HELD: The application was opposed. 1)The applicant was entitled to an absolute discharged. 2)The respondent was entitled in principle to a pension of $325 per month for the basic bankruptcy period of 9 months. 3)The trustee was entitled as condition of her discharge to pay surplus income of $300 for the horses. 4)The court reviewed the definition of income and found that the respondent had failed to perform the duties required to make a surplus income. The respondent was also entitled to a portion of the pension. 5)The Court reviewed the value of the horses and found they were exempt. The Court held that the net proceeds the respondent could receive for taking on serious risks to their person were of interest to the trustee. The court found that since the respondent was a person of considerable means, she was entitled not to pay the lesser amount. The trustee was also required to pay a portion in insurance proceeds. The judge also found that there was a clear element of necessity which did not extend to horses used for recreation. The order was not a burden on the respondent."
8_2010skqb467.txt,"Employees were entitled to wage adjustments under the collective bargaining agreement. The plaintiff union brought an application for an interlocutory injunction requiring the defendant to pay employees who were retiring in 2010 their wage adjustments in the current calendar year. This was an issue because it would affect pensions and retirement dates. In the alternative, the union argued the employer should pay the entitlements before the year end on a 'best approximation' basis or be required to proceed to an expedited arbitration. The defendant brought a motion to strike or dismiss the plaintiff's motion under Queen's Bench Rules 99 and 173 on the basis that the issues raised were terms and conditions of the employment contract and outside the jurisdiction of the Court according to the terms of the collective bargaining agreement. HELD: The defendant's application was dismissed because the Court has residual discretionary jurisdiction to grant relief not available under a statutory arbitration scheme. The plaintiff's application for an injunction was also dismissed. While there may be a serious issue to be tried, the pleadings do not set forth a strong prima facie case. While there might be some irreparable harm to some employees, in general terms the losses can be dealt with through damages. It would be impossible for the defendant to meet a deadline two weeks away because of the complexity of the calculations. It is not appropriate to grant an injunction requiring the defendant to make payment before the end of 2010 and it is not reasonable to make payments based on best approximation. The Court has no jurisdiction to force arbitration on the parties.","The plaintiff union, SEIU-West, represents approximately 11,000 health care workers employed by the four defendant regional health authorities and their affiliates. The current collective bargaining agreement covers the period April 1, 2008 to March 31, 2012. The tentative agreement was not signed until October 2010. The plaintiff union's motion to strike was dismissed. The defendants' motion to compel the defendants to make retroactive adjustment payments was dismissed as there was no prima facie case. The court was without jurisdiction to do so. The plaintiffs had provided abundant evidence that the imposition of a deadline less than two weeks from now could conceivably be met. HELD: The motion was dismissed with costs. 1)It is not appropriate for the court to grant an injunction requiring the defendants make the required retroactive assessment payments before the end of 2010. 2)It appears that the claim is not necessarily nullity. Although it can otherwise appropriately be struck pursuant to Rules 99 and 173 it can nevertheless subsist if only to provide a platform of pleading to support an application for interlocutory relief. 3)As the defendants conceded that the court is without jurisdiction, the alternative of directing an expedited arbitration and appointing an arbitrator to conduct it would be inconsistent with the determination of the Supreme Court in the Weber case that the model of overlapping jurisdiction is no longer to be followed. 4)It was not appropriate to grant the injunction requiring defendants to comply with the required monthly retroactive assessments. Neither do I see any reasonable prospect of a solution to the problem by making payments on a 'best approximation' of entitlement."
8_2012skpc79.txt,"The accused's neighbour disliked the accused and alleged that the accused drove his vehicle into hers. The police arrested the accused and found a fob that operated the locks on the doors of the vehicle and the engine hood of the accused's vehicle was warm. The accused was charged with hit and run and impaired driving. HELD: The Court found the accused not guilty of both charges. The Court found that the police breaches of the accused's Charter rights were numerous. The approximate 11 minutes of investigative detention was not an infringement of his rights but the combination of the officers' failing to inform the accused of the reason for his arrest and not giving his rights to counsel without delay, coupled with the illegal search and seizure of the fob and keys were in total breaches serious enough to bring the administration of justice into disrepute. The Court excluded the evidence of the fob and keys which further weakened the circumstantial case against the accused to the extent that the Crown failed to prove the accused was the operator of the motor vehicle.",The accused was arrested for impaired driving. The accused was also charged with failing to inform the police of the reason for his detention. The police had been involved in a motor vehicle investigation and had observed the accused staggering down the lawn towards them. The complainant had called the police and asked them to stop. The officer asked the accused to stop and the accused fell to the ground. The defence argued that the police conducted an unreasonable search and that the officer had breached the accused's rights by not informing him of the reasons for his detainment. The court excluded the evidence of the fob and keys which was significant part of the circumstantial case against the accused. The exclusion of the evidence was a serious breach of the accused’s right to be free from an unreasonable and seizure. The breach of his rights was numerous and point to ignorance on the part of police as to the distinction between their powers upon arrest and their powers on investigative detention.
8_2013skqb403.txt,"HELD: The application was dismissed. With respect to the issues, the Court found: 1) that the board had not relied upon the clause in the Policy Statement but on the evidence before it. It was not necessary to decide then whether the Policy Statement was ultra vires; 2) that the board’s interpretation that the Act granted discretion to the board to refuse to reimburse a specific medical treatment was reasonable; 3) that the board’s conclusion was reasonable. The scientific studies did not definitively stated that medical marijuana was effective. In some situations where a patient’s only recourse would to be to use a non-clinically approved drug whose safety and efficacy was still questioned, a determination that the medical aid was not necessary or required might be unreasonable, but not in this case where the applicant declined to try Sativex; and 4) that there was no evidence that the board based its decision on irrelevant considerations such as the potential political ramifications of paying for medical marijuana.","HELD: The application was dismissed. Based on the wording of the Act and the context of the relevant provisions, the Board's interpretation that the Board cannot rely on a blanket prohibition to deny reimbursement of medical marijuana is reasonable. The Board's decision to deny reimbursements falls within the range of acceptable outcomes. 1) Based on all the wording and the relevant documents, the board's interpretation of the law granted the Board discretion to refuse to reimburse a specific medical treatment is reasonable but the Board’s decision that it has the power to deny reimbursed for medical marijuana meets the standard of reasonableness. 2) Based upon the wording, the wording is reasonable and the Board did not rely on Policy Statement 5 or even mention it in reaching its decision, it does not decide this matter. The applicant’ s. 21.1(1)(b) and ss. 106(1) and (2) must be read together with s. 22(1(2) which expressly grants the Board exclusive jurisdiction to hear and determine all matters and questions arising under this Act. On the face of its reasons, the decision to refuse reimbursement specifically because medical marijuana was potentially unsafe and unproven met the standard for reasonablety. Based upon that wording and context, the Court was of the view that the board’’S interpretation that it granted the board discretion to deny the reimbursement of a specific drug is reasonable as well. 3) Based in the wording the Act, the respondent’d position is that the Act provides discretion to determine whether or not to reimburse the cost of the drug is well within the bounds of reasonability. The board did not apply or rely on it in making its decision. The decision was based on irrelevant considerations, in effect, misconceived perception of the potential political ramification of paying for medical marihuana."
8_2014skqb299.txt,"HELD: The application was dismissed. The court held that the standard of review of the arbitrator’s decision was one of reasonableness. Section 25 of The Trade Union Act states that the conclusions of arbitrators are final and therefore the court noted they should not be interfered with lightly. Further, the court noted that the decision of the arbitrator was not of significant importance to the general public. The court reviewed the history of collective bargaining at the university and found that tenure was not dependent on the president’s personal recommendation in the past. The court found that the arbitrator’s reasoning was transparent and intelligible throughout. To include the word tenure in the definition of appointment or promotion was not the only conclusion that could be drawn. The arbitrator’s decision was within the range of acceptable conclusions and was reasonable.","The parties agreed to a lengthy statement of facts and the admissibility of number of documents before the arbitrator. The parties disagreed on the standard of review to be applied to the arbitrators interpretation of s. 51 of the Act. The standard of reviewing was that the president's authority to make recommendations to the Board was paramount, and could not be fettered by the provisions of collective agreement. The arbitrator found after reviewing The University of Saskatchewan Act and the Tenure Appeals Committee that the President's personal recommendation to the board was not required, and the Board's decision to follow the president’s recommendation was not a recommendation of the Tenures Appeal Committee. The Arbitrator concluded that an award of tenure is neither an appointment nor promotion as contemplated by the Act, the Saskatchewan Act, and this collective agreement can more readily be harmonized. The Act is one of general law, that is both of essential importance to the legal system as a whole and outside the adjudicator’ s jurisdiction, and is consistent with the principles and purposes of the Agreement. The principles and procedures outlined in the Saskatchewan Agreement are similar to those in the American Civil Liberties Union case. The provisions of the Saskatchewan legislation are similar in that they both refer to the same person and the same institution. The president”s personal recommendation is not required and the board is not obliged to follow his recommendation. The same person is not bound by the terms of the collective agreement and the Act is not a statute creating and dividing up responsibilities within the University. The fact that the Act hardly uses the term tenure at all and not directly in this context leaves open the possibility that the Board could be bound by s. 73(3)(b) to follow its decision. The Court reviewed the various provisions of The Saskatchewan Act that deal with the granting of tenure and found that the award of the tenure was neither an appointed appointment nor an appointment as contemplated in the Act nor an appointed promotion as a result of the agreement. HELD: The arbitrators found that s. 53 of the act is an unreasonable decision and committed an otherwise reviewable error. The interpretation of the s.51 by the arbiter met the applicable standard of analysis. The court found that it was not the Court’S interpretation of S. 51. The decision was made by the Board of Governors and the president on behalf of the Board and the appeal committee and their actions were taken as his. The award of a tenure is either an appointment within the meaning of s50(a) or promotion within the Meaning"
8_2017skqb53.txt,"The accused was charged with the commission of sexual assault, sexual touching in relation to a 16-year-old and possession of child pornography. The accused came to police attention via a report by the complainant. She reported that the accused was often viewing a pornographic website while in her presence. The police prepared an information to obtain a search warrant (ITO). The ITO stated that the search would provide evidence of the accused’s viewing of pornography in the presence of the complainant, bolstering the complainant’s credibility. The ITO did not reference possession of child pornography. The ITO sought only a search of the “search history on the computer”. The issued warrant authorized a search of the accused’s computer and related devices and media, as well as documents pertaining to occupancy of the home and control of computer equipment. The complainant subsequently alleged that the accused had taken photos of her in the shower. The police did not amend the ITO to include a search for photos. The police executed the search and seized, inter alia, a laptop, an iPhone and CDs. The police delivered the material to a computer forensic specialist at the RCMP and requested a complete forensic search of the computer and phone to obtain a general search of the Internet history, pictures of the complainant and messages between the complainant and the accused. The police knew that the search of pictures was not included on the search warrant. The RCMP did not review the terms of the warrant prior to completing the examination and examined the entire contents of the laptop and phone. The accused submitted that his s. 8 Charter rights had been violated by the search and applied for exclusion of evidence pursuant to s. 24(2). The application proceeded by voir dire. The evidence was apparently located on either the accused’s laptop or cell phone, but the nature of the evidence obtained was not disclosed at the voir dire. The following issues were raised: 1) What is the correct procedure to be used to challenge evidence seized pursuant to a search warrant; 2) Was the Crown able to call amplification evidence and have it considered in support of the search and seizure conducted; 3) Did the ITO set forth reasonable and probable grounds that the items sought were evidence with respect to the commission of an offence; 4) Did the ITO use boiler plate clauses; 5) Did the ITO establish reasonable and probable grounds that the items were likely to be found in the place to be searched; and 6) What was the extent of a search of a computer or computer device. | HELD: Evidence of the accused’s search history was validly obtained. Other evidence was beyond the scope of the search warrant and obtained by violation of the accused’s s. 8 rights. The court held: 1) There is a two-step inquiry to be made when real evidence is seized during a search. The first step is an inquiry into constitutionality, and the second is reached only after a constitutional infringement has been established. Both inquiries impose an onus on the person claiming infringement. The standard of proof is the balance of probabilities. Challenges to constitutionality of warranted searches may involve either or both a facial and a sub-facial attack on the authorizing warrant. The record examined on facial review is fixed: it is the ITO, not an amplified or enlarged record;  2) In attempting to enter evidence of the complainant’s allegation that the accused took pictures of her in the shower, the Crown relied on an argument that the ends justified the means. This amplification evidence sought to allege a whole new offence and area of search. It was not admitted; 3) The point of this voir dire was not to determine admissibility of evidence outside of the search warrant context. There was no requirement that evidence sought in support of allegations made be directly connected to a complainant or the actual subject matter of a complainant; 4) The ITO did not use impermissible boiler plate clauses when read in its entirety. However, it did not set forth reasonable and probable grounds that text messages were evidence with respect to the commission of an offence; 5) The ITO provided sufficient description. It was reasonable to infer that search history meant search history of the accused with respect to the websites defined in the ITO. Further argument was required on whether text messages could be included; and  6) Police are not entitled to rummage through entire contents of a device searching for other evidence. The ITO sought only the search history.","The accused applied for relief pursuant to s. 24(2) of the Charter to exclude evidence seized through the execution of a search warrant. The accused called no evidence. He disputed the facial validity of the search warrant, the facial accuracy of the warrant, and the suggested criminal offence of possession of child pornography. HELD: The application was granted. 1)The accused was found guilty of both charges.  2)The evidence seized was not disclosed at the hearing. It is apparently located on either the accused's laptop computer or his cell phone. 3)The Court reviewed the evidence and found that the accused was in a position of trust or authority toward a person aged 16 years or over for a sexual purpose, a sexual organ or the anal region of a person under the age of 18, contrary to s162.1(4) of Canada. The Court reviewed whether the accused had in his possession child pornography to wit: possessing digital files of a persons who is or depicted as being under the ages engaged in explicit sexual activity, or the dominant characteristic of a sexual activity contrary to the Criminal Code of Canada; 4)The court reviewed the application in R. v. Parson, 2010 SKQB 346 (CanLII), 358 Sask 303 (1) and found the accused guilty of possession. The court found that there was insufficient evidence to establish the accused’s constitutional right to be excluded. The evidence seized by the search was not part of the evidence at the time of the arrest. The Crown was entitled to call amplification evidence and have it considered in support of the searches conducted. The application proceeded by way of voir dire. The judge reviewed the respondent’ s. 8 Charter rights and found there was sufficient evidence to support the exclusion of evidence. The respondent”s s.8 Charter rights were violated."
9_1994canlii4283.txt,"The respondent had undertaken the residential development of certain lands bordering the appellant's property and constructed roadways which it proposed to convey to the Department of Transportation, who agreed to accept with the consent of owners of property where water would drain from the road. When the appellant refused to consent, the respondent applied to the municipality for proceedings under the Ditches and Water Courses Act, which failed to achieve agreement. The respondent then filed a requisition with the county clerk pursuant to s. 7(1) of the Act which allows for the appointment of a municipal engineer. The engineer filed a report in which he concluded the respondent was entitled to open a ditch on the appellant's land, subject to certain conditions. In this action, the appellant appealed pursuant to s. 12 of the Act. Allowing the appeal, that the Act appears to assume that landowners will agree that a ditch benefits their land and provides a mechanism for apportioning cost. However, it does not give an engineer authority to expropriate land or take any interest in it, nor does it provide a means by which the appellant is forced to accept the ditch. Further, the common law prohibits the use of another's property to solve one's drainage problems.","The applicant, a subdividing developer, sought to have the respondent's land conveyed to the Department of Transportation and Communications for drainage. The respondent refused to consent to such drainage. Application dismissed. The applicant argued that the respondent was entitled to the ditch and drain on the Haverstock lands. The court found that the applicant had not followed the proper procedure and the respondent had failed to comply with s.9 of the Act. The Court awarded costs to the respondent. The respondents were awarded the amount of $3,000.00. The judge concluded that the Act provided a method of apportioning the cost of the ditch or drain amongst the owners and prescribing the means by which will be determined the necessary technical details of the drainage."
9_1996canlii8701.txt,"The appellant appealed his conviction of distributing infringing copies of three computer programs. He argued that the Crown did not prove that he had distributed the copyrighted material, or that the distribution was to an extent that it prejudicially affected the owners of the copyrights. Dismissing the appeal, that by placing the copyrighted computer pro-grams on his computer bulletin board in a compressed format, for ease of transmission, and allowing access by modem to the programs, the appellant was distributing the programs to the prejudice of the owner's copyright.","This was an appeal by a young offender from convictions of distributing infringing copies of computer software contrary to s. 42(1)(c) of the Copyright Act. The appellant had used a bulletin board to allow other computer users to connect to his computer system by modem and leave messages, collect and send e-mail, play computer games, and other files without a license from commercial producers and copyright owners of those materials. The evidence accepted by the trial judge was that they were 'packaged' or 'compressed' for efficient storage and 'ease of transmission'. The Court reviewed the evidence and found that the appellant had not prejudiced the owners of the copyrights. The Court dismissed the appeal."
9_2001canlii390.txt,"The accused was charged with operating a motor vehicle while his ability to do so was impaired and while over .08 (breath sample readings were 160 and 150 mg) contrary to s. 253(a) and s.253(b) of the Criminal Code, respectively. Issues arising during the trial included whether there was a breach of his s.8 and s.9 Charter rights to be secure against unreasonable search or seizure, and not to be arbitrarily detained; if there was a breach, was there a remedy under s.24(2); whether the evidence was sufficient to prove the offence of impaired driving beyond a reasonable doubt. The police officer concluded that he had reasonable and probable grounds for the breath demand based upon the accused sleeping through two green traffic lights, a strong smell of alcohol, and his somewhat bloodshot or glassy eyes. HELD: The accused was acquitted of both charges. 1)The evidence was sufficient to establish breaches of s.8 and s.9 of the Charter. The Certificate of Analysis constituted conscriptive evidence which, on balance, would not have been discovered by alternative means. Its admission into evidence might render the trial unfair and bring the administration of justice into disrepute. In the absence of the Certificate of Analysis, the evidence was not sufficient to prove the offence under s.253(b) beyond a reasonable doubt. 2)The strong smell of alcohol and somewhat bloodshot or glassy eyes were not sufficient to conclude there were reasonable and probable grounds for the demand. The court is required to examine the evidence as a whole. Every case will depend a great deal on its individual circumstances. It was not reasonable for the officer to assume that the vehicle not moving at the lights was a reliable indicator of impairment for these purposes. The evidence of slurred speech was not reliable as there was nothing in the officer's notes regarding slurred speech, nor had it been included in the investigation documents. The accused did not have any problems with balance or manner of walk, was cooperative throughout, and did not have any difficulty understanding his rights and the breath demand read to him from a printed card. The officer did not ask the accused whether he had been drinking. 3)The nature and quality of the evidence of a strong smell of alcohol, and eyes which were somewhat glassy or bloodshot, in the context of Stellato, was so frail as to leave a reasonable doubt as to impairment. The 'classic' signs of impairment (erratic driving, strong odour of alcoholic beverage, glassy and bloodshot eyes, slurred speech and unsteadiness on one's feet) was not intended to be an all-encompassing list, and its application will very much depend on the circumstances of a given case.","The accused was charged with operating a motor vehicle while impaired and while over.08 contrary to s. 253(a) and s.253(b) of the Criminal Code. The accused was also charged with impaired driving contrary to ss. 253A and 253B of the Code. HELD: The evidence of a strong smell of alcohol, and eyes which were somewhat glassy or bloodshot, did not constitute conscriptive evidence. The evidence was not reliable. The Court held that the Certificate of Analysis constituted conscriptives evidence which on balance would not have otherwise been discovered by alternative non-conscriptive means. The admission of it into evidence might well render the trial unfair and bring the administration of justice into disrepute. The court held that in the absence of the Certificate, the evidence was insufficient to prove the offence under s.255(a), s.254(b), s253(a and s253B) of The Code.  1)The evidence of the accused remaining asleep through the green lights to be a reliable indicator of impairment, given that he was immediately awakened when the officer grabbed him by the wrist and he appeared to fully comprehend the circumstances in which he was involved. 2)The Court held the evidence of slurred speech was not sufficient to prove that the accused's eyes were glassy and bloodshot. The officer concluded that the evidence did not appear to be of sufficient assistance to establish reasonable and probable grounds. The Certificate of Analyses constituted conscriptionive evidence which, on balance, would not be sufficient to establish beyond a reasonable doubt the offence of impaired driving. The Admission of it Into Evidence would be a Plea to the Court to Rule that the Evidence of Slurred Speech is Not reliable. 3)The accused's evidence of being slurred was not found. The police officer did not ask the accused whether he had been drinking. The breath demand was read to him from a printed card. The defence argued that the officer's observations of the defendant's physical comportment were not sufficient evidence to establish that the defendant was committing. The trial judge concluded that there were two factors which must be considered: 1)the evidence of his eyes which appeared to be somewhat glass-y or glassy, and 2)the presence of alcohol and eyes that were somewhat bloodshot and were somewhat cloudy. The nature and quality of the evidence in the presence of these factors did not leave the officer with a reasonable and reasonable doubt as to impairment. The"

The defendant proposed to open a pharmacy on the premises. Another tenant in the shopping centre already operated a drug store and their lease provided that no other tenant would operate a drug store in any part of their premises. The other tenant brought an application for a interim injunction against the defendant. The receiver of the shopping centre also brought an application for a declaration that the defendant could not operate a pharmacy on its premises. The defendant objected to the receiver's application on the basis that it involved controverted issues of fact requiring a trial. Application for interim injunction dismissed on the basis that the applicant had not established irreparable harm; the receiver's application could proceed as an application as the potential for a factual dispute was insubstantial; defendant provided with the option of either accepting an adjournment to allow time for further investigation, the conduct of discoveries and the presenting of any further evidence or moving for the court's further consideration.","The plaintiff and the receiver applied for a permanent injunction against Sobeys. The plaintiff had agreed to establish and operate a business in the shopping centre consistent with the terms and conditions of the lease. The receiver promised to restrict competition by other tenants. The respondent opposed the application for an interim injunction on the grounds that the disputed questions of fact and law were beyond the scope of a summary proceeding. The court dismissed the application on the basis that neither Sobeis nor LeBlanc had established irreparable harm. The Court dismissed the motion for an injunction on that basis. The issue was whether Sobey should have time to make investigations, conduct necessary discoveries, acquire productions and present further evidence. The respondents were entitled to a declaration of damages. The applicant should have the opportunity to make discoveries, conduct productions and to present further further evidence if necessary. The plaintiffs relied upon Miller v. Toews, 1990 CanLII 2615 (MB CA), and Canada v. LeBlanca (1991 CanLIII 3951) for the proposition that the enquiry into irreparable damage is less vigorous or less telling in cases of a breach of negative covenant. The case for the receiver was much simpler than that for Sobeess and M.C. Leblanc because the landlord is party to the SobeYS lease and is entitled to enforce the lease as a party. The factual dispute was beyond the jurisdiction of the Court. The application for interim injunction was dismissed on the ground that neither the respondent nor Leblanca had established damages."

HELD: The application for disclosure was dismissed. A date for the extradition hearing was set.,"The accused was arrested in Saskatoon on May 28, 2003 and was granted bail pending his extradition hearing.

At the extradition hearing, the accused was granted a bail condition that he be granted custody pending his committal hearing. At his extradition request, the United States requested a stay of proceedings on one or more of the following grounds: contempt of court by the Attorney General for failing to provide proper disclosure; production by the Minister of Canada for witness statements and other evidence in compliance with the common law duty of procedural fairness as it applies in administrative proceedings; production of witness statements; disclosure by the accused of witness statement and other information pursuant to s. of the Charter; contempt of Court by the AG for failing not to provide properly disclosure; the production by and production by The Attorney General of witness information and other material in compliance and information pursuant s. s. the Charter. HELD: The motion on the accused's behalf was dismissed. The motion was without merit and it was not prepared by counsel for the Attorney general. It was not the business of an extradition judge to assume responsibility for reviewing the actions of foreign officials in preparing the evidence for an extradition hearing; the application was dismissed and the motion on his behalf was not granted. The Act does not confer an expanded Charter jurisdiction upon the accused."
9_2005skca89.txt,"This appeal arises from proceedings under The Family Property Act. The couple had lived together for several years. She sought judgment distributing their property. The property included a house in Vancouver, which he had acquired some years earlier with the financial assistance of his parents. The trial judge found that the respondent had acquired the house after the commencement of the spousal relationship and then went to hold that the petitioner was entitled to an equal share of its value with no reduction owing to the gifts or loans from his parents. The respondent appealed. HELD: Appeal allowed by the majority. Lane J.A. wrote in dissent. Majority: 1) The Vancouver property was acquired after commencement of the spousal relationship. The value of the property did not qualify for exemption under s. 23(1)(a) of the Act. There are a number of facts that merit emphasis. The respondent received $125,000 from his mother before the spousal relationship started. He still had that amount on hand when the relationship commenced. He used the money as a down payment on the purchase of the Vancouver house shortly after the relationship commenced. By establishing these facts, the respondent established the requisite conditions for the grant of an exemption of the value of the Vancouver property to the extent of the $125,000. 2) The trial judge erred in declining to take into account the loans of $100,000 the appellant received from each of his parents for the purpose of purchasing the Vancouver property. There was insufficient evidence before the trial judge to enable him to find that the mortgage debts were statute-barred and he did not make a firm finding on this point. The trial judge's finding that the respondent will not have to repay the loans was incomplete. He did not assess the loans in light of s. 21(3)(e) of the Act. On the whole of the circumstances concerning the Vancouver property and the length of the spousal relationship, there is no tenable basis for not giving effect to s. 21(3)(e) of the Act and the contributions made by the respondent's parents on his behalf to the acquisition of the property. The petitioner is entitled to share in the build up of the equity in consequence of the pay-down of the mortgage. Minority: 1) The Vancouver home ought to be distributed in accordance with s. 22 of the Act. The gift of $125,000 was made by the respondent's mother with the full knowledge that the parties were living together. In this case, the contribution by a third party on behalf of a spouse to the acquisition of family property is one of the usual factors outlined in s. 21 of the Act and it would be inequitable to exempt the gift from distribution. 2) The trial judge did not err in failing to deduct from the family property the loans given by the appellant's parents. He made a finding the loans were statute-barred. The trial judge clearly considered the legislation and his interpretation of the legislation was not challenged by the respondent. He also made the finding the loans would likely never be repaid. He simply used less than precise language.","This appeal stems from proceedings under The Family Property Act, s.S.1997, c.F-6.3, initiated by a nurse against a doctor. The two lived together for several years. She sought judgment distributing their property or its value equally between them. The trial judge held that the value of the house was exempt from distribution because it was acquired before the commencement of the spousal relationship between the parties. Alternatively, he contended the gift and loans served to reduce the value available for distribution. HELD: Appeal allowed. 1) The Court held that it would be unfair and inequitable to allow the distribution of the value equally with the parties if the value was not already distributed. 2) The court found that the trial judge erred in concluding that the values of the Vancouver property were not exempt from distributing because they had become'spouses within the meaning of the Act in late June 1994. The fact as found is sufficient in law to render the relationship between parties spousals of interest as contemplated by the definition of'spouse' found in section 23 of the act. The Court found that in the circumstances the trial court erred by failing to give effect to the gift of $125,000 the appellant had obtained from his mother. The appellant's application for distribution of their property fell to be applied on the two-stage, step by step approach suggested in Deyell v. Deyll and applied in each of Mitchell v. Mitchell and Benson v. Benson (1994), 176 D. L.R. 17 (Sask.C.A.). The Court considered the equivalent of Mitchell in Mitchell v Mitchell, 1999 CanLII 8234 (SKCA), 172 Sask. R. 201(Sask.) (3) The appeal raises several issues. 1. The evidence shows that the Court found the value fell to the level of unfair and unfair distribution because the value had been acquired after the commencement. The court held that in light of the material facts, the relevant provisions of the Family Property act and the distribution made by the trial Judge, that the evidence supports the findings of section 23. III. The second issue is whether the trial trial judge, in awarding the respondent an equal share of the property, erred. The value of this property was exempt because the property was acquired after, not before, the spouse relationship. The amount of money the appellant received from his parents for the purposes of the purchase of the home was $125. The respondent was awarded an equalization payment of $354"
9_2006skca114.txt,"This is an application for leave to appeal, and leave being granted, an appeal by the Crown from a sentence imposed against a young offender pursuant to the Youth Criminal Justice Act. The respondent pled guilty to a charge of robbery, an offence contrary to s. 344(b) of the Criminal Code. The respondent was sentenced to 90 days secure custody, 45 days community supervision, 1 year probation and a 10 year firearms prohibition. HELD: Appeal allowed orally. The sentence is set aside and a sentence of 12 months closed custody, 6 months community supervision, 1 year probation and a 10 year firearms prohibition was imposed in addition to the 90 days closed custody already served at the time of the appeal.  1) It was clear that the primary concern of the sentencing judge was that, in the wake of the Supreme Court of Canada decision in R. v. B.W.P.; R. v. B.V.N. 2006 SCC 27, a custodial sentence might not be open to him at all. It is the Court's view that the sentencing judge's conclusion that the decision in B.W.P. virtually ruled out custodial sentences for young persons under the Youth Criminal Justice Act was unwarranted. The gist of that decision is that under the Act the principle of general deterrence is not a factor to be taken into account and cannot be used to justify a sentence harsher than the circumstances of the offender and the offence would warrant. Nor is specific deterrence to be considered as a separate factor. 2) It is the Court's view that a long custodial sentence is necessary to accomplish the task of bringing the seriousness of the offence to the respondent's attention, and provide meaningful consequences to reinforce societal values without negatively affecting the respondent's likelihood of rehabilitation.","This was an application for leave to appeal and, leave being granted, an appeal by the Crown from a sentence imposed against a young offender pursuant to the Youth Criminal Justice Act, S.C. 2002, c.1. The sentence was set aside and a sentence of 12 months closed custody, 6 months community supervision, 1 year probation and a 10 year firearms prohibition. The respondent was sentenced to 90 days secure custody, 45 days community supervision and a 1 year firearms ban. The Court found that the sentence imposed was demonstrably unfit, failing to take into account the seriousness of the offence, the culpability of the respondent, the criminal history and other circumstances of the offender and the principles of sentencing set out in the Act."

Following discovery examinations, the great niece, who was the alternative executor appointed under the will, applied to have the executor, the deceased's husband, removed on the basis that his discovery evidence raised grave concerns about his mental capacity to continue to act as executor. Application to remove the executor dismissed; there was no medical evidence submitted in support of the applicant's claim that the executor was not competent to administer the estate and although it was clear from the discovery evidence that he did not have a clear understanding of his duties as executor, given that he was the only beneficiary under the will, he was the only person whose interest was at risk if he failed to properly administer the estate.","The applicant seeks an order removing the executor of the estate. The executor is the husband of the testator, the deceased testator. The applicant, a niece of the deceased, is the alternate executor. The deceased testor died in April 2004. The respondent seeks an Order removing the respondent as executor pursuant to s.61(1)(b)(v) of the Probate Act. The application to remove the respondent is dismissed. The Court found that the respondent's interests were at risk if he failed to properly administer the estate and that the applicant's niece was the only person who was the primary beneficiary. The court found that on the first test, the respondent was the person most at risk, as his wife was very secretive and possessive with respect to the bank shares and he therefore did not have full understanding of how they were dealt with. The second test, however, was that the executors himself was the one person whose interest was at risk. He is the only beneficiary of the will. The only beneficiary is the applicant. The applicants claim that the Court has no difficulty in removing trustees who have abused their trust. The Act does not define 'person interested in an estate' and the respondent, who is the sole residuary beneficiary, is not the only one. The applications to remove respondent as the executrator are dismissed."
9_2010skqb122.txt,"FIAT: This is an application for an order pursuant to s. 63(2) of The Personal Property Security Act requiring the respondents or those in possession to deliver to the applicant four pieces of construction equipment. The four pieces of equipment were rented by applicant, Inland, to respondents, Mike Dery Holdings Ltd. and Giants Head Excavating Ltd. pursuant to an equipment rental contract entered into at Penticton, British Columbia, between April 21, 2008 and August 6, 2008. Inland did not register any security interest in the equipment in British Columbia or Saskatchewan until October 20, 2009. In the fall of 2008, the equipment was transported to Saskatchewan by Mike Dery Holdings Ltd. and/or Giants Head. In February of 2009, respondent 101138096 purchased the equipment from Mike Dery Holdings Ltd. and Giants Head for valuable consideration. Searches were completed to establish no registrations against the equipment. In April of 2009, the equipment was leased to Giants Head and a security agreement registered in Saskatchewan on May 5, 2009 listing the equipment as general property but not specifically registering the equipment by serial number. The security agreement was taken by 101138096 to secure the rental payments owed to it under the lease by Giants Head who had possession of the equipment. Mike Dery Holdings Ltd. and Giants Head defaulted under their payments to Inland and Giants Head defaulted in its payments to 101138096. September 18, 2009, 101138096 seized the equipment leaving it in the possession of Giants Head. The equipment was subsequently removed from Giants Head's possession and stored at the farm of Bruce Bakken. On October 19, 2009, 101138096 forwarded a letter to Giants Head confirming that 101138096 had elected to retain the equipment as payment for the outstanding indebtedness. As of this date a Personal Property Security registry search in Saskatchewan disclosed no security interest other than that of 101138096 in the equipment. Inland subsequently registered both a British Columbia and Saskatchewan Personal Property registry interest by serial number respecting the equipment and its original agreements of 2008. The issue before the Court is whether Inland by virtue of its Personal Property Security registration by serial number on October 20, 2009 has priority over the interest of 101138096 which registered earlier as general security without serial numbers but who alleges to have taken possession of the equipment and elected to retain the equipment seized in satisfaction of Giants Head's indebtedness October 19, 2009. This occurred one day prior to the registration of the security interest by serial number of Inland. HELD: The application is dismissed with costs to the respondents. The respondent 101138096 had a general security registered and had actual possession of the equipment in early October 2009 which therefore perfected its security while it retained possession. As of October 19, 2009 when 101138096 elected to take the collateral as satisfaction of the debt the only party to whom notice was required was the debtor Giants Head and his notice is in compliance with s. 61(1) and s. 61(3) of the Act. When the applicant completed its registration on October 20, 2009 the collateral was no longer available because of 101138096's election on October 19, 2009. The respondent perfected its security interest in the equipment which is subject to this application by taking possession thereof. Electing to take the collateral as satisfaction of the obligation secured and providing the required notices prior to registration by the applicant, transferred title to the equipment to the respondent 101138096 free and clear of the claim of the applicant.","FIAT.

He was given credit for 22 months spent in custody. Matychuk was sentenced to 12 years in prison but was given credit for time in custody on a 1:1 basis because the Court had not found any circumstances to justify any greater amount of credit. Matychuk’s credit was for 19 months. The sentences were based on the circumstances of the offence: a home invasion and inflicting serious bodily harm on a young victim.

b_1995canlii6024.txt,"The accuseds were charged under ss.300 and 301 of the Code with (i)committing and (ii)publishing a defamatory libel against a police officer. They filed a plea of justification as permitted under s.611(1) of the Code. The Crown denied the truth of the plea pursuant to s.611(4) and the matter proceeded to trial. At the opening of their trial the accuseds applied for an order declaring ss.300 and 301 of the Criminal Code to be of no force and effect on the basis that they constituted an unreasonable limitation on their rights and freedoms guaranteed under ss.2, 7 and 11 of the Charter. The Crown admitted that ss.300 and 301 limited an individual's right to freedom of expression as provided by s.2 of the Charter but argued that this infringement was justified under s.1 of the Charter. HELD: Application allowed in part.  1)The onus of justifying the limitation of a right or freedom is on the party seeking to uphold the limitation and the standard of proof is by a preponderance of probability. 2)The standards against which a limit on a right or freedom guaranteed by the Charter can be shown to be reasonable and demonstrably justified are those underlying values and principles essential to a free and democratic society. While the right of free speech is important in our society, it is not unrestricted. 3)In order to justify an infringement of this right, it must be shown that: (i)the impugned legislative provision has an objective of pressing and substantial concern and (ii)there is a proportionality to the legislation in that: (a)the measures must be fair and not arbitrary, carefully designed to achieve the objective in question and rationally connected to the objective; (b)the means should impair freedom of expression as little as possible; (c)there must be a proportionality between the effects of the limiting legislation and the objective. S.300 of the Code meets these tests, and is therefore a reasonable limit on free speech and is valid. 4)Ss.611 and 612 of the Code, which permit a plea of justification do not create a reverse onus on the accused. They are procedural and merely serve to put the Crown on notice as to the accused's defence. The Crown must still prove that the alleged defamatory libel is knowingly false beyond a reasonable doubt. 5)S.301 of the Code makes it an offence to publish a defamatory libel whether or not the accused believes it to be true. S.301 is therefore not a reasonable limit and is invalid. ADDENDUM: The Court ordered that the agreed statement of facts set out at pp. 2 and 3 of the judgment not be published nor broadcast in any manner.","The accused were charged with two counts of defamatory libel. The accused were observed walking on a public sidewalk in front of the police station carrying a sign that said 'Did [rank] police officer] just allow or help with the rape/sodomy of an innocent person?' and on the other side the words 'If you admit it, then you might get help with your touching problem'.

The Court found that s. 300 of the Criminal Code constitutes a limit to freedom of expression which is demonstrably justified in free and democratic society. The Act is a fundamental principle of freedom of speech and expression. The principles of freedom, dignity and respect for the human person are fundamental to free and democracy. The offences committed are not of pressing and substantial concern in free or democratic society, but rather in a reasonable limit to the freedom of express. The offence of defamation is a serious one and the principles of free expression, dignity, respect for human dignity, and respect of the reputation of all persons are at issue. The court must balance the value of freedom against the value and necessity of the limiting legislation. The objectives of s.300 of the Code are not limited to values expressly set out in the Charter. The objective of s300 of s303 must be of sufficient importance to justify a violation of s2(b) of the Charter and the actus reus element of the proportionality test. The measures must be fair and not arbitrary, carefully designed to achieve the objective and rationally connected to the objective. The limitation on freedom of the expression is reasonable and justified under s.2(a) of The Charter. HELD: The Court held that s300 and s300 were of sufficient significance to justify an infringement of s3(b). The Court must balance between the value, principle of fundamental justice and the objective of defaming. The definition of defamed in s. 298 of the code is constructed in words of common usage capable of interpretation. It provides sensible construction and an intelligible standard of conduct. The aim of s301 is to protect the privacy and reputations of Canadians. The test for s.310 is met. The application of s309 is dismissed. The trial judge filed a plea of justification consisting of 17 typed pages which, for the purposes of this application, need not be reproduced."

The grounds of her appeal were that the trial judge erred in determining that she was impaired, and that the trial judge otherwise misconstrued and misapplied the evidence. HELD: Appeal dismissed.  1)Both grounds of appeal raised questions of fact. Findings of fact are not to be reversed on appeal unless it can be established that the trial judge has made some palpable and overriding error which affected her assessment of the facts. 2)The Court's task is not to retry the case or substitute its own decision. A trial judge's findings of fact can only be overturned if they are so clearly wrong as to make the decision unreasonable. 3)The Court was unable to say that an error of that kind was made by the trial judge in this case.","The appellant appeals from her conviction of impaired driving. The trial judge found that the conviction was contrary to the Criminal Code s.253(a) and made an error in law in determining the degree of impairment by alcohol or drug required before a conviction can be entered. HELD: Appeal dismissed. 1)The trial judge made an inferences of fact which were not made on the evidence. 2)The evidence of impairment was so frail as to leave the trial judge with a reasonable doubt as to impairment, the accused must be acquitted. 3)The Court was unable to say that the findings by the trial Judge are not supported by the evidence, or that her conclusions are clearly wrong as to make her decision unreasonable."
b_1996canlii6803.txt,"A claim for wrongful dismissal. The position of executive secretary was discontinued for economic reasons. HELD: The plaintiff was awarded $30,737.93 plus costs plus pre-judgment interest. 1)The plaintiff had taken all reasonable steps to mitigate her losses. The duty is to take such steps as a reasonable person would take in his own interests to maintain his income and position in his industry, trade or profession. The former employer has no right to expect that the former employee will accept a lower paying alternative employment with doubtful prospects. 2)Reasonable notice would have been ten months. She had been erroneously requested to take 19.871 days as annual leave and therefore actually received one months' notice. Nine months salary at $26,514.00 plus $1,325 for lost pension benefits and $564 for the Canada Pension Plan were awarded. She was to be compensated for 19.871 days of combined time in lieu and annual leave.","The plaintiff was employed with the defendant, Gabriel Dumont Institute of Native Studies and Applied Research, Inc. from January 1983 to May 1993. The plaintiff was a married mother of three children. She was the sole supporter of her family as her husband was unemployed. The defendant brought a claim for wrongful dismissal. HELD: The plaintiff's damages were assessed at $26,514.00.  1)The defendant took all reasonable steps to mitigate her loss. The trial judge awarded her 9 months salary in lieu of notice.  2)The plaintiff took all necessary steps to minimize her loss, including taking reasonable steps in declining an offer from another company for a new and experimental position. The respondent had been employed for ten years and the duties were primarily secretarial. The employer erroneously requested her to take 19.871 days which she earned as annual leave. The court therefore awarded her nine months salary."
b_1996canlii6818.txt,"At issue was the determination of the quantum of spousal and child support and division of matrimonial property. HELD: 1)The respondent's supplementary allowances were taken into consideration in finding a gross salary of $53,000.00 per annum. Due to an injury he was no longer able to work overtime but was working full-time. Should a medical discharge become necessary an application to vary can be brought at that time. 2)The petitioner suffered a substantial economic disadvantage. The frequent moves due to the husband's employment had disrupted the petitioner's employment and university education. However, the court must also take into consideration the economic advantage enjoyed as a result of the marriage including the pension plan of the spouse. 3)If the petitioner did receive the greater share of the household goods it can be attributed to partial compensation for her economic disadvantage. Shares in joint names were divided equally. Other assets were divided equally. 4)Upon the granting of the divorce the petitioner will be disqualified from receiving the pension survivorship benefits. The fair solution was to use the enhanced value of the 'With Survivorship Benefits' column and the date of adjudication was used as the valuation date. The combination method of valuation was used in view of the 15 year marriage and given the economic disadvantage suffered by the petitioner. 5)The parties agreed that child support should be set in accordance with the Federal/Provincial/Territorial guidelines based on the respondent's gross yearly income. $600.00 per month per child was awarded.  6)The court must seek to promote the economic self-sufficiency of each spouse. The petitioner's future plans were realistic. $800 per month until June 1, 2001 was awarded for spousal support.  7)Costs including one-half of the cost of preparing reports and pension valuations were awarded to the petitioner.","The parties agreed on their divorce based on their separation in excess of one year and that Mary be granted custody of the children with reasonable access to John upon reasonable notice. The parties also agreed that the amount of maintenance should be based on the respondent's gross yearly income as determined by the Federal/Provincial/Territorial Guidelines. The respondent indicated that the costs of maintaining herself and the children were approximately $2,462 monthly. Given the relative income of the parties and current income tax implications, the amount is reasonable and fair."
b_1999canlii12407.txt,"The defendant, who was to install sewer and water lines on four lots for the hamlet, was charged with seven violations of the Occupational Health and Safety Act and Regulations. It had been agreed that the offences were strict liability. The principle issue was whether the defendant had an obligation imposed by law with respect to the workers and if so whether he discharged it by exercising due diligence in the circumstances. The essential facts were not in dispute. HELD: The defendant was found guilty on all offences.  1)There is a legal duty on an employer under the Act to take steps to supervise and oversee excavations to ensure the usual protocols for safety are met. This requires at a minimum the presence of an experienced person on site. Any reasonable person with some knowledge of worksite safety would insist that the walls be properly sloped, that there be at a ladder or other method to get out of the trench and that first aid supplies were readily available. Supervision is essential particularly when the worker is inexperienced. The deceased had had no experience in sewer and water trenching. No inexperienced person should be allowed to work on such a potentially dangerous site without proper training and specific guidance and supervision. The Law is specific on the requirements to be met for safety of the workers on excavation and sewer and water hookups. 2)The remedial progress report was ruled inadmissible. There was no formal comment on the issue of admissibility. 3)The Act does not define due diligence but well established case authority defines it as taking reasonable care to avoid causing harm which is prohibited by law. 4)The Act does not apply to a contractor. The relationship had all the ordinary indicia of an employer/employee relationship. The defendant controlled the project, tools and materials and bore the risk of loss or profit, had the ultimate responsibility for the worksite, completion of the project and the payment of wages.","The defendant was charged with seven violations of the Occupational Health and Safety Act, 1993. The defendant had obtained a contract from the Hamlet to install sewer and water lines on four lots. The contract was for $16,000. The plaintiff was an employee of the defendant. The court found that the defendant had an obligation imposed by law with respect to the workers at the excavation site. The Court found that if the defendant did have an obligation, it did so by exercising due diligence in the circumstances. The evidence showed that the relationship between the defendant and the Hamlets was one of master and servant or employer and employee. The fact that the plaintiff arranged for his nephew to work with him does not make the defendant an employer since the defendant was negligent. The facts of the case are not in dispute and they are fairly straight-forward. The trial judge found that there was no admissibility to the report. The only issue that was raised was whether the defendant obeyed the Act by exercising his due diligence. The judge also found that although the defendant knew that the Hamlett employees were not in the service of the employer, he did not have a legal obligation to perform the work. The issue was whether he discharged his duty by exercising the due diligence required by the Act. The accused was found guilty of seven offences. The first offence was breach of the fiduciary duty to ensure the health, safety and welfare of the workers. The second offence was failure to provide and maintain a first aid station. The third offence was breaching the fidiority duty by failing to provide a first-aid station."
b_1999skqb167.txt,"An appeal of a conviction for having the care or control of a motor vehicle after consuming in excess of 80 milligrams of alcohol in 100 millilitres of blood contrary to s.253(b) and s.255(1) of the Criminal Code. Although the trial judge concluded the appellant rebutted the presumption in s.258(1)(where it is proven that an accused occupies the seat normally occupied by the operator of the vehicle, it is presumed he is in care and control unless he can establish that he did not occupy the seat for the purpose of setting the vehicle in motion), the appellant was found to be in de facto control. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. It was clear from the trial judge's acceptance of the evidence of the two paramedics who had noted the car parked in an unusual place and police officer who came along later, that he rejected the theory advanced by the appellant's counsel. The location of the ignition key was not relevant. The appellant's memory of the events was far from clear given the level of his intoxication. The trial judge was entitled to accept and rely on the evidence of the Crown witnesses.","The accused appealed his conviction on count two of the Information. HELD: The learned trial judge was entitled to accept and rely on the evidence of the Crown witnesses to support the conviction. The appeal was dismissed. The Court was entitled not to accept the evidence that the accused had not exercised care and control of his motor vehicle prior to being discovered behind the wheel. The accused was found guilty of count two. The location of the ignition key was not relevant, given the fact it was located somewhere on the right side of the steering wheel. Counsel for the accused advanced spirited argument that the evidence outlined by the learned judge did not justify the conclusion that the Crown had established proof of 'care and control' beyond a reasonable doubt. For example, he attacked the evidence the two ambulance attendants and the police officer over the accused's version of what took place."
b_2000canlii4425.txt,"Plaintiff suffered soft tissue damage to knee when he tripped over a dolly cart in a building supply warehouse. Knee became swollen and infected and he was off work for 12 days. He claimed for pain and suffering, loss of income and loss of earning capacity. Plaintiff was found 60% responsible for injuries and defendant 40% responsible. Damages were assessed as follows: $8,500.00 for general damages, $5,000.00 as damages for loss of income and $1,000.00 for loss of ability to perform household tasks. The dolly cart out of view behind the counter was an 'unusual danger' which the defendant knew or ought to have known of and reasonable care was not used to prevent injury. However, the plaintiff failed to look at the floor as his attention was focused on the door. He assumed nothing had changed in the area from the time he entered the premises a few minutes previously. The plaintiff was in commercial premises and should have taken greater care to observe and avoid anything in his path. The plaintiff suffered an injury which restricted his activities for the first five months, to a lesser extent for the following year and to a very limited extent to the time of trial. There was no evidence to support a claim for diminishment of earning capacity.","The plaintiff injured his knee when he tripped over a 'dolly cart' while attending at the premises of the defendant. The defendant had contracted a new business and the plaintiff had been attending at its premises to pick up lumber and other materials for a job on which he was working. The plaintiff had not seen the cart at the time of the accident and had been unable to participate in the business. He had to return to the premises to ice the knee. The court awarded the plaintiff $5,000.00 by way of general damages. The Court recognized that the defendant had not used reasonable care in these circumstances to prevent injury or damage to persons in the position of the plaintiff and that the presence of a 'cart' or 'doll' out of view would also be an 'unusual danger' notwithstanding knowledge of such dollies within the premises. The presence of the 'doyle' was not comparable to the ice in the parking lot in Breau. The damage to the plaintiff's knee was minor and did not cause him difficulty in driving. The evidence showed that the plaintiff was able to resume some of his work activities within the first few days of the incident. The injury restricted his activities during the remainder of 1995 and to lesser extent the following year and, to very limited extent, continues to the present."
b_2001skca85.txt,"The Court of Appeal was required to determine the limits of its authority to change the application of the Rule against Perpetuities, an established common law principle, to a particular type of oil and gas lease. In 1950 Taylor entered a 'top' (head) lease for mineral rights with Freeholders Oil, effective upon the expiry of Imperial's interest in 1959. The new owner of the land recognized the assignment of the 1961 top lease sold to Tarragon in 1993. After reaching an agreement in 1993 in principle for a 'farmout' arrangement whereby Maxx agreed to drill the lands for Tarragon, Maxx concluded the top lease offended the Rule against Perpetuities and entered its own lease with the landowner. The trial judge held the 1950 Freeholders lease was void because it contravened the Rule against Perpetuities; although top leases do not offend the policy behind the rule, any modification of the rule is best left to the legislature; there was a breach of confidence. HELD: The appeal was allowed with costs on double column V. The action for a declaration that the top lease is void was dismissed with costs in Queen's Bench. 1)The top lease in question was not void as it did not offend the object and purpose of the Rule. The reasoning and approach of the Supreme Court of Canada in Salituro, Tolofson and Morguard was persuasive. The decision of the House of Lords in Arthur J S Hall demonstrates the need to re-examine archaic rules of common law which cannot be justified in modern society. The genius of the common law lies in its adaptiveness to changing times. Its basic principles are not meant to become rigid formulae. Common law rules may be tweaked to do justice between the parties when a rigid and mechanistic application of the rule would run counter to the object and purpose of the rule. Since the socio-economic and political conditions which gave rise to the creation of the Rule no longer exist, it was open to the Court to consider the application of the rule in the context of a commercial instrument such as the top lease in question.  2)Although top leases have been attacked on other grounds, this was the first case before the Saskatchewan Courts in which the Rule against Perpetuities has been advanced to void such a lease. The historical background and object and purpose of the rule were reviewed. The general purpose is to prevent the tying up of property to the detriment of society in general. The common law rule against perpetuities prevails over intention because it is not a rule of construction, but a rule of property. A mere possibility, or even a probability that the estate or interest may vest within the time is not enough. The 'wait and see' doctrine has been adopted by statute in some jurisdictions.DISSENT: The Court should not modify the Rule in the face of the significance of such a modification, the efforts of the legislature to legislate and the inability to deal with such issues as the retrospective operation of such a decision. The Rule against Perpetuities applies to this top lease. As there is no life in being in this case, the interest must vest within 21 years of its creation which would have been 1971. The Rule is not concerned with the duration of an interest but only that an interest may vest at a remote time in the future. The rule invalidates interests in land that vest too remotely.",The trial judge held that the lease was void because it breached the rule against perpetuities. He allowed the counterclaim by the appellant Tarragon against the respondent Maxx Petroleum Ltd. for breach of confidence with consequent directions for an accounting and assessment of damages. The principal question on this appeal is whether the appellants' oil and gas 'top lease' with the late Harry Herbert Taylor should be rendered void by the rule of perpetuity. HELD: The trial judge found that the 'top leases' with Harry Herbert and the late Maxx were void because they breached the Rule against perpetuity. The policy behind the rule is not offended. The court allowed the application for declaration to that effect. The trial court found that it was possible that the phrase 'top' in the impugned clause speaks to contingency and to the future. The Court found that this was the first case before the Saskatchewan Courts in which the rule was advanced to a void such lease. The facts were not in dispute. The only issue at trial was whether the lease breached the common law rule against the perpetuites. The issue was whether this 1950 Freeholders lease was a void under the rule. The fact that the original Freeholders leased to the defendant was not an issue. The test for whether there was a breach of the rule for perpetuism was to determine whether the term of the lease in question was void. The rule against a perpetuistic lease was not offended by the fact that it breached a rule against them. The principles of the Rule are not offended and the policy behind it is not offend.
b_2002nsca30.txt,"A fifteen year old died in a motor vehicle accident. The estate brought a claim for loss of future income and lost earning capacity. The Chambers judge found that such a claim was not available and the estate appealed. Appeal dismissed; the context of the legislation, its purpose and text all support the conclusion that the deceased's loss of prospective earnings is not an actual pecuniary loss to the estate.","Where a person is killed due to the fault of another, the estate may sue the wrongdoer for certain damages which have resulted in an actual pecuniary loss to the estate. The Legislature has denied such a claim to the Estate but has provided the deceased's dependants with a statutory cause of action for the lost financial support and other losses resulting from the wrongful death. The appellants appeal that determination. HELD: Appeal dismissed. 1) Where a person was killed due the fault or other such a person, the Estate was not entitled to claim damages for loss of future earnings and are therefore recoverable by the estate in an action against the wrongdie. 2) The Nova Scotia survival of actions legislation contained several exclusions and limitations not found in the earlier Ontario and English legislation. The Nova Scotian legislation excluded causes of action, not being excluded from general provisions of the 1934 Act. The Act limits the type of damages which may be recovered by the Estate to those which have a reasonable expectation of receiving significant financial support from the deceased. 3) The provisions of Nova Scotia's survival of action legislation contained a number of exclusions, limitations and limitations. The only significant claim under the Act was for loss in expectation of life. The Court reviewed the relevant provisions of this legislation and found that the provisions of these provisions were not in issue. The provisions in Nova Scotia were not new to the Legislature. The law was updated in 1986 to permit recovery of damages for the guidance, care and companionship which the survivors lost as a result of the deceased’s death."

The defendant did not file affidavit evidence but opposed the application solely on the basis that recent amendments to the Queen's Bench Act precludes reference to minutes of settlement. HELD: The plaintiff was entitled to enter judgment for $15,000 plus costs of this application. A settlement agreement reduced to writing in no way offends the confidentiality required under s.28.1. The plaintiff is entitled to rely on the minutes of settlement and must be permitted to refer to them in his affidavit. Section 28.1 is not meant to apply to this situation. If a party to an action is unable to enforce a concluded settlement, the pre-trial process becomes meaningless. The legislation never intended such a result. There was no suggestion that there was non-disclosure, misrepresentation, duress or fraud in the execution of the minutes of settlement. Nor was it suggested the minutes were unclear or ambiguous.

However the remaining $15,000 that was to be paid pursuant to the Minutes of Settlement have not been paid to the defendant. HELD: The application was granted. 1)The court should be hesitant in upsetting or rectifying minutes of a settlement unless of course there be something in the nature of fraud, incapacity of party or the minutes are too vague to enforce or are obviously incomplete. 2)The minutes of the settlement provided as follows: The minutes of settlements provided as evidence. The court should not be hesitant to order reference to discussions, conversations and the like where such allegations are raised. 3)The Court should be reluctant in upsetting, rectifying or rectification minutes of an action unless of the nature there be a fraud, or incapacity to party, or the minute of settlement are too incomplete."
b_2006skqb218.txt,"The respondent applies to vary the consent joint custody order granted in October 2004. His application was prompted by the relocation of the petitioner with one of their two children, Tyson. The sole issue on this variation application is the determination of the primary residence of Tyson. HELD: 1) The petitioner wants to move Tyson 5.5 hours away from the respondent. This also requires a change in access arrangements. These are changes in circumstances that are material.  2) The petitioner has developed a strong bond with Tyson. The respondent has developed a close relationship with the parties' other child Kailey. After Kailey went to live with the respondent, neither parent did much to facilitate the access of either child. Before the petitioner and Tyson moved, although a short distance apart, neither Kailey nor Tyson saw his or her non-custodial parent and sibling on a regular basis. Even telephone access has been sporadic. Both parents have established homes that accommodate only one child. 3) The petitioner's move must be considered in light of the circumstances that existed before the petitioner's relocation. The parties had already adopted a split custody arrangement without formalizing access or adjusting child support. 4) Permitting the petitioner to relocate is in the best interests of Tyson. It is important that Tyson continue to live in the home of the parent whose constant presence he has become accustomed to. The petitioner has always been Tyson's primary caregiver.

The Court found that it was in the best interests of the children to continue living together. The respondent was permitted to relocate the children from Kindersley to Archerwill. The primary residence of the respondent is with the petitioner. The petitioner shall be permitted to move the children. The issue of access was whether the petitioner should be permitted in the first place. The parties had already adopted a split custody arrangement without formalizing access or adjusting child support. The move was to an entirely new and different community. The children would be living with grandparents, attending school less able to provide for his special needs and away from his friends and family. That will be disruption to the children's ability to maintain close relationship with each other and with both parents. The applicant was granted access to the petitioner and the petitioner on an interim basis. Access to the respondent and access to access to both parties was not acknowledged. Access was not made to the applicant. The child was not permitted to speak to the court. The issues were not addressed in the hearing."

HELD: The appeal is dismissed. The trial judge was not required to accept the entirety of the witness's testimony, despite having accepted most of it, particularly in light of the contradictory evidence of the respondent denying the sum claimed by the appellant. The denial by the respondent of the appellant's claim, accepted by the trial judge, was fatal to the appellant's onus of proving a mutual understanding and absolute acknowledgement of the alleged debt between the parties.","This was an appeal from a judgment which found that the appellant admitted owing $1,685.86 to the respondent who accepted that amount as being the correct quantum of counterclaim.

As per the order, she personally served the appellant's mother and notified the appellant of the hearing date by text message. He didn't appear and default judgement was granted against the appellant in the amount of $11,031.35. The appellant appealed, arguing the adjudicator failed to follow the natural requirements of justice. He denied being in contact with his mother. He admitted receiving the text message(s) but said he didn't believe the respondent, but didn't make any further inquiries. New evidence (a letter from his mother saying she was not in contact with her son) was allowed on the appeal. Appeal dismissed. The right to be heard is a fundamental right, and an appeal of a default judgment must be subject to the highest scrutiny. Here the respondent's claim was valid. The adjudicator had the jurisdiction/authority to make an order for substituted service and the respondent followed it. At the very least, the appellant was notified of the hearing dates by text message(s). While he may not have believed the messages, he should have taken some steps to confirm with the court if there was indeed a hearing set.

The Respondent appeals that judgment by Notice Of Appeal (see below). HELD: The respondent must accept the consequences of his decision to ignore the notice. The Court has sympathy for the appellant and for the reason he did attend the hearing. The Stated Case is set out below by the learned adjudicator and is straight forward. The appellant was not mistaken about the date of the hearings. He was mistaken about what would be the outcome of his absence. His conscience choice to ignore hearing notification resulted in the judgment against him. Personal service was effected upon him by the Order for Substituted Service granted by the Small Claim Court in accordance with the provisions of the Act and Regulations of the SCC.

b_2010skqb187.txt,"The plaintiff granted the defendant a mortgage over a parcel of land just outside the city limits. The defendant failed to make any payment. The plaintiff applied for foreclosure on the land and an order nisi for judicial sale. The defendant was a developer. He argued that the foreclosure action was void because the land was being used as farmland and was subject to protection under s. 9 and 11 of The Saskatchewan Farm Land Security Act. The other issues before the court were the appropriate period of redemption and whether the plaintiff could submit a bid that incorporated the value of the land as a 'credit' enabling the plaintiff to merely 'top up' the bid by the additional amount needed to reach the bid price. HELD: The Saskatchewan Farm Land Security Act (SFSA) did not apply. The undisputed evidence was that since the defendant acquired the land in 2007, their focus was to develop the land as an industrial park and they had undertaken a host of activities to achieve that purpose which clearly indicated that their intent was not to farm the land in the sense contemplated by the SFSA. There was no foundation to deviate from the usual redemption period of 90 days from the date of the decision. The bidding process in a judicial sale contemplates a level playing field for all participants. The fact that the plaintiff is likely to receive a significant cash payout from the judicial sale does not modify the desirability of obliging all bidders to pay into court the full bid price. Normal bidding rules shall apply. The plaintiff was entitled to costs.","The applicant, a developer, issued a statement of claim seeking foreclosure on a parcel of land located outside the City of Saskatoon. None of the defendants entered defence but served demands for notice and then were noted for default of defence on March 12, 2010. The applicant seeks an order nisi for judicial sale pursuant to s. 11 of the Saskatchewan Farm Security Act. The application by the applicant for judicial sales is dismissed and the usual bidding rules apply. The court found that since the applicant's acquisition of the land in 2007, Alberta Ltd.'s focus and direction vis-à-vis the Land has been the undertaking of a host of activities designed to develop the Land into an industrial park. The plaintiff was not a farmer but rather a developer and the Land was not farm land but rather development site. The purpose of the bidding process in a judicial sale remedy contemplates a level playing field for all participants. The fact that the applicant is owed an amount on the mortgage and that it will likely receive a significant cash payout on sale does not modify the desirability and necessity of obliging all bidders to pay into court the full bid price. To do otherwise would be to pay heed to the financial strengths of one or more of the parties or at least give preferred position to the entity seeking foreclosure. The Court found that the application by Alberta Ltd was dismissed and usual bidding rule applied. The applicants were directed to the Land qua farm land which could reasonably bring it within the statutory purpose of s. 9 and s. 8 of the SFSA. The proposed use of the Land is intended for uses that meet the zoning guidelines set by the City. HELD: The application was dismissed.

When this brother died, his son continued to use the driveway and garden, even after the second property changed hands many times. When the current owners of the second property refused to allow the continued use of their property, the son claimed that his use of the driveway was of right on the basis of expressed reservation or prescription. He argued that his uncle was incompetent when he executed a statutory declaration stating that the use of both the driveway and the garden had been with his express permission. Judgment for the defendants; there was no express reservation of the driveway in the deed to the second property and the plaintiff did not have a prescriptive right to use the driveway. Although the plaintiff and his father had used the driveway in a continuous, uninterrupted and peaceful manner for well in excess of 20 years, the statutory declaration showed that this use had been with the uncle's permission.","The plaintiff obtained a portion of the defendant's property from the defendant. The defendant used the defendant to access the plaintiff's property. The plaintiff obtained the portion of his property from him and his wife. The defendants then proceeded to block off the defendant from accessing the plaintiff. The court found that the defendant had not shown that the reservation contained in the defendant was or incorporated the defendant into the plaintiff’s deed. The Court found that there was considerable and convincing evidence that the defendants in combination used the Borden driveway in a continuous, uninterrupted, open and peaceful manner for many years prior to it being blocked off by the Defendants. The Defendant claimed that the plaintiff had not demonstrated that the applicant’ s driveway was or incorporates the Bordens driveway. The Plaintiff’d evidence was that the respondent had used the driveway to access his property for many, many years.

The young mother was angry and was abusive. The Father was not able or able to provide for the baby. The Mother was not a person of sufficient interest. The Children and Family Support Worker was not available. The Minister's evidence was that the parents were unable to care and that physical or emotional harm was likely to occur to the child.

b_2018skca27.txt,"HELD: The appeal from conviction was dismissed and sentence appeal allowed. The sentence was varied to 12 months of probation. The court found with respect to each issue that: 1) the presumption of competent trial representation had not been displaced. The trial lawyer’s decision not to cross-examine the complainant was a tactical one. She was very young and had difficulty expressing herself in the courtroom whereas she had given clear, coherent statements to the police shortly after the offence. The lawyer determined that it was not beneficial to the appellant’s position to highlight those statements by raising certain inconsistences between them and the complainant’s testimony;  2) the trial judge’s assessment of credibility was entitled to deference. He correctly identified R v W.(D.) as the guiding legal principle in the circumstances and his credibility findings were supportable on the evidence; and 3) the sentence was unfit because denunciation and deterrence are secondary factors in sentencing young offenders and are to be considered in a fashion consistent with the principle of “diminished moral blameworthiness” described in s. 3 the YCJA. The court acknowledged that this offence, committed against an 11-year-old and causing her serious psychological harm, might warrant a custodial sentence but for the appellant’s exemplary conduct since the offence and the almost four years that had elapsed between the offence in 2012 and his sentencing in 2016. Under s. 3(1)(b)(iv) and (v) of the YCJA, the delay in this case offended the concept of timely justice. To impose a custodial sentence on the appellant in this case would be contrary to the purposes of the YCJA as it would impede the appellant’s rehabilitation and reintegration into society. The court decided that a fit sentence in this case would be 12 months of probation.","The appellant was convicted after trial of sexually assaulting his 11-year-old niece contrary to s. 271 of the Criminal Code. The appellant argued the trial judge made errors in assessing the credibility of the witnesses and that he received ineffective trial representation. The trial judge sentenced the appellant to an 18 month custody and supervision order, 12 months to be served in secured custody followed by months of community supervision. The appeal was allowed and the sentence imposed was varied to 12 months probation. HELD: The appeal is dismissed. 1) It is well understood that an appellate court must show 'great deference' to a trial judge's assessment of witness credibility. The Court must show great deference to a judge's assessments of witness reliability. The evidence satisfies the threshold for admission as set out in Palmer (1979), 1979 CanLII (SCC), [1979] SCR 827. 2) It was well understood the restrictions on imposing a custodial sentence unless the gateway to custody was open pursuant to s39(1) of the Code. It is also well understood in this case that an appeal court must demonstrate great deferential to a court's assessment. 3) The appellant had failed to show great respect to the trial Judge's assessment and credibility. He failed to establish that the representation provided by trial counsel was incompetent. The sentence appeal was dismissed. 4) The Court found that an appeals court must be 'great in deference', as the trial court did not err in its assessment of the credibility. 5) The evidence must meet the criteria set out by Palmer (1978), 1979 SCC (SCH), [1980) SCR 759 at 775. The principles of denunciation and deterrence were paramount sentencing principles in the circumstances. The sentencing judge committed an error in principle when he emphasized denunciation as the paramount sentencing objectives. This error impacted the sentence. The conviction appeal is allowed and sentence imposed is varied to a 12 months community supervision order. 6) The court found that the appellant had shown great deferrence to the judge's assess of witness and credibility and that there were no basis to interfere with the conviction. The court also found that it was not necessary to interfere in the conviction appeal. The decision to vary the sentence was made in accordance with the declaratory principles found in Palmer.

In this case, the court found that the judge had not erred in his decisions regarding the first and the third requests for adjournment but had in the second request by failing to provide sufficient reasons for his denial. Amongst many factors it considered, the court found that most importantly, the appellant had not caused his counsel to withdraw for the purpose of delaying trial. It concluded that the error resulted in a miscarriage of justice based upon the appellant’s poor conduct of his own defence and lack of understanding of trial process.","The accused appealed his conviction on a charge of fraud over $5,000. The trial judge refused to grant an adjournment, finding that there was no tenable basis for interfering with the trial judge's discretion in refusing to grant the adjournment and ordering a new trial. The Court applied the framework for review from Barrette The Queen to Ironchild, where the accused argued the trial court's refusal to grant a full answer and defence deprived him of the right to make full answer, defence and a fair trial. In Ironchild the Court found that the trial was a 'perfect storm' and that the Court was all too aware of the factors that might affect the decision to grant or deny an adjournments.

Moge (1992), 43 R.F.L.(3d) 345 (S.C.C.) and found that marriage and child care responsibilities hinder a wife's role in the workplace. The court awarded $4500 per month as spousal and child support, plus an additional $500 while the wife retrained.

The Executive Committee of LEADS issued a reprimand to be placed on his file for five years and a fine of $2,500. At issue was whether the Discipline Committee erred in its findings of fact and the burden of proof, whether the facts, if true, constituted professional misconduct and whether the penalty imposed was excessive. HELD: Appeal dismissed.  1)The legislation does not appear to call for a change in the traditional approach. The fact that an appellate judge can substitute his or her decision for that of the Discipline Committee or order of an executive does not mean that the appellate court's view of the facts and credibility of witnesses supercedes in any way the role of the Discipline Committee unless it finds there were inappropriate inferences drawn, conclusions reached which were not supported by the evidence, or a misdirection on a point of law. None were found in either case. The Discipline Committee did not err in its interpretation of 'professional misconduct' or its application to the facts.  2)Section 52 of the LEADS Act and s62 of the Medical Profession Act, 1981 are virtually the same except for minor changes in wording and format. The jurisprudence under the Medical Profession Act was applicable to the standard of review in this case. 3)The penalty imposed was not wrong or unjustified.

c_1998canlii14058.txt,"FIAT. An application pursuant to Rule 188 for a determination of whether the defendant was liable pursuant to s86(1) of the Highway Traffic Act for the personal injuries of the infant plaintiff or was immune from liability by virtue of s228 [now s232] of the Education Act. The second point of law to be determined was whether the co-defendant as car owner was liable if the driver was found to be immune from liability. The motor vehicle accident occurred while the infant plaintiff was being transported during a field trip, approved by the defendant school board, and the defendant was the teacher. HELD: 1)The teacher/driver was acting within the scope of her duties and was immune from liability by virtue of the Education Act. 2)The owner was only liable to the same extent as the driver. The reasoning in Neault was directly on point. Just as the Workers' Compensation Act and the Highway Traffic Act prevent the injured worker from suing the owner of the vehicle because he is prevented from suing the driver, the Education Act extends the same immunity to the owner as it does to the driver by operation of s86(1) of the Highway Traffic Act. 3)There was no apparent conflict between the statutes. When read together, the legislation provides that a negligent teacher is granted immunity from liability if the teacher has acted within the scope of the Education Act. The Traffic Act is the general statute, governing liability of all drivers. The Court did not agree with the School Board's analysis that the Education Act was the general statute. 4)The injured plaintiff was not denied a party to sue for negligent operation of a vehicle as he had recourse against the school board and its insurer. The immunity under the Education Act only applies to teachers and principals.","FIAT. The school board applied pursuant to Rule 188 of The Queen's Bench Rules for a determination of the following points of law: 1)Whether the defendant is liable for personal injuries sustained by the infant plaintiff or whether the co-defendant is immune from liability by s. 228 of The Highway Traffic Act for the personal injuries of the infant. The Education Act is the general statute dealing with teacher's liability and immunity in a general way. Oppositely, the Highway Traffic act is specifically directed to liability arising from motor vehicle negligence. The specific creates an exception to the general, and negligent teacher/driver, even acting within the scope of s.228 of The Education act, is liable. The teacher's immunity is an exception. The wording of s8(1) of The HELD Act extends that restriction to the owner of the motor vehicle involved in the accident. The School Board was not immune from this analysis. The evidence showed that the teacher's immune from the liability s8 of The Highways Act was not in conflict with the Education Act. The fact that the school board was not the party to the accident was not a factor. The facts were that the bus driver was immune from negligence s8. The bus driver's immunity extended to the employer. The education board was immune. The student was not liable for the injury to the plaintiff. The principal was immune to liability s9. The Highway Act is a general statute, governing liability of all drivers of motor vehicles. The Teacher's immunity only applies to the teacher. The Board was immune in the event of a school board action. The issue was whether the school was immune under the s8 provisions of the Education act. The board was entitled to sue the employer based on the facts. The court was not entitled to find the school immune from such liability. The Student's Law was not an issue. The Court was unable to find that the School Board's position was that the Education was the general law dealing with the teacher and immunity s8 in a specific way. The principle of generali specialibus non derogant was applied. The case was not related to the Education. The Act was the broad statute dealingwith teacher's and immunity. The only exception was the teacher who was the school's teacher."

The objections were categorized as the questions sought to elicit the plaintiff's manner of investigation or expert opinions; it should have been asked of another witness better suited to answer or third parties as the questions relate to issues between the defendant and the third parties; it was irrelevant or improper. HELD: 1)The plaintiffs were not required to answer questions which would require them to accept or reject an opinion of another party to the action. 2)The plaintiffs should answer what cellulose fibre insulation was present at the time of the fire. 3)The affidavit answered whether Miner was a participant in the investigation notwithstanding the defendants are not entitled to the names of possible expert witnesses at the discovery stage. 4)Any meeting between the plaintiff's investigators and the fire marshal clearly related to its investigation and is privileged. The defendants could obtain the information directly from the fire marshal. 5)The question of whether there was any liaison between the city fire investigator and SIAST was improper as it relates to the manner of investigation. Questions can be asked of the city. 6)Details of the plaintiff's investigation, including an engineer's report, was protected by litigation privilege. 7)The question regarding what observations were made of the damage was too vague. The plaintiff's claim was in excess of $7 million. A proper foundation must be laid in the context of specific questions and answers given or not given (Hill v. Arcola School Division). The defendants are not entitled to expert opinion. 8)Whether SPMC's insurer's investigation team participated related to manner of investigation and was therefore privileged. 9)The defendant will be able to examine the city in the third party claim with respect to documents from the fire department. 10)All discussions at mediation proceedings are strictly confidential. The name of the plaintiff's expert, who prepared the drawings in contemplation of litigation, is privileged. 11)The facts and observations upon which expert opinions are based must be disclosed including any photographs.  12)Whether any pattern on the wood would indicate contact by propane flame required expert opinion. 13)Questions concerning what material first ignited could only be answered by having experts reconstruct what in their opinion occurred at the time the fire started. 14)If the plaintiffs do not have a position (on whether there was a fire stop in the 1967 construction of the tower), there is no rule the court is aware of requiring them to adopt a position. They can be required to give an undertaking to provide a position if they adopt one at a later date. Whether they believed the building was built in accordance with the 1960 fire code when constructed in 1967 was information obtainable by the defendants. 15)If the party being examined had no control over or greater access to a witness than the examining party, it need only disclose the evidence known to it. There is no obligation to seek information from third parties when the defendants are capable of obtaining that information. 16)An undertaking was given to advise if and when the plaintiffs develop a position on whether the parapet roof was constructed in accordance with the detail set out in FC and whether the detail in the sketch of the Tower parapet was correct. 17)If the request for the proposal related to Kelsey, the document should be produced, but if it only related to the Regina campus, the document was not relevant. 18)Whether it was considered anytime that Hagblom would be a sub-consultant was a legal question. The trial judge will interpret the terms of the agreement. 19)Any information required could be obtained directly from the architects who had been added as third parties by the defendants.  20)The plaintiffs gave undertakings to answer the other questions and did not object to answering them. 21)The 36 objections (less 3 that were withdrawn) failed. It would be an abuse of process for the defendants to ask the same question of a second officer hoping to obtain a different answer. The same question can be put if the first did not answer it. The fact there were three separate officers does not restrict the defendants to only asking certain questions of each. The reason for having three officers, each with a different expertise in a certain area, was to prevent the plaintiffs from having to give endless undertakings. Having all three present during each examination would have saved time and unnecessary legal fees. 22)The exhibit was not before the court to determine how complicated the question was. Defence counsel was to break it down. 23)There were 200 undertakings. As a general rule examinations for discovery should be completed before the party being examined is required to comply with the undertakings. It would lead to endless delay if the examining party were allowed to simply adjourn and demand the undertakings be complied with. There were no exceptional circumstances.  24)Costs were left to the trial judge.","The defendants brought this application to compel responses to a large number of questions that were objected to at examinations for discovery of the proper officers on behalf of Saskatchewan Property Management Corporation (SPMC). They also sought an order requiring SPMC to comply with numerous undertakings. HELD: The Court granted relief of a general nature that the meaning of the order is uncertain. 1) The Court failed to see why a party to an action should be required to accept or reject an opinion of another party to the action. 2) The respondents were seeking details of the plaintiffs' investigation and that information is protected by litigation privilege. 3) The question asked was 'what observations were made of the damage post fire, the damage to the roof and its attic that would connect the point of breakout to the point where Hagblom were operating or were working?' The question posed a legal question. The Court was asked whether SPMc had any position on the matter. The answer was 'yes'. 4) The court failed to provide a reasonable degree of specificity to the question of this nature when reference was made to document. The court was not entitled to ask the plaintiff's expert opinion on burn pattern. 5) The questions were asked of SPMCs. The respondents should have asked the plaintiff if SPMCA had any information about the damage caused by the fire. The plaintiff was not required to provide that information. 6) The plaintiff's evidence was not privileged. The plaintiffs were entitled to know what was observable to anybody looking at the wall where the Soprema was being applied not to an expert's interpretation of what was in issue. The facts were privileged. It would be improper for the plaintiff to demand that SPMCI's expert opinions be disclosed. The only thing that would be privileged is the plaintiff having access to the plaintiff’s documents. The defendant was not obliged to provide the plaintiff with the names of potential witnesses. The documents were privileged and the plaintiff was entitled to have the plaintiff provide the names. The questions asked of the plaintiff were privileged because the plaintiff had not seen the documents. It was not necessary for the plaintiffs to know whether the plaintiff received the statements during the course of their investigation. The defendants were not entitled the plaintiff would have to provide an expert opinion. The order cannot stand. The issue is whether a party is entitled to accept an opinion from another party. The question is privileged. There is no obligation on the plaintiff that the plaintiffs are entitled to the names and observations made in the report. The"
c_2003skqb46.txt,"The Attorney General applied to strike out the plaintiff's claims on the grounds they are statute-barred by virtue of the LAA s.3 and that all the claims except for trespass to person are not exempted by s.3(3.1); by POPA s.2; alternatively, the Court has no jurisdiction over any cause of action relating to intentional torts committed by a Crown servant or employee prior to May 14, 1953; all claims arising from the conduct of two deceased Sisters who died in 1988 and 1993 are barred by the TA and SAA. The plaintiff claimed he was physically assaulted by employees and staff and suffered the loss of his traditional language and culture between 1944 and 1952 while attending the Qu'Appelle Residential School. The AG acknowledged the plaintiff attended the school from 1946 until 1949. The AG in a previous application was granted leave to amend its statement of defence and third party claim to plead and rely upon the Crown Liability and Proceedings Act; Limitations of Actions Act ss.31(d),(h) and (j); Public Officers' Protection Act; Trustee Act s.59, or its predecessor legislation Survival of Actions Act s.10; Crown Liability Act s.3(1)(a) and the Exchequer Court Act s.19. A third party claim against the Oblats alleging they controlled and operated the residential school at all material times, was not relevant on this application. HELD: 1)The claim based on physical assault by the Sisters was struck. The Court has no jurisdiction over any cause of action relating to intentional torts committed by a Crown servant or employee prior to May 14, 1953. The Crown remains immune from claims for trespass, assault and battery committed by servants and officers before the enactment of the Crown Liability Act in 1953 (renamed the Crown Liability and Proceedings Act in 1990), which did not operate retroactively. The LAA s.3(3.1) does not create a cause of action but simply removes statutory time limitation periods barring otherwise existing actions. Before May 14, 1953 the Crown was subject to claims for negligence pursuant to the Exchequer Court Act s.19(c). The Dyson procedure is available in Canada in every jurisdiction except New Brunswick and Nova Scotia. 2)The claim based on negligence is subject to the two year time limitation prescribed by LAA s.3(1)(d) which must calculated having regard to the principles of discoverability. 3)The claims of breach of trust and breach of fiduciary duty are equitable claims subject to the six year time limitation in LAA ss.3(1)(h) which explicitly begins to run from the discovery of the cause of action (PG v. AG Canada). Relevant factual issues are to be dealt with at trial. 4)Even though the claim in trespass is based on acts alleged to have occurred over 50 years ago, it clearly falls within the class of actions contemplated by LAA s.3(3.1)(b)(ii). As such it is also exempted from any limitation period against others liable for the conduct. 5)The argument that the 12 month limitation period in POPA s.2(1)(a) should be applied in priority to the more general provisions of the LAAA was rejected in RJG v. AG Canada. 6)Claims based on direct liability of the Crown for negligence, breach of trust and fiduciary duty are not affected by time limitation periods applicable to the deceased Sister Greyeyes and her estate. The time limitation periods are abrogated by LAA s.3(3.2). Since there is no limitation period barring an action against the Sister or her estate, there can be no provincial limitation period available to the Federal Crown under CLPA s.24. 7)The other claims made directly against the Federal Crown are not affected by limitation periods applicable to Sister Elle or her estate. SAA ss.5 and 10(1),(3) and (4) do not bar the claims against her.  LAA s.3(3.2) abrogates the time limitation in SAA s.10(3)(b).","The Attorney General applies to strike out the plaintiff's claims on the grounds that they are barred by certain statutes or alternatively that the Court has no jurisdiction over any cause of action relating to an alleged intentional tort committed by a Crown servant or employee prior to May 14, 1953. HELD: 1) The Attorney General applied to strike the plaintiff’s claims on five alternative grounds. The Attorney general acknowledges that the plaintiff attended the Residential School from February 1946 until June 1949. The plaintiff alleges continuing injury and that he was in relationship with the perpetrators of the assaults. 2) The law is clear that any claims arising from acts or omissions that predate May 14 are barred. The Court has a duty to protect actions of public authority “of an internal or operational character” or that are predominately of private character. The 12 month time limitation period under s. 24(1)(d)(h) does not apply. 3) The Court had no jurisdiction to hear or adjudicate upon any cause or action relating the intentional torts of officers and servants of the Crown occurring before the proclamation of the LAA. The wording of s.24(1) of the POPA is clear and unambiguous. Even if the time limitation in the POPa applies to claims other than those described in s.3(3.1) the plaintiff has cause of actions they can pursue under the Exchequer Court Act or its successor, the Federal Court Act. 4) The Law is clear the plaintiff cannot pursue a claim against the Federal Crown for the intentional tort of trespass, assault and battery of its officers and employees occurring prior to June 1953. The only vehicle available for bringing proceedings against the Attorney General of Canada in provincial court is the Trustee Act. The Act does not provide a remedy in tort. The 18 month time limit period under the POPAA is set aside by s. 3(3(1(1)) of the Act. 5) The court has no authority to determine whether the plaintiff can satisfy the requirements of discoverability. The language of s3(2) of s2(1). The law states that the limitation period in the LPA is set at 6 years from the discovery of the cause of the action. The law also states that s.2(3) of The LAA does not create causes of action but simply removes statutory time limitation periods barring otherwise existing actions. The court adopted the [R.J.G.] decision and concluded that the POPAs do not bar the plaintiff from proceeding to trial"
c_2004nssc248.txt,"In a divorce proceeding, the wife claimed lump sum spousal support in the amount of $20,000 to allow her to return to her native country. She also claimed that periodic maintenance was not appropriate because of the difficulty of enforcement when she is living abroad and referenced two occasions when the husband was paying periodic support that she had to seek the assistance of Maintenance Enforcement. The husband opposed paying any more spousal support but expressed a preference for lump sum support if he was required to pay more, as it would allow him to move on with his life with his new family. Husband ordered to pay a lump sum award of $10,000 to wife; when the parties moved to Nova Scotia, the husband was able to improve his financial situation, while the wife's position deteriorated.","HELD: The respondent was awarded spousal support of $5,000. The court found that the respondent was entitled to lump sum spousa support of the amount suggested by the respondent. The respondent had not made any periodic payments. The Court found that there was a need and ability to pay, albeit diminishing in view of the evidence of the respondent that the major contract held by his company was not being renewed. The amount suggested was $28,000, which the respondent had estimated would be $5k. The respondents were now working, albeit part-time, and the Court found the respondent could not afford the lump sum. The applicant was awarded lump sum support of approximately $5K. The petitioner was awarded $10,000 by way of lump sum, which was sufficient to cover her living expenses for the duration of the marriage. The award of a lump sum was not appropriate as the respondent did not have the means to pay it. The evidence showed that the applicant had no means to obtain spousals. The parties were married for 30 years and had two children. The husband had a substantial income and the two children were now living in Nova Scotia. The wife had a modest income and was able to pay spousas in the amount of $16,000 over two years. The child had a relatively modest income. The father was now working part- time and the parties had no children. Although the respondent's income had declined, the Court was satisfied that the child had the means and ability of the husband to pay support. The only issue on this hearing was whether the respondent would be able to meet the standard of living that was expected of her. The family was now living on the assumption that the husband would be moving to Nova Scotia in the near future. The mother was now in the United States and the father was working part time. The children were in the home of the petitioner. The marriage was a very difficult one for the respondent to achieve. The Family Law Division ordered the respondent pay $10k."
c_2008nssm39.txt,"The applicant law firm applied for a taxation of accounts in a complicated family law matter. The client contended that there was obvious overbilling and that the solicitor was negligent in failing to specify in an interim Order the actual time at which she had to leave the matrimonial home. Accounts as presented are certified; there was no indication whatsoever of overbilling, whether with respect to legal fees or disbursements, and there was no negligence on the part of the solicitor as she had acted reasonably in relying on the representations of the husband's lawyer as to when the Order would be enforced. It is not always necessary to examine every single entry in detail on a line-by-line basis; an overall view of the entries contained in an account can be taken when assessing reasonableness. The temporal limitation of cross-examination is within the Small Claims Court's scope of discretion in special circumstances.",The applicant sought a taxation of the accounts issued to the respondent. The respondent argued that the respondent was negligent in the execution of an order that granted interim exclusive possession of a matrimonial home to the applicant's estranged spouse. The Respondent argued that this was an obvious overbilling and that the respondents had not kept their informed of all actions taken on her behalf. The applicant also alleged that the Respondent was negligent with regard to the execution the Court Order that granted exclusive possession and a matrononial home. The respondents' response to taxation was that the applicant had not asked the respondent why she went to the taxation hearing. The reply to the Respondents' response was that it was more likely that the decision maker had not been aware of the issues at hand and that she had not followed proper procedure. The Court of Appeal's decision may not be particularly applicable to the appellant. The trial judge's evidence regarding the respondent's retainer was not supported by the respondent’s evidence. The court found no evidence that the appellant had any prior apprehension of bias. The appellant’ evidence regarding her retainer did not appear to be relevant to the Court of appeal’ s decision. The evidence regarding whether the respondent had received a copy of the respondent in the prior claim was sufficient to establish that the parties were in agreement that the matter was settled. The only issue that was raised was whether the Respondenting had received the respondent as the sole recipient of the money. The answer was that she did not. The application was dismissed. The matter was resolved. The appeal judge’d decision was not the only one to be made. The decision was made in the context of the trial judge”s decision.
c_2009skca53.txt,"The three respondents pled guilty to three offences: trafficking in cocaine for the benefit of, or at the direction of, or in association with a criminal organization contrary to s. 467.12 of the Criminal Code; conspiring together and with others to traffic in cocaine contrary to s. 5(1) of the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act and s. 465(1)(c) of the Criminal Code; and trafficking in cocaine contrary to s. 5(1) of the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act. On the last two counts, each was sentenced to 1 year less a day to be served in the community on each count, to be served concurrently, plus a 10 year fire arms prohibition. On the first count, each was sentenced to serve 1 year, in the community, consecutive to the sentences for the other counts. They were also subjected to DNA orders and there was an order of forfeiture of a vehicle belonging to a third party. The Crown appealed these sentences on the grounds that the sentencing judge failed to give proper effect to the gravity of these offences. The Court weighed all the evidence and circumstances of the accused, and found the sentencing judge was clearly moved by the personal circumstances of the accused and while they are mitigating and would normally justify a sentence at the low end of the range, it was the Court's view that the sentencing judge gave them undue weight in comparison to the principles of denunciation and general deterrence, which must play a significant role in offences of this nature. The Court further stated the 1 year sentence for the trafficking offence, to be served in the community, was demonstrably unfit given the range of sentences established in other cases of trafficking offences, even after taking into account the mitigating personal circumstances of these offenders. The Court found the sentences must be set aside. The Court found that an appropriate sentence for each of the respondents, taking into account the seriousness of the offences, the personal circumstances of the respondents, and the aggravating nature of the offences pursuant to s. 467.12, would be 18 months, concurrent, for each of the last two counts, and 1 year consecutive for the criminal organization offence, for a total of 30 months imprisonment. HELD: The total sentence in each case is 30 months, 5 months having already been served.","The Crown appealed the sentences on the grounds that the sentencing judge failed to give proper effect to the gravity of the offences, particularly in light of the volume of trafficking and lengthy period of time over which it had taken place, the highly dangerous nature of the substances sold, the fact that they were working for a criminal organization and the fact their motivation was financial gain. HELD: The appeal was allowed. 1)The sentence of one year was demonstrably unfit, even after taking into account the mitigating factors of the offenders. The sentence of 1 year was clearly unfit, in light the seriousness of the offence, the high level of the trafficking and the highly violent nature of their substances sold; the fact they were actively involved in a criminal enterprise and the motivation was a financial gain; the sentence of 10 years was demonstrable unfit.  2)The Court of Appeal had repeatedly said that the range of sentencing for trafficking in cocaine is 18 months to 4 years and that the personal circumstances of an accused, while not to be ignored, are secondary considerations to the issues of deterrence and denunciation. The Court of Appeals had repeatedly stated that the ranges of sentencing in cocaine are 18 months, 4 years to 4 year and 10 years to be consecutive for the other offences. The sentencing judge had not given proper effect in light these offences, even in light that they had been convicted of trafficking. The sentences imposed were 30 months, 5 months, 6 months, consecutive for trafficking and 10 year fire arms prohibition. The court also noted that the sentence in each case was demonstratively unfit, considering the high volume of the trafficking and lengthy time over the period, the very dangerous nature and the motivated nature of these substances sold. The total sentence imposed in this case failed to provide due weight to the aggravating factor that these offences were carried on in furtherance of criminal organization. The respondents were made subjects to DNA orders and there was an order of forfeiture of a vehicle belonging to a third party. The Crown appealed these sentences on this grounds that one year of imprisonment was demonstrative unfit, and the sentence was set out in the range set out for the offences for criminal organization, and that they must be served in the community to justify a life sentence.  3)The respondents all worked as street level cocaine dealers, selling crack cocaine in gram, gram, and gram (8-ball) amounts for criminal gang based in Edmonton known as the 'Crazy Dragons'. The respondents worked 12 hours a day and rotated their shifts so that the phone and delivery car were being operated"
c_2012nsca78.txt,", motion denied. While the province has an arguable appeal, it does not concern a summary judgment motion that would result in the claims being dismissed outright. If the certification order is struck, the province will still face individual claims. The AG has not shown that defending individual actions will cost less than defending one class proceeding. There is no evidence to estimate how it may incur significantly higher expenses as a result of how the points at issue in the appeal are resolved. The matter has been ongoing for some time and it is reasonable to expect the province has already spent time and money to prepare the defence they will eventually file. To succeed on this basis, the court would require a reliable indication of what remains to be done during the stay period, what component of that residue would be wasted if the appeal is allowed, and some estimate of that cost.","The plaintiff brought an action against the defendants for breach of fiduciary duty, coke ovens and steel plant. The defendants sought certification of the class proceeding under s. 7(1) of the Act. The plaintiff brought a motion for stay of the certification order, which was to strike the certification orders for common issues trial in class proceeding. The defendant moved for stay pending the appeal of the order in a motion to strike them certification order. The motion was granted. The court reviewed the evidence and the parties' positions and reached conclusions on the area boundaries of both the Property Owner and Residential Classes and the temporal limit of the Residential Class. The judge concluded that the plaintiffs' cause of action and common issues were reasonable and logical. He accepted that the province's grounds of appeal were arguable on their face. The Court reviewed the fine points of the motion and found that the costs of the appeal would be significantly higher because of the points in issue on the appeal. The appeal did not involve a summary judgment motion that would dismiss the claims outright, in any form, against the defendant."
c_2012nssc46.txt,"The parties agreed on discovery dates and the order in which witnesses would be discovered. As a result of an honest error, the defendant wasn't able to attend the original dates. The plaintiff became frustrated and concerned about further delays. While the defendant was making good faith efforts to resolve the discovery issues (including whether its witnesses should be excluded from attending discovery of the plaintiff's witnesses), the plaintiff's lawyer issued discovery subpoenas to compel the defendant's witnesses to appear, making the exclusion issue moot. The defendant moved to have the subpoenas dismissed, and sought solicitor and client costs on the motion. The defendant argued the subpoenas were improper and an abuse of process, and accused the plaintiff's lawyer of making unwarranted attacks against the defendant's lawyer in his pre-hearing brief. The motion was heard over approximately one-half day. Motion granted. The plaintiff will pay total costs of $2,550 (plus disbursements) to the defendant, consisting of $1,500 in party and party costs under Tariff C and $1,050 in solicitor and client costs. The tariff amount of $1,000 is increased by $500 to reflect the fact the issuance of the subpoenas was an improper step, albeit one falling short of an abuse of process. It required the defendant to bring this motion to strike. The plaintiff was given a chance to withdraw the subpoenas and chose not to. Solicitor and client costs were warranted especially in light of the defendant's lawyer's language, which was unduly harsh and unnecessarily strong. His allegations added a layer of complexity and seriousness to the case, which caused the defendant to spend extra time preparing a response. Lawyers are officers of the court and the court must encourage them to use courtesy, respect and professionalism.","The defendant filed a motion to dismiss discovery subpoenas issued to the defendant's witnesses. The motion was allowed and the order granted included a direction as to the manner of discovery. The defendant argued that the issuance of the discovery subpoena was an abuse of process and that the circumstances justified an increase in the tariff for party/party costs. The plaintiff sought an award of costs on a solicitor/client basis against the defendant. The Defendant sought an increase of costs for party and solicitor costs. HELD: The defendant was awarded costs on the solicitor/party basis. The circumstances and factual findings justified an increased tariff for the defendant, D.R. Breton Limited. The Plaintiff sought costs on solicitor/custodial costs in limited amount. The parties positions on discovery, when they would be held and in particular the order in which the parties would be discovered became entrenched. The Court reviewed the various factors in determining costs and concluded that the defendant took no position on exclusion of witnesses. It was not necessary to add costs to the calculation of costs."
c_2012skqb426.txt,"The Crown applied under Part XXIV of the Criminal Code to have the accused declared a dangerous offender after he pled guilty to committing an aggravated assault on his common-law spouse contrary to s. 268 of the Code. The application is based on the Code provisions in effect before the danger offender legislation set forth in The Tackling Violent Crime Act was passed. The accused is 52 years old and in poor health. He has a significant criminal record thatreveals a history of violence and an inability to abide by court orders. The offences occurred between the time he was 40 and ended in 2006 with his last conviction, the predicate offence. Two psychologists prepared psychological assessments both of which concluded that the offender should not be declared a dangerous offender because his risk to re-offend could be reasonably managed by supervision in the community. The issues before the Court were: 1) whether the predicate offence is a serious personal injury offence as defined by s. 752 of the Code; 2) whether the offender is a threat of the kind contemplated by s. 753 of the Code and thus a danger to society; 3) if so, whether the Court should exercise its residual discretion an impose a fixed-term sentence or resort to long-term offender provisions, even though the statutory criteria for declaring the accused a dangerous offender have been met; and if a long-term offender designation is warranted, what determinate sentence and long-term supervision order should be imposed? HELD: 1) The Court held that the aggravated assault committed by the offender was a serious personal injury offence because it was an indictable offence involving the use of violence against his spouse. 2) The Court found that the Crown had proven the criteria required that the offender clearly fits within the definition set forth in ss. 753(1)(a)(i) and (ii), in that this offender had shown a repetitive and persistent pattern of aggressive behavior, especially against women. 3) The Court decided to exercise its residual discretion not to designate the offender as a dangerous offender and found that the he met the long-term offender criteria and that his risk to re-offend could be managed within the meaning of s. 753.1(1)(c). The offender has never been imprisoned in a penitentiary and thus had never had the benefit of programming offered in that system. The appropriate sentence should be 7 years. As the offender has spent approximately 3 years and 4 months in pre-sentence custody, the Court gave him credit in that amount on a one-to-one basis. The Court ordered that the appropriate length of time for a long term supervision order is the maximum of 10 years since the offender needs to learn alternative ways to express his frustration and address his issues with alcohol.","The offender pled guilty to committing an aggravated assault on his common-law partner contrary to s.268 of the Criminal Code. The Crown applied under Part XXIV of the Code to have him declared a dangerous offender. The offender is 52 years old and has a significant criminal record. The Court entered the conviction of the offender and prior to him being sentenced, he was charged with common assault on a woman contrary to ss. 266 of the code. The court reviewed the offender's record and found that he was a high risk to re-offend violently in the future. The only thing that could possibly exacerbate the offender’s risk is a change in his employment history. The evidence suggested that the offender was a low risk to return violently and that he would be better able to learn alternative ways of venting his anger. The facts did not support this conclusion. The accused was convicted of common assault and sentenced to 60 days in jail. The judge reviewed the Crown’ s. 754(1)(a) and s. 810(1) of the criminal code."
c_2014skqb144.txt,The Court dismissed the application. It found that the accused was not capable of representing himself but that the accused had not shown that he was indigent.,"The accused applied for court appointed counsel in an application for a stay of proceedings under s. 24(1) of the Charter in the event the prosecution insists on proceeding with trial in breach of the accused's Charter right to fair trial. The accused had made no effort to obtain funds from the provincial Legal Aid system. He sought court appointed representation in cases where the accused wishes counsel but is unable to pay legal fees, or where the cost of retaining legal counsel in the matter is prohibitive. The Court noted that the accused had a significant amount of equity in the home and that he had made little effort to secure financing. The court noted that this was a significant difference in the accused’s financial situation and that the Court was not persuaded that he was indigent. The application for court- appointed counsel was dismissed. The applicant had not demonstrated that he is indigent as he had not made any effort to raise funds. The evidence presented by the accused showed that he has significant amounts of equity and that his financial situation is significantly in excess of the baseline criterion for Legal Aid in Saskatchewan. The trial was to be held in the Provincial Court in Saskatoon and the Court ordered that the applicant be personally present at the preliminary inquiry. The respondent’ s financial statements do not demonstrate extraordinary financial circumstances, nor has he demonstrated a reasonable possession of substance for the purposes of trafficking. The parties were to meet the same set of criteria. The only difference is that the respondent has a significant equity in his home and his demonstrated expenses consume the $2,500. The defendant’’ financial circumstances are significantly in the excess of baseline criterion and the court was not convinced that he demonstrated the requisite circumstance of being indigent in the circumstances. The lawyer’d be in a position to make arrangements with counsel to represent him at the trial."
c_2014skqb284.txt,HELD: The court dismissed both applications. The respondent’s voluntary decision to significantly reduce his income was insufficient grounds to vary his child support application. The court found that there had not been a material change in the circumstances with regard to the petitioner’s application.,"The respondent father applied to reduce his child support obligation and to extinguish arrears of child support as a result of him quitting his job and embarking on an apprenticeship program to become an electrician. The petitioner mother applied to become the sole custodian parent of the parties' two daughters. Both parties sought to vary the existing court order regarding support and parenting. HELD: The application to vary child support was granted. The respondent father was found to be earning $75,000 per year. He was in excess of $10,000 in arrear support obligation. The mother sought sole custody of the two children because she is the only one providing for the children and is the sole one parenting the children. The father provided no response to the petitioner's allegations and declined to give any further information at the chambers hearing. The court found that the respondent had essentially been an absentee father. The application was dismissed. The Court found that there had been a material change in circumstances as required to vary an order and that the application to change the order was brought more out of frustration for the respondent's lack of involvement than as result of any material change that has taken place."
c_2016skqb293.txt,"HELD: The appeal was granted on the basis of the first two grounds as well as others. The court quashed the tribunal’s decision and reinstated the appellant’s hospital privileges. The court reviewed the transcript of the tribunal’s hearing and its written decision. With regard to the first two issues, it found that the tribunal had erred in law in the following ways: 1) by failing to conduct a de novo hearing as required. It did not refer to the expert opinion submitted by the appellant as new evidence at the hearing; and 2) by failing to explain its decision. It did not refer to the new evidence nor did it state how it had reconciled the conflicting expert opinion evidence offered by the appellant and the respondent. It merely accepted the evidence of the SMO’s experts.","HELD: The Court found that the Tribunal made errors in its decision regarding the suspension of the appellant's hospital privileges. The Court held that the Court had reviewed the Tribunal's decision and found that it had err in some respects, and that the errors led to the granting of remedy to the appellant. The Appeal Division ordered the suspension to be lifted. The court ordered the reinstatement of the privileges to the respondent's senior medical officer. The order of the Tribunal was made in accordance with s. 58(5) and s. 59(6) of the Act. The appellant was suspended for two years. He had been advised of the immediate suspension and the notice of Board meeting as required by s. 76(3) of The Public Inquiries Act. He received copies of documents which the SMO had relied upon in coming to the decision to levy an interim suspension. The SMO sought and obtained no information from the appellant regarding the appellant prior to the appointment of the second opinion. The respondent did not have access to the evidence. The evidence was not known to the Court. The Tribunal did not take its own view of the evidence put before it and was not bound by the view of its view of it. The appeal was divided into subsections. The s. 45 appeal to the Tribunal is a de novo hearing. The decision of the tribunal is a new hearing. It is not that the appellant is THE CHAIRPERSON. The holding of critical incident review does not connote any wrongful act or omission on the part of any members of the patient care team. It must be done consistent with ministerial guidelines. The hearing should proceed in the same fashion as it proceeded before the Board. The Act requires the Tribunal to have the same powers as a commission under the Public Inquiry Act. HELD: Appeal dismissed. The judgment is divided into the subsections.  1) The Court reviewed the decision of The Tribunal to determine if it made any of the numerous errors alleged by the appellant such that its decision is rendered unreasonable or, in one case, incorrect. The Hearing should proceed to the same manner as it was held in the previous proceeding. The Judge reviewed the findings of the critical incident report and the respondent did the same. The judge reviewed the evidence and found the respondent was doing the same thing. The issues were resolved in the manner the Tribunal had intended. The trial de novos are a new and different hearing."
c_2017skqb144.txt,"HELD: The application was granted. The court ordered that the property be sold and the proceeds of sale take into account the amount necessary to protect the respondent father’s claim. The Partition Act, 1868 applies in the province. It did not allow the equitable principles of unjust enrichment and constructive trust to operate to create a proprietary interest. The court found that s. 4 of the Act applied, which provides a monetary remedy so that if the respondent father could establish entitlement to some amount for his maintenance and improvement costs, he would be protected for that amount for his costs.","The sisters apply to have the partition and sale of a lake front recreational property partitioned and sold. Each party owns an undivided one quarter interest as tenants in common in the property. Each of the parties owns an interest as tenant in common with the other. The parties are separated and the respondent is the sole owner of the property and the only one with a common interest. The respondent is of the opinion that the improvements made by the respondent have added to the value of the Property. The respondents argue that this is a situation where it was not his intention that the parties sell the property to realize on its capital value. HELD: The application will be allowed. 1) The Court has a discretion to refuse partition under s. 1. The Court must have regard to two factors: reasonable expectations of the party, and public policy considerations. The first is that the Court must establish that juristic reason exists to deny the claim. 2) The court must be able to look to all of the circumstances of the transaction in order to determine whether there is another reason to deny recovery. The court has discretion to deny partition under the s.1(d) of the Act. The second is that when reasonable expectations and public policies are considered, the Court will establish that a juristic motive exists to deprive the parties of the benefit conferred by the benefit. This opens the door to consider the manner in which the parties organized their relationship and whether an injustice has arisen that without equity cannot be remedied. 3) The law of unjust enrichment and resulting and constructive trusts is a proper analysis in light of the developments in the law of the unjust enrichment. The application is limited whereas under s4 the broader discretion exists. The judge in Reitsma v. Becker, [1980] SCR 834 (SCC 83) indicated that the court may make all just allowances and should give such directions as will do complete equity between the parties. The third element is that there is no reason in law or justice for the defendant's retention of the benefits conferred by his benefit. The equities that might result in an unequal division of the sale proceeds are taken into account after the sale and are not used to determine the ownership interest of title holder opposing partition and s.3. The law is clear that the law is a common law and the principles of resulting and productive trusts are germane to the issues raised. The principles of such a common sense analysis are clear and the Court has the discretion to make all the necessary allowances."

The Crown and counsel for the accused agreed that a fine and probation would be appropriate. The trial judge sentenced him to 1 year in prison and 1 year's probation. He appealed his sentence. HELD: Appeal allowed. 1)The force applied was minimal and the child was not injured physically. 2)The sentence imposed would result in the accused losing his employment which would harm his dependents. 3)The Court reduced his sentence to 60 days intermittent.,"The appellant pleaded guilty to the charge of assault contrary to s. 266 of the Criminal Code. He was sentenced to one year imprisonment and one year's probation. The evidence indicated that the assault consisted of cuffing the eight year old stepdaughter rather frequently as a disciplinary measure. There was also an incident where a small paddle was employed and she had been struck with a cookie box. No injury had ever resulted from the assaults. HELD: The appeal was allowed and a sentence of 60 days intermittent be substituted for the sentence of 1 year. The probation order was to remain unchanged except to substitute the word 'approved' for'supervised' in the first condition.  1)One year under these circumstances, even with the record of the appellant, is excessive. In addition, it will mean the appellant would lose his current employment upon which the family is reliant. 2)The trial judge must have been influenced to substantial degree by the lack of parenting skills displayed by the appellant in the way he mistreated and verbally abused the young girl in the manner he mistreat and verbally assaulted her in. As offensive as that conduct may be, a lack of parental skill does not constitute a criminal offence and the only thing that the appellant pleaded to was an assault which was not severe and produced no injury."

The son granted an option to purchase to the plaintiff which was exercised and a fee simple title was issued in 1973 subject to encumbrances including caveats protecting the surface leases. There was no reference to the rent charge reserved or excluded by the option agreement. The plaintiff asserted that whatever rights arose from the option agreement were merged in the transfer and effectively disappeared upon the registration of the transfer and the issuance of a new unencumbered title. HELD: Declaration denied. Plaintiff's action dismissed with costs. 1)The absence of a caveat protecting the rent charge has had no affect because of the plaintiff's continued ownership of the property.  2)Rarely, if ever, has there been a case where, as here, a purchaser has contracted to obtain the property under an instrument clearly accepting the unregistered equitable interest, then has obtained a fee simple title, then has permitted the unregistered interest to continue unimpeded for 15 years and then, perhaps tiring of the inconvenience of the lease and thinking that the money would be useful, has decided to seek an order of this Court terminating the other interest and directing that it be paid to him. His counsel made no suggestion that the plaintiff had a moral claim, it was purely an attempt to secure by legal means that which he had previously agreed to forego. This is a court of equity as well as a court of law and as such it is repugnant that the court be called upon to vest in an applicant an interest which he has heretofore freely recognized to be the property of another, both before and after receiving his transfer under The Land Titles Act. 3)It was apparent that there was no intention that the rent charge would be merged since it was recognized and allowed to continue for 15 years.",The plaintiff purchased a land parcel from his son in 1968 and retained the right to continue receiving rentals arising from four surface leases. The option was exercised in 1973 and a fee simple title was issued in 1973.

The plaintiff asserts that whatever rights arose from the option agreements were merged in the transfer andeffectively disappeared upon the registration of the transfer. HELD: The action is dismissed with cost. 1)It is apparent in this case that there was an intention that the rental charge would be merged since it was recognized and allowed to continue in the hands of its holders for a period of about 15 years. 2)There was no intention that any of the above would be waived. 3)The plaintiff's action is not the first time he has been denied an opportunity to sue.

The defence had not proven that the plaintiff should have her prima facie entitlement to a jury trial. HELD: The application was dismissed. 1)The defendant had not met the onus of establishing the plaintiff's prima prima fie entitlement. The trial judge would likely allow those issues which ought to be tried by jury to be decided by the trial judge and withdraw those that should not be so decided. 2)The Court had previously held that a jury notice is a substantive right of a person to be given to a trial by jury. The defendant had failed to give any or sufficient weight to this vital factor. The Court found that the Court had more than once demonstrated that the prima-facie right to a Jury notice was not in dispute.

d_1996canlii7113.txt,"The question was whether a corporate board could breach its undertaking to remain in a small community when it had taken advantage of the government sponsored community bond program in order to establish its business. The Shareholders' Agreement obliged all shareholders to vote their shares so as to confirm the nominees of certain shareholders, thereby freezing the board composition without regard for its performance. As a result the board was dominated by the original Precision group of shareholders and even though the Government of Saskatchewan and Bondco were entitled to enough votes to exercise control of the company, they could not change the board and did not have the usual ways of enforcing their wishes. Members of Bondco were concerned that jobs were being obtained in Saskatoon at the expense of Rosetown jobs and the economic spin-offs expected from their $800,000 investment were not being realized in Rosetown due to the opening of the Saskatoon facility. An application was brought under s234 of the Business Corporations Act.

Allowing the appeal reducing the damage award to $2,745,600, that the trial judge erred in the test he applied to the award of damages. The proper test is to put the respondent as far as possible in the position he would have been in if he had not invested in the company.

The defendant's bank loans fell into default after SGI disability benefits were terminated. The Bank reported the particulars of the loan defaults to a credit reporting agency (Equifax). The defendant declined to give an assignment of any accident injury settlement he might receive from SGI and requested the bank direct Equifax to eliminate any references to his default or delinquency upon the bank loans. The bank offered to put an explanatory note on their credit report confirming the arrears were the result of the defendant's automobile accident and that he had undertaken to pay the bank from the proceeds of the accident settlement. The bank commenced this action for payment. The Compains sought general, punitive, exemplary and aggravated damages in a counterclaim for breach of the bank's duty of good faith, duty of confidentiality and breach of contract. HELD: The counterclaims were dismissed with taxed costs to the bank for both the claim and counterclaims. The bank's claim was admitted at trial. 1)Compain expressly waived any contractual rights which he had to confidentiality of his credit information by the provisions of paragraph 8 of the Personal Credit Line Agreement. The principles outlined by the English Court of appeal in Tournier enumerated four exceptions to a bank's confidentiality obligation to its customers. 2)The analogy between the insurance cases and a bank and borrowing customer was not complete or appropriate. Assuming, without deciding, that banks do have a duty of good faith and fair dealing towards their customers, the bank did not breach such duties in their dealings in this case. 3)The characterization of the accounts as collection accounts was fair, reasonable and accurate in the circumstances and were not out of the normal course of business.","The plaintiff banked with the defendant Royal Bank of Canada and at the time of the accident the Compain's were indebted to the Royal Bank under Royal Bank Credit Line and Visa credit card account (the ""Bank Loans""). The Royal Bank agreed to defer commencement of any action with respect to the defaulted Bank Loans until such time as the Compaine received an accident injury settlement from SGI. The Royal bank refused to assign the Bank Loans to Equifax. The plaintiff's counter-claim against the Royal bank for general, punitive, exemplary and aggravated damages was dismissed. The court concluded that the Royal and Bank of Canadian lending contracts, fiduciary duty and duty of confidentiality were not breached. The Court concluded that in the Royal's case the Royal had breached its lending contract, its fiduciaries duty and its duty of integrity and that the Bank had complied with its undertaking to pay the Royal. The Bank's counter claim against the defendant was dismissed in total. The defendant's claim against Royal Bank was dismissed as there was no evidence that the bank breached its duty to provide credit information to the plaintiff. The bank's failure to act in good faith and in keeping with its contractual and fiduciarian obligations did not result in the disclosure of the credit information. The credit line agreement was in good standing and the Bank's failure not to provide the information to Equipe constituted a breach of the Royal Court's duty to act fair and just. The breach of RBC's fiduciars duty and fiduary duty was not established by the Royal or Bank of America. The RBC did not act in bad faith or in breach of its fidre duty or duty of good faith. The provisions of paragraph 8 of the Personal Credit Line Agreement authorized the Royal to release to Equitrade the information which it did. The default was reported to Equicine Canada. The borrower appealed. The judge dismissed the plaintiff's claim for general damages. The issue was whether the Royal was liable for a breach or fiduciar duty or a duty of secrecy to the defendant. The only thing that could be considered fair and proper was the Royal B's undertaking to the applicant to pay his loans from the proceeds of the settlement and once the loans were paid out that the Compaint had complied.

The plaintiff's costs were reduced on the basis that she refused a formal offer to settle for slightly less than what she was awarded and refused a second offer which was increased before trial to an amount in excess of what she was awarded. The plaintiff appealed and the defendant cross-appealed. Appeal and cross-appeal dismissed. No strong and cogent reasons were advanced to warrant interference with the trial judge's findings on credibility. There was ample evidence to support the conclusion that the accident only caused a mild aggravation of the pre-existing condition and thus no basis upon which court could interfere with that conclusion or adjust upwards general damage assessment. Trial judge applied no wrong principle in exercising discretion to reduce plaintiff's costs. Award of $25,000 was not so far outside range of damages for like cases as to be considered wholly erroneous estimate of damages.","The respondent admitted liability for driving his truck into the back of the appellant's vehicle. The trial judge described the accident as a very mild rear end collision. The appeal and cross appeal both dismissed without costs as per oral reasons. The appellant was seeking to set aside the trial judge's credibility findings against him, to take a different view of the medical evidence than did the trial Judge and to attribute larger percentage of the respondent's present health problems to the accident in question, with correspondingly higher assessment of damages against the respondent. HELD: The appeal was dismissed without cost as the appellant must demonstrate that the trial's assessment of general damages at $25,000 is so inordinately high that it must be a wholly erroneous estimate of damages. The cross appeal was also dismissed. The Appeal and Cross Appeal both dismissed. 1) While recognizing the particular pain and anxiety which the respondent was found to have caused to the appellant and, at the same time, recognizing that a pre-existing condition was the major cause of the the appellant’s present medical problems, the trial judges assessed the appellant his general damages. This court held that the appellant was entitled to general damages for general pain and suffering. 2) There was ample medical evidence to support the trial court’ s conclusion that the accident did not contribute materially to the respondent’S present medical condition and there was no basis, in law, upon which we can interfere with that conclusion. The Court awarded the appellant general damages of $25.000 for general suffering. 3) The appeal is dismissed. There will be no order for costs. The appeals and cross appeals are both dismissed as per the oral reasons for judgment. The court has repeatedly stated that the credibility of witnesses is matter peculiarly within the province of the trial. It would take strong and cogent reasons for this court to interfere with a trial judge’’ findings as to the credibility. There is no basis in law upon which to interfere. No such reasons are advanced by the appellant in this case."

HELD: A trial of the issue was directed, as it could not be decided on the material filed whether he was intentionally unemployed or underemployed. The father's circumstances had changed since the consent order. The fact he no longer resided with a girlfriend and was making payments on a truck did not justify any reduction.

The father applies to vary a consent order dated April 5, 2001, by reducing his required child support payments from $236.00 per month to $19.00. HELD: The trial of whether the respondent is intentionally underemployed or unemployed is directed. The issue is whether the father is intentionally unemployed within the meaning of s. 19(1)(a) of the Federal Child Support Guidelines. The real issue is if the respondent's circumstances have changed since April 2001. He is now employed as tow truck driver and says that he is earning an annualized income of only $7,510.

Given that he agreed to pay child support based upon an imputed income of 17,386, which is what he had been earning at Lilydale Foods, the material indicates he’d changed since then. He was now employed in tow trucking and says he is only earning an average income of less $7.510. The consent order was granted one month after he had quit his employment at Lilydene Foods. Although he remained unemployed, the respondent agreed to provide child support on an imputation annual income.

Spousal support to continue at the rate set out in the separation agreement for a period of fifteen months from the date of the decision at which time all support shall terminate, unless, prior to the termination date, the wife commences an application which results in her showing cause why spousal support should continue; the husband has complied with his obligations with respect to the provision of an automobile. The wife's financial means and needs required support, the husband had made an agreement to provide such support and the evidence did not support a conclusion that it was agreed to be for only one year. Although the wife did not establish any disadvantage from the marriage, there were disadvantages relating to its breakdown and her lifestyle deteriorated as result of the marriage ending.","The issues were: 1) Spousal support; 2) Ms. Bemister's allegation that Mr. Beminister has failed to comply with the Separation Agreement requiring him to provide her with an automobile. HELD: 1). The court found that the issues were the spousal and maintenance of the parties' property and the parties’ financial situation. The court also found that although the parties had lived separate and apart for more than a year, their financial situation clearly demonstrated their need for spousals. The Court concluded that the entitlement to spousa support at separation was ongoing and that it was agreed to be only for one year. While the parties agreed to a maintenance schedule, the Court found that there were disadvantages related to its breakdown. The respondent’s financial situation did not change the fact that the wife had made an effort to purchase her own home. The parties” financial situation was worsened by the separation and there were some disadvantages related. The wife was entitled to spOUSAL support retroactive to the date the husband ceased paying the $1,000 per month. The spousas should continue for a period of fifteen months. The issues were whether the spouse’d be entitled to the spOUSal support retroactively or for a further 15 months."

After calling the plaintiff several times to determine the market price for flax, the defendant agreed to sell the plaintiff 300 metric tonnes of flax of which 297.957 tonnes remain undelivered. HELD: 1) The defendant did not deliver the balance of the flax before August, 2001 or at anytime and he is in breach of the contract. 2) The verbal contract was in force from the time of the telephone conversation ended in June 2001. As the price rose, the plaintiff would have profited by $36.50 per tonne. That is the loss of profit that the plaintiff's claim is based on multiplied by 297.957 and totals $10,875.43. 3) The part performance involving the sale under the contract of 2.043 tonnes is sufficient to meet the requirements of The Sale of Goods Act.","The plaintiff farmer farmer was in the business of buying and selling grain. The defendant farmer agreed to sell 300 metric tonnes of flax at a net price of $264.65 per tonne. The plaintiff's agent was accompanied by his regional supervisor when the contract was made. The quantity was substantial and it was not surprising that both testified that the defendant stopped calling for prices after the contract ended. HELD: The plaintiff was awarded judgment for the sum of $10,875.43. The verbal contract was in force from the time the telephone conversation ended on June 25, 2001. Had the price dropped, the plaintiff would have profited by $36.50 per tonn which is the loss of profit upon which the plaintiff's claim is based. The administrative fee of $7.00 per tonnes was not allowed. The part performance involving the sale under the contract of 2.043 tonnes is sufficient to meet the requirements of the Act. The contract was not in force at the time of the telephone call. Had it dropped, there would have been a loss of $36 per tonte. As the price rose the plaintiff could have profitted by $32.50 which is a loss on the claim of $8,875 and totals $10.875. The administrator fee was $10 per ton tonne which, while it may be customary, has not been proven or explained to my satisfaction and will not allow it. The Part Performance involving the Sale of Goods Act, R.S.S., 1978, c. S-1, requires some writing to support a contract such as this, however, the part performance of the sale is sufficient.

A verbal contract in force prior to the telephone conversations ended on the June 25th, 2001 date. Had a price dropped the plaintiff will have profated by $35.50. As it rose the defendant would have suffered by $6.50 and the loss on which the claim is made is $10 in the amount of $12,875 to the amount in the sum.

The plaintiff claims the defendants agreed to repay the loan in the amount of $1,500 per month. HELD: The plaintiff's claim is dismissed. The only evidence that might suggest that this transaction was a loan to either of the defendants was that some of the payments made by the defendant to the plaintiff were in the amount of $1,500, the amount that the plaintiff asserts was the monthly amount to be repaid by the defendant for the loan. However, there was no evidence as to when the agreement to pay $1,500 was made. In her testimony, the plaintiff stated that when the decision was made to pay the $69,000 to the business, she did not have a discussion with the defendant, Kelly. The only discussion she seems to have had was with her husband after which she wrote a cheque to the defendant.","The plaintiff loaned $69,000 to the defendant. The defendant denied that the transaction was loaned to the plaintiff. The plaintiff loanered back the money to the defendants. The defendants argued that the advance was an investment by the plaintiff and her husband into the auto broking business. The action was brought under simplified procedure rules. The only evidence that might suggest that this transaction was a loan to either of the defendants was that the plaintiff's husband had said that they should invest the $69k in Kelly's business so that he could buy more vehicles. The evidence from the plaintiff in cross-examination that after discussions with her husband, it was felt that they ought to invest the money in Kelly’s business so he could purchase more vehicles, which she did. The affidavit also stated that she did not have any written contracts or other written evidence of any agreement between the plaintiff, the defendant, and/or the numbered company defendant evidencing the nature of the transaction. The affidavits filed by the defendant’ s representative and the plaintiff’d husband were not filed with the court. The court found that the defendant had not made any representations to the court as to the amount of the loan. The cross- examination showed that the evidence of the defendant was not supported by the evidence. The documents filed by both parties were not prepared by the cross-examining parties. The information was not filed on the basis of the affidavits. The Court found that there was no evidence that the defendants agreed to repay the loan in the amount $1,500 per month, that some payments were made, but in the end, an amount of approximately $61,000 was still outstanding. The plaintiffs’ affidavits were not made on the evidence filed by cross-contacts. The case was not made in the open. The facts were not supported. The agreement between plaintiff and the defendant on the loan was not proven. The Plaintiff’ll have taxable costs. The other evidence that would have been a loan was that there were no written contracts and other written documents of any kind between the defendant and the plaintiffs. The payments were all made in her sole name. The two parties did not discuss the loan on the cross examination. The wife’t testify on the stand that she made no representations to either party. The husband’S testimony was not held on the affidavit. The decision to pay the plaintiff was not moot."

HELD: The evidence from the lawyer who prepared the Testator's last Will was that she was concerned that the testator was being influenced.

Appeal allowed; adoption order set aside; matter remitted to the application court for a further hearing; application to admit fresh evidence granted in part; the portions of the appellant's affidavit addressing her efforts to secure counsel for the adoption hearing admitted into evidence. The appellant had a bona fide intention to appear or to be represented at the hearing and had made reasonable, although unsuccessful, efforts to do so.

The parties agreed to Gabrielson J. receiving the report and neither party sought to cross-examine the writer of the report. HELD: Leave denied. Even if there was a scintilla of merit to the argument, the Court would not grant leave to appeal on the basis that to grant leave to appeal on an extremely technical ground would cause delay that is manifestly not in the best interest of the child in the circumstances of this case.

The parties agree that the calculation of the IRB as provided by s. 117 of the Act is the annualized sum of $28,889.75. The appellant takes issue with SGI's reduction of the amount determined in accordance with s. 117 of the Act by calculating the appellant's net income in accordance with s. 135 to s. 138 of the Act. HELD: SGI has correctly calculated the appellant's IRB when it made the requisite deductions as set out in s. 137 to find the appellant's net income, and then reduced the net income to 90% to determine his IRB. It would be neither a rational nor fair interpretation to reduce a full-time earner's IRB by 90% and not the other types of earners. It would be neither a rational nor fair interpretation to deduct income tax, employment insurance premiums and Canada Pension contributions from only full-time earners. All earners are subject to these payments being deducted from their income but for their inability to earn an income because of an automobile accident. The further deductions to obtain the non- earner's IRB are in keeping with his earning reality.","The respondent was awarded an amount less than that of the respondent. The respondent appealed the decision. Appealing the decision, that SGI had correctly calculated the respondent's IRB when it made the requisite deductions as set out in s 137 and reduced the net income to 90%. The hearing judge also found that SGE had erred in holding that the IRB for non-earners under Part VIII of the Act is not to be less than the amount received pursuant to s 116 of the act. HELD: The respondent's income replacement benefit was reduced by 90% and not the other types of earners. It would be neither a rational nor fair interpretation to deduct income tax, employment insurance premiums and Canada Pension contributions from only full-time earners. The legislation attempts to find the non-income as non-ener defined in the Act. The Court of Appeal upheld the respondent’s appeal. The court found that the respondent was paying an amount below the amount the respondent had been paying. The appellant was awarded $28,889.75. The hearing court found the respondent correctly calculated his IRB. The trial judge also held that SIG was correct in holding the respondent should not deduct income taxes, employment premiums and pension contributions from the only full time earners.

The Act is intended to correlate victim’ s. 117 income with his earning reality. The provisions of s. 135 do not apply to the non non-employer defined in this Act. It is neither a logical nor fair to deduct the income tax and employment insurance premium and Canada pension contributions. The final IRB is equal to 90% of the applicant’S net income. The conclusion that S. G. has correctly calculated Montgrand’’ IRB was that of a 'weighted average' calculation. It was neither a reasonable nor fair interpret to deduct any income tax or employment insurance contributions from any full- time earners and deduct income, employment and pension contribution from only part-time. The standard of proof is that of 'weighting average' and the legislation attempts not to find non-Earner’d earning reality.'

Other key staff members intended to quit and work in the new store. The applicant moved for an interim injunction to prevent the respondent from opening his store pending the hearing of their motion for an interlocutory injunction. Interim injunction granted. The new Civil Procedure Rules (2008) distinguish between interim and interlocutory injunctions. This is one of the circumstances which was contemplated when the new Rule 41.04 was enacted. Urgency exists and the applicant can't wait. While the non-competition clause may well not survive a challenge at the full hearing of the interlocutory injunction motion, all the applicant needs to show is that there is a serious issue to be tried. There is. This isn't a frivolous or vexatious application. There's a high potential for the applicant to suffer irreparable harm (e.g. the loss of customers, market share) especially given that this is a small community. An interim injunction will only result in a delay of a few weeks. The interlocutory injunction is set to heard at the end of April. The stakes are higher for the applicant than they are for the respondent.",The defendant applied for an interim injunction to prevent the opening of a competing drug store. The plaintiff had not had sufficient time to gather all the evidence it wished to present on an interlocutory motion. The applicant had submitted that the opening would be imminent. The defendant motion was granted. The court reviewed the circumstances and found that the application was not frivolous or vexatious. The application was also not frivolous.

The judgment had found the appellants liable for damages after the respondent, who had purchased a house from the appellants, discovered that water was entering his basement. When the respondent investigated the source of the water, he removed the interior wall of the basement and discovered that there was a second wall behind the first one. He also discovered that a large chunk of the concrete footing and concrete grade beam were broken and had slid into the space between the interior basement wall. The respondent obtained a professional opinion that suggested that the problem had been there for a significant period of time and that the wooden beam that sat on the concrete grade beam was rotten and would have to be replaced. The respondent was awarded judgment in the amount of the repair. The appellant appealed on the basis that the trial judge should not have considered the respondent's expert's opinion about the age of the defect, that the trial judge had crossed a line in assisting the self-represented plaintiff at the trial and that the trial judge erred in calculating damages. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. The respondent's expert was qualified as an expert concerning foundation repair and had the necessary experience to give expert evidence on the type of structural repair and the need for structural repair. Once qualified as an expert in the area of foundations and structural repair, he could testify on the nature of the foundation's problems, including the wooden beam. The witness was also the person who actually carried out the repair to the foundation and was entitled to give evidence on what he saw and did. The witness was properly qualified by virtue of his years of experience and the trial judge was entitled to accept his evidence as to the state of the foundation and how long it had been in such a state. The trial judge's intervention and comments to the appellant's lawyer at the trial did not go beyond the nature of a legitimate attempt to ensure that all of the evidence regarding the matters at issue was before the Court with sufficient clarity to allow the trial judge to understand it. The cause of action in this case was negligent misrepresentation. The trial judge found that the appellants were aware of the structural defect and had covered it up. The proper measure of damages is the amount of money required to put the plaintiff in the position he would have occupied if the negligent misrepresentation had not been made. In this case, the judge made no palpable or overriding error in calculating damages at the amount it cost to fix the foundation.","This was an appeal from a Small Claims Court judgment dated August 20, 2012. The trial judge made an error in interpretation of the evidence and calculation of damages. The evidence did not go beyond the nature of a legitimate attempt to ensure that all of the information regarding the matters at issue was before the court and was of sufficient clarity so that the trial judge could understand it. As Hancock was self-represented, more questions of him were required than may have been appropriate or necessary in a traditional civil trial. HELD: This appeal was dismissed with costs of the appeal to the respondent. 1) The trial Judge made no palpable and overriding error regarding the calculation of the damages and the proper test is whether his conduct denied the defendant fair trial or gave rise to reasonable apprehension of bias. 2) The evidence must be given by witness who is shown to have acquired special or peculiar knowledge concerning the impartiality of the tribunal.

d_2017skqb42.txt,"HELD: The action was allowed. The defendants had defamed the plaintiff and he was entitled to damages in the amount of $100,000. The court found the following with respect to each issue: 1) it would substitute Postmedia as a defendant pursuant to Queen’s Bench rule 3-84(2) as it was the successor to Canwest and was aware of the plaintiff’s claim when it purchased the Star Phoenix and it would not be prejudiced. It would not deprive Postmedia of a defence under s. 5 of The Limitations Act because the articles remained on Postmedia’s websites and were republished whenever they were viewed or downloaded; 2) after reviewing each of the articles and assessing the words complained of, it found that the words constituted defamation; 3) all of the defendants were found to be joint tortfeasors with Purdy because they participated in the publication of a libel and were jointly and severally liable in defamation to the plaintiff; and 3) an appropriate award for general damages was $50,000. The court allowed the claim for aggravated damages as the defendants were found to be motivated by actual or express malice because Purdy did not simply report the jury’s verdict in her articles but indicated that she believed that the jury had not reached the proper verdict in the trial. She deliberately chose to report the stories of people who had made complaints about the surgical care provided to them by the plaintiff without verifying it or seeking comment from the plaintiff. As she was acting in the course of her employment, Purdy’s malice was attributed to all the defendants. The plaintiff was awarded $50,000 in aggravated damages.","The plaintiff physician underwent tubal ligation. He was the successor to the doctor and at the time of the surgery, was the owner of the StarPhoenix newspaper. He later sued the hospital and the hospital for defamation. The plaintiff brought an action against the defendants alleging that the defendants, acting alone or in concert, published defamatory comments about him in series of articles in the Star Phoenix and on websites owned and operated by the newspaper and the Hospital. The newspapers published the articles and the plaintiff sued the defendants. The defendants, who were all insured by the defendants and insured by their insurer, Hiscox Insurance, did not make an application to add or substitute the doctor as defendant prior to the trial commencing. The plaintiffs sued the hospitals and the insurer claiming negligence. The doctor's income began to decline and he was forced to take a leave of absence. The newspaper published a series of pieces about the plaintiff and her medical care. The court reviewed the articles in its online publications and found that the doctor had suffered loss and damage to his professional and civic reputation. The articles were misleading. The only thing that could conclude that the doctors were negligent was that the articles were written in a way that would have made it appear as if they were written by the doctor himself. The article also suggested that the plaintiff had been contacted by the hospital, which was not aware of the plaintiff's medical care and thus had no personal financial exposure to the plaintiff. The statements of claim were not amended. The statement of claim was amended to add the doctor's name. The Court reviewed the statements of liability and found no liability. The defendant was aware of this fact and the fact that the statements were published in the newspapers and on the websites owned by the hospitals. The judge found that there was no liability for the plaintiff for the defamatories. The fact that there were no errors in the statements and that the words were found to be defamant did not disqualify the doctor from continuing with the practice. The decision to add a doctor as a defendant was made in consultation with the plaintiff’s counsel. The parties were to submit further written submissions on the doctor’ s request for an injunction requiring the defendants to remove certain articles from websites under their control if these articles were found not to be true.

The respondent counter-petitioned for similar relief, including divorce, joint custody and an equal division of the property. HELD: 1)Sole custody was awarded to the mother with access on the same terms as contained in the interim order. Two reasons for not awarding joint custody were the obvious acrimony between the parties and the respondent's reluctance to support his children. Three weeks after his application for sale of the home was rejected, he applied for a leave of absence from his job. It was inferred that he was trying to avoid complying with the order for interim support. 2)The mother re-entered the workforce after many years' absence. She suffered an economic disadvantage from the marriage and its breakdown. 3)The car owned by the petitioner when she married was exempt property. The motorcycle was disregarded as there had not been a significant increase in value. The list prepared by the respondent was used to divide household goods, tools and equipment. 4)The respondent was to assume one-half of the bank loan and it was agreed that the pension funds should be shared equally. 5)It would be unfair and inequitable to the custodial parent to order an equal division of the matrimonial property. The petitioner was granted possession of the matrimonial home until the younger child's 18th birthday or until she vacated the property. 6)The respondent cannot avoid his responsibility of providing an adequate level of support by turning his back on well-paid employment. Spousal and child support were deducted from his share of the matrimonial home. The petitioner was given leave to return to Court after February 28, 1999 for reconsideration of child support.","The petitioner sought a divorce, custody of the children, joint custody and an equal division of matrimonial property.

Bennett, owner of an office building (the Plaza), leased space to VIP for five years ending in 1997. Issues included (i)whether there had been a valid renewal of the head lease; (ii)whether there had been valid renewals of sub-leases; (iii)assuming valid renewals, did s4 of the Statute of Frauds bar enforcement against Bennett; (iv)whether the Court had jurisdiction to hear an application for relief under s11 brought solely by notice of motion; (v)are the applicants entitled to such relief; (vi)whether Bennett was bound by the sub-leases by virtue of taking the assignment from VIP. HELD: The application was dismissed. 1)It was assumed that the evidence led by the applicants was true in order to determine issues (iii) and (iv) which dispose of the application. Issues (i), (ii) and (vi) could not be dealt with summarily because of the conflicting affidavits. 2)Notwithstanding Queen's Bench Rule 13(1), the term action in s11 includes summary application by way of notice of motion. There is no reason for landlords to have better access to this Court than the tenants concerning possession of demised premises. The words 'or otherwise' include extrajudicial actions by landlords, including re-entry. Had it been concluded that it was necessry to proceed by statement of claim, such error would have been procedural one, curable under Rule without affecting the jurisdiction of the Court. 3)The Court should exercise its discretion within the guidelines outlined in Golden Griddle. grant of relief requested by the applicant would constitute an improper exercise of such discretion. They were not the sole tenant in stand alone building of the kind in Chatham Empire Theatre. The relief sought would unfairly affect the landlord. As the applicants expressed no interest in taking over the whole head lease premises on the terms of the head lease, there was no need for a conditional order of the nature of London Bridge. 4)The only memoranda consisted of the original head lease and subleases and the unsigned fax messages. The fax messages did not meet the essential requirements for a valid lease. The actions and performance by VIP and the applicant fell short of constituting part performance for the purposes of s.4 regardless of a narrow or broad interpretation of the doctrine. In any case the Court would not have exercised its discretion by binding Bennett with leases which comprised less than 15% of the head premises in the absence of evidence that clearly demonstrated the owner's ability to rent out the balance of the head lease premises was not impaired economically or physically. The applciants could obtain other office space including that offered by Bennett. General and punitive damages would provide an adequate remedy.","The applicants sought an order under s.11 of The Landlord and Tenant Act vesting the whole term of their sub-leases with either V.I.P.

The Court assumed for the purposes of these reasons that the actions and performance by the applicant and the applicants fell short of constituting part-performance for the purpose of s. 11 of the Act. 3)The Court was of the view that a decision on issue nos. 3 and 4 can dispose of the application, and perhaps the issues between the parties."

It was held in an earlier fiat in June that the addition of the two proposed plaintiffs asserted new causes of action and amendments to the statement of claim could only be considered pursuant to an application under s.44(11) of the Queen's Bench Act. The defendant resisted the joinder of the new plaintiffs and amendments on the basis of undue delay and actual prejudice. The statement of claim alleged nuisance, and in the alternative, negligence against the City with respect to the design, construction and maintenance of the sewer system causing his basement to flood. The plaintiffs stated they only became aware of the damage to their home and possible health problems over period of time. Leave to appeal the June fiat was denied. The defendant plead limitation period defence to the amendment and argued that if the City had received notice of any ongoing problems it would have investigated and possibly taken steps to minimize any damage; that evidence had been lost; it may be too late to determine the causes. HELD: The amendments were allowed. 1)The limitation period in s.314(1) applies from the time damages were sustained, not from the date of the occurrence which led to the damage. The facts were uncertain. It was uncertain when the limitation period commenced. If the date the applicant should have discovered the additional damage was the date they received the geotechnical and structural engineering report, the amended claim was brought within the 1 year limitation period. 2)Inexcusable delay was not established. 3)It was not accepted that the defendant suffered actual prejudice. If it was prejudiced it was through its own inaction. No evidence had been lost. The basement was available for inspection. It had the benefit of the reports provided by the applicants. 4)The requirements of s.44(11) were met and judicial discretion was exercised to allow the amendments. The fact that the joint owner of the property was not included was due to inadvertence rather than any deliberate choice. It was also appropriate to join the new plaintiff. It appeared that the expanded claim alleged in the requested amendment was not apparent at the time the original claim was issued and arose out of the same occurrence. 4)Costs in the cause.",FIAT. The plaintiff sought amendments to the original statement of claim and the joinder of parties to that claim. The original plaintiffs were the defendants. The amendments did not require leave to amend and the infant could be joined as a plaintiff on the basis she was an infant against whom the limitation period of one year set out in The Urban Municipality Act had intervened. The amended claim was brought within the one year limitation period. The Court noted that uncertainty as to when the limitation time actually commenced running with respect to the amendments was a factor to be taken into account with respect the defence position of inexcusable delay and actual prejudice.
e_1999skqb268.txt,"The defendant manufactured solarium in Saskatoon which it sold to the plaintiffs in Minnesota. The plaintiffs alleged the solarium was defective, sued and obtained judgment in the Minnesota Court which it now sought to enforce in Saskatchewan. The defendant argued the Minnesota court did not have jurisdiction because at the time the action was commenced he was not 'ordinarily resident' in the state of Minnesota. The defendant was served in Saskatoon with notice of the claim but did not appear or defend the action or surrender to its jurisdiction. HELD: The action was dismissed with costs to be taxed. 1)The defences available to defendant in Saskatchewan where an action is brought to enforce foreign judgment are set out in s.6 of the Foreign Judgments Act. 2)While there may be evidence supporting the conclusion that the defendant was carrying on business in Minnesota, that same evidence does not support the conclusion the defendant was ordinarily resident there. The defendant advertised its business in Minnesota and elsewhere in the United States and employed agents there to sell its product. The logical conclusion was that the address in the city of Minneapolis was a business address. It could be argued that the defendant carried on business in the state of Minnesota but the question was whether the defendant was ordinarily resident in that state. The Foreign Judgments Act reflects real difference in the meaning of 'ordinarily resident' and 'carrying on business'.","The plaintiffs sought to enforce payment by the defendant of judgment for $23,396.03 in US currency awarded them by Carver County District Court in the State of Minnesota. The action was defended on the basis that the defendant was not ordinarily resident in the United States and did not appear before the Minnesota court or submit to its jurisdiction. HELD: The action is dismissed with costs to be taxed.  1) Because of the activities of the defendant in Minnesota the logical conclusion, so it seems to me, is that it is a business address.  2) Because the defendant is not ordinarily residents in Minnesota, that is to say its activities in sales, the logical conclusions, so to me is that the logical result, so, is a Business address."

The father applied to vary child support in November on the basis of his reduced income. HELD: The application was dismissed with costs to the petitioner fixed at $1,000. The onus is on the applicant to provide cogent, independent or objective verification of change of circumstances. This application was brought 10 months after the pre-trial conference. It was of no consequence that someone may come into the home rather than using commercial day care service. There was no change in the father's hours of work or the schedule. The only change was that the mother was no longer available to provide care during Saturday of his access weekends. The mother was not to schedule activities during the father's access periods without his consent and he was to provide 7 days written notice if he chooses not to exercise access during specified times. This was not a variation of the custody/access regime but rather specific directions to provide some predictability for the children.","The parties agreed to vary the child support provisions of the consent judgment. The respondent was to pay the petitioner $1,000 per month. The petitioner was to schedule activities for the children during the respondent's access periods. The court found that the respondent had not changed his income since the pre-trial conference.

There were four separate incidents involving the dog in September 2001. At issue was whether the Crown had proven an attack on any of the four occasions. The accused agreed that the presumption of non-provocation set out in s.135.2(1) of the UMA applied and that presumption had not been displaced. HELD: 1)A $200 fine was imposed along with conditions. The dog must be kept within an enclosed continuous fence and chained to a post. There must be a gate preventing exiting except while on a leash and muzzled. The owner must display a sign stating Guard Dog on Duty. 2)If dog is territorial or protective, and the facts show the human has, by intruding, been in law provocative, the offence may not be proven beyond reasonable doubt. On the evidence there was no intrusion sufficient to justify an attack or which could be considered provocation. 3)There were seven specific pieces of evidence which supported the conclusion that the owner did not take reasonable steps to ensure his dog did not attack someone in the fashion prohibited by s.135.3(3). It is irrelevant at law that after dog attacks it responds to its owner's commands. The dog escaped the yard, was off leash and was not sufficiently restrained or enclosed. logging chain affixed to post is substantial way of tethering dog. One would not expect dog to be attached to logging chain if there were no concerns.","The accused was charged with the offence of 'guard dog on duty, bowing to the dog's owner's commands' contrary to s. 135.3(3) of the Urban Municipalities Act. The accused was convicted of the charge of dog attack contrary to the Act. HELD: The court imposed a fine of $200. The court accepted the accused's evidence that the dog ran through the front steps of the complainant's house and then into the alleyway where it upset the complainant. The Court accepted the Crown's evidence as to whether the dog was properly restrained or enclosed and that the chain was attached to a post embedded in the ground to prevent the dog from getting closer.

e_2005skqb51.txt,"The plaintiff seeks damages for unlawful arrest and assault, including aggravated or punitive damages arising out of events which resulted in his arrest and a charge of obstruction. During the course of his arrest, the plaintiff received cut to his scalp. He remained in custody until released at approximately 7:30 a.m. that morning. The three named defendants are members of the Saskatoon Police Service. The City of Saskatoon is their employer. HELD: The action for wrongful arrest is dismissed. The plaintiff was assaulted when his head was driven onto the hood of the vehicle. The plaintiff is awarded $2,500 in general damages and pre-judgment interest on that amount. It is not an appropriate case to award punitive damages, but the Court awarded solicitor client costs to the plaintiff in the amount of $6,000 plus taxable disbursements. 1) The Court accepted the plaintiff's evidence that he did not physically interfere with the police officers outside of the lounge. The police officers that attended at the lounge and became involved in the arrest of Mr. Sampson were in the execution of their duty. The plaintiff does not dispute that he possessed the general intent to make the comments that he did throughout the proceedings and that he did so wilfully. The issue is whether or not his actions obstructed the police officers, who were in the execution of their duty. 2) The combined actions of the plaintiff and Ms. Krupa clearly interfered with the police officers' arrest of Mr. Sampson, to the point that Constable Pura called for back-up help. Once the back-up officers arrived, one of them was required to expend time and effort restricting the movements of the plaintiff and Ms. Krupa. Once on the street, they again confronted the police officers. Their combined actions clearly affected the work of the police officers in the execution of their duty. There were reasonable and probable grounds to believe the plaintiff was obstructing the police officers in the course of their duty. 3) On the facts in this matter, the same conclusion is arrived at based solely on the plaintiff's individual actions. The plaintiff's officious interference consisted of verbal abuse, excessive criticism and undue pertinacity in his discussion and questioning and provided reasonable and probable grounds to believe he was obstructing police officers in the execution of their duty. The action for wrongful arrest is dismissed. 4) The cut to the plaintiff's head is a minor one, not requiring stitches or immediate medical attention. The plaintiff experienced headaches for several weeks. He also had stiff neck and sleep disturbance. There were no long term effects. Corrigendum received January 25, 2005 and added to fulltext.","The plaintiff sought damages for unlawful arrest and assault, including aggravated or punitive damages, arising out of events which resulted in his arrest and a charge of obstruction. During the course of his arrest, the plaintiff received a cut to his scalp just inside the hairline above his left eye. The actions of the defendants were in dispute. The plaintiff was arrested for obstruction. The action was stopped when the police officers arrested the plaintiff outside of the lounge. The events surrounding the arrest involved the police arresting and removing a patron of a local lounge for being intoxicated in public place. The event leading up to the arrest and the activity of all participants while in the lounge are not largely in dispute and vary in minor detail only. The defendant's actions were in violation of s. 495(2) of the Criminal Code. The evidence of the plaintiff's assault is at odds with what the other witnesses say and because her evidence does not distinguish between Ms. Krupa and Mr. Rodgers. The officer who arrested the defendant was the one who first handcuffed the plaintiff and then handcuffed him. The Court found that the defendant's action amounted to obstruction."
e_2005skqb549.txt,"There is no dispute between the parties as to the nature of the plaintiff's investment in the defendant corporation. The real issue between the parties is whether the plaintiff is entitled to the summary relief, which she now seeks pursuant to Rules 129 and 133 of The Queen's Bench Rules. It is the position of the plaintiff that the cross- examination of the defendant on his affidavit discloses that the corporation is profitable company and that s. 34(2) of The Business Corporation Act does not provide any defence to the defendants against the requested relief sought. The parties are in disagreement over the issue of the amount of dividend payments that have been made by the corporation to the plaintiff pursuant to her investment in the corporation. HELD: 1) The plaintiff's application for summary judgment does not require the corporation to redeem any redeemable shares. Rather, the plaintiff's application is one seeking summary judgment. The corporate defendant is not making payment to redeem shares, but rather following judgment however and whenever obtained, it would be subject to the normal judgment process, including execution. Such execution or enforcement of judgment is not tantamount to redemption of shares. The plaintiff provided notice in writing to the corporation that she wished to redeem all her Class E preferred shares effective March 2005. The principal amount of her shares is $214,600. It is this amount that she seeks as the substance of her summary judgment. Section 34(2) of the Act does not serve to prevent the plaintiff seeking summary judgment from the court. The effect of granting judgment, if it is otherwise appropriate to do so, does not place the corporation in a position of breaching the prohibitions contained in s. 34(2) of the Act. 2) The defendants have not demonstrated that there is real insolvency on the part of the corporation. The defendants have failed to provide responses to the undertakings. Further, the defendants have not provided any professional analysis or evidence in support of their position that s. 34(2) is applicable. 3) The amount sought to be recovered by the plaintiff does represent debt or liquidated demand as contemplated by Rule 129. The plaintiff is entitled to summary judgment against the defendant corporation for the sum of $214,600 pursuant to Rule 129. Further the plaintiff is entitled to interest at the rate of 16% from March 2005 in accordance with the Share Agreement. 4) The plaintiff has not demonstrated an appropriate basis for summary judgment against the individual defendants. 5) The plaintiff is entitled to costs.","The plaintiff commenced an action against the defendants seeking various items of specific relief and costs on solicitor-client basis. Thereafter, the plaintiff brought notice of motion seeking an order that the defendants provide an accounting in relation to specified items. The defendants deny that they have any obligation to redeem the plaintiff's preferred shares, as asked for by the plaintiff in paragraph 38 of the Statement of Claim, or that they are not making payment to the plaintiff. The plaintiff also sought an order pursuant to Queen's Bench Rule 217, 173(e) and the inherent jurisdiction of the Court striking the statement of defence of all the defendants. The amended notice of request seeks an order for leave to amend the statement and the provisions of the Business Corporations Act. HELD: 1) The plaintiff's motion does not require the defendants to'make any payment to purchase' or to'redeem any redeemable shares'. The effect of granting a judgment, if it is otherwise appropriate to do so does not place the corporation in a position of breaching the prohibitions contained in s34(2).  2) The amount sought to be recovered by the defendant in the amount of $214,600 does not serve to prevent the plaintiff seeking summary judgment from the Court. The effect is that granting a summary judgment does not put the corporation a position in breach of s34."

The plaintiff claims she told the Town Office to shut off her water supply and the failure to do so let to the damages being sustained. HELD: The claim is dismissed. 1) There is no evidence that the plaintiff gave clear instructions to the town to shut off her water. 2) The proximate cause of the damage was turning off the heat and power without ensuring that water line, toilets, and the water tank had been properly drained. 3) The plaintiff sustained no damages herself. She admits she negotiated the sale price of $50,000 with her daughter prior to any damage being sustained to the property. No adjustment had to be made to her daughter thereafter for any 'loss' occasioned. Any claim would have to be made by her daughter not her.","The plaintiff brought an action for water damage sustained to her former residence when frozen pipes burst. She alleged that she instructed the Town Office to shut off her water supply and the failure to do so led to the damages being sustained. The plaintiff also brought action for unpaid electricity bill. The defendant argued that the plaintiff instructed the town office to shut down her water service and the failed to do that led to damages being incurred. The Court held that the action could not succeed because clear instructions were given to the plaintiff to disconnect the water service. The evidence showed a misunderstanding at best between what the plaintiff believed she was requesting and what in fact she did instruct. This however cannot be construed as negligence in the circumstances by the town nor does the fact that specific forms are now utilized for disconnect purposes, elevate the matter on the facts before the Court, to negligence by the defendant."

The Chronic Pain Regulations did not come into force until 2004. Section 2 has no application to payment of the chronic pain benefit for injuries during the window period.

e_2009nssm47.txt,"The claimants live on property abutting the defendant Burrow's property. The defendant Renouf is Burrows' friend. As favour, Renouf attended the property while Burrows was away and cut down some trees that he was asked to cut. He went on to cut down several others that he felt were diseased/damaged. eventually realizing he had crossed the property line and cut down more than 17 of the claimants' trees. The claimants sued for the cost of replacing the trees with a comparable number of mature trees, the cost of removing the felled trees and to recoup for anticipated damage to their septic field. At issue was: 1. whether Renouf trespassed; 2. whether Burrows was liable for Renouf's actions (for 'hiring' Renouf or because they were engaged in a joint enterprise); and 3. damages. The claimants did not want Burrows helping with the tree removal, even if doing so would save money. 1. Renouf trespassed on the claimants' land and is liable for damages. That it was an honest mistake is irrelevant since trespass does not require bad faith or improper purpose. 2. Burrows is not liable. He was not Renouf's employer, nor were Renouf's actions foreseeable. It was a favour and Renouf went way beyond the scope of what he was asked to do. Burrows is not responsible for everything that flowed from their limited enterprise. The case law requires a degree of blameworthiness (a neglectful or unlawful enterprise) which creates a foreseeable risk of harm. 3. Renouf to pay the claimants: $3,750 to replace the trees with young, native trees (half the amount sought by the claimants), $2,000 for tree removal (half the quote submitted by the claimants since they refused to mitigate the damage by allowing Burrows to help). While Burrows had counterclaimed for damages arising from a confrontation between the claimants and his son, he did not seriously pursue it and it was dismissed. Costs of $1,234 awarded to the claimants (including $960.77 for disbursements). While the amount seems high, the case was large one and the counterclaim, although not seriously pursued, hung over the claimants' heads as they prepared for trial.","The Claimants were married and lived on a lovely property. The Defendant hired a friend to cut down trees for them. The friend cut the trees for the Claimants. The Claimants sued the Defendant for damages. The defendant hired the friend to remove the trees. The parties argued that the friend was a 'guitarist' and that the Court should consider the evidence to establish that the parties were involved in a joint enterprise. The Court rejected the claim and awarded the damages to the Defendant. The court found that there was a degree of blameworthiness which caused liability to attach. The plaintiff was not prepared to accept the defendant's involvement in the tree cutting. The evidence showed that the defendant had no reasonable foreseeability that the tree removal would damage the Claimant's septic field. The fact that the plaintiff had not been paying the defendant for the work did not disqualify the defendant from liability. The only reason the defendant was not willing to accept assistance from the plaintiff was because he was afraid of the consequences of his actions. The defendants were also liable for the damage to the septic tank. The claim was dismissed. The Judge dismissed the counterclaim and awarded damages against the Defendant and the Defendant in the amounts of $3,750 for tree replacement and $2,000 for tree removal for a total of $5,750. The judge did not consider the counter claim to have been established and it was dismissed as there was no evidence that the Defendant was aware of the damage caused by the tree cut. The issue was whether the Defendant, who was hired by the Defendant to remove trees, was vicariously or vicarly responsible for the actions of the Defendant who went on a 'frolic of his own' to the Claimante. The Plaintiff was not aware of any of the activities of the defendant and was not able to assess the risk that the trees would damage his septic system. The liability was assessed at $5.5 million. The costs were allowed in the amount of $1,234.90 in addition to the damages of $6,750 as against the defendant. The amount of service of the claim on the Defendant's property was $1.5m. The cross section of the property was assessed as $5m and the Court awarded the plaintiff $1m. This figure is not considered to have had a causal connection to the defendant as the defendant is not a friend of the plaintiff."
e_2009skpc9.txt,"The plaintiff claims against the defendant for water damage sustained to their belongings while in transit from Edmonton to Nipawin in a one ton, 17 foot cube van owned by the defendants. The issues are whether the plaintiffs are precluded from recovery against the defendant by virtue of the contractual term acknowledging the equipment to be water resistant only as well as the posted disclaimers to this effect. HELD: The plaintiff shall have judgment for $250 plus costs of issuing the claim and service. 1) Notwithstanding that the plaintiff signed the rental contract acknowledging that the equipment was not waterproof and only water resistant, it appears from the last three sentences of the inspection report that water was entering at the corners of the door by virtue of the door not sitting flat at the corners. This defect would have permitted excess water to enter prior to being cleaned. Perfection could not be expected since it was acknowledged that the rental unit was not waterproof and some seepage may be expected even after the door had been fixed. Nonetheless, the sealing problem would have taken it beyond the acknowledgment of the unit being only water resistant. 2) The plaintiff acknowledges that the truck remained parked outside in heavy rainfall for two days and nights prior to being unloaded. This exacerbated the scope of the damage claimed since the water would have continued to seep in unabated for roughly six times as long as the trip itself took. The Court concludes that the defendant is only 20% responsible for the damages sustained to the plaintiff's possessions.","The Plaintiffs claim $6,700.77 against the Defendant for water damage sustained while in transit from Edmonton to Nipawin, Saskatchewan in a one ton, 17 foot cube van owned by the Defendant.

The plaintiff was awarded $250,000 for water damages sustained while the goods were transported in heavy rain conditions. The plaintiffs were the authors of their own misfortune by permitting the loaded truck to sit for an additional two days after reaching their destination in steady rain prior to its unloading. The Plaintiff was awarded a quantum amount of damages. The only issue left for the Court was whether the Plaintiffs are precluded by virtue the contractual terms acknowledging the Equipment was water-resistant only as and as the posted disclaimer to this affect.

The accused denied the allegations, suggesting that, since the niece had not disclosed any of these matters until she was 17 years old, she had made up generalized allegation against him to stop her boyfriend from breaking up with her and then found it necessary to maintain the lie, tell her friends, her mother and the police and get more specific when pressed for details. He also argued that she was not credible because her testimony in court was inconsistent with that in the preliminary inquiry and although there were numerous persons she could have confided in at the time, she never told anybody about the alleged incidents but kept going back to visit her father. Accused found guilty of all counts. Although she was at times frustrated and unable to recall precisely, the niece's demeanour was consistent with a young person doing her best to be truthful and accurate in intimidating and embarrassing circumstances. Her evidence was both consistent with that of other witnesses and internally consistent and the inconsistencies with her previous statements were minor. The court found she had no motive to lie initially or during her trial testimony and the reality was that by making these allegations, she knew her father would be forced to move and would become estranged from his sister, her family would be fractured and the 'sister'-like relationship she had with the accused's daughter would end.","The accused was charged with four counts of sexual assault. The accused was found guilty of four counts relating to the alleged incidents. The first count was that the accused touched the victim with his penis. The second count was related to the fact that the complainant had not disclosed that the alleged acts had occurred to her. The Court considered the evidence of the witnesses. The Crown argued that the evidence was not credible since the accused had not proven beyond a reasonable doubt that he committed the offences. The court also considered the factors that would have been helpful in determining the credibility of the accused. The evidence suggested that the Crown had not proved beyond a doubt that the defendant was guilty of the first count. The essential elements of sexual assaults were comprehensively addressed by the Supreme Court of Canada in v. Ewanchuk 1999 CanLII 711. In this case, the Crown was able to establish that the first allegation was that he touched the complainant with his tongue and hands. The third count was the same as the first two counts. The test for credibility was to determine whether the accused was guilty. The trial judge also noted that the Court was unable to determine the exact dates of the alleged offences."
e_2012skpc80.txt,The accused was charged with two counts being driving while impaired contrary to s. 253(1)(a) and refusal to provide a breath sample contrary to s. 254(5) of the Criminal Code. The Court had earlier acquitted the accused on the charge of driving while disqualified as there was no evidence regarding the status of the accused's driver's licence. At issue was whether the GiO cycle or moped which the accused was operating was a motor vehicle as defined by the Criminal Code. The accused asserted that his GiO bike was operated that night by pedaling it as the electric motor was not working and asserted that driver's licence was not required to operate the GiO bike nor was he required to put licence plate on it. HELD: The accused was found not guilty of the charges before the Court. There was no evidence that the electric motor on the GiO bike was operational that evening and the officer testified that he observed the accused dragging his feet while driving the moped.,"The accused was charged with impaired driving and failure to provide samples of his breath for analysis contrary to s. 253(1)(a) of the Criminal Code. The issue before the court was whether the GiO cycle which the accused was operating was a motor vehicle as defined by the Criminal code. HELD: The accused was found not guilty of the charges. The court found that the accused had failed to prove that the Gio bike was a registered motor vehicle. The Crown had failed in its charge of operating a motor car on the evening of February 26, 2010. The accused should be acquitted of the charge of impaired driving. The offence was not registered. The officer who conducted the breath sample was acquitted of all charges."
e_2013skqb390.txt,"HELD: The Court sentenced the accused pursuant to s. 742.1 of the Criminal Code in force at the time of the offence that precluded the use of conditional sentence order for a serious personal injury offence, which included sexual assault. The Court found that the offences fell on the low end of the sexual assault spectrum as there was no skin to skin contact, the contact was brief and without violence or threats. The aggravating factors were that the accused had two previous convictions for sexual offences and that one of the victims had some cognitive disability. The accused was sentenced to a term of one year imprisonment for each count, followed by a term of probation of two years. The sentences were to be served concurrently.","The accused was found guilty of two counts of sexual assault contrary to s. 271 of the Criminal Code. The accused had been on social assistance since 1992. He had been diagnosed with a back problem and had been placed on a back-up drug program. The complainant had been sexually assaulted by the accused. The Court of Appeal reviewed the factors that led to the sentence and found that the appropriate range for offences of this nature was a conditional sentence of 10 years, when that offence was prosecuted by indictment. The court also reviewed the circumstances of the accused's previous convictions and found he was at a low risk to re-offend. The sentencing guidelines for sexual assaults at the lower end of the scale were that of fleeting touching, which is a form of sexual interference, and the accused was in a position of trust. The respondent used physical force which distinguishes this case from the cases of fleeting touch. HELD: The accused was convicted of sexual assaulting. The sentence imposed was a sentence of 30 months imprisonment. 1)The Court of appeal reviewed the relevant sentencing guidelines and found the sentence imposed in this case was demonstrably unfit. The appropriate range of sentence for offences that involve fleeting touching is a conditional one year imprisonment. 2)The court reviewed the sentencing guidelines in R. v. Revet, 2010 SKQB 71 (CanLII), 350 Sask. R. 292. The judge held that in major sexual assaults involving adult offenders and victims, three years would be a starting point from which a sentencing judge should start, increasing or decreasing the term according the aggravating and mitigating factors. The same starting point should be used in all other major sexual assault cases."
e_2013skqb434.txt,HELD: The Court granted the application. It held that: 1) a solicitor-client relationship was created between the applicants and the defendants based on the evidence; and 2) that the applicants had not rebutted the presumption that they had received confidential information during the meeting that was relevant to the plaintiff’s action against the defendants. That finding was sufficient to disqualify them for acting for the plaintiff.,"HELD: The application was dismissed. The court found that the Phillips law firm was not acting for the plaintiff. The Court found that there was a conflict of interest between the parties. The plaintiffs had agreed to a settlement with the Holgates. The Holgaters had agreed that the terms of the agreement for sale and purchase would be conditional upon the sale of the farm property. The parties disagreed about whether the signed agreements were returned to the law firm. The plaintiff sought an order disqualifying the Holgins. The defendant sought an injunction against the Holgs. The judge found that although the Holgars had a long-standing solicitor-client relationship, the court found the Holgate had not shown it was sufficiently related to the retainer under challenge. The solicitor-to-client relationships were not established. The law firm acted for the plaintiffs. The lawyer was prohibited from acting against the plaintiffs because of a conflict. The decision was based on the fact that the Holges had a previous relationship with the plaintiff and that they were using the same lawyer for the purposes of saving money. The Law Society brought in a revised Code of Professional Conduct effective July 1, 2012. The sole issue presented by this application is whether the Holgas and the lawyers with Phillips Co. should be disqualified from continuing to act for the defendant because of conflict of interests. The first issue is whether a solicitor- to-client relation arises between the law firms and the plaintiffs, and the second issue is the nature of the relationship. The second issue, the nature and extent of the relationships between the Holates and the Holgatates, is whether there is a risk that the confidential information will be used to prejudice the plaintiff's legal position. The last issue is if the Holgartates and their lawyer have a relationship that is sufficiently related the terms and the retraining agreement. The issue is, is there a risk the confidential material will be misused? The Holgate's affidavit describes the type of information in benign way. The respondent contends that the lawyer's lawyer has waived his right of objection either though delay in raising the conflict issue in timely way or by waiver of any confidentiality which would have attached to the discussions at the July 2011 meeting. The question is whether this relationship is sufficiently similar to the one that the plaintiffs imparted confidential information to the lawyers in that law firm and is therefore automatic disqualification. The answer is no. The evidence is controverted. The only thing that is controvertical is the presumption that the solicitor-"
e_2014skqb265.txt,The determination of whether the trial judge’s conclusion regarding the officer’s suspicion was reasonable was question of law subject to the correctness standard. The respondent conceded that the officer had the requisite subjective belief that he had alcohol in his body so the appeal centered on whether the objective test had been met. The appeal court did not find any basis to disturb the trial judge’s finding of fact as to the factors the officer based his suspicion of alcohol consumption on. The court noted the trouble with the fact that the respondent admitted to drinking alcohol that “evening” but the stop was at 5:00 am in the morning. The trial judge disregarded the respondent’s admission to drinking because there was no smell of alcohol and the trial judge said there should be if the consumption was recent. The court concluded that the trial judge erred in dismissing the alcohol consumption admission. A reasonable person would have assumed that the officer’s question was with respect to recent consumption of alcohol not an earlier irrelevant time. It was also found reasonable for the officer to believe the consumption was recent. The court concluded that a reasonable person standing in the officer’s place would reasonably suspect that the respondent had alcohol in his body. An answer by an accused person that they have been drinking was found to be stronger support for a suspicion than the smell of alcohol. Because the respondent’s Charter rights were not breached a new trial was ordered.,"The accused was charged with impaired driving and operating a motor vehicle while the blood alcohol concentration exceeded.08. The trial judge excluded the Certificate of Qualified Technician, pursuant to s. 24(2) of the Charter. The accused challenged the reasonableness of the investigating officer's suspicion upon which the officer based his ASD demand. The Crown appealed the acquittals of both of the charges. The Court held that the trial judge had erred in determining there were not reasonable grounds for the officer's reasonable suspicion, which resulted in a breach of the accused's s. and Charter rights. The court found that the accused relied only on three factors in forming his suspicion. The evidence showed that the officer had reasonable suspicion that the detained driver had alcohol in his body. The fact that the ASD demand was not based on reasonable suspicion and therefore violated the accused s. ss. and rights under the Charter was a finding of fact. The appellant appealed the trial decision. Appeal allowed. The appeal was dismissed. The verdict was found to be a finding in fact."
e_2014skqb344.txt,"The court gave leave to counsel for the plaintiff to file an amended draft order nisi. It made the following recommendations regarding the draft order: 1) the sale should be held under the direction of a solicitor other than the plaintiff’s solicitor; 2) that relying upon a partial appraisal and in the absence of information on the condition of the property, setting the reserve bid at $100,000 might not reflect the best price. Fairness demanded the reserve bid be set at $125,000 but the court set the bid at $115,000. If the property could not be sold at that price, the plaintiff was given leave to apply to the court for a lower reserve bid; and 3) Queen’s Bench rule 10-47(2) required that purchase monies are to be paid into court to the credit of the cause to be applied as directed by the court, including costs. Only after an application and service upon the defendant and after the court had assessed solicitor client costs could monies be disbursed to the plaintiff. Monies owed under the mortgage must be set out by the court on application. All of these matters may be addressed in one final proceeding, in the application to confirm the sale, if the judicial sale proved successful.","FIAT. The plaintiff applied for an order nisi for judicial sale of the property owned by the defendants. The Limitation of Civil Rights Act does not preclude the plaintiff from suing on the covenant because this is not a purchase-money mortgage. However, this is a not purchase- money mortgage. Therefore, a judicial sale is required so that the plaintiff may apply to have the amount of deficiency in the judgment set by the court. Otherwise, as provided by s. of the LCRA, foreclosure of the mortgage operates as full satisfaction of that debt. The applicant applied for judicial sales following the service of statement of claim on the respondents in which it sought foreclosure or alternative relief. In so doing, it asked that its solicitor be appointed as selling officer to conduct the sale and report to the court on application to confirm the sale. The proposed selling officer ought not to be the plaintiff's own counsel. The court set the reserve bid at $115,000. The reserve bid is an exercise of judicial discretion. The only information before the court as to the value of this mortgaged land is a partial appraisal. The Court reviewed the partial appraisal and found that setting the reserve price at $100,000 may not reflect the best possible price. The judge reviewed the full appraisal and concluded that setting a reserve bid of $100k may not be appropriate in the circumstances. The application for judicial sisi for a judicial sales was adjourned until October 15, 2014. The Supreme Court ordered that the reserve bidder be appointed by the plaintiff. The solicitor was to report to court on the application to verify the sale to the Court. The order was not in accordance with Rule 10-47(2) of the Queen's Bench Rules. The realtor is permitted to reduce the list price to the amount the reserve bidder is to the set of the judgment. It would be more fair to set the lower reserve bid. If the mortgaged lands cannot be sold at that amount, the plaintiff has leave to return the matter to court to seek a lower reserve bid, based upon evidence to support its position. The Reserve Bid is an Exercise of Judicial discretion."
e_2016skca29.txt,"HELD: The majority of the court granted leave to appeal and restored the conviction entered by the trial judge. The parties and court agreed that the provisions of s. 34(1) as they read prior to May 2012 were applicable. The issues were determined as follows: 1) the appeal court judge erred by misunderstanding the applicable test and inappropriately focusing on the respondent’s belief. The appeal court judge reviewed cases that led him to focus on the doctrine of mistake of fact, which was not argued by the respondent at trial and were not part of his grounds of appeal; 2) the trial judge accepted some but not all of the expert’s evidence, as he was entitled to do. The trial judge also reinterpreted the video evidence, which was found to be an error by the Court of Appeal. The trial judge considered the factors without weighing the use of force to a nicety. He was determining the objective reasonableness of the force based on the factors; and 3) the appeal court judge properly instructed himself on the standard of review but failed to analyze the decision of the trial judge based on that standard, namely, whether the evidence was reasonably capable of supporting the trial judge’s conclusion based on the evidence as a whole. The dissenting judge would have granted leave to appeal but then would have dismissed the appeal. The dissenting judge of the Court of Appeal found that the appeal court judge erred in his approach but reached the right conclusion that the trial judge erred. The trial judge ignored the fact that the encounter was only three seconds long and he mischaracterized the thrust-kick as extreme force. The respondent had to react quickly. The trial judge also erred in questioning whether the respondent honestly believed he was in danger of harm.","The Crown appealed the decision of the summary conviction appeal court pursuant to s. 839 of the Criminal Code. The Crown argued that the trial judge erred in the approach he took to measure the appellant's use of force, and in disregarding the evidence of the police officer. The appellant argued that s. 25(1) of the Code was inapplicable. HELD: The appeal was allowed and the conviction was reinstated. 1) The Court found that the appellant erred by taking the approach that was taken to measure his use of power, and by disregarding evidence of police officer and the police officers involved. The Court also found that, in assessing whether there is an air of reality to the proportionality requirement, that is whether the appellant was justified in kicking the complainant in the abdomen, causing him to fall backwards and injure his head. The trial judge failed to consider the nature and extent of the assault or threatened assault the accused faced and the nature of the force used. The evidence showed that the respondent's belief in the force being necessary was not reasonable on the basis of the situation he or she was in. The court found that it was possible to conclude that the officer erred because the complainant had not been trained in the proper use of the Force. The appeal court judge instructed himself to disregard the evidence and to take into account certain factors in his analysis of whether the level of force was reasonable. The judge also instructed himself not to use the 'threat assessment' method. The accused was not expected to use that method. 2) The appeal judge failed in his duty to consider whether the respondent had a reasonable belief in his use and that the force he used was not intended to cause death or grievous bodily harm. The officer was not entitled to the same level of protection as the Crown. 3) The court reviewed the jurisprudence regarding s. 27(1), s. 34(1, s. 35(1 and s. 32(1). The Court reviewed the evidence to determine whether the trial court erred. The jury was directed to disregard evidence of a police officer who was not trained in how to use force. The decision was therefore left to the trial judges to decide the case on the merits."
e_2016skpc106.txt,"HELD: The accused was found not guilty. The court found that the accused’s s. 8 Charter rights were breached. Pursuant to a Grant analysis, the court excluded the evidence obtained after the illegal entry of the accused’s home. The court found that the accused had not consented to the entry by the officer and the complainant and it was therefore a warrantless search. The officer did not have the lawful authority to enter the home on the basis of arresting the father as he was not in hot pursuit. The complainant had not obtained a warrant under s. 13.1 of The Child and Family Services Act to enter the accused’s home and therefore had no lawful authority to enter the home. There were no exigent circumstances to justify the search such as preventing the destruction of evidence as they already established that the person they sought was not in the house. The unlawful entry and search of the accused’s home was a severe breach of the accused’s Charter rights. The impact upon her was severe as the complainant gathered evidence and apprehended her children. The accused’s assault on the complainant was minor in nature and although not excusable, her offence was a reaction to a significant breach of her rights. The administration of justice was served by excluding the evidence.","The accused was charged with assault contrary to s. 266 of the Criminal Code. The accused was also charged with breach of probation. The complainant was a child protection worker employed by the Ministry of Social Services. She enlisted the assistance of Moose Jaw Police to enter the accused's apartment suite to investigate whether the accused had children in need of protection. The mother was a Child and Family Services worker. She was specifically asked whether she had a warrant under s. 13.1 of The Child andFamily Services Act allowing her to enter her daughter's apartment. She testified that she had no such warrant, and had never utilized a warrant before. The defence argued that the accused was acting in breach of s. 14 of The Children and Family Act. The evidence showed that the mother had indicated that she wanted the accused charged. The court concluded that the child protection officer did not have any lawful authority to enter Ms. Bigsky's apartment and that the officer was not exercising criminal law power. The Court concluded that this was a situation where the mother was not willing to give consent to the accused entering her daughter’s apartment suite. The officer was in full uniform and was accompanied by Constable Scheske. The child protection work was conducted by the mother. The police officer was assigned to the child and family services. The father was charged in the assault on the complainant. The daughter was arrested and charged with assaulting the complainant and the mother with child endangerment. The son was charged and charged in relation to the assault. The children were apprehended and placed in the care of the Minister of Social and Family Affairs. The Mother was charged for assault and the accused, who was under probation, was charged under s13.1. The Child Protection Worker was specifically directed that she enter the daughter”s apartment and to assist her with the search. The fact that the police officer directed that the daughter not to have contact with the mother did not alter that situation. The only issue here is whether the mother, who had no other authority to be in the home, had the legal authority to allow her to do so. The issue here isn”t which officer did what but whether any officer had the authority to conduct the search and take the steps that they did at the mother’ s apartment. The most fundamental question here is: which officer was entering the daughter and her daughter? The mother” s. 16(1) and s. 17(1(1)(a) of The Act) was specifically instructed that she was entering her children�"
e_2016skpc157.txt,"HELD: The court found with respect to the following issues: 1) it would not permit the defence to argue the s. 8 violation at the conclusion of the trial because it had not mentioned it in its Charter notice. The Crown disclosed the video-taped interaction between the officer and the accused to the defence at the outset and it was clearly pertinent to the issue of reasonable suspicion, but the defence failed to raise it; and 2) there were two periods of delay and the court was satisfied that the 77 minutes between arrival at the station and the taking of the second sample was satisfactorily explained. However, the court found that first period of 35 minutes between the arrest to the time of departure was not satisfactorily explained. The officer did not act expeditiously and the delay may have prejudiced the accused because when, as here, the readings are slightly above the legal limit, the tests need to be taken as soon as practicable to ensure that the accused’s blood alcohol content at the time of driving is determined accurately. The Crown was not entitled to rely on the presumption in s. 259(1)(c) of the Code.","The accused was charged with impaired driving. The accused was arrested and the police officer attended to administer the breath tests. The delay was so lengthy that a rudimentary, or even a perfunctory, perusal of the disclosed material would have shown the accused's breath sample at the outset. The officer's explanation for not being able to leave the scene till some thirty-five minutes after the accused was apprehended was not satisfactory. The Court of Queen's Bench found that the defence did not mention the s. 8 violation in its Charter notice. The court found that there were two time periods that have to be considered the period from arrest to departure to the police station, and the time from arrival at the police office to the time the tests were taken. The time spent at the scene was approximately an hour. The police officer's failure to provide a reasonable suspicion standard was glaringly apparent. The officers could have acted in a more expeditious manner. The trial judge's explanation that he could not leave the station till some time after he had taken the first sample was not acceptable. The evidence was not sufficiently explained. The test result was not obtained until some thirty minutes after it was taken."
