19,"10(1) and 6(2) of the Act, an employer is required to pay an employee at the rate of time and one-half for every hour worked in excess of 32 hours in any week containing a public holiday (""holiday"").
It is noted that none of these days is holiday, but is the day in the week containing holiday when Morgan worked the eight excess hours.
The Director says it is not holiday issue, but whether the City is obliged to pay overtime as required by the Act for hours worked over 32 in week which has holiday in it.
The existence of the holiday is an essential part of the issue.
The City filed various documents, including copies of the collective bargaining agreement (the ""agreement"") it has with the Amalgamated Transit Union, Local #588, which covers Morgan's employment with the City, and asked me to compare the agreement's holiday pay with the Act's holiday pay.
The materials satisfy me that pursuant to the terms of the agreement: 1. during the period December 31, 1989, to January 2, 1993, the City paid Morgan 87 hours of pay in excess of the Act's requirements for hours worked in week containing holiday; and 2. for each of the specific weeks questioned by the Director it paid Morgan 4 hours pay in excess of the Act\'s requirements.
72(1) Nothing in this Act or in any order or regulation made under this Act affects any provision in any Act, agreement or contract of service or any custom insofar as it ensures to any employee more favourable conditions, more favourable hours of work or more favourable rate of wages than the conditions, the hours of work or the rate of wages provided for by this Act or by any other order or regulation.
(2) Where any provision in this Act or in any order or regulation made under this Act requires the payment of wages at the rate of time and one-half, no provision in any Act, agreement or contract of service, and no custom, shall be deemed to be more favourable than the provision in this Act or in the order or regulation if it provides for the payment of wages at rate less than the rate of time and one- (3) Any provision in any Act, agreement or contract of service or any custom that is less favourable to an employee than the provision of this Act or any order or regulation made under this Act is superseded by this Act or any order or regulation made under this Act insofar as it affects that employee.
Caxton, found guilty at trial of failing to pay overtime wages as required by the Act, appealed and won in the Court of Appeal on the ground that the collective bargaining agreement was more favourable to Caxton's employees than the Act.
The Court held that ""deemed"" in ss.
71(2) meant ""deemed until the contrary is proved"", and the Court was satisfied by the material before it that the collective bargaining agreement was more favourable to the employees than the terms of the Act.
419 and 421: In determining whether any provision in an agreement prescribing rate of pay is more favourable than its counterpart contained in the Act, should that provision be isolated from the rest of the agreement and be treated as unaffected by the other provisions of the agreement dealt with in vacuo so to speak and the comparison between it and its counterpart in the Act then made, or should that provision and its effect be first evaluated in the light of the other provisions of the agreement then, only after such evaluation has take place, should the comparison be made.
[M]y conclusion is that the legislature intended the rate-of-pay provision in any agreement to be read and evaluated in the light of the other provisions of the agreement before comparison is made with its counterpart in the Act.
That the legislature contemplated that it should be left open to demonstrate that provision (in an agreement) on its face less favourable than its counterpart in the Act is, in fact, more favourable than the latter is evident not only from the wording of the section but from the decision itself to include the second branch of S62(1) in the section.
note that in Justice Bayda's view the ""manifest"", ""avowed"" purpose of the Act is ""to provide employees with working conditions and standards as favourable to them as possible.""
He admits that over all the agreement is more favourable to the employee than the minimum standards set out in the Act.
have no difficulty therefore in concluding that in the circumstances of this case the provisions of the agreement are more favourable to Morgan than the terms of the Act.

In response to his application, the Victims' Services Division wrote Mr. Glasgow in part as follows: The police investigation has indicated that they will not be proceeding with criminal charges.
In this respect, the Board wrote: There is nothing ln the Act which suggests that a person is not a victim because the police failed to lay a charge.
In some instances the victim will not know his attacker and despite investigation the police will be unable to determine who to charge.
In the Board's opinion, Mr. Glasgow does qualify as victim within the meaning of s. 2(e) of the Act.
The Board notes that the s. 11A does not use the term ""victim"" in describing who has been injured or killed.
The Director should use the terminology in s. 11(A) when deciding whether or not to award compensation.
Section 11D(1) of the Act allows the Director to take into account the circumstances and any behaviour of the injured person that directly or indirectly contributed to the injury.
It states as follows: 11 D(1) In determining whether to award compensation and the amount thereof, the Director shall consider and take into account all such circumstances as the Director considers relevant to the making of the award and, without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Director shall consider and take into account any behaviour of the person injured or killed that directly or indirectly contributed to that person's injury or death.

No. 110144 NOVA SCOTIA COURT OF APPEAL Clarke, C.J.N.S.; Chipman and Pugsley, JJ.A. BETWEEN: ATTORNEY GENERAL OF NOVA SCOTIA and STACY GLASGOW Respondent John D. Wood for the Appellant The Respondent in Person Appeal Heard: February 8, 1995 Judgment Delivered: February 8, 1995 THE COURT: Appeal dismissed from decision of Nova Scotia Utility and Review Board concerning an award of compensation pursuant to the Victims\' Rights and Services Act, per oral reasons for judgment delivered by Clarke, C.J.N.S.; Chipman and Pugsley, JJ.A. concurring. The reasons for judgment of the Court were delivered orally by: CLARKE, C.J.N.S.: Mr. Glasgow applied for criminal injuries compensation pursuant to the Victims\' Rights and Services Act, S.N.S. 1989, c. 14, as amended. He alleged that he was wrongly assaulted and as result he was entitled to compensation for the losses he suffered. On September 10, 1993, Mr. Glasgow was involved in an angry exchange of words with Mr. Johnson. He asked Mr. Johnson if he wanted to fight. No fight ensued. As Mr. Glasgow turned away Mr. Johnson delivered ""sucker‑punch"" which broke Mr. Glasgow's jaw. Mr. Glasgow ended up in hospital. He incurred dental expenses and lost wages. In response to his application, the Victims' Services Division wrote Mr. Glasgow in part as follows: The police investigation has indicated that they will not be proceeding with criminal charges. The investigation did not provide evidence that criminal offence occurred. Because the program is unable to confirm through the criminal justice system that you are a victim of crime, we are unable to make a compensation award. Mr. Glasgow appealed to the Nova Scotia Utility and Review Board. The Board held de novo hearing which it is entitled to do under the Act. In decision dated September 20, 1994, the Vice‑Chair of the Board allowed the appeal. She found Mr. Glasgow was ""victim"" in the meaning of s. 2(e) which provides: (e) ""victim"" means an individual who has suffered bodily harm, mental or nervous shock, pain, suffering, economic loss or deprivation of property as the result of an act or omission that forms the basis of an offence and includes, where the individual is dead, ill or otherwise incapable of exercising the rights granted by this Act, the spouse or next of kin of that person or anyone who has, in law or in fact, the custody or guardianship of that person or who is responsible for the care or support of that person. In this respect, the Board wrote: There is nothing ln the Act which suggests that a person is not a victim because the police failed to lay a charge. In some instances the victim will not know his attacker and despite investigation the police will be unable to determine who to charge. In the Board's opinion, Mr. Glasgow does qualify as victim within the meaning of s. 2(e) of the Act. The Board then considered an application of 11A(1)(a) and (d) and 11L(3) of this Act. Of these sections the Vice Chair wrote: Section 11A(1)(a) and (d) of the Act states as follows: 11A(1) Where person is injured or killed by an Act or omission in the Province of another person occurring in or resulting from (a) the commission of an offence within the description of any criminal offence mentioned in the Schedule to this Act; the Director, on application to the Director in accordance with the regulations and on consideration of such evidence as the Director may require, may, as the Director considers proper, award compensation to (d) the person injured or killed or that person's estate; The offence of causing bodily harm is listed in the Schedule to the Act. The Board notes that the s. 11A does not use the term ""victim"" in describing who has been injured or killed. The Board also notes that Cst. Johnston referred to Mr. Glasgow as victim. The Director should use the terminology in s. 11(A) when deciding whether or not to award compensation. Section 11D(1) of the Act allows the Director to take into account the circumstances and any behaviour of the injured person that directly or indirectly contributed to the injury. It states as follows: 11 D(1) In determining whether to award compensation and the amount thereof, the Director shall consider and take into account all such circumstances as the Director considers relevant to the making of the award and, without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Director shall consider and take into account any behaviour of the person injured or killed that directly or indirectly contributed to that person's injury or death. Under s. 11 L(3) of the Act the Board may make any decision that the Director could have made. After reviewing the evidence and determining Mr. Glasgow ""was injured as result of the commission of an offence of causing bodily harm"", the Board applied s. 11D(1) which is quoted above. In doing so it determined that based on the evidence, the behaviour of Mr. Glasgow in the series of events contributed to his loss. Accordingly the Board reduced his claim for dental costs and lost wages by 50%. The appellant has now appealed from the decision and award of the Board contending that lt misapprehended the evidence, misinterpreted the relevant law and erred first, by awarding compensation to Mr. Glasgow and second, by reducing lt by 50%. The appeal provisions are set forth in s. 11 L(3) and (4). They state: (3) The person or tribunal hearing the appeal may make any decision that the Director could have made; (4) decision made upon appeal is final except that an appeal lies therefrom to the Appeal Division of the Supreme Court on any question of law. In our opinion the Board correctly interpreted its jurisdiction. Thereafter it made findings of fact that were within its jurisdiction. The record reveals there was ample evidence arising from the de novo hearing to support its findings. We find no error in law was committed by the Board. In these circumstances the decision of the Board is protected by the finality provision the Legislature has impressed upon lt. Accordingly the appeal is dismissed.

EVERETT ROGER STUCKLESS SENTENCE BREACH OF PROBATION HEARD: before the Honourable Chief Justice Joseph P. Kennedy, Supreme Court of Nova Scotia, Halifax, Nova Scotia, August 13, 1999 DECISION: August 13, 1999 WRITTEN RELEASE: October 14, 1999 COUNSEL: Robert McCarroll for the Crown Donald L. Presse, for the defence Kennedy, C.J.: (Orally) am going to accept the recommendation of both the Crown and Defence in relation to his appeal. I am doing so on the basis that when I read the decision of Judge Williams, actually, his decision is ambiguous to the extent that, although he appears to believe that the Tan case requires that a second conditional discharge not be made available in relation to the matter arising out of similar circumstances in relation to a prior discharge. Although he believes the Tan case dictates that situation, he nevertheless, during the course of that decision, appears to do the requisite test in determining the use of conditional discharge, so there is degree of ambiguity in relation to the matter. What is clear though, to me, is that he starts the process by indicating to counsel that he believes that he is constrained and finishes his decision with a reference to the Tan case at page 13 of the abstract that I have, where I note and I state that R. v. Tan (1974), 1974 CanLII 1608 (BC CA), 22 C.C.C. (2d)184 (B.C.C.A.) stands for the proposition that an accused may not receive a discharge where he has already received a discharge for another offence. In fact Tan does not stand for that proposition, it is not nearly so rigid and that causes me the concern that have, that the learned Provincial Court Judge misconstrued the situation at that time. Having come to that conclusion, am going to overturn the determination of that learned judge. I am going to accept the joint recommendation of counsel that was made before him, and is again made before me, that there be a conditional discharge, three years probation, absolutely no contact direct or indirect with the named victim. It was the nature of the contact and the other circumstances surrounding the contact in this specific that allows for further discharge. am satisfied that can substitute the sentence in relation to this specific and it seems to me to be the reasonable way to proceed.

Mr. Stuckless, wanted you here, particularly, because, want to make very sure that you understand why you got into this situation today, why you got into this mess.

Should there be further contact of any nature on your part with the woman involved, you will not have to worry about discharge, it will be quite simply, question of how long period of time you are going to be incarcerated. want you to know that so you will not jeopardize your future in that respect, you will not misinterpret the position of this Court. know you won’t.

The debtor made consumer proposal which was accepted by his creditors and PricewaterhouseCoopers (“PWC”) was appointed Trustee under the proposal. At some point during the proposal Mr. White defaulted. The Act makes it clear where the payments on consumer proposal are to be made monthly (as was the case here), and where the debt is in default to the extent of three months of payments the proposal is deemed to be annulled.

The evidence as to the exact date was unclear, but PWC can determine the exact date applying the principle expounded upon here. The Superintendent objects on this taxation indicating that this court should review the trustee’s fee given that the trustee accepted payments after the deemed annulment. find that PWC is entitled to fee, but that fee can only be based on those amounts received by PWC under the provisions of the consumer proposal. Those amounts received after the consumer proposal was deemed to be annulled are not be subject to a trustee’s fee. What should PWC do with the monies received from the debtor after the default? It seems to me that the debtor did send those monies to PWC with the intention those monies be distributed to the debtor’s creditors. To that extent the trustee acts as the debtor’s agent. PWC as agent has an obligation to disburse those monies to the creditors as was the intention of the debtor. In summary, the fee of PWC should only be based on monies received from the debtor while the proposal was extant. The fee is taxed and allowed in the appropriate amount, with leave to reapply to me to set specific number if PWC and he Superintendent cannot agree what that should be.

NOVA SCOTIA COURT OF APPEAL Citation: R. v. Robinson, 2005 NSCA 65 Date: 20050412 Docket: C.A.C. 233300 Registry: Halifax Between: Her Majesty The Queen v. Wayne Douglas Robinson Respondent Judges: Roscoe, Chipman and Saunders, J.J.A. Appeal Heard: April 11, 2005, in Halifax, Nova Scotia Held: Appeal allowed, per reasons for judgment of Roscoe, J.A.; Chipman, J.A. and Saunders, J.A. concurring. Counsel: William D. Delaney, for the appellant Brad G. Sarson, for the respondent Reasons for judgment: [1] At the conclusion of the hearing the court announced that this appeal was allowed with reasons to follow. These are the reasons. [2] The Crown appeals from acquittals entered by Judge Michael Sherar of the Provincial Court on five charges relating to the possession and storage of prohibited weapons. The Information alleged that the offences occurred on or about May 30, 2003. [3] The charges were laid after police officers who were in attendance at residence as result of fire, were advised by firefighters of the presence of two sawed off shotguns in the home. [4] At the commencement of the trial, counsel advised the trial judge that the defence had made several admissions in letter to the prosecutor and which was agreed would form part of the record. That letter, dated May 12, 2004, stated in part: Further to the above noted matter, am writing to advise you of number of admissions that the Defence is prepared to make in an effort to shorten the amount of time required for trial: The Defence is prepared to admit: 1. Date, time, and place; [5] In addition, the defence admitted that on May 30, 2003, Mr. Robinson was resident of the home where the firearms were found, that he was subject to an order prohibiting possession of firearms, and that he was not the holder of an firearms licence. As well, in preliminary discussions with the trial judge, defence counsel agreed that the firearms in question were stored without secure devices, that one of them was loaded and that one of them was stolen. It was noted that essentially the issues at trial would be knowledge and possession. [6] Two police officers testified. The first, Constable Guzzwell indicated that he had been dispatched to structure fire at house on Herring Cove Road, at 3:00 a.m. on May 23, 2003. He arrived before the fire engines. He banged on the door several times, eventually rousing an occupant and advising him to leave the house. After learning that there was dog still in the house the officer went back in with the resident to find the dog. while later he was told by member of the fire department that gun had been observed in bedroom of the house. Constable Guzzwell went back into the house with two other officers and found and removed two sawed off shotguns. [7] The second officer, Constable Dumas testified that he attended at the scene of the fire on May 23, 2003, entered the residence accompanied by Constable Guzzwell, located the firearms and photographed the weapons and two pieces of personal identification found in the bedroom, bearing the name of the accused. [8] After the close of the case for the Crown, defence counsel brought a motion for directed verdict on the basis that there was no evidence of one of the elements of the offence, that is, the date of the offence as alleged in the Information. In response, Crown counsel applied to amend the Information with respect to the date of the offence, to conform with the evidence. The trial judge, without specifically ruling on the motion to amend, granted the defence motion and entered acquittals on all charges. In discussions with counsel the trial judge remarked: THE COURT Well, if it wasn’t for the letter of May the 12th, think that you would have been out of luck, [Crown counsel]. I’m not so sure that you’re still not out of luck. But the first comment in the letter of May 12th, 2004 which also reviewed during the trial was that the Defence is prepared to admit the following date, time and place, presumably with regards to jurisdiction in the event. There is no argument made that the Crown must prove their case beyond reasonable doubt on each and every one of the elements of the offence, time being one of them. The time is admitted. There’s no argument that the accused is put to any surprise by the events which unfolded. [9] The brief decision is as follows: With some hesitation, am going to grant the Defence motion. There has not been proof of the elements of the offences alluded to in the Information before the Court sworn the 31st of May, 2003. [comments re exhibits] You are acquitted sir. [10] On appeal, the Crown takes the position that the trial judge erred in allowing the directed verdict motion even in the absence of an amendment and that the trial judge erred in failing to grant the motion to amend. The respondent submits that the trial judge granted the motion for directed verdict for insufficiency of evidence unrelated to the discrepancy in the date. It is conceded by the respondent that if the trial judge granted the motion for directed verdict because the date of the offence was not proven, there was an error of law. The respondent suggests that because the trial judge used the word “elements” that the date was not the only insufficiency. [11] The appellant relies on section 601(4.1) (which pursuant to s. 572 also applies to trials of indictable matters without jury),: 601 (4.1) variance between the indictment or count therein and the evidence taken is not material with respect to (a) the time when the offence is alleged to have been committed, if it is proved that the indictment was preferred within the prescribed period of limitation, if any; or ... [12] In R. v. B.(G.). 1990 CanLII 7308 (SCC), [1990] S.C.R. 30, Justice Wilson for the Court indicated that s.529(4.1), the predecessor of s. 601(4.1), was similar to the common law rule that the date of the offence need not be proven unless it is an essential element of the offence. At 38, she stated: 38 From the foregoing, it is clear that it is of no consequence if the date specified in the information differs from that arising from the evidence unless the time of the offence is critical and the accused may be misled by the variance and therefore prejudiced in his or her defence. It is also clear from Dossi and other authorities that the date of the offence need not be proven in order for conviction to result unless time is an essential element of the offence. Accordingly, while it is trite to say that the Crown must prove every element of the offence in order to obtain conviction, it is, believe, more accurate to say that the Crown must prove all the essential elements. The Crown need not prove elements which are, at most, incidental to the offence. [13] Justice Wilson provided several examples of cases where the time of the offence was an essential element, such as, on charge of operating plane or an automobile without valid licence where the defence is that valid licence had been in existence at the time. Obviously, the date of the offence has to be proven to fall outside the time when licence was effective. As well, where an accused defends charge by providing evidence of an alibi for the date or time period alleged, the date of the offence is an essential element. [14] Given the circumstances in which the motion for directed verdict was made, including the argument advanced by defence counsel, it is fairly obvious that the trial judge granted the motion because the Crown had failed to prove that the date of possession of the weapons was May 30, 2003 as alleged in the Information. That was an error of law. The date of the offences was not an essential element. [15] Counsel for the respondent contends however that the trial judge granted the motion for directed verdict because the evidence presented by the Crown was not sufficient to meet the required test, that is, whether there was any evidence upon which reasonable jury, properly instructed could return verdict of guilty. (see: The United States of America v. Sheppard (1976), 1976 CanLII (SCC), 30 C.C.C. (2d) 424 (S.C.C.)) [16] If that is correct interpretation of the decision, then the reasons for granting the motion are so inadequate that they do not meet the test for sufficiency of reasons because they do not provide any indication of why there was insufficient evidence. The test for sufficiency of reasons, is, as set out in R. v. Braich, 2002 SCC 27 (CanLII), [2002] S.C.R. 903, at para. [31] The test, in other words, is whether the reasons adequately perform the function for which they are required, namely to allow the appeal court to review the correctness of the trial decision. [17] If the directed verdict was not founded in the discrepancy with the date, then the appeal would have to be allowed on the basis that the trial judge erred in law by giving insufficient reasons which prejudiced the Crown’s right of appeal. [18] Although the trial judge did not actually rule on the application by the Crown to amend the Information, if the directed verdict was granted on the basis that it was too late for an amendment, that too was an error in law. Section 601(3) of the Criminal Code provides: (3) Subject to this section, court shall, at any stage of the proceedings, amend the indictment or count therein as may be necessary where it appears ... (b) that the indictment or count thereof (i) fails to state or states defectively anything that is requisite to constitute the offence, ... (iii) is in any way defective in substance, and the matters to be alleged in the proposed amendment are disclosed by the evidence taken on the preliminary inquiry or on the trial; or ... [19] Section 601(4) lists the factors that should be taken into consideration on an amendment application, which include whether the accused has been misled or prejudiced and whether the amendment would cause an injustice. Here there was no suggestion that the amendment of the date would mislead or cause prejudice or injustice to the accused. There was no indication that the date of the offences was relevant to the defence. [20] In summary, the trial judge erred by granting the motion for directed verdict based on the discrepancy between the date of the offences alleged in the Information and the evidence presented at trial because the date of the offences was not an essential element of the offences. Alternatively, if the motion was granted on the basis of insufficiency of the evidence, the reasons are inadequate. Furthermore, although it was not necessary to amend the Information because the date was not an essential element, if the reason for the directed verdict was that it was too late to amend, that was also reversible error of law. [21] The appeal is accordingly allowed, the acquittals are set aside and a new trial is ordered. Roscoe, J.A. Concurred in: Chipman, J.A.

[9] His counsel reports that S.C. has had significant substance abuse problems throughout his life mostly with alcohol but also occasionally with drugs.
Submissions made on his behalf suggest that he has twice attempted treatment programs, the first approximately five years ago which was successful for short period of time but saw him relapse into alcohol and drug abusive behaviours.
POSITION OF THE PARTIES [12] At the invitation of the court, counsel for both parties submitted their positions in writing with respect to the sentencing of S.C. Those positions are as follows: The Crown’s Position [13] In his brief, counsel for the Crown sets out its position as follows in para.
... [14] In support of its position, the Crown relies upon the cases of R. v.
[19] It must be pointed out at this time that counsel for the defence did not argue for any sentence imposed to be served in the community.
[23] Section 718.2 of the Criminal Code mandates that sentencing court must take into consideration relevant aggravating or mitigating circumstances relating to the offence or the offender in considering whether or not sentence should be increased or reduced.
Since this case did involve the abuse of person under the age of 18 years, this section of the Code mandates that primary consideration be given to the sentencing objectives of denunciation and deterrence.
Section 718.2(ii.1) also applies since this case did involve the abuse of person under the age of 18 years.

Mitigating Circumstances [31] The accused does not have any significant or related criminal record and he has not previously served time in jail.
She has written letter of support outlining her feelings for the accused and her belief that he truly wishes to rehabilitate himself and make plan for his and now his family’s future.
They accept the sincerity of his wish to deal with his past and present addictive and abusive behaviours and to make new life for himself and his family.
They are prepared to support him personally and with the resources of the Reserve, as Chief Pratt submitted in her oral statements and written letter to the court.
There is no better evidence of why the protection of children is an important social value than to consider the history of abuse testified to by both A.M.’s mother and S.C. himself.
As S.C. testified, the physical and sexual abuse that he suffered at the hands of his family members have haunted and affected him throughout his life.
The length of sentence responds to the concerns and considerations which the court has outlined including the Code mandates of denunciation and deterrence both of S.C. and the larger members of the community.
[40] In addition, the court imposes the following optional conditions in this probation order: 1.
[42] A further order shall issue pursuant to s. 487.051(2) of the Criminal Code authorizing and ordering you to provide sufficient samples of your bodily substances so that a DNA analysis may be conducted.
[43] Finally, the Crown has requested an order be made pursuant to s. 161 of the Criminal Code prohibiting S.C. from engaging in certain employment involving positions of trust or authority towards persons under the age of 14 years and prohibiting him from attending certain public areas frequented by children under 14. am prepared to accept the submissions of the Crown with respect to ss.

M. a person under the age of fourteen years directly with a part of his body contrary to s. 151(a) of the Criminal Code.
After reviewing the circumstances of the offence and the offender, in addition to sentencing principles as set out in the case law and statutes, the Court found that this was not a case where a conditional sentence served in the community is available or appropriate.
The Court found the appropriate sentence, given all the circumstances, is a term of 9 months to be served in a correctional institute in Canada, to be followed by a 1 year term of probation containing the standard conditions.

Skibinsky for S. C. SENTENCING JUDGMENT ZARZECZNY J. July 2, 2009 INTRODUCTION [1] On June 5, 2009, this Court, in a written judgment (the “Judgment”) found the accused guilty of the following offence:COUNT 1 THAT HE, the said S. C. [sic], on or between the 20th day of May and the 22nd of December, A. D. 2005 at Muscowpetung First Nation, Saskatchewan did for a sexual purpose touch A. M. [sic] a person under the age of fourteen years directly with a part of his body, to wit: his hand, contrary to Section 151(a) of the Criminal Code. [2] Section 151(1) of the Criminal Code provided, at the relevant time, as follows: 151. Sexual interference Every person who, for sexual purpose, touches, directly or indirectly, with part of the body or with an object, any part of the body of person under the age of fourteen years (a) is guilty of an indictable offence and liable to imprisonment for term not exceeding ten years and to minium punishment of imprisonment for term of forty-five days; ... CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE OFFENCE [3] The facts of this case are as set out in the court’s Judgment. Briefly stated, the accused was found guilty of directly touching, for sexual purpose with his hand, the vagina of A.M. on more than one occasion between May 20 and December 22, 2005. The last of these occurred either December 17 or 18 of that year. A.M. was nine years old at the time and therefore person under 14 years of age as provided for by s. 151(a) of the Criminal Code. On all occasions, his touching occurred over and not under A.M.’s clothes. [4] At the time of these occurrences, the accused lived with A.M.’s mother, T.Y. He regarded his relationship with A.M. as that of step-father/daughter. His sexual touching occurred at his residence on the Muscowpetung First Nation Reserve on occasions when A.M. would visit with him and her mother on weekends. CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE OFFENDER [5] S.C. is currently 37 year old male. At the time of the commission of this offence, he was 33. He is First Nations and although he currently resides on the Ochapowace First Nation Reserve, his home reserve is Muscowpetung where these incidents occurred. At 13 years of age, he entered the Lebret Residential School where he attended for approximately three and one-half years. At the sentencing hearing, his counsel advised he experienced abuses at this school. The accused testified at the trial. He told of his experiences both of physical and, more traumatic to him, sexual abuse while growing up. He was sexually abused by both male and female members of his family. He testified at the trial that this abuse substantially impacted him and it has affected him all his life. [6] S.C. did not complete high school education, however, he says he has plans to do so. He hopes to enroll in Grade 12 equivalency program which he could begin in the fall of 2009. [7] S.C.’s counsel submitted that when he did work it was in general labouring type jobs. He has been unemployed for lengthy periods including the present. [8] S.C. has three children, two older sons, ages 13 and 17, as well as daughter, age 15, and young son born of A.M.’s mother. He currently resides with his new common law spouse who is now pregnant with his child. [9] His counsel reports that S.C. has had significant substance abuse problems throughout his life mostly with alcohol but also occasionally with drugs. Submissions made on his behalf suggest that he has twice attempted treatment programs, the first approximately five years ago which was successful for short period of time but saw him relapse into alcohol and drug abusive behaviours. The second occasion was during December and January of 08/09 while he was awaiting trial on this charge. He attended two months of an 11 month program. He withdrew before completion but hopes to re-enter and is on the waiting list. [10] S.C. has many supporters. His mother, common law spouse, cousins, brother and nieces were in court during his sentencing hearing as was Mr. Vern Anaskan of the Justice Committee of the Piapot Reserve and Chief Elizabeth Pratt of the Muscowpetung Reserve. Chief Pratt and number of others wrote letters of reference and support and during the sentencing hearing, submissions of support were received. Chief Pratt emphasized his need for healing and encouraged the court to accept his commitment to change which she believed was sincere. [11] S.C. has criminal record for offences dating back to 1993, the last of which involved an uttering threat charge in 2003, for which he was fined and received one year probation. The Crown accepts that these past offences are non-related to the present charge. In all prior cases he received fines, driving prohibitions and, in the one case, probation. His counsel advises he has not served any period of incarceration other than as related to the present offence. POSITION OF THE PARTIES [12] At the invitation of the court, counsel for both parties submitted their positions in writing with respect to the sentencing of S.C. Those positions are as follows: The Crown’s Position [13] In his brief, counsel for the Crown sets out its position as follows in para. 1: In it’s submissions, the Crown will seek sentence of incarceration to be served in Provincial Correctional Facility. The length of sentence requested by the Crown will be years less one day. ... [14] In support of its position, the Crown relies upon the cases of R. v. D.W.C., 1997 SKCA (SentDig) 30; R. v. McKay, 2000 SKCA (SentDig) 19; R. v. G. (H.), 2003 SKCA (SentDig) 38; R. v. Bighetty (2005) 2005 SKCA 94 (CanLII), 269 Sask. R. 108 (Sask. C.A.); R. v. Lindsay, 2008 SKCA (SentDig) 1, R. v. Bird (2008), 2008 SKCA 65 (CanLII), 310 Sask. R. 222. In addition to these case authorities, the Crown relies upon s. 718.01 of the Criminal Code of Canada, R.S.C. 1985, c. C-46 (the “Criminal Code”) requiring court, when it imposes sentence for an offence that involves the abuse of person under the age of 18 years, to give primary consideration to the objectives of denunciation and deterrence. The Crown additionally relies upon s. 718.2(ii.1) providing that it is an aggravating circumstance that the offender abused person under the age of 18 years, s. 718.2(iii) that the offender abused position of trust or authority in relation to the victim, and s. 718.2(b) the parity principle. [15] In addition to the sentence of incarceration, the Crown applies for s. 490.012 Criminal Code sex offender registry Order (unopposed by the defence), s. 487.051(2) Criminal Code Order authorizing DNA analysis samples to be provided (again unopposed by the defendant), s. 109 ten year firearm prohibition Order and ten year prohibition Order from attending certain places as provided for by s. 161 of the Criminal Code. The latter two orders are both opposed by the defence as being over-reaching having regard to the circumstances of the offence in respect of the former and this offender in the respect of the latter. [16] Finally, the Crown asks for two year period of probation to follow any sentence with general conditions and two specific conditions including sex offender and substance abuse assessment, counselling or treatment and avoiding contact with A.M. The Accused’s Position At para. 49 of her submission, counsel for the accused advances the following position to the court with respect to its sentencing of the accused: In light of all of the submissions and materials filed, as well as any additional oral submissions on the date of sentencing, the defence submits that an appropriately fit sentence for [S.C.] would be in the range between six to nine months. We agree with the Crown’s recommendation for lengthy probation period to follow the custodial portion of the sentence. [18] As did those persons making submissions to the court during the sentencing hearing, counsel for the accused stressed S.C.’s need and desire for treatment as First Nation’s individual. Counsel stressed the restorative approach outlined by the Supreme Court in the seminal decision of R. v. Gladue, 1999 CanLII 679 (SCC), [1999] S.C.R. 688 and commended the “Gladue principles” to the court for its consideration. In doing so, she raises s. 718.2(e) of the Criminal Code requiring the court to consider all available sanctions other than imprisonment before imposing custodial term, especially with respect to aboriginal offenders. [19] It must be pointed out at this time that counsel for the defence did not argue for any sentence imposed to be served in the community. The court understood her submissions to support not community based sentence for the accused but rather the proposition that the “Gladue factors” and principles should inform this Court with respect to the length of any incarceral sentence it might impose upon this offender. ANALYSIS The Sentencing Provision of the Criminal Code [20] As have the courts in the cases quoted in this sentencing judgment, have considered, in particular, the provisions of the Criminal Code setting out the fundamental purposes, objectives and principles of sentencing. [21] The Criminal Code of Canada, and in particular s. 718 of the Code, sets out the fundamental purposes of sentencing. These include maintaining respect for the law and just, peaceful and safe society. The objectives of sentencing are also set out in this section of the Code and they include denunciation of unlawful conduct, deterrence of an offender or other persons from committing offences, separation of offenders from society when necessary, assisting in the rehabilitation of offenders and finally the promotion of sense of responsibility in offenders and an acknowledgment of the harm done to victims and to the community. [22] fundamental principle of sentencing is set out by s. 718.1 of the Criminal Code. sentence must be proportionate to the gravity of the offence and the degree of responsibility of the offender. [23] Section 718.2 of the Criminal Code mandates that sentencing court must take into consideration relevant aggravating or mitigating circumstances relating to the offence or the offender in considering whether or not sentence should be increased or reduced. This section advances the parity principle that similar sentences should be imposed on similar offenders for similar offences committed in similar circumstances. An offender should not be deprived of liberty if less restrictive sanctions are appropriate in the circumstances. All available sanctions other than imprisonment that are reasonable in the circumstances should be considered for all offenders with particular attention to the circumstances of aboriginal offenders. [24] Finally, s. 742.1 of the Criminal Code provides that where court imposes sentence of imprisonment of less than two years and it is satisfied that serving the sentence in the community would not endanger the safety of the community and would be consistent with the fundamental purposes and principles of sentencing previously referred to, the court may order that the offender serve the sentence in the community subject to conditions that the court imposes. [25] The court has already commented, in the particular facts and circumstances of this case, upon the additional considerations which it is mandated to take into account with respect to the provisions of s. 718.01. Since this case did involve the abuse of person under the age of 18 years, this section of the Code mandates that primary consideration be given to the sentencing objectives of denunciation and deterrence. Section 718.2(ii.1) also applies since this case did involve the abuse of person under the age of 18 years. That is relevant aggravating circumstance as is the fact that the accused abused his position of trust or authority, namely his step-father/daughter relationship to A.M., and this too is an aggravating circumstance that the court is mandated by s. 718.2(iii) to consider. Aggravating Circumstances [26] As has already been observed, this offence involves abuse of person under the age of 18 years, namely A.M., who was nine years old at the time. The accused abused his position of trust and authority since, by his own evidence at the trial, he saw himself in step-father/daughter relationship with A.M., relationship which had continued over some years. As A.M.’s mother, T.Y., states in her victim impact statement: ... My daughter still doesn’t trust men because she gave all her trust in the world to [S.C.] and took him like her “Dad”. Then he turned around and betrayed her at the tender age of years old, by sexually touching her private parts. never thought that [S.C.] would hurt my daughter. He played the part well of being great step-dad to her. He promised her that he wasn’t here to hurt her remember him saying this to her. He gained our trust and used it to his benefit and started abusing me then eventually sexually touching [A.M.]. ... [27] These incidents of abuse occurred more than once. At the trial, as best A.M. could remember, it happened around five times or so. [28] The accused is not young man he was 33 years old when this offence occurred and he is now 37. Even though he is self-acknowledged long time abuser of alcohol and drugs, has made no serious effort at obtaining help, programming or rehabilitation. What efforts he has made have been unsuccessful or uncompleted. He has not upgraded his skills or education nor has he maintained regular or any worthwhile employment. [29] Perhaps most noteworthy, however, as an aggravating circumstance, is that at no time during the trial nor during the sentencing hearing when he was given specific opportunity to do so and asked if he had anything to say, did he apologize to his victim, the court, his community, his current spouse or T.Y. for his actions. He has shown absolutely no remorse and, as noted in the trial Judgment, appeared more focused upon himself and his own victimization then showing any concern for his victim or the impact his abuse might have upon her and her future life. [30] These are the aggravating circumstances which this Court has considered applicable in this case. Mitigating Circumstances [31] The accused does not have any significant or related criminal record and he has not previously served time in jail. He appears now to be well settled in new relationship which appears stable. He clearly has the love and support of his current spouse who has been with him during the trial and all subsequent court proceedings. She has written letter of support outlining her feelings for the accused and her belief that he truly wishes to rehabilitate himself and make plan for his and now his family’s future. [32] The accused clearly has the support of his First Nation’s community, both members of his Reserve and that of his now adopted Ochapowace First Nation Reserve. Many of his relatives, including his brother, cousins and nieces as well as his mother, were in court to support him. number of these individuals spoke at the sentencing hearing. They accept the sincerity of his wish to deal with his past and present addictive and abusive behaviours and to make new life for himself and his family. They are prepared to support him personally and with the resources of the Reserve, as Chief Pratt submitted in her oral statements and written letter to the court. [33] Finally in this regard, the court does observe that as abusive as S.C.’s behaviours towards A.M. were, the nature of his actions were not as intrusive as is the case in number of the cases relied upon by the Crown in its brief on sentencing. A.M., as the Judgment notes, is an intelligent and confident individual and although she has been impacted, as her mother’s victim impact statement outlines, nevertheless, she appears resilient and impressed the court as being able to put this matter behind her. Time will tell. CONCLUSION [34] This is not a case where a conditional sentence served in the community is available or appropriate. Section 151 of the Criminal Code provides that the maximum sentence in case such as this is 10 years but it also provides compulsory minimum sentence of incarceration of not less than 45 days. Section 742.1 of the Criminal Code relating to the imposition of conditional sentences is therefore not available in this case. [35] As previously reviewed, the Crown recommends sentence of two years less day of imprisonment while defence counsel submits that sentence of six to nine months of incarceration would be appropriate in all of the circumstances. [36] There can be no question, by virtue of the recent amendments to the Criminal Code, that the Parliament of Canada has clearly sought to protect the children and young people of this country from the abuse of adults. It has done so, in part, by enacting the provisions of s. 718.01 mandating that where case involves the abuse of person under 18 years of age, the court must give primary consideration to the sentencing objectives of denunciation and deterrence. There is no better evidence of why the protection of children is an important social value than to consider the history of abuse testified to by both A.M.’s mother and S.C. himself. As S.C. testified, the physical and sexual abuse that he suffered at the hands of his family members have haunted and affected him throughout his life. Failure of the justice system and the courts to protect young people by imposing jail sentences that will serve to denounce and deter abusive behaviour towards children will only perpetuate the kind of abuse and consequences which S.C., the accused in this case, has himself experienced and from which he testified he still suffers. [37] A.M. was entitled to be safe in the hands of her parent, including her step-parent, S.C. She was entitled to grow up happy and well-adjusted and to trust in and have respect for adults, male and female. S.C. accepted his role, as he testified at trial, as A.M.’s step-parent and as such, he was responsible to protect her and keep her safe. He abused his position of trust and authority by molesting her not once but on number of occasions. So much so, that when she finally reported his abuse to her grandmother, she did so because she was frightened that, as she testified, it would get worse. Her testimony at the trial suggested nothing less than she was sufficiently aware of the nature and kind of abuse that she was experiencing to follow her mother’s advice and report it to someone she trusted, in this case, her grandmother. She became scared enough to do so. [38] In all of these circumstances, the court has concluded that an appropriate sentence to be imposed upon S.C., for his conduct in this case, is a term of imprisonment of nine months to be served in a correctional institute of Canada. The length of sentence responds to the concerns and considerations which the court has outlined including the Code mandates of denunciation and deterrence both of S.C. and the larger members of the community. This sentence also responds to the nature of the acts committed. Thankfully, because of A.M.’s intelligence and strength S.C.’s abuse of her, while serious, was reported soon enough to avoid the potential of much more serious abuse. Because of her strength what happened to A.M. has had an impact upon her which the court expects she will be able to overcome with time. [39] The sentence of imprisonment imposed by this judgment will be followed by a one year term of probation containing the standard conditions that the accused keep the peace and be of good behaviour, appear before the court when required to do so by the court, that he will notify the court or a probation officer in advance of any change of name or address and will promptly notify the court or the probation officer of any change of employment or occupation. [40] In addition, the court imposes the following optional conditions in this probation order: 1. That S.C. will report to probation officer within five working days after the making of this probation order and thereafter when required by the probation officer and in the manner directed by the probation officer; 2. That S.C. shall participate actively in assessments, education and/or treatment in an approved program or programs for substance abuse and sex offenders as may be directed by and to the satisfaction of S.C.’s probation officer and, if so directed, S.C. shall not give just cause for dismissal from such program. 3. That S.C. shall refrain from having any contact with A.M. during the period of his incarceration and, subsequently, this probation order. [41] The Crown has satisfied the court that this offence is an offence to which s. 109 of the Criminal Code applies and therefore a mandatory prohibition order shall issue prohibiting S.C. from possessing any firearm, cross-bow, prohibited weapon, restricted weapon, prohibited device, ammunition, prohibited ammunition and explosive substance during the period of 10 years after his release from prison. [42] A further order shall issue pursuant to s. 487.051(2) of the Criminal Code authorizing and ordering you to provide sufficient samples of your bodily substances so that a DNA analysis may be conducted. The court further orders, pursuant to s. 487.012 of the Criminal Code, that S.C. comply with the Sex Offender Information Registration Act, S.C. 2004, c. 10, the length of such order to continue for 20 years. [43] Finally, the Crown has requested an order be made pursuant to s. 161 of the Criminal Code prohibiting S.C. from engaging in certain employment involving positions of trust or authority towards persons under the age of 14 years and prohibiting him from attending certain public areas frequented by children under 14. am prepared to accept the submissions of the Crown with respect to ss. 161(1)(b) order, however, not in respect of an order under ss.(a). This offence occurred in particular circumstances and there is no indication that the acts of abuse were random nor is there any evidence that compulsive behaviours were involved. An order will therefore issue pursuant to s. 161(1)(b) prohibiting S.C. from seeking, obtaining or continuing any employment, whether or not the employment is remunerated, or becoming or being a volunteer in a capacity, that involves being in a position of trust or authority towards persons under the age of 14 years. J. T. C. Zarzeczny",6_2009skqb272.txt,"The accused was found guilty of the following offence: for a sexual purpose touching A. M. a person under the age of fourteen years directly with a part of his body contrary to s. 151(a) of the Criminal Code.
After reviewing the circumstances of the offence and the offender, in addition to sentencing principles as set out in the case law and statutes, the Court found that this was not a case where a conditional sentence served in the community is available or appropriate.
The Court found the appropriate sentence, given all the circumstances, is a term of 9 months to be served in a correctional institute in Canada, to be followed by a 1 year term of probation containing the standard conditions.
HELD: The accused is sentenced to 9 months incarceration.
Pursuant to s. 109(1) of the Criminal Code, a firearm order was made for 10 years prohibiting the accused from possessing any type of weapon.
The accused shall also supply a sample of his DNA for analysis.
There is an order under s. 490.012(1) that the accused comply with the Sexual Offender Information Registration Act.

The reasons for judgment of the Court were delivered orally by CHIPMAN, J.A.: This is an appeal from corollary relief judgment of Mr. Justice Richard dividing matrimonial assets and from an order for support of the children of the marriage, with respect to its effective commencement date. Mr. Justice Richard divided the matrimonial assets equally. The appellant, the husband, contends that he should have included in those assets money manager bank account. The account was in the wife's name alone and was valued at $5,961.20 at the time of separation. By the time of trial, this balance was reduced to approximately $100.00. The wife\'s testimony was ‑that when she went back to work, the marriage was in difficulty and that it was unlikely that the parties would be staying together. Her uncontradicted evidence was that it was agreed by the parties at that time that what she made should be hers. She was attempting to save money to cover legal costs and additional expenses respecting herself and the children. Some of the money was used to purchase furniture. The trial judge observed in his decision that the furniture had already been divided equally by the parties and did not require consideration by him. We are satisfied that the trial judge did not err in not finding that this spent money should be included in the division, in the unusual circumstances of this case. Mr. Justice Richard fixed the support for the children at $1,000.00 per month and set the effective date retroactively to March 1, 1991. The appellant seeks an earlier effective date so that he can obtain income tax deductions for certain monies which he said he paid prior to March 1, 1991 covering largely expenses relating to the matrimonial home in which the wife was living with the children. We see no error on the part of Mr. Justice Richard in exercising his discretion to fix the effective date of the order as March 1, 1991. The appeal is dismissed, in the circumstances with costs, which we fix at $750.00, plus disbursements to be taxed. J. A. Concurred in: Clarke, C.J.N.S. Hallett, J.A.

Wood for the appellant Harvey L. Morrison for the respondent Appeal Heard: November 12, 1991 Judgment Delivered: November 12, 1991 THE COURT: Appeal dismissed without costs per oral reasons for judgment of Jones, J.A.; Clarke, C.J.N.S. and Hart, J.A. concurring The reasons for judgment were delivered orally by: JONES, J.A.: This is an appeal by the Minister of Finance under the Health Services Tax Act. The Sarah Kate, sailing vessel, was purchased by the respondent, John Risley in Finland in 1988. The vessel sailed to the Carribean where it remained until May of 1989. From May to October, 1989, the vessel was based in Camden, Maine. In July, 1989, the vessel was in Halifax at the end of the Marblehead race. In August of that same year the vessel participated in the Chester races. On both occasions the vessel was allowed into Canada under customs permit. No customs or excise tax was paid. The vessel returned to Maine after the races. In the fall it went to the Carribean for the winter. The boat has been used as charter vessel in Maine and the Carribean. The vessel is registered in Lunenburg, Nova Scotia. Mr. Risley has home in Chester, Nova Scotia and is resident of Nova Scotia. On July 23, 1990, an assessment of $195,785.90 was made against Mr. Risley because the vessel was registered in Nova Scotia and had been used in the province. Notice of objection to the assessment was filed and eventually the matter came before the N.S. Tax Review Board. On January 14, 1991, after reviewing the provisions of the Health Services Tax Act, board member, W.J. Skinner concluded that the vessel did not have a sufficient presence in the province to attract tax under s. 7(1) of the Act. The Minister has now appealed from that decision. The only issue on the appeal is: ""Whether the Nova Scotia Tax Review Board erred in law in its interpretation of s. 7(1) of the Health Services Tax Act, R.S.N.S. 1989, c. 198, by holding that there was not sufficient presence of the yacht 'Sarah Kate' in the Province of Nova Scotia for the application of s. 7(1)."" Under s. 21(1) of the Health Services Tax Act an appeal lies from decision of the Board on any point of law raised upon the hearing of the appeal. Section 7(1) of the Health Services Tax Act, R.S.N.S. 1989, c. 198, provides as follows: ""7(1) Every person who brings into the Province or who receives delivery in the Province of tangible personal property acquired by him for value for his own consumption or use in the Province, or for the consumption or use in the Province of other persons at his expense, or on behalf of, or as agent for, principal, who desires to acquire such property for the consumption or use in the Province by such principal or other persons at his expense, shall immediately report the matter in writing to the Commissioner and supply to him the invoice and all other pertinent information as required by him in respect of the consumption or use of such property, and at the same time shall pay to Her Majesty in right of the Province the same tax in respect of the consumption or sue of such property as would have been payable if the property had been purchased at retail sale in the Province."" The appellant contends that as the vessel was brought into Nova Scotia and used in the Province it immediately became subject to the Health Services Tax Act. The respondent argues that the Province can only impose ""direct taxation within the Province"" and that temporary presence is not sufficient to raise an assessment under the Act. He relies on the decisions of the Supreme Court of Canada in R. v. Air Canada, 1980 CanLII 16 (SCC), [1980] S.C.R. 303 and Canadian Pacific Airlines v. British Columbia (1989), 1989 CanLII 94 (SCC), 59 D.L.R. (4th) 218. In the Air Canada case the issue concerned the application of The Retail Sales Tax Act, R.S.M. c.R.150 to Air Canada operations and services in through flights which did not touch down in Manitoba and in flights which landed or took off in that province. The assessment was with respect to aircraft, aircraft engines and parts consumed and services, meals and liquor, consumed or supplied in the company's aircraft. Section 3(1) of the Act provided that every purchaser of tangible personal property was required to pay tax to the province Chief Justice Laskin in delivering the judgment of the Court stated at p. 316: ""I am prepared, on this view, to assume that the Province has some legislative jurisdiction in the air space above it so that the pivotal question is whether Air Canada aircraft, engaged in overflights are 'within the Province', as this quoted phrase is used in s. 92(2) which empowers Province to impose 'direct taxation within the Province in order to the raising of revenue for provincial purposes'. Merely going through the air space over Manitoba does not give the aircraft situs there to support tax which constitutionally must be 'within the Province'. In the case of aircraft operations, there must be substantial, at least more than nominal, presence in the Province to provide basis for imposing tax in respect of the entry of aircraft into the Province."" In Canadian Pacific Airlines Ltd. v. British Columbia, 1989 CanLII 94 (SCC), 59 D.L.R. (4th) 218 the Supreme Court of Canada had to consider whether the Social Services Tax Act, R.S.B.C. 1979, c. 388 applied: ""(a) to the respondent airlines' aircraft, engines, components, parts, equipment and rotable spares (hereafter compendiously referred to as 'aircraft and parts') when used on flights that originate from, terminate in or connect two points in the province, and (b) to sales by the airlines of alcoholic beverages which are served to passengers on such flights after the aircraft is airborne and has achieved cruising speed."" Mr. Justice La Forest stated at p. 222: ""In general terms, the Social Service Tax Act of which counterpart exists in most of the provinces) imposes tax on person who purchases tangible personal property at retail sale in the province for his own consumption or use. The tax is based on percentage of the purchase price. similar tax is imposed on person who brings such property in the province for his consumption or use. In the case of the airline's aircraft and parts brought into the province, the tax, by virtue of administrative formulae not provided by statute, is applied only in respect of flights originating from, terminating in, or connecting two points in the province. According to the formulae, the tax is calculated on the percentage of miles travelled by the aircraft in provincial airspace to the total miles travelled. More specifically, s. 2(1) imposes the tax in the usual case to which the Act applies, purchase in the province. 2(1) purchaser shall pay to Her Majesty in right of the Province at the time of making the purchase tax at the rate of 4% of the purchase price of the property purchased. Section defines 'purchaser' and 'retail sale' in manner that makes it clear that the taxpayer is (minor additions apart) purchaser who purchases tangible personal property at retail sale in the province for his own use or consumption. These provisions read: 'purchaser' means person who acquires tangible personal property at sale in the Province for his own consumption or use, or for the consumption or use by other persons at his expense, or on behalf of, or as the agent for, principal who desires to acquire such property for consumption or use by that principal or other persons at his expense, and includes promotional distributor to the extent that the purchase price of the tangible personal property provided by way of promotional distribution exceeds the amount of the payment specifically made for it by the person to whom the tangible personal property is so provided; 'retail sale' means sale to purchaser for purposes of consumption or use and not for resale; Section makes provision for collecting the tax through the seller, who is deemed to be an agent of the Minister for the purpose. Rounding out the scheme is s. 2(4) which imposes similar tax on persons who reside or carry on business in the province who acquire tangible personal property outside the province. Section 2(4) imposes the tax on any such person who brings into, or receives in the province, any such property acquired by him for value for his own consumption or use. It reads as follows: 2(4) person residing or ordinarily resident or carrying on business in the Province who brings or sends into the Province or who receives delivery in the Province of tangible personal property for his own consumption or use, or for the consumption or use of other persons at his expense, or on behalf of, or as the agent for, principal who desires to acquire such property for the consumption or use by that principal or other persons at his expense, shall immediately report the matter in writing to the commissioner and supply to him all pertinent information as required by him in respect of the consumption or use of the property, and furthermore, at the same time, shall pay to Her Majesty in right of the Province tax at the rate of 4% of the purchase price of the tangible personal property."" In applying these provisions the British Columbia Court of Appeal held that if an aircraft lands, loads and unloads and performs maintenance, the airline is using aircraft in the Province and was subject to the tax under the Act. Mr. Justice La Forest stated at p. 230: ""The first issue to be determined is whether on its true construction the Act applies to the aircraft and parts. The province claims it does by virtue of s. 2(4) of the Act, which have already cited in full. That provision applies to residents, and more pertinently, to any person 'carrying on business in the Province who brings or sends into the Province or who receives delivery in the Province of tangible personal property for his own consumption or use...' [emphasis added]. Section 2(4), like other provisions in statute, must be read both in its specific context and in its context as whole. That consideration must be firmly kept in mind in considering whether the entry into the province of the aircraft and parts in the course of the operations of the airlines previously described constitutes 'bringing' or 'sending' them into province or 'receiving delivery' of them there. While would not, in the absence of detailed examination, wish to categorize the Act as being solely intended to impose retail tax payable by the ultimate consumer of the goods, there can be no doubt, as mentioned before, that this is its predominant purpose. The Act, in its general structure and intent, closely resembles the type of enactment originally approved by the courts in Atlantic Smoke Shops Ltd. v. Conlon, 1943 CanLII 372 (UK JCPC), [1943] D.L.R. 81, [1943] A.C. 550, [1943] W.W.R. 113 (P.C.), and later generalized to include all tangible personal property: see Cairns Construction Ltd. v. Government of Saskatchewan (1960), 1960 CanLII 59 (SCC), 24 D.L.R. (2d) 1, (1960] S.C.R. 619, 35 W.W.R. 241, (S.C.C.). This predominant purpose, in my view, is of considerable assistance in understanding the import of s. 2(4). Indeed, Viscount Simon L.C. in the Conlon case (p. 91) observed of similar provision that it was manifest that it was enacted merely as supplementary provision. The nature of this particular provision also argues for its interpretation in the light of the overall scheme. It is provision which, if it stood alone, might well be construed as infringing upon s. 121 of the Constitution Act, 1867 which provides that 121. All Articles of Growth, Produce, or Manufacture of any one of the Provinces shall...be admitted free into each of the other Provinces. Viscount Simon in Conlon, it is true, rather underplayed that possibility, but subsequent cases have indicated that the courts would closely scrutinize tax that in Rand J.'s words 'in its essence and purpose is related to provincial boundary': see Murphy v. C.P.R. Co. (1958), 1958 CanLII (SCC), 15 D.L.R. (2d) 145, [1958] S.C.R. 626, 77 C.R.T.C. 322 (S.C.C.), per Rand and Cartwright, JJ.; see also Comment by F.R. Scott, 12 Can. Bar. Rev. 303 (1934), at p. 308. This context, it seems to me, strongly supports the view that the general purpose of s. 2(4) is to serve as supplementary provision 'to guard against the methods of avoidance of' the purchase tax: see Viscount Simon in Conlon, at p. 91. If that view is correct, what the provision was intended to do was to prevent the evasion of the tax and consequent loss of revenue by the simple expedient of consumer purchasing goods outside the province. The provision equalizes the burden by taxing out‑of‑province purchases by provincial residents at the same rates as if the purchases had taken place in the province. The out‑of‑province purchaser pays the tax when he 'brings or sends the goods' in the province or 'receives delivery' for his use or consumption. This is confirmed, think by the words used in the provision, and especially if one considers them in connection with the purported application of the provision to the facts of this case. What think is contemplated is the bringing of purchased item into the province on permanent basis, at which time it is taxable once and for all at stated percentage of the purchase price as the provision clearly provides."" The Court concluded that the statute did not apply to the airlines aircraft and parts. We see no substantial difference between the provisions of the B.C. statute and the Nova Scotia Health Services Tax Act. In our view the reasoning in Canadian Pacific Airlines Ltd. applies to the present case. We see no error on the part of the Tax Review Board in concluding that the vessel was not subject to tax in this case. The appeal is dismissed without costs. J.A. Concurred in: Clarke, C.J.N.S.

Rhodenizer, 2003 NSPC 017 Date: 20030408 Docket: 1208549 Registry: Bridgewater Between: Her Majesty the Queen v. Lance Boyd Rhodenizer Judge: The Honourable Judge Crawford Heard: April 8, 2003, in Bridgewater, Nova Scotia Written Decision: May 14, 2003 Counsel: Franceen Romney, for the Crown Alan Ferrier, for the Defence By the Court: [1] The defendant has made an application for the exclusion of evidence found following a search conducted at his residence pursuant to a warrant issued by fax from the Justice of the Peace Centre in Dartmouth, N.S. [2] The defendant argues: (1) that the information to obtain the warrant did not meet the test in R. v. Debot, 1989 CanLII 13 (SCC), [1989] 2 S.C.R. 1140, and therefore that the warrant should not have issued; (2) that the search was therefore warrantless, breached his Charter s. right to be free from unreasonable search and seizure, and that evidence obtained by it should be excluded under s. 24(2) of the Charter of Rights and Freedoms. [3] The grounds stated in the Information to Obtain were: THAT on June 5th, 2002 the informant received information from reliable source (SOURCE #1), that Lance Rhodenizer of 196 High St., Apr. #2 of Bridgewater was selling marihuana for $13.00 gram. He also had magic mushrooms for $10.00 gram, and mescaline for sale. The source advised if person purchased gram of marihuana and mushrooms, the cost was $22.00 total. The informant also stated he/she had purchased marihuana from Mr. Rhodenizer in the past and that Mr. Rhodenizer purchases his narcotics from the city. This source has provided information to the informant in the past that has resulted in charges of possession for the purpose of trafficking and straight possession of marihuana under the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act. THAT on June 20th, 2002, S/Cst. Laliberte of the Bridgewater Police Department spoke to male (SOURCE #2) who wanted to remain anonymous. This person stated there was lot of traffic going to the basement apartment at 196 High Street. He also stated there was strong smell of marihuana coming from this apartment. The informant knows this location to be Mr. Rhodenizer’s apartment. THAT on July 2nd, 2002, the Bridgewater Police dispatch received an anonymous complaint from female (SOURCE #3) that Lance Rhodenizer of 196 High Street, Apt. #2 was selling and using drugs from his residence. This female also provided police with some of the vehicle plates that were attending the residence on regular occasions. THAT on July 9th, 2002, the informant and D/Cst. Feener spoke to confidential informant (SOURCE #4) with unknown reliability. He/she stated Mr. Rhodenizer was selling marihuana from his apartment. He/she also stated sometimes Rhodenizer has more than just marihuana for sale. He/she said there was lot of people coming to the apartment staying for brief periods of time (approximately 10 minutes). THAT on July 9th, 2002 D/Cst. Feener of the Bridgewater Police Department checked the Town’s water billing books and found the water bill for 196 High Street Apt #2 was in the name of Lance Rhodenizer. THAT on the 10th and 11th of July, 2002, the informant and D/Cst. Feener of the Bridgewater Police Department conducted surveillance on 196 High Street, the building in which Mr. Rhodenizer resides. Over an approximate two hour time period each night, high volume of car and pedestrian traffic was noted coming and going from the apartment building. This building has six rental units total. The individuals coming and going were noted to enter and leave the building within to 10 minutes and were noted to enter by the front entrance and go downstairs. There are two apartments located downstairs from the main entrance. Mr. Rhodenizer’s residence is one of these two units. THAT on the 11th of July, 2002, the informant spoke to reliable source (source #1) who advised he/she had purchased cannabis (marihuana) within the previous 48 hours at the residence of Lance Rhodenizer. THAT on the 16th of July, 2001[sic], the informant spoke to reliable source (source #1) who advised he/she had purchased cannabis (marihuana) within the previous 48 hours from Lance Rhodenizer. [4] D/Cst. Collyer, the informant in the Information to Obtain, testified in support of the warrant and was closely cross-examined by defence counsel. [5] In summary, the defendant points to the following flaws revealed by cross-examination: 1. Source #1, although stated to be reliable, had never given information which resulted in conviction. 2. Source #2 was anonymous and therefore of unknown reliability. Cst. Collyer was unable to state with certainty whether the ""informant"" referred to in the last sentence of the second paragraph referred to source #2 or to himself. It is therefore unclear whether the source knew the apartment belonged to the defendant; if not, he may have been speaking about the other basement apartment at 196 High Street. 3. Source #3 was also anonymous and therefore of unknown reliability, although Cst. Collyer deemed her information reliable because it provided corroboration for other sources. 4. Source #4's reliability was unknown; no specific dates were given. 5. The fact that on July D/Cst. Feener had to obtain the defendant's apartment number from town records makes it doubtful that the sources referred to in paragraphs 1-4 actually supplied that information; it appears more likely that at least part of the address given in those paragraphs was supplied by D/Cst. Collyer's later knowledge. D/Cst. Collyer was unable to state whether or not this was so. 6. The surveillance conducted on July 10th and 11th was ineffective in distinguishing which of the two basement apartments in the building was attracting the traffic. 7. Source #1 did not state whether the marihuana purchased from the defendant's residence on July 11 was bought from the defendant personally or from someone else at that address. 8. As to paragraph 8, D/Cst. Collyer stated that ""2001"" was typographical error and that the information was received on July 16th, 2002. He admitted that this was not questioned by the Justice of the Peace. He also admitted that there was no indication as to where the purchase from the defendant took place. 9. Generally he stated that he kept no notes regarding the contacts referred to in his Information and relied on receipts from paid informants to remember relevant dates, which was the practice at that time. He states that now notes are kept. He also confirmed that he had not spoken personally to the Justice of the Peace and that the only information on which she issued the warrant was what was contained in his written Information. Should the warrant have issued? [6] The Supreme Court of Canada set out the role of judge in reviewing the issuance of warrant in R. v. Araujo 2000 SCC 65 (CanLII), [2000] S.C.R. 992 as follows: 51 The reviewing judge does not stand in the same place and function as the authorizing judge. He or she does not conduct rehearing of the application [page1017] for the wiretap. This is the starting place for any reviewing judge, as our Court stated in Garofoli, supra, at p. 1452: The reviewing judge does not substitute his or her view for that of the authorizing judge. If, based on the record which was before the authorizing judge as amplified on the review, the reviewing judge concludes that the authorizing judge could have granted the authorization, then he or she should not interfere. In this process, the existence of fraud, non-disclosure, misleading evidence and new evidence are all relevant, but, rather than being prerequisite to review, their sole impact is to determine whether there continues to be any basis for the decision of the authorizing judge. [Emphasis added.] As noted as judge at the Quebec Court of Appeal in Hiscock, supra, at p. 326 C.C.C., even basis that is schematic in nature may suffice. However, as our Court has recognized, it must be basis founded on reliable information. In R. v. Bisson, 1994 CanLII 46 (SCC), [1994] S.C.R. 1097, at p. 1098, the requirement was described as ""sufficient reliable information to support an authorization"" (emphasis added). The Court concluded that this requirement had still been met despite the excision of retracted testimony. In looking for reliable information on which the authorizing judge could have granted the authorization, the question is simply whether there was at least some evidence that might reasonably be believed on the basis of which the authorization could have issued. 53 Other appellate court jurisprudence confirms this understanding. In the context of reviewing search warrant, appellate courts have looked to whether the authorization could have issued: e.g., Mitton v. British Columbia Securities Commission (1999), 1999 BCCA 186 (CanLII), 123 B.C.A.C. 263; R. v. Allain (1998), 1998 CanLII 12250 (NB CA), 205 N.B.R. (2d) 201 (C.A.), at p. 217; and R. v. Krist (1998), 1998 CanLII 6105 (BC CA), 113 B.C.A.C. 176, at p. 179. But they look at this in context. For example, in R. v. Monroe (1997), 1997 CanLII 3034 (BC CA), C.R. (5th) 324 (B.C.C.A.), at p. 333, Esson J.A. stated that, after looking for whether there was sufficient grounds on which the judge could have authorized warrant, ""The judge was then required to assess the evidence placed before the justice, in the light of the evidence brought out at trial, in order to determine whether, after expunging any misleading or erroneous information, sufficient reliable information remained to support the warrant"" (emphasis added). 54 The authorities stress the importance of contextual analysis. The Nova Scotia Court of Appeal, while reviewing the cases from our Court cited above, explains this in judgment dealing with problems arising out of errors committed in good faith by the police in the material submitted to the authorizing justice of the peace: An approach based on looking for sufficient reliable information in the totality of the circumstances appropriately balances the need for judicial finality and the need to protect prior authorization systems. Again, the test is whether there was reliable evidence that might reasonably be believed on the basis of which the authorization could have issued, not whether in the opinion of the reviewing judge, the application should have been granted at all by the authorizing judge. [7] In other words, rather than subjecting the Information to Obtain to paragraph by paragraph dissection, should look at it as whole and decide whether there was sufficient reliable evidence which might reasonably have been believed by the Justice of the Peace on which she could have issued the warrant. [8] In this process, should apply the test and criteria set out in R. v. Debot, 1989 CanLII 13 (SCC), [1989] S.C.R. 1140: ¶53 In my view, there are at least three concerns to be addressed in weighing evidence relied on by the police to justify warrantless search. First, was the information predicting the commission of criminal offence compelling? Second, where that information was based on ""tip"" originating from source outside the police, was that source credible? Finally, was the information corroborated by police investigation prior to making the decision to conduct the search? do not suggest that each of these factors forms separate test. Rather, concur with Martin J.A.'s view that the ""totality of the circumstances"" must meet the standard of reasonableness. Weaknesses in one area may, to some extent, be compensated by strengths in the other two. [9] Looking first at the nature of the evidence, over all I find that it was compelling. Noting the progression of dates in each succeeding paragraph of the Information, accept D/Cst. Collyer’s testimony, and find that it is reasonable to conclude, that the year “2001"" in the penultimate paragraph was typographical error and was intended to read ""2002"". So four apparently separate and independent sources over the month and a half prior to the warrant application all confirmed, with varying amounts of detail, either that the defendant was selling drugs or that drugs were being sold or used at his apartment, or both. There was therefore evidence on which the Justice of the Peace could conclude that this was continuing activity and that it was on-going at the date of the warrant application. [10] In regard to the credibility of the sources, although individually none of these sources was of known or proven reliability, collectively they reinforce and confirm each other. [11] Finally the police did not seek a warrant on the basis of this information alone, but conducted surveillance, which corroborated the information provided by their sources. To suggest that the traffic could have been going to the other basement apartment is to propose level of coincidence that is highly improbable in the light of the information provided by the four sources. Conclusion [12] I find that there was sufficient reliable evidence to constitute the reasonable and probable grounds for issuance of this warrant. In doing so, note that the standard of proof for issuance of warrant is reasonable and probable grounds, which must be more than mere suspicion, but is considerably less than proof beyond reasonable doubt or even proof on balance of probabilities. [13] Having found that the warrant was properly issued and that the search therefore met the standard in Charter s. 8, need not consider s. 24(2).",8_2003nspc17.txt,"The defendant applied to have evidence found during a search of his premises excluded on the basis that the search warrant was invalid.
Application dismissed;

504,"The arbitration panel was constituted to resolve commercial contractual dispute between HAL and the respondent, SecurTek Monitoring Solutions Inc. [SecurTek].
[2] For reasons that follow, I have determined that HAL’s application for leave must be dismissed.
[5] The relevant portions of the IDSL dealing with cancellation or termination of the contract read as follows: 2.2 The term of the licence granted under this Agreement shall commence upon execution of this Agreement by SecurTek and shall continue thereafter for period of three (3) years.
This agreement shall automatically renew unless either party cancels in writing at least sixty (60) days prior to the renewal date.
8.2 This Agreement may be terminated at any time upon one hundred and eighty (180) days written notice by either party.
Both parties agree to make reasonable commercial efforts to ensure any subsequent transition following termination is effectively concluded with minimal disruption.
[9] The IDSL contained clause relating to the minimum sales target that SecurTek was required to meet in order to maintain its exclusive distribution right.
SecurTek shall at HAL’s discretion lose exclusive distribution rights herein for failure to reach this goal.
Said AA rules shall be modified as follows: no in person hearings shall be required with all hearings via telephone unless both parties agree otherwise; discovery shall be limited to 30 requests total; Each party will file single brief outlining its point of view and submitting any facts; said brief may be no longer than ten (10) pages double spaced with one (1) inch margins, eleven (11) point times new roman font; the factual attachments, table of contents, authorities shall not be part of said ten (10) pages.
The arbitrators’ decision shall be final without any possibility of appeal other then (sic) on the issues of whether this arbitration clause is valid.
The arbitration shall be expedited and must be concluded within sixty (60) days.
[21] It is clear that these contracts are “arbitration agreements”, within the meaning of ss.
(2) If the arbitration agreement does not provide that the parties may appeal an award to the court on question of law, party may appeal an award to the court on question of law with leave, which the court shall grant only if it is satisfied that: (a) the importance to the parties of the matters at stake in the arbitration justifies an appeal; and (b) determination of the question of law at issue will significantly affect the rights of the parties.
The use of the words “final and binding” demonstrates that the parties have made the choice to resolve disputes through the expeditious process of arbitration; choice which reflects an intention to avoid the prospect of potentially protracted and costly litigation, even if it means there is chance they will be bound by an unfavourable decision from the arbitrator.
It says that the “arbitrators’ decision shall be final without any possibility of appeal”, save for on the question of whether the arbitration clause itself is valid.
It leads me to conclude that the absence of reference to any other circumstances in which appeal would be permitted was not inadvertent, but intentional.
It is fair to say that the terms of contract cannot always be confined to those expressly stated, and each case must be decided on its own facts and circumstances.
[32] Furthermore, term should generally not be implied where it is inconsistent with the express terms of the contract: M.J.B.
In the context of this case, the contractual language the parties used is clear: they intended to resolve disputes by way of final and binding arbitration.
They clearly stipulated that such resolution would not be subject to appeal, unless there was question of validity of the arbitration clause itself.
[40] Section 45(2) provides that leave to appeal an arbitrators’ decision may be granted only on questions of law.
He wrote: 50 With respect for the contrary view, am of the opinion that the historical approach should be abandoned.
It reflects the role of courts of appeal in ensuring the consistency of the law, rather than in providing new forum for parties to continue their private litigation.
Of course, it is not easy to say precisely where the line should be drawn; though in most cases it should be sufficiently clear whether the dispute is over general proposition that might qualify as principle of law or over very particular set of circumstances that is not apt to be of much interest to judges and lawyers in the future.
These principles also weigh in favour of deference to first instance decision-makers on points of contractual interpretation.
Given that our legal system leaves broad scope to tribunals of first instance to resolve issues of limited application, this supports treating contractual interpretation as question of mixed fact and law.
54 However, courts should be cautious in identifying extricable questions of law in disputes over contractual interpretation.
Where the legal principle is not readily extricable, then the matter is one of “mixed law and fact” .... [para.
36] [43] However, it is important to note that the mere fact that an arbitrators’ decision dealt with matter of contractual interpretation does not inevitably mean that the issues involved are questions of mixed fact and law, rather than questions of law.
Courts must be vigilant in distinguishing between party alleging that legal test may have been altered in the course of its application (an extricable question of law; Sattva, at para.
In consequence, characterizing the nature of the specific question before the court requires delicate consideration of the narrow issue actually in dispute.
[45] This also applies to HAL’s argument that the majority erred in law by failing to consider the effect of the termination clause of the contract.
[46] Accordingly, HAL’s proposed grounds of appeal do not raise a pure issue of law.
Even if I had found that HAL and SecurTek had not contracted out of s. 45(2) of the Act, HAL’s application for leave to appeal would have to be dismissed on that basis.","HELD: The application for leave to appeal was dismissed.
The court found that a term permitting an appeal from an arbitrator’s decision on an error of law did not fall into the category of the obvious and was not the same as an implied term, such as that of good workmanship in contracts for repair.
The contractual language used by the parties was clear that they intended to resolve disputes by final and binding arbitration.
Even if it had found that the parties had not contracted out of s. 45(2) of the Act, the application for leave would have been dismissed because the proposed grounds of appeal did not raise a pure issue of law.",404,"QUEEN’S BENCH FOR SASKATCHEWAN Citation: 2017 SKQB 249 Date: 2017 08 22 Docket: QBG 1409 of 2017 Judicial Centre: Regina BETWEEN: HOME AUTOMATED LIVING, INC. and SECURTEK MONITORING SOLUTIONS INC. Counsel: Breanna Mussell for the applicant Stephanie Yang for the respondent JUDGMENT KALMAKOFF J. August 22, 2017 INTRODUCTION [1] This is an application by Home Automated Living, Inc. [HAL], seeking leave to appeal the decision of an arbitration panel. The arbitration panel was constituted to resolve commercial contractual dispute between HAL and the respondent, SecurTek Monitoring Solutions Inc. [SecurTek]. [2] For reasons that follow, I have determined that HAL’s application for leave must be dismissed. FACTUAL BACKGROUND [3] HAL and SecurTek had contractual relationship which began in February of 2008. HAL produces software, technology and services related to home automation. SecurTek, Sasktel subsidiary, wanted to have the exclusive right to market, licence and distribute HAL’s products in Canada. Accordingly, the parties entered into three separate contracts designed to accomplish those business goals. They were (i) the International Distribution and Software Licence Agreement [IDSL]; (ii) the Software Customization Agreement [SCA] and (iii) the Escrow and Software Modification Agreement [ESMA]. These contracts each provided, among other things, that any disputes which could not be resolved between the parties would be settled by binding arbitration. [4] The IDSL was the primary operating agreement or contract between HAL and SecurTek. It was signed for three year term, and was automatically renewed for successive three year terms, unless either party cancelled the contract, in writing, at least 60 days prior to the renewal date. [5] The relevant portions of the IDSL dealing with cancellation or termination of the contract read as follows: 2.2 The term of the licence granted under this Agreement shall commence upon execution of this Agreement by SecurTek and shall continue thereafter for period of three (3) years. This agreement shall automatically renew unless either party cancels in writing at least sixty (60) days prior to the renewal date. SecurTek may terminate this Agreement for cause. This licence may be terminated by HAL for cause. SecurTek agrees upon termination of this Agreement to return the HALhms and all documentation together with all copies in any form in its possession. For cause shall be defined as either party not complying with the terms and conditions found in this agreement. 8.1 The term of this Agreement shall be from February 22, 2008 and continue in accordance with 2.2 herein. 8.2 This Agreement may be terminated at any time upon one hundred and eighty (180) days written notice by either party. Both parties agree to make reasonable commercial efforts to ensure any subsequent transition following termination is effectively concluded with minimal disruption. [6] It is clear from the wording of those provisions that there were three options for terminating the IDSL: (1) by giving notice 60 days prior to the renewal date, (i.e. 60 days prior to February 21, 2011, or February 21, 2014, etc.); (2) at any time, for cause; and (3) in other circumstances, by giving 180 days notice. [7] In this case, the agreement between the parties reached the renewal date in February of 2011 without incident, so the IDSL was automatically renewed for second three-year period. [8] In July of 2012, the parties executed contract that modified the IDSL. It was titled Modification to the International Distribution and Software Licence Agreement [MIDSL]. As one would gather from the title, it modified portions of the IDSL. [9] The IDSL contained clause relating to the minimum sales target that SecurTek was required to meet in order to maintain its exclusive distribution right. It read as follows: 4.3 Minimum sales SecurTek Agrees that it must make an average of at least 25 sales of the HALhms per month over each quarterly period in order to maintain an exclusive distribution right. SecurTek shall at HAL’s discretion lose exclusive distribution rights herein for failure to reach this goal. [10] The MIDSL, which the parties executed on July 9, 2012 amended the minimum sales requirement in clause 4.3, by substituting the following provision: 4.3 Minimum sales SecurTek Agrees that it must make 25 new sales of the HALhms per month in order to maintain exclusive distribution rights granted herein, or purchase the equivalent in new pre-paid licences of HALhms. [11] Eventually, dispute arose. The licences referred to in clause 4.3 sold for $1,000.00 each. HAL took the position that clause 4.3, as it appeared in the MIDSL, required SecurTek to pay HAL minimum of $25,000.00 per month, regardless of how many licences SecurTek actually sold. SecurTek took the position that, if it failed to sell 25 licences, it simply lost the right to exclusive distribution, rather than being obligated to pay HAL for 25 licences regardless of how many were sold. HAL alleged that SecurTek was not meeting its sales obligations, and demanded payment of the shortfall. [12] SecurTek eventually gave notice to HAL, on December 13, 2013, that it would not be renewing the agreements at the end of the three year term which expired on February 21, 2014. [13] HAL took the position that SecurTek breached the contract by failing to comply with the term regarding payment for licencing fees, and also that SecurTek failed to properly terminate the contract, thus making it liable for any products received from HAL that were not paid for. [14] Accordingly, as per the terms of the contracts, an arbitration panel was constituted, and appointed to resolve the dispute. [15] The arbitration panel, in 2-1 decision, ruled that the IDSL, as amended by the MIDSL, did not impose an obligation on SecurTek to purchase set number of licences from HAL. Accordingly, HAL’s claim was dismissed. [16] SecurTek also counter-claimed against HAL. The majority of the panel ruled that, given its disposition of HAL’s claim, the counter-claim was moot and, in any event, did not prove that SecurTek had suffered any damages. SecurTek takes no issue with this finding. POSITION OF THE PARTIES [17] HAL argues that leave to appeal the arbitrators’ decision should be granted, because it is proposing to appeal on the basis of errors in law in the arbitration panel’s majority decision. HAL takes the position that the agreements signed with SecurTek, although not specifically referring to right of appeal on such basis, contain an implied condition that permits the parties to appeal arbitrators’ decisions, with leave, on the basis of errors in law. As such, HAL says that s. 45(2) of The Arbitration Act, 1992, SS 1992, A-24.1 [Act] permits the application, and that it has met the criteria to be granted leave. [18] SecurTek argues that leave to appeal should not be granted, for number of reasons. First, it argues that its contracts with HAL contain dispute resolution mechanism (final and binding arbitration) which “contracts out” of s. 45(2) of the Act. As such, HAL cannot seek leave to appeal. In the alternative, if the right to seek leave to appeal is not abrogated by the language of the contracts, SecurTek argues that the questions HAL proposes to raise on appeal are questions of mixed law and fact, rather than questions of law, and even if they are questions of law, they are not of sufficient importance to compel the court to grant leave under s. 45(2). 1. HAL cannot seek leave to appeal, because HAL and SecurTek explicitly “contracted out” of any right to appeal decisions of the arbitration panel. [19] In this case, the relationship between HAL and SecurTek was governed by contracts. Those contracts set out very clear and well-defined procedures for dispute resolution. In fact, the IDSL, SCA and ESMA all contained identical clauses in that respect. Under the heading “Arbitration”, at Clause 26, the IDSL reads as follows: 26.1. The parties agree that they will use their best efforts to amicably resolve any dispute arising out of or relating to this Agreement. The parties shall meet and discuss any disputes prior to the initiation of an arbitration and shall grant the alleged wrong doer an opportunity (30 day minimum) to cure any defects. 26.2 Any controversy, claim or dispute that cannot be so resolved shall be settled by final and binding arbitration in accordance with the expedited rules of the American Arbitration Association (AAA), however the AAA’s services shall not be used, and judgment upon the award rendered by the arbitrator or arbitrators may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof. Said AA rules shall be modified as follows: no in person hearings shall be required with all hearings via telephone unless both parties agree otherwise; discovery shall be limited to 30 requests total; Each party will file single brief outlining its point of view and submitting any facts; said brief may be no longer than ten (10) pages double spaced with one (1) inch margins, eleven (11) point times new roman font; the factual attachments, table of contents, authorities shall not be part of said ten (10) pages. 26.3. Any such arbitration shall be conducted through the use of briefs only and at the discretion of the arbitrators there may be telephonic hearings. In person hearings shall not be allowed. Each party may make one set of each type of discovery request and one dispositive motion. There shall be three arbitrators where each party shall choose one arbitrator and those two arbitrators shall choose the third who shall be in charge of the panel. No Court shall have subject matter jurisdiction over this matter until after the arbitrators has (sic) rendered reasoned opinion. The arbitrators’ decision shall be final without any possibility of appeal other then (sic) on the issues of whether this arbitration clause is valid. The arbitration shall be expedited and must be concluded within sixty (60) days. [Emphasis Added] [20] Clauses 26.1, 26.2 and 26.3 of the SCA, and clauses 5.1, 5.2 and 5.3 of the ESMA, respectively, contain identical wording. [21] It is clear that these contracts are “arbitration agreements”, within the meaning of ss. 2(a) and of the Act. Section 45 of the Act deals with appeals from decisions of arbitrators in such circumstances. It reads, in part, as follows: 45(1) If the arbitration agreement so provides, party may appeal an award to the court on question of law, on question of fact or on question of mixed law and fact by notice of motion that briefly states the grounds of the appeal. (2) If the arbitration agreement does not provide that the parties may appeal an award to the court on question of law, party may appeal an award to the court on question of law with leave, which the court shall grant only if it is satisfied that: (a) the importance to the parties of the matters at stake in the arbitration justifies an appeal; and (b) determination of the question of law at issue will significantly affect the rights of the parties. [22] In the circumstances of this case, s. 45(1) of the Act does not give HAL the right to appeal the decision of the arbitration panel, because the agreements in place between HAL and SecurTek do not provide for right of appeal. [23] The question is whether s. 45(2) permits HAL to obtain leave to appeal on question of law, notwithstanding the absence of such provision in the agreements. HAL takes the position that this section provides the ability to obtain leave. SecurTek, on the other hand, argues that while s. 45(2) may permit parties to obtain leave to appeal in some cases, it does not apply here, because the parties intentionally “contracted out” of it. [24] Section of the Act provides that parties to an arbitration agreement may agree, expressly or by implication, to vary or exclude any provisions of the Act (subject to certain exceptions which are not applicable to this case). It is trite law that parties who have commercial contractual relationship, which contains an arbitration agreement for dispute resolution, can, by agreement, abrogate appellate review of the arbitrator’s decision: Bank of Nova Scotia Span West Farms Ltd., 2003 SKQB 306 (CanLII), 237 Sask 175; Chypiska Aspen Homes Ltd., 2010 SKQB 376 (CanLII), 365 Sask 160. In Labourers' International Union of North America, Local 183 Carpenters and Allied Workers Local 27 (1997), 1997 CanLII 1429 (ON CA), 34 OR (3d) 472 (WL) (Ont CA) the court noted at paras. 22-23 that “final and binding” clauses, such as the ones used in the agreements between HAL and SecurTek, while not necessarily precluding judicial review, certainly reflect an intention to exclude all rights of appeal, even those conferred by statute. [25] Parties to contract can, in essence, agree to structure dispute resolution mechanisms in any fashion they want. This may include eliminating statutory appeals. As read the relevant jurisprudence, where the language used in the agreement between parties is clear and precise, and indicates clear intention on their part to treat the decision of an arbitrator as final and binding, the balance tips very heavily in favour of finding that the parties intended to eliminate any ability to appeal from the arbitrator’s decision. The use of the words “final and binding” demonstrates that the parties have made the choice to resolve disputes through the expeditious process of arbitration; choice which reflects an intention to avoid the prospect of potentially protracted and costly litigation, even if it means there is chance they will be bound by an unfavourable decision from the arbitrator. [26] In this case, the language used in the agreements between HAL and SecurTek, in my view, could not be more clear. It says that the “arbitrators’ decision shall be final without any possibility of appeal”, save for on the question of whether the arbitration clause itself is valid. It is obvious from the wording of the clause that the parties had turned their minds to the question of dispute resolution, and intended that the arbitrators’ decision would not be subject to appeal, except on that very narrow issue. There is simply no other reasonable interpretation of such wording. [27] Furthermore, the fact that the parties referred to one, and only one, specific instance in which an appeal would be permissible is significant. It leads me to conclude that the absence of reference to any other circumstances in which appeal would be permitted was not inadvertent, but intentional. If the parties had intended, for instance, to allow an appeal from the arbitrators’ decision based on an error of law, they could easily have said that in the agreements. They did not. Therefore, must conclude that they had no intention to permit an appeal on that basis. [28] For the same reason, reject HAL’s argument that the ability of the parties to appeal an arbitrators’ decision based on an error of law must be implied as term of the contract. It is fair to say that the terms of contract cannot always be confined to those expressly stated, and each case must be decided on its own facts and circumstances. The context and background of contract should always be carefully considered, along with the precise terms written into it, when considering whether it is appropriate to find an implied term. [29] The general presumption in contractual interpretation is that parties have expressed every material term which they intended to govern their agreement: Benfield Corporate Risk Canada Ltd. Beaufort International Insurance Inc., 2013 ABCA 200 (CanLII), [2014] WWR 772. Generally speaking, as the Supreme Court of Canada noted in Canadian Pacific Hotels Bank of Montreal, 1987 CanLII 55 (SCC), [1987] SCR 711, terms of contract may be implied where such terms (i) are necessary to give business efficacy to contract (i.e., they are terms which the parties would obviously have assumed to be part of the contract); (ii) can be implied as matter of custom or usage (which requires evidence that the parties would have understood such custom or usage to be applicable); or (iii) can be implied as legal incidents of particular class or kind of contract (i.e. terms implied in law). [30] The court can imply terms that are in the nature of things that “it goes without saying”, and are necessary to give business efficacy to the transaction: Highwood Distillers Ltd. Panorama Public Industrial Communications Ltd., 2005 ABCA 107 (CanLII) at para 13, 363 AR 239. The implication of the term must have certain degree of obviousness to it, and if there is evidence of contrary intention on the part of either party, the implied term may not be found: M.J.B. Enterprises Ltd. Defence Construction (1951) Ltd., 1999 CanLII 677 (SCC), [1999] SCR 619 [M.J.B. Enterprises]. While it is clear that there are some cases in which term must be implied in order to ensure that the intention of the parties is not defeated, the court does not have licence to reconstruct contract on equitable principles, or from the point of view of what the parties should reasonably have contemplated. [31] With the greatest of respect to the position advanced by HAL, a term permitting an appeal from the arbitrators’ decision on an error of law simply does not fall into the category of the obvious, or something that “it goes without saying”, in the factual matrix of this case. Such an implied term is not akin, for instance, to the implied term of good faith in contractual negotiation, or the implied term of good workmanship in contracts for repair or renovation work, or the implied term of reasonable notice of termination in contracts of employment. [32] Furthermore, term should generally not be implied where it is inconsistent with the express terms of the contract: M.J.B. Enterprises; Fort Frances (Town) Boise Cascade Canada Ltd., 1983 CanLII 47 (SCC), [1983] SCR 171. In the context of this case, the contractual language the parties used is clear: they intended to resolve disputes by way of final and binding arbitration. They clearly stipulated that such resolution would not be subject to appeal, unless there was question of validity of the arbitration clause itself. Implying term which would permit an appeal based on an error unrelated to the validity of the arbitration clause would be inconsistent with the express terms of the contract. Accordingly, can see no basis upon which to imply an additional term, such as the right to appeal from an error of law made by the arbitrator. [33] Finally, on this point, HAL has argued that the terms of the arbitration agreement were altered by correspondence of counsel. Correspondence, it says, which effectively nullified the “final and binding” nature of the arbitration clauses. In particular, HAL points to the exchange of correspondence between Will Egan (counsel for SecurTek at the time) and Robert MacKay (counsel for HAL at the time). This correspondence, as read it, was in the vein of setting out the procedures to be followed during the arbitration. Questions of what material would be filed for the arbitration panel to consider, timing, and governing law were addressed. In that regard, Mr. Egan’s letter to Mr. MacKay, dated May 5, 2014, ended with the following: 5. The governing law is to be the Province of Saskatchewan. 6. Arbitrators’ decision will be final. [34] To that, Mr. MacKay responded with letter dated September 8, 2014. He proposed slightly different procedure, with slightly different timelines than did Mr. Egan, but ended his letter with the following: Generally, the contract shall govern, then the rules provided by the American Arbitration Association then the laws of the province of Saskatchewan. [35] In response to that, on September 11, 2014, Mr. Egan wrote: have reviewed your letter outlining the proposed procedures and forms and can advise that they are acceptable to SecurTek. [36] HAL argues that because Mr. Egan’s first proposal included the words “Arbitrators decision will be final”, and Mr. MacKay’s response did not specifically agree to that term, but instead said “Generally the contract shall govern…”, should conclude that HAL was not agreeing to the finality of the arbitrators’ decision and, as such, cannot be taken to have abrogated its right to appeal. [37] With respect, cannot accede to this argument. The language of the agreements, in my view, is so clear with respect to the arbitration clauses, and the finality of the arbitrators’ decision, that it cannot be overridden by vagueness or inadvertent omission. The intention expressed in the arbitration clauses of the agreement is clear, and it would take an equally clear statement to convey different intention. Furthermore, the final sentence of Mr. MacKay’s letter says “[g]enerally the contract shall govern” (emphasis added) and, as have repeated several times, the contract was very clear about the finality of the arbitrators’ decision and the very limited nature of potential appeals. [38] Accordingly, find that the provisions of the agreement between the parties (the IDSL, the SCA, and the ESMA) exclude the right of appeal on questions of law, pursuant to s. 45(2) of the Act. HAL cannot appeal the arbitrators’ decision, and the application must be dismissed. 2. HAL’s appeal would not be permitted by s. 45(2) in any event, because it raises question of mixed law and fact, rather than question of law. [39] My finding on the first issue is dispositive of the application, but even if my conclusion in that respect had been different, would still not have granted HAL’s application for leave. That is because the issues upon which HAL seeks leave to appeal are questions of mixed fact and law, not pure questions of law. [40] Section 45(2) provides that leave to appeal an arbitrators’ decision may be granted only on questions of law. It does not permit appeals on questions of fact, or questions of mixed fact and law. This distinction is one of significance. The scope of appeals permitted by arbitration legislation is narrow, because arbitration is intended to be complete alternate dispute resolution mechanism, rather than simply an extra layer of litigation: Student Assn. of the British Columbia Institute of Technology British Columbia Institute of Technology, 2000 BCCA 496 (CanLII), [2000] 10 WWR 256; Boxer Capital Corp. JEL Investments Ltd., 2015 BCCA 24 (CanLII), [2015] WWR 481 [Boxer Capital]. [41] Questions of law are questions about what the correct legal test is. Factual questions are questions about what actually took place between the parties. Mixed questions are questions about whether the facts satisfy the legal test. In other words, they involve applying legal standard to set of facts: Teal Cedar Products Ltd. British Columbia, 2017 SCC 32 (CanLII) at para 43 [Teal]; Canada (Director of Investigation and Research) Southam Inc., 1997 CanLII 385 (SCC), [1997] [42] Questions of contractual interpretation are almost always regarded as questions of mixed fact and law: Boxer Capital at para 9. In Sattva Capital Corp. Creston Moly Corp., 2014 SCC 53 (CanLII), [2014] SCR 633 [Sattva] Justice Rothstein made this point very clearly. He wrote: 50 With respect for the contrary view, am of the opinion that the historical approach should be abandoned. Contractual interpretation involves issues of mixed fact and law as it is an exercise in which the principles of contractual interpretation are applied to the words of the written contract, considered in light of the factual matrix. 51 The purpose of the distinction between questions of law and those of mixed fact and law further supports this conclusion. One central purpose of drawing distinction between questions of law and those of mixed fact and law is to limit the intervention of appellate courts to cases where the results can be expected to have an impact beyond the parties to the particular dispute. It reflects the role of courts of appeal in ensuring the consistency of the law, rather than in providing new forum for parties to continue their private litigation. For this reason, Southam Inc. identified the degree of generality (or “precedential value”) as the key difference between question of law and question of mixed fact and law. The more narrow the rule, the less useful will be the intervention of the court of appeal: If court were to decide that driving at certain speed on certain road under certain conditions was negligent, its decision would not have any great value as precedent. In short, as the level of generality of the challenged proposition approaches utter particularity, the matter approaches pure application, and hence draws nigh to being an unqualified question of mixed law and fact. See R. P. Kerans, Standards of Review Employed by Appellate Courts (1994), at pp. 103-108. Of course, it is not easy to say precisely where the line should be drawn; though in most cases it should be sufficiently clear whether the dispute is over general proposition that might qualify as principle of law or over very particular set of circumstances that is not apt to be of much interest to judges and lawyers in the future. [para. 37] 52 Similarly, this Court in Housen found that deference to fact-finders promoted the goals of limiting the number, length, and cost of appeals, and of promoting the autonomy and integrity of trial proceedings (paras. 16-17). These principles also weigh in favour of deference to first instance decision-makers on points of contractual interpretation. The legal obligations arising from contract are, in most cases, limited to the interest of the particular parties. Given that our legal system leaves broad scope to tribunals of first instance to resolve issues of limited application, this supports treating contractual interpretation as question of mixed fact and law. 53 Nonetheless, it may be possible to identify an extricable question of law from within what was initially characterized as question of mixed fact and law (Housen, at paras. 31 and 34-35). Legal errors made in the course of contractual interpretation include “the application of an incorrect principle, the failure to consider required element of legal test, or the failure to consider relevant factor” (King, at para. 21). Moreover, there is no question that many other issues in contract law do engage substantive rules of law: the requirements for the formation of the contract, the capacity of the parties, the requirement that certain contracts be evidenced in writing, and so on. 54 However, courts should be cautious in identifying extricable questions of law in disputes over contractual interpretation. Given the statutory requirement to identify question of law in leave application pursuant to s. 31(2) of the AA, the applicant for leave and its counsel will seek to frame any alleged errors as questions of law. The legislature has sought to restrict such appeals, however, and courts must be careful to ensure that the proposed ground of appeal has been properly characterized. The warning expressed in Housen to exercise caution in attempting to extricate question of law is relevant here: Appellate courts must be cautious, however, in finding that trial judge erred in law in his or her determination of negligence, as it is often difficult to extricate the legal questions from the factual. It is for this reason that these matters are referred to as questions of “mixed law and fact”. Where the legal principle is not readily extricable, then the matter is one of “mixed law and fact” .... [para. 36] [43] However, it is important to note that the mere fact that an arbitrators’ decision dealt with matter of contractual interpretation does not inevitably mean that the issues involved are questions of mixed fact and law, rather than questions of law. As Justice Gascon noted, in Teal, while questions involving application of facts are not always mixed questions, the court must be careful to maintain the proper distinction. At paras. 44-47 he wrote: 44 That said, while the application of legal test to set of facts is mixed question, if, in the course of that application, the underlying legal test may have been altered, then legal question arises. For example, if party alleges that judge (or arbitrator) while applying legal test failed to consider required element of that test, that party alleges that the judge (or arbitrator), in effect, deleted that element from the test and thus altered the legal test. As the Court explained in Southam, at para. ... if decision-maker says that the correct test requires him or her to consider A, B, C, and D, but in fact the decision-maker considers only A, B, and C, then the outcome is as if he or she had applied law that required consideration of only A, B, and C. If the correct test requires him or her to consider as well, then the decision-maker has in effect applied the wrong law, and so has made an error of law. Such an allegation ultimately challenges whether the judge (or arbitrator) relied on the correct legal test, thus raising question of law (Sattva, at para. 53; Housen, at paras. 31 and 34-35). Accordingly, such legal question, if alleged in the context of dispute under the Arbitration Act, and assuming the other jurisdictional requirements of that Act are met, is open to appellate review. These “extricable questions of law” are better understood as covert form of legal question where judge’s (or arbitrator’s) legal test is implicit to their application of the test rather than explicit in their description of the test than as fourth and distinct category of questions. 45 Courts should, however, exercise caution in identifying extricable questions of law because mixed questions, by definition, involve aspects of law. The motivations for counsel to strategically frame mixed question as legal question for example, to gain jurisdiction in appeals from arbitration awards or favourable standard of review in appeals from civil litigation judgments are transparent (Sattva, at para. 54; Southam, at para. 36). narrow scope for extricable questions of law is consistent with finality in commercial arbitration and, more broadly, with deference to factual findings. Courts must be vigilant in distinguishing between party alleging that legal test may have been altered in the course of its application (an extricable question of law; Sattva, at para. 53), and party alleging that legal test, which was unaltered, should have, when applied, resulted in different outcome (a mixed question). 46 From this standpoint, the characterization of question on review as mixed question rather than as legal question has vastly different consequences in appeals from arbitration awards and civil litigation judgments. The identification of mixed question when appealing an arbitration award defeats court’s appellate review jurisdiction (Arbitration Act, s. 31; Sattva, at para. 104). In contrast, the identification of mixed question when appealing civil litigation judgment merely raises the standard of review (Housen, at para. 36). 47 Given these principles, question of statutory interpretation is normally characterized as legal question. In contrast, identifying question, broadly, as one of contractual interpretation does not necessarily resolve the nature of the question at issue. Contractual interpretation involves factual, legal, and mixed questions. In consequence, characterizing the nature of the specific question before the court requires delicate consideration of the narrow issue actually in dispute. In general, though, as the Court recently explained in Sattva, contractual interpretation remains mixed question, not legal question, as it involves applying contractual law (principles of contract law) to contractual facts (the contract itself and its factual matrix): para. 50. [44] In this case, the questions that HAL seeks to raise on appeal are, at best, questions of mixed fact and law. While HAL alleges, among other things, that the majority’s decision failed to properly apply the ratio of the Supreme Court of Canada in Sattva, each of the proposed grounds of appeal cited deal with how the majority of the arbitration panel applied the legal standard set out in Sattva to the facts they found. The errors that HAL alleges were made by the majority do not relate to the application of an incorrect principle, failure to consider required element of legal test, or failure to consider relevant factors. Instead, HAL’s proposed grounds of appeal relate to the way in which the majority weighed certain factors, and applied the legal standard. Such proposed grounds of appeal, according to the leading authorities, are thus mixed questions, not pure questions of law. [45] This also applies to HAL’s argument that the majority erred in law by failing to consider the effect of the termination clause of the contract. In my view, the majority’s language is clear, throughout its reasons, that it considered the whole of the contract. This must be taken as including the termination clause. Furthermore, the issue of the termination clause was not relevant to the central issue of whether SecurTek was obligated by the IDSL or MIDSL to purchase certain number of licences from HAL. [46] Accordingly, HAL’s proposed grounds of appeal do not raise a pure issue of law. Even if I had found that HAL and SecurTek had not contracted out of s. 45(2) of the Act, HAL’s application for leave to appeal would have to be dismissed on that basis. CONCLUSION [47] For the foregoing reasons, HAL’s application is dismissed. SecurTek is entitled to the costs of this application. J. J.D. KALMAKOFF",8_2017skqb249.txt,"HELD: The application for leave to appeal was dismissed.
The court found that a term permitting an appeal from an arbitrator’s decision on an error of law did not fall into the category of the obvious and was not the same as an implied term, such as that of good workmanship in contracts for repair.
The contractual language used by the parties was clear that they intended to resolve disputes by final and binding arbitration.
Even if it had found that the parties had not contracted out of s. 45(2) of the Act, the application for leave would have been dismissed because the proposed grounds of appeal did not raise a pure issue of law."
506,"[4] find no merit in the submissions of Key’s counsel that Sollows has calculated interest too high because of “rounding error”.
However, Key’s counsel is entirely correct that Sollows has calculated two extra days of interest on one of the invoices.
[5] In exercising my judicial discretion under Rule 10-13, I must also conclude that Key is entitled to have the default judgment set aside on its merits.
[13] While one might imagine circumstances in which “wilful” failure to defend an action might constitute sufficient reason to deny an application to set aside default judgment, as noted, the fundamental principle relevant to the exercise of judicial discretion in these cases is that it is necessary to ensure that the application of the Court’s rules and principles does not violate the principles of fundamental justice and equity.
pointed out in Rimmer v. Adshead, the applicable principle requires consideration of all the circumstances and strong reason to deny defendant his or her day in court when he or she can demonstrate an arguable defence to the claim and the delay has not caused the plaintiff irreparable harm.
[Emphasis added] [7] Sollows’ counsel submits that Key is not entitled to have the default judgment set aside because of the “wilful” failure of its chief and one band councillor to defend the action, even though they had been warned of the consequences of not responding to the action.
However, Sollows’ counsel concedes that Sollows will not suffer irreparable harm if the default judgment is set aside and it must pursue its claim against Key.
Barnes J. specifically referred to the misconduct of Rodney Brass and Angela Desjarlais (among others) that sufficiently corrupted the October 1, 2016 election.
[13] Chief Papequash and councillor Clinton Key swore affidavits in this application stating that they first learned of this default judgment on June 22, 2018.
[16] I cannot accept that a time frame of 28 days is sufficiently long for the court to prevent Key from defending the action.
[17] Sollows’ counsel also argues that Key has not demonstrated an arguable defence to the claim.
[19] The basis of this defence is outlined in W. Downer Holdings Ltd. Red Pheasant First Nation, 2012 SKQB 468 (CanLII) at paras 25-26, 34-36 and 42-43, 408 Sask 110, where Scherman J. stated: 25 Section 2(3) of the Indian Act provides as follows: 2(3) Unless the context otherwise requires or this Act otherwise provides, (a) power conferred on band shall be deemed not to be exercised unless it is exercised pursuant to majority of the electors of the band; and (b) power conferred on the council of band shall be deemed not to be exercised unless it is exercised pursuant to the consent of majority of the councillors of the band present at meeting of the council duly convened.
26 Counsel for Red Pheasant argues that the signatures of six councillors on the settlement agreement do not bind the Band because, under s. 2(3) of the Act, powers conferred on Council are deemed not to be exercised unless done pursuant to the consent of the majority of the councillors present at meeting of the Band Council duly convened.
The requirement for matters to be dealt with and approved at meeting of the body, ensures public transparency relating to the decisions of governing bodies.
42 The legislation provides that Council may only exercise its power “pursuant to the consent of majority of the councillors present at meeting”.
The logic and the law relating to ostensible authority cannot supplant this clear statutory direction as to how and when band councillors are entitled to make decisions.
43 It should be noted that the fact of being member of collective decision-making body, means no one councillor can be viewed as having the ostensible authority to bind the whole of council.
This is an appropriate situation to exercise the judicial discretion provided by Rule 10-13 and set aside Sollows’ default judgment.
[22] Counsel for Key seeks costs of this application in any event of the cause, on the basis that the default judgment was set aside ex debito justitiae.","HELD: The application was granted.
The judgment was set aside and the defendant given leave to file its statement of defence.
The court found that the judgment should be set aside as a matter of right because it was in excess of the amount due.
The judgment was also set aside on the merits.
It found that the time between service of the statement of claim and the default judgment was not sufficiently long to prevent the defendant from defending the action.
As well, the defendant had provided an arguable defence to the claim in that it pled in its proposed defence of non-compliance with s. 2(3)(b) of the Indian Act.
The delay had not caused the plaintiff irreparable harm.",79,"M.T.

Lee, Q.C., and Katelyn J. Jones for the plaintiff Nathan Phillips for the defendant FIAT ROTHERY J. July 31, 2018 [1] On March 15, 2018, the plaintiff, Douglas Sollows Architect Inc. [Sollows], obtained default judgment against the defendant, The Key First Nation [Key], totalling $102,703.62 plus costs assessed at $1,598.50. Sollows had sued Key for monies owed pursuant to an agreement to provide professional architectural services. [2] Pursuant to Rule 10-13 of The Queen’s Bench Rules, Key’s counsel now applies to set aside that default judgment and seeks leave to file defence in the form of the draft filed with the court July 19, 2018. Because the Sheriff holds funds seized under the enforcement proceedings following the entering of the default judgment, Sollows’ counsel undertakes to request the Sheriff to continue to hold those funds pending further order of the court. [3] Counsel for Key submits that the default judgment should be set aside because Sollows has entered judgment that is greater than the amount due. Counsel refers to Beaver Lumber Company Hopfauf, 1932 CanLII 192 (SK CA), [1932] WWR 357 (WL) (Sask CA) at para 11, in support of this principle: 11 It is clear from number of authorities that it is on the allegations in the pleadings that default judgment must be signed: McCoy v. Laberge, 1929 CanLII 134 (SK CA), [1929] W.W.R. 154, 23 Sask. L.R. 544; Wagar v. Little (No. 2) 1923 CanLII 672 (AB CA), [1924] W.W.R. 112; Ellam v. Acadia Trust Co. Ltd. (1914) W.W.R. 1083; Ewing v. Latimer (1903) Terr. L.R. 499. The judgment having been signed for too much, it should be set aside ex debito justitiae: McCoy v. Laberge, supra; Fawell v. Andrew, [1917] W.W.R. 4001, 10 Sask. L.R. 162; Wagar v. Little, supra; Anlaby v. Praetorius (1888) 20 Q.B.D. 764, 57 L.J. Q.B. 287; Hughes v. Justin, [1894] Q.B. 667, 63 L.J.Q.B. 417. [4] find no merit in the submissions of Key’s counsel that Sollows has calculated interest too high because of “rounding error”. Per diem rates ought to be stated in dollars and cents. However, Key’s counsel is entirely correct that Sollows has calculated two extra days of interest on one of the invoices. The time frame from March 22, 2016 to March 15, 2018 is total of 723 days, not 725 days. Thus, two extra days of interest at per diem of $8.54 amounts to an overcharge of $17.08. As a matter of right, Key is entitled to have the default judgment set aside. [5] In exercising my judicial discretion under Rule 10-13, I must also conclude that Key is entitled to have the default judgment set aside on its merits. [6] The applicable principles in considering Rule 10-13 are the same as the former Rule 346. As stated by Caldwell J.A. in Ballentyne Benard, 2012 SKCA 23 (CanLII) at paras 11-13, 385 Sask 280, the court’s exercise of judicial discretion is based upon the following factors: [11] The reference to “wilful blindness” may have its source in Klein v. Schile (1921), 1921 CanLII 107 (SK CA), 59 D.L.R. 102, an earlier decision of this Court, where Lamont J.A., setting out the circumstances in which judicial discretion will be exercised in favour of an applicant under what is now Rule 346, suggested that the delay in setting aside the default judgment should not be “wilful” (at p. 103): The circumstances under which court will exercise its discretion to set aside judgment regularly signed are pretty well settled. The application should be made as soon as possible after the judgment comes to the knowledge of the defendant, but mere delay will not bar the application, unless an irreparable injury will be done to the plaintiff or the delay has been wilful. Tomlinson v. Kiddo, 1914 CanLII 139 (SK CA), Sask. L.R. 132, W.W.R. 93, 29 W.L.R. 325; Mills v. Harris, Sask. L.R. 114. The application should be supported by an affidavit setting out the circumstances under which the default arose and disclosing defence on the merits. Chitty’s Forms, 13th ed., p. 83. It is not sufficient to merely state that the defendant has good defence upon the merits. The affidavits must show the nature of the defence and set forth facts which will enable the Court or Judge to decide whether or not there was matter which would afford defence to the action. Stewart v. McMahon, Sask. L.R. 209, W.L.R. 643. If the application is not made immediately after the defendant has become aware that judgment has been signed against him, the affidavits should also explain the delay in making the application; and, if that delay be of long standing, the defence on the merits must be clearly established. Sandhoff v. Metzer, W.L.R. 18. [12] review of the jurisprudence indicates this Court has consistently followed Klein v. Schile, see: Hamel v. Chelle (1964), 1964 CanLII 384 (SK CA), 48 W.W.R. 115 (Sask. C.A.); Warner Construction Co. v. Wood River (Rural Municipality) (1979), 1979 CanLII 2230 (SK CA), 105 D.L.R. (3d) 370 (C.A.); Bank of Montreal v. Pauls (1984), 1984 CanLII 2419 (SK CA), 35 Sask. R. 204 (C.A.); Wicks v. Wicks (1990), 1990 CanLII 7728 (SK CA), 87 Sask. R. 139 (C.A.); and Rimmer v. Adshead [2002 SKCA 12]. These cases interpret Klein v. Schile as having established the four requirements subsequently referred to in Strange v. Saskatchewan [2008 SKQB 481], including the requirement to provide “satisfactory explanation” for failure to respond to the claim. However, in Rimmer v. Adshead, at para. 60, Cameron J.A. added that “the merit of the matter is the dominant consideration provided the delay not be accompanied by irreparable harm.” Of these cases, only Warner Construction Co. v. Wood River (Rural Municipality) made any reference to the idea of “wilful delay” as reason, in itself, to deny the application. [13] While one might imagine circumstances in which “wilful” failure to defend an action might constitute sufficient reason to deny an application to set aside default judgment, as noted, the fundamental principle relevant to the exercise of judicial discretion in these cases is that it is necessary to ensure that the application of the Court’s rules and principles does not violate the principles of fundamental justice and equity. As Cameron J.A. pointed out in Rimmer v. Adshead, the applicable principle requires consideration of all the circumstances and strong reason to deny defendant his or her day in court when he or she can demonstrate an arguable defence to the claim and the delay has not caused the plaintiff irreparable harm. [Emphasis added] [7] Sollows’ counsel submits that Key is not entitled to have the default judgment set aside because of the “wilful” failure of its chief and one band councillor to defend the action, even though they had been warned of the consequences of not responding to the action. Sollows’ counsel also argues that there is no defence upon the merits. However, Sollows’ counsel concedes that Sollows will not suffer irreparable harm if the default judgment is set aside and it must pursue its claim against Key. [8] The facts surrounding the response to this Statement of Claim are unique. Sollows’ counsel wrote letter to Chief Rodney Brass on December 18, 2017, demanding payment for the architectural services. Additional information of the debt was provided to Chief Brass by correspondence of December 19, 2017 and January 11, 2018. Sollows’ process server properly served Angela Desjarlais, one of Key’s band councillors, with the Statement of Claim on February 15, 2018. [9] After service of the Claim on Angela Desjarlais on February 15, 2018, and following telephone conversation between Chief Brass and Sollows’ counsel on February 20, 2018, Sollows’ counsel provided further particulars to Chief Brass on February 21, 2018 and warned of the pending deadline to defend the action. [10] Sollows’ counsel noted the action for default on March 14, 2018, and took out default judgment on March 15, 2018. On March 21, 2018, Sollows’ counsel received letter from Maurice Law Firm advising they had been retained to represent Key and requesting that the action not be noted for default without reasonable notice. Sollows’ counsel sent Maurice Law Firm correspondence dated March 22, 2018, advising they were unable to grant that undertaking because default judgment had already been entered against Key. [11] The unique aspect of this action is what happened on March 21, 2018. Some members of Key had brought an application before the Federal Court of Canada on November 16, 2017, seeking an order setting aside the election of the chief and band councillors conducted on October 1, 2016. Two of the respondents elected on October 1, 2016 were Chief Rodney Brass and band councillor Angela Desjarlais. Barnes J. rendered decision on March 21, 2018 (cited as 2018 FC 325 (CanLII)) annulling the election and ordering that new election be conducted. Barnes J. specifically referred to the misconduct of Rodney Brass and Angela Desjarlais (among others) that sufficiently corrupted the October 1, 2016 election. [12] Thus, between March 21, 2018 and June 12, 2018, Key was without chief and band councillors. In the election conducted June 12, 2018, Clarence Papequash was elected chief and Clinton Key and David Darrell Cote were two of the five councillors elected. [13] Chief Papequash and councillor Clinton Key swore affidavits in this application stating that they first learned of this default judgment on June 22, 2018. Chief Papequash states that he immediately sought legal counsel. Key’s present counsel sent correspondence to Sollows’ counsel on June 27, 2018, explaining that the positions of chief and band councillors had been vacant between March 21, 2018 and June 12, 2018. The default judgment had just come to the attention of the new band council on June 22, 2018. [14] Because Sollows’ counsel refused to set aside the default judgment, Key’s counsel brought this application on July 19, 2018. [15] Sollows’ counsel concedes that Key’s electoral turmoil may be an explanation for Key’s delay in defending the case between March 21, 2018, and June 12, 2018. But, that does not explain what should be characterized as wilful failure to defend in the time frame between February 15, 2018 and March 14, 2018. Key was warned of the deadline that was looming. [16] I cannot accept that a time frame of 28 days is sufficiently long for the court to prevent Key from defending the action. That is only seven days past the date Sollows was permitted to note the action for default. Given that Key’s then counsel responded to the action soon after default judgment was entered, this delay in defending the action is insufficient to deny Key its day in court. [17] Sollows’ counsel also argues that Key has not demonstrated an arguable defence to the claim. Sollows filed affidavit evidence to show that there had been contract for professional services with Key. However, band councillor Cote swears that no contract was ever made with Sollows in the time frame he was chief, from December 2014 to October 1, 2016. Councillor Key and Chief Papequash swear that they had been band councillors since the October 1, 2016, election. But, they were regularly excluded from band council meetings. [18] This evidence forms the foundation for an arguable defence. In paragraph of the draft Statement of Defence, Key pleads: 5. In the alternative, THE KEY FIRST NATION pleads and relies upon the Indian Act in general, and in particular section 2(3)(b). At no point in time was the purported contract alleged by the Plaintiff authorized or executed at duly called and convened meeting of the Band Council of THE KEY FIRST NATION, or was anyone authorized to enter into same on its behalf. Pursuant to section 2(3)(b) of the Indian Act, any such purported contract alleged by the Plaintiff is deemed to not bind THE KEY FIRST NATION. [19] The basis of this defence is outlined in W. Downer Holdings Ltd. Red Pheasant First Nation, 2012 SKQB 468 (CanLII) at paras 25-26, 34-36 and 42-43, 408 Sask 110, where Scherman J. stated: 25 Section 2(3) of the Indian Act provides as follows: 2(3) Unless the context otherwise requires or this Act otherwise provides, (a) power conferred on band shall be deemed not to be exercised unless it is exercised pursuant to majority of the electors of the band; and (b) power conferred on the council of band shall be deemed not to be exercised unless it is exercised pursuant to the consent of majority of the councillors of the band present at meeting of the council duly convened. 26 Counsel for Red Pheasant argues that the signatures of six councillors on the settlement agreement do not bind the Band because, under s. 2(3) of the Act, powers conferred on Council are deemed not to be exercised unless done pursuant to the consent of the majority of the councillors present at meeting of the Band Council duly convened. In support of this interpretation of the legislation, they rely on the decisions in Heron Seismic Services Ltd. v. Peepeekisis Indian Band (1990), 1990 CanLII 7500 (SK QB), 87 Sask. R. 66, [1990] S.J. No. 495 (QL) (Q.B.), upheld on appeal at (1991), 1991 CanLII 7963 (SK CA), 86 D.L.R. (4th) 767, [1991] S.J. No. 553 (QL) (C.A.); and Brass v. Peepeekisis Cree Nation No. 81, 2002 SKQB 194 (CanLII), 221 Sask.R. 4, upheld on appeal at 2004 SKCA 40 (CanLII), 254 Sask. R. 3. 34 At no Red Pheasant Band Council meeting was anyone authorized to negotiate and conclude the settlement agreement in question. Accordingly, whether apply the law as stated by the Saskatchewan Courts (as am bound to do) or accept the logic of Moir J. [Maloney Eskasoni Indian Band, 2009 NSSC 177 (CanLII)], in which find significant merit, the result is the same. Even under the Moir J. approach to the interpretation of s. 2(3)(b), the power of Council was not exercised “pursuant to the consent of majority of the councillors present at meeting”. Therefore, the settlement agreement is unenforceable because no one was authorized, by consent of majority of the councillors present at Band Council meeting, to enter into such an agreement on behalf of the Band. 35 The fact that majority of the councillors signed the settlement agreement does not salvage the issue for the plaintiffs since the language of the statute expressly requires the power of Council to be exercised “pursuant to the consent of majority of the councillors present at meeting”. There was no meeting as required by the legislation. 36 This is not distinction of little significance. For band councils and host of other decision-making bodies including municipal councils, decisions cannot be made without the matter being brought before meeting of the body. This permits all members of council who might disagree the opportunity to voice their opposition and reasons for their opposition. The required meeting and debate might well change the views of those who came prepared to approve. One of the strengths of the democratic process is the opportunity to debate matters to be decided and to convince others. The requirement for matters to be dealt with and approved at meeting of the body, ensures public transparency relating to the decisions of governing bodies. In each of the cases relied upon by the plaintiff, the band or the band council had the opportunity to debate the matter and made decision to authorize its chief to proceed. 42 The legislation provides that Council may only exercise its power “pursuant to the consent of majority of the councillors present at meeting”. The logic and the law relating to ostensible authority cannot supplant this clear statutory direction as to how and when band councillors are entitled to make decisions. To permit majority of Council to bind the Band on the principle of ostensible authority when they have made decision outside of Council meeting would be permitting common law principle of contract law to supplant the express direction of Parliament. 43 It should be noted that the fact of being member of collective decision-making body, means no one councillor can be viewed as having the ostensible authority to bind the whole of council. Councillors can only act collectively and thus one or several counsellors do not have ostensible authority to make decision. chief or band manager by virtue of their position may, in commercial matters, have the ostensible authority to bind. All councillors (which includes the chief) may arguably have ostensible authority to bind. But individual councillors or collection of councillors less than all do not. In reaching these conclusions, acknowledge the logic and merit of Moir J.’s reasoning, but cannot adopt because of the existing precedent in this jurisdiction and for the additional reasons have outlined. [20] Thus, non-compliance with s. 2(3)(b) of the Indian Act, RSC 1985, c I‑5, may well be an arguable defence in this case. Whether there has actually been non-compliance is matter for the trial judge to decide. That is exactly one of the issues the judge had to decide by way of trial in All-Fab Building Components Inc. Montreal Lake No. 354, 2015 SKQB 407 (CanLII). [21] In short, I find that the delay has not caused Sollows irreparable harm, and Key has demonstrated an arguable defence to Sollows’ claim. This is an appropriate situation to exercise the judicial discretion provided by Rule 10-13 and set aside Sollows’ default judgment. Key is granted leave to serve and file its Statement of Defence, in the form of the draft filed July 19, 2018. [22] Counsel for Key seeks costs of this application in any event of the cause, on the basis that the default judgment was set aside ex debito justitiae. While costs are often granted in such case, upon considering the entire set of circumstances that led to this application, Sollows should not have costs awarded against it for what was actually result of electoral turmoil within Key’s own governance. [23] The application is granted. Costs shall follow the cause. J. A.R. ROTHERY",8_2018skqb217.txt,"HELD: The application was granted.

Stewart on June 10, 1998, Special Chambers, 2:00 p.m. DECISION: July 9, 1998 COUNSEL: Joel Fichaud, Q.C., for the plaintiff Michael Moreash,for the defendant Stewart, J.: The plaintiff, Canada Trustco Mortgage Company, (""Canada Trust""), a municipal tax payer paid its property taxes as assessed for the years 1994, 1995, 1996 but on appeal was held entitled to a refund for each of the three years in the total amount of $420,177.13. Canada Trust, pursuant to s. 41(i) of the Judicature Act, R.S.N.S., 1989, c. 240 seeks payment of interest on this amount from the date of the payments and stresses it does not seek the alternative remedy of entitlement to the interest based on unjust enrichment. The facts are not in issue. Canada Trust, municipal taxpayer, in the City of Dartmouth, now Halifax Regional Municipality (""HRM""), the defendant, was assessed for municipal property taxes on fourteen multi-unit residential properties. As required by the Assessment Act, R.S.N.S., 1989, c. 23, Canada Trust paid its taxes as assessed. It appealed its assessments for the years 1994, 1995 and 1996 inclusive. The appeal process ended with the Nova Scotia Court of Appeal, on March 3, 1997, upholding the Utility and Review Board's assessment determination which translated into $420,177.13 overpayment of taxes. Within five months, on September 5, 1997, HRM issued $420,177.13 property tax refund cheque to Canada Trust. HRM earned interest on this money from the time of receipt or had the use of these monies. As noted, Canada Trust seeks interest pursuant to s. 41(i) of the Judicature Act, supra on the refund from the date it made the overpayments to HRM in response to HRM's tax invoices requiring payment of those amounts on the ""due dates"" in 1994, 1995 and 1996. Section 41(i) reads: In every proceeding commenced in the Court, law and equity shall be administered therein according to the following provisions: (i) in any proceeding for the recovery of any debt or damages, the Court shall include in the sum for which judgment is to be given interest thereon at such rate as it thinks fit for the period between the date when the cause of action arose and the date of judgment after trial or after subsequent appeal. Canada Trust submits s. 41(i) provides an ""independent"" statutory basis for interest claims on debts and states pre judgment interest is payable from ""the date when the cause of action arose"" and ""the cause of action arose"" when Canada Trust was required to overpay its property taxes, thereby causing it to suffer loss. Canada Trust submits it is entitled to compensation for the deprivation. Basically, Canada Trust contends pre judgment is payable on the overpayment of property taxes from the time of remittance for the same reasons pre judgment interest was payable in Cherubin Metalworks Limited v. Nova Scotia (Attorney General) (1995), 1995 CanLII 4314 (NS CA), 137 N.S.R. (2d) 197 (C. A.) where an overpayment of Health Services tax under the Health Services Tax Act, R.S.N.S., 1989, c.198, over period of several years resulted in the trial court and the Nova Scotia Court of Appeal, in an action for unjust enrichment, awarding judgment for substantial overpayment of sales tax and concurrently, under s. 41(i) of the Judicature Act, supra, prejudgment interest on the overpaid sales tax amount from the time of the remittance of the tax overpayment by Cherubin Metalworks Limited. Justice Roscoe, speaking for the unanimous court, at p. 209-11, stressed the court's previous findings that firstly, the purpose of s. 41(i) is to compensate the litigant for the profit he might have made if he had use of the money and secondly, interest is payable under this section on ""any sum of money which is recoverable by one party from another, either in common-law or in equity or under Statute"" thereby giving the phrase ""debt or damages"" ""very wide"" definition. Canada Trust stresses the issue is not when there is an obligation to pay prejudgment interest i.e. upon determination by the Court but rather the issue is when did the facts which if proven in the appropriate proceedings support the cause of action. When did those facts i.e. the overpayment of taxes because the properties were over-assessed happen? Canada Trust cites Cherubin, supra as an example of the trial judge finding an obligation to refund excess taxes in 1994 but awarding the prejudgment interest back to 1988, being the date when the overpaid health taxes were first remitted. HRM paid the refund of overpaid real property taxes to Canada Trust, pursuant to s. 90 of the Assessment Act, supra. Section 90 reads as follows: When person has paid any money on an assessment or rate that is subsequently quashed, reversed or varied as result of which his rates have been overpaid, he shall be repaid by the treasurer out of the general revenues of the municipality the amount overpaid, but if an appeal is taken against the order quashing, reversing or varying the assessment or the rate, the person is not entitled to repayment until the disposition of the appeal. HRM submits s.90 provides tax payer has no right to refund of any overpayment of taxes until the disposition of any appeal of the assessment. It specifically and expressly requires the municipality to refund the amount overpaid and intentionally makes no mention in this or in any other section to paying interest on that overpayment. This lack of obligation to pay interest on an overpayment of taxes, resulting from incorrect assessment, is fact that HRM contends is consistent with similar statutes in other provinces. HRM submits the legislature did not intend other statutory provisions, like s. 41(i) of the Judicature Act, supra, to apply or to be read in conjunction with the Assessment Act, supra. This intention can be drawn from the fact the Assessment Act, supra is complete code and s. 90 specifically is exhaustive in describing clearly what payment the municipality is required to pay, ie. the amount overpaid. No interest payment is authorized, either directly or indirectly, by the Assessment Act, supra and even the refund of taxes cannot be paid until the appeal process is complete. Secondly, the intention can be gained from the very terms or phrases in s. 41(i) of the Judicature Act, supra. Section 41(i) only applies where there is proceeding for the recovery of any debt or damages and it is ""mischaracterization"" of the various levels of assessment appeals to suggest they are proceedings for the recovery of debt or damages. am satisfied there was no cause of action for return of any overpayment of taxes until after the appeal provisions of the Assessment Act, supra had been exhausted. The Nova Scotia Court of Appeal ruled upholding the reduced assessment in March, 1997. Consequently, the date from which interest is calculated in this action to pursue Canada Trust's right to interest on the amount of the overpayment is upon completion of the appeal process. Appeal proceedings before the Utility Board and the Nova Scotia Court of Appeal were not ""proceedings for the recovery of any debt or damages"". No amount of money was awarded as judgment for overpayment. Rather, the appeal proceedings were limited to confirming or amending the assessment. At the end of the process, the assessment was reduced and this had the ramification of an overpayment when the taxes were recalculated. No order was provided for recovery of the overpayment. HRM was under direct mandatory statutory obligation, pursuant to s. 90 of the Assessment Act, supra to refund any amount overpaid as soon as the appeal process concluded. As noted in Island Realty v. Corner Brook (City) (1994), 1993 CanLII 7758 (NL CA), 113 Nfld. P.E.I. 198 (C.A.), at this point failure by HRM to repay the overpaid taxes could result in an action for recovery of the overpayment, pursuant to the Assessment Act, supra and interest could be claimed under s. 41(i) of the Judicature Act, supra from the time the overpayment was to be paid. There is no provision in the Assessment Act, supra to pay interest on the overpayment. Section 90 clearly states there is no entitlement to repayment of an amount overpaid until disposition of the appeal. Canada Trust could not bring an action to recover an overpayment from HRM at any time before the decision was rendered on the assessment by the appeal body. Appeal proceedings under the Assessment Act, supra relate to the validity and appropriateness of the assessment and are not proceedings for the recovery of ""debt or damages"". The taxpayer, Canada Trust, had no cause of action for return of any overpayment of taxes until the appeal provisions of the Assessment Act, supra had been exhausted and resulted in reduced assessment. Unlike Cherubin, supra the payment of taxes were not overpayments at the time they were paid. The payments were simply the payment of taxes on assessment and could not be said to have been overpayments until the conclusion of the appeal process (Zaidan Group Limited v.

The date when it could be said to be an overpayment of taxes does not change or revert back to an earlier date when the tax payments were remitted because the appeal process has concluded. proceeding under the Judicature Act, supra does not create debt. There was no right to a refund of overpaid taxes until March 1997 when the Nova Scotia Court of Appeal rendered its decision upholding the reduction in the assessment. An appropriate interest claim does exist under s. 41(i) of the Judicature Act, supra on the principal amount for the five month period between the Nova Scotia Court of Appeal assessment determination in March, 1997, and the payment of the property tax refund, in September 1997, as well as on the unpaid interest until date of judgment. An interest rate of 8.75 % being a rate equatable to the interest rate charged by HRM on overdue taxes (prime plus 4 %) is an appropriate rate on the principal amount of $420,177.13 fro m March 3, 1997 to the date of the refund on September 5, 1997 and on the unpaid interest only from September 6, 1997 to the date of judgment. would ask counsel to make the appropriate calculations and subject to any agreement wil hear the parties as to costs by way of brief written submissions.",9_1998canlii1737.txt,"The plaintiff paid its municipal property taxes as assessed for three years.

No. 33/2006 Judicial Centre: Saskatoon BETWEEN: ORION RAYCRAFT and SHAUNNA RAYCRAFT, and HER MAJESTY THE QUEEN, Respondent Appearances: Orion Raycraft and Shaunna Raycraft on their own behalf Sami A. Shenouda for the Crown JUDGMENT CURRIE J. March 14, 2007 [1] At a June 2, 2006 trial in Provincial Court the appellants, Orion Raycraft and Shaunna Raycraft, were found guilty of breaching a bylaw of the Rural Municipality of Vanscoy No. 345. The trial justice of the peace convicted the appellants of breaching Bylaw 2‑1995, which provides: “That no poultry or livestock be permitted in districts zoned Hamlet.” [2] Before convicting the appellants, the trial justice heard evidence: (a) that cattle were being kept on the appellants’ property; (b) identifying and proving Bylaw 2‑1993, the zoning bylaw by which the appellants’ property is determined to be in district zoned “Hamlet”; and (c) identifying and proving Bylaw 2‑1995, the bylaw prohibiting livestock in that zoning district. [3] The appellants did not lead evidence at trial. They did not dispute that they were keeping cattle on their property. Their defence related to points of law. [4] The appellants appeal from their conviction. Four issues are to be addressed:(1) the appellants’ application to admit new evidence on the appeal;(2) a constitutional question raised by the appellants;(3) the significance of the word “hamlet” in the bylaw; and(4) the meaning of the word “livestock” in the bylaw. (1) Application to admit new evidence [5] At the hearing of this appeal the appellants applied for the admission of new evidence. New evidence will not be admitted on an appeal if, by due diligence, it could have been adduced at trial. Further, the evidence will be admitted on appeal only if it bears upon a decisive or potentially decisive issue in the trial: R. v. Palmer (1979), 1979 CanLII 8 (SCC), [1980] 1 S.C.R. 759; Carriere v. Carriere, 2004 SKCA 80 (CanLII), 249 Sask.R. 240. [6] The appellants have submitted, by way of sworn affidavits and by way of oral presentation, that some of the evidence they seek to have admitted came into their hands after the trial. have reviewed the documents tendered for admission by the appellants. Some of the documents were in the possession of the appellants earlier than the trial. These documents include correspondence and the appellants’ notes for presentation to meeting of the council of the rural municipality. As these documents were in the possession of the appellants, the documents could have been adduced at the trial. For this reason, decline to admit these documents in evidence on the appeal. [7] The evidence that has come into the possession of the appellants after the trial, and that the appellants seek to have admitted, includes: (a) minutes of the council meeting that occurred before the trial; (b) Bylaws 1‑1993, 8‑1994 and 1‑1998 of the rural municipality; and (c) letter, dated more than two years before the trial, from Saskatchewan Government Relations and Aboriginal Affairs to the rural municipality, suggesting an amendment to Bylaw 1‑1993, the rural municipality’s basic planning statement. [8] The minutes of the meeting could have been obtained prior to trial with due diligence. In any event, since the minutes serve only to demonstrate that the appellants addressed council, the minutes do not bear upon decisive or potentially decisive issue at the trial. [9] The appellants tender three bylaws of the rural municipality. The appellants have explained their unsuccessful efforts, before trial, to obtain copies of bylaws and amendments from the rural municipality. am not persuaded, however, that the documents could not have been obtained by due diligence. [10] The appellants asked for zoning information from the rural municipality, and the rural municipality provided the appellants with copies of the zoning maps that are appended to the zoning bylaw. These maps indicate that the appellants’ property is in district zoned “Hamlet”. The appellants subsequently asked for material in addition to the maps, but the appellants did not make clear what they were seeking. As described in Ms. Raycraft’s affidavit, the appellants asked the rural municipality for “bylaws and resolutions clarifying the zoning status” of their property. request of this nature does not communicate the particular documents, or even categories of documents, that are being requested. The appellants are not lawyers, but it is not unreasonable to expect non‑lawyers to frame their requests for documents in manner that permits one to understand what documents are being sought. Framing their requests in this manner would have amounted to due diligence. [11] In any event, the three bylaws tendered by the appellants do not bear upon decisive or potentially decisive issue at the trial. Bylaw 1‑1993 purports to be the rural municipality’s basic planning statement, and its relevance to the issues is not apparent. The appellants seem to suggest that there may be some inconsistency between the basic planning statement and Bylaw 2‑1995, under which the appellants were convicted, but no inconsistency is apparent. The second bylaw tendered by the appellants, Bylaw 8‑1994, purports to be an amendment to Bylaw 1‑1993, and so it shares the lack of relevance. [12] The third bylaw tendered by the appellants, Bylaw 1‑1998, purports to be an amendment to Bylaw 2‑1993, the zoning bylaw. The amendments in this document are not reflected in the version of the zoning bylaw that was put in evidence at the trial. Thus it may be, as suggested by the appellants, that the version of the zoning bylaw put in evidence was not the current version. Alternatively, it may be that the version of the zoning bylaw put in evidence was the current version, as consequence of more recent amendments. [13] For the purposes of the application for admission of new evidence, this question not matter, because the amendments set out in the purported Bylaw 1‑1998 do not relate to any issue in this matter. The amendments address other topics. [14] The letter from Saskatchewan Government Relations and Aboriginal Affairs does not bear upon decisive or potentially decisive issue at the trial. Assuming it could be proven, the references to proposed amendments in the letter would not establish that there had been any amendments. As well, the proposed amendments relate to the basic planning statement, not to the zoning bylaw or to the bylaw under which the appellants were convicted. [15] For the above reasons, the application to admit new evidence on the appeal is dismissed. (2) Constitutional question [16] The appellants ask that Bylaw 2-1995, which prohibits livestock in districts zoned “Hamlet”, be declared ultra vires on the ground that it is uncertain. The appellants have not given notice under The Constitutional Questions Act, R.S.S. 1978, c. C‑29. Notice is required when the constitutionality of bylaw is questioned. For this reason, the constitutional question is not properly before me. [17] In any event, the uncertainty on which the appellants rely in attacking the bylaw does not exist, as I discuss in the balance of this decision. Thus, even if the question were properly before me, would dismiss the application. (3) Significance of the word “hamlet” [18] The first of the appellants’ arguments on the merits relates to the use of the word “hamlet” in Bylaw 2‑1995: “That no poultry or livestock be permitted in districts zoned Hamlet.” The appellants argue that the district in which their property lies is not “hamlet” in the sense of it being legal community of that name. The appellants refer to The Rural Municipality Act, 1989, S.S. 1989‑90, c. R‑26.1 (subsequently repealed by The Municipalities Act, S.S. 2005, c. M‑36.1), which defined “hamlet” in law at the relevant time. The appellants say that the district in which their property lies does not fall under this definition, and so as matter of law the appellants cannot be guilty of breaching Bylaw 2‑1995. That is, since their district is not hamlet, they cannot be guilty of keeping livestock in district that is hamlet. [19] The appellants misunderstand the use of the word “hamlet” in the bylaw. In the zoning bylaw, and in Bylaw 2‑1995, “Hamlet” does not refer to community of that name as identified in The Rural Municipality Act, 1989. “Hamlet” is simply the label given by the rural municipality to particular zoning district. The reference in Bylaw 2‑1995 is to “districts zoned Hamlet”, not to “hamlet” within the meaning of The Rural Municipality Act, 1989. [20] The label given to zoning district is significant only as an aid to determining those parts of the bylaws that set out the rules governing that particular district. For example, in this case the appellants learned from the zoning maps that their property lies within zoning district labelled “hamlet”. With this information, the appellants were in position to peruse the bylaws relating to districts labelled “hamlet”, and to learn of the rules governing their property including the rule prohibiting cattle. [21] The appellants fail on this argument. (4) Whether cattle are livestock [22] The second of the appellants’ arguments on the merits relates to the use of the word “livestock” in Bylaw 2‑1995. Neither Bylaw 2‑1995 nor the zoning bylaw defines “livestock”, although Part of the zoning bylaw defines “Intensive Livestock Operation” as “the operation or facilities for rearing, confinement or feeding of poultry, hogs, sheep, goats, cattle or horses, in such numbers or conditions that requires permit under this bylaw.” Thus, to the extent that the zoning bylaw refers to an operation relating to keeping livestock, “livestock” includes cattle. [23] In the absence of specific definition of “livestock”, though, the appellants argue that the word is uncertain, and that it can be defined so broadly as to be either meaningless or unenforceable. [24] In support of this argument, the appellants refer to definitions of “livestock” from various sources. They point out that the broadest of the definitions of “livestock” include virtually any living creature that might be kept by people, including bees and butterflies. Against this background, the appellants ask how anyone can know what “livestock” is, within the meaning of the bylaw. If one cannot know what “livestock” is, they say, then one cannot be convicted of keeping livestock. [25] The appellants are correct in identifying range of definitions of “livestock”. Definitions include: (a) at the narrow end of the range, “cattle, horses, and similar animals kept for domestic use but not as pets, esp on farm” (Collins English Dictionary, Canadian Edition, 2005, HarperCollins Publishers); and (b) at the broad end of the range, “Domestic animals generally; any animals kept or dealt in for use or profit” (Shorter Oxford English Dictionary, 3d ed., 1973, Oxford University Press). [26] Two points emerge. First, whatever definition of “livestock” is used, the definition always includes cattle. Second, in order to determine whether Bylaw 2‑1995 has been breached by the keeping of cattle, one does not need to identify each animal that may be included in the word “livestock”. One needs only to know whether cattle are included in the word “livestock”. They are included, since cattle are “livestock” under any definition of the word. [27] The uncertainty suggested by the appellants does not exist. Under Bylaw 2‑1995 no livestock is permitted in the district. Cattle are livestock, and so cattle are not permitted in the district. [28] The appellants fail on this argument. [29] The trial justice made no error in law. His findings of fact were supported by the evidence. That being the case, there is no basis on which to reverse the trial decision. The appeal is dismissed. J. G.M.

DISPOSITION: Appeal Heard: February 24, 1995 Appeal Allowed: February 24, 1995 (oral) Reasons: March 1, 1995 On Appeal From: Provincial Court Appeal File: 6491 Reasons by: The Honourable Madam Justice Jackson In concurrence: The Honourable Mr. Justice Cameron and The Honourable Mr. Justice Lane JACKSON J.A. The Crown appealed the disposition imposed on B.D.L., a young offender, following his guilty plea to four Criminal Code offences. The four offences were: (i) escaping lawful custody, contrary to s. 145(1)(a); (ii) stealing property valued at more than $1,000, contrary to s. 334(a); (iii) dangerous driving, contrary to s. 249(1)(a); and (iv) possession of stolen property valued at more than $1,000, contrary to s. 355(a). For these offences, B.D.L. received, in total, a five months closed custody disposition on October 17, 1994 concurrent to a nine month open custody disposition previously imposed on September 17, 1994. Shortly after B.D.L. started to serve his nine month open custody disposition, he escaped custody. He, along with another young offender, took truck from the parking lot of residence in Indian Head. police officer saw them in this stolen vehicle in the early hours of October 9, 1994. When the police officer tried to stop them, they accelerated away and police chase began. After speeding, including turning corners at high speeds, B.D.L. and the other young offender fled on foot when the truck they were driving hit the side of an attached garage. On October 11, 1994, another police officer found B.D.L. in another stolen vehicle the steering column of which had been dismantled. B.D.L. was raised by his maternal aunt following the early death of his parents. Since April 14, 1993, he has been involved in series of offences. His record includes one count of sexual assault, five counts of theft or possession of stolen property and four counts of failure to comply or to appear. All offences committed after the first set of charges have also been in breach of probation. B.D.L. turned 18 on October 13, 1994. We are all of the view, having regard for the age of the offender, his previous record and the nature of the offences committed, notably the escape custody and dangerous driving, that a five month secure custody disposition, concurrent to an existing disposition, was not fit. In arriving at this conclusion we have considered our decisions in R. v. Shane B. (unreported, issued December 6, 1994, court file nos. 6436, 6411, 6372 and 6427) and R. v. M.(J.C.) (unreported, issued December 6, 1994, court file no. 6451). Accordingly, the disposition of five months is set aside and one year secure custody, again concurrent to the nine month open custody sentence, substituted. We note B.D.L. has made some progress in secure custody, but, given its recent nature, it is better tested in review process at later date than by us at this time.",b_1995canlii3936.txt,"The accused, a young offender, was convicted of escaping lawful custody, theft of property valued in excess $1,000.00, dangerous driving and being in possession of stolen property.

[2] The written release of decision February 17, 2005 left counsel to attempt to reach agreement with respect to costs and disbursements failing which the court would receive representations from both parties which have now been received. [3] The originating notice action in this matter was filed July 21, 2003 and therefore the new tariff of September 29, 2004 does not apply, (Little v. Chignecto Central Regional School Board (2004), 2004 NSSC 265 (CanLII), 230 N.S.R. (2d)1). [4] There is no tariff that provides direction with respect to the determination of the amount of costs in Chambers’ applications. Normal Chambers’ applications have been awarding costs generally in the range of $250 to $750, (Hi-Fi Novelty Co. et al v. Nova Scotia (Attorney General) (1993), 1993 CanLII 4632 (NS SC), 121 N.S.R.

In this application Canada Lands sets out that its solicitor and client fees to the date of the hearing amounted to $24,856.50 plus disbursements of $510.97 and counsel for Chater indicate that his solicitor and client fees were approximately half that amount. While time sheets, etc., can be very helpful in determining party and party costs, the level of solicitors’ fees in this application is not very helpful in measuring an amount that is just and appropriate. [5] The hearing in this matter was less than two hours in duration, however, there were a number of steps taken prior to the application including filing a list of documents, exchange of documents and apparently two days of discovery. The defendant made an offer of settlement in the amount of $5,000, inclusive of costs, which take to be an attempt to have the action simply go away due to the heavy costs of litigation. As indicated, the sale price of the property which was approximately $2,000,000 was not, in my view, the appropriate “amount involved”, and it was very difficult and, in fact, impossible for me to really get handle on what amount of loss of profits was being pursued or to what extent the defendants were monetarily at risk. am left therefore with judgment call as to what is reasonable level of indemnity to the defendants who have been successful on an application which does dispose of the matter before the court. [6] In the circumstances, I think a reasonable and fit party and party level of costs is $5,000 plus disbursements of $510.97 and the defendant is entitled to judgment for costs and disbursements herein taxed and allowed in the amount of $5,510.97.",c_2005nssc120.txt,"The court granted the defendant's application for summary judgment of claim.

803,"The next evening, Gene Knudsen telephoned Mr. Sheppard to ask if he was prepared to do only portion of the seeding and to “seed along side us”.
He awarded damages in the amount of only $1,575.00, being the profit that would have been lost in relation to the 70-100 acres which had already been seeded when Mr. Knudsen had extended his offer.
[7] The Company has catalogue of complaints about the Queen’s Bench decision and about the way in which the judges in the courts below decided the matters before them.
[8] The Company’s central complaint is that neither the appeal judge nor the trial judge understood the significance of exhibit P-5, drawing which shows the effect that water washes would have had on efforts to seed particular tract of land owned by Knudsen.
The Company’s concern is that exhibit P-5 was not given sufficient effect or importance in determining whether the Company had mitigated its damages.
This is conclusion that was open to him given the evidence as whole and see no possible error in the appeal judge’s decision to that effect.
Further, regardless of what exhibit P-5 might show about the impact of water washes on seeding patterns, the trial judge found that the Company could have mitigated its losses by seeding the whole of the tract of land shown in P-5 plus the balance of the Knudsen property (save for 70-100 acres).
[9] The Company also says the trial judge erred in finding that Mr. Sheppard contacted the RCMP.
He merely attempted to keep Mr. Sheppard on track in the presentation of his case and discouraged him from asking Mr. Knudsen the same question multiple times.
(c) The trial judge diminished Mr. Sheppard and/or showed bias by using the phrase “people like you” to describe him and by asking if he thought mitigation meant sitting by the phone and waiting for people to respond to his ads—this issue was not raised with the appeal judge and he did not deal with it.","The court denied leave to appeal.

[Knudsen] for breaching contract whereby the Company had agreed to custom seed some 1,050 acres for Knudsen in exchange for fixed price of $19,293.75. [2] The essential facts are relatively straightforward. In broad-brush terms, they are as follows. The contract in question was signed on May 29, 2014. The next evening, Gene Knudsen telephoned Mr. Sheppard to ask if he was prepared to do only portion of the seeding and to “seed along side us”. Mr. Sheppard made it clear that he considered this to be breach of the contract but said he would think about it. At around noon the next day, May 31, Mr. Sheppard called Gene Knudsen back and said he was not prepared to comprise his position. Mr. Sheppard then discovered voicemail message from Gene Knudsen which Mr. Knudsen had left for him earlier in the day. In it, Mr. Knudsen had said, “[W]e got guy” and had told Mr. Sheppard not to move his equipment to the Knudsen land. [3] On June 2, after getting advice from his lawyer, Gene Knudsen called Mr. Sheppard and, as found by the trial judge, told Mr. Sheppard that the Company could seed until the job was done. At that point, between 70 and 100 acres had already been seeded. Mr. Sheppard rejected this invitation and sued Knudsen for $19,293.75, the value of the contract. [4] At the Small Claims trial, the judge found that Knudsen had breached the contract but that the Company had failed to mitigate its damages when, on June 2, it had declined the opportunity to finish seeding the Knudsen land. He awarded damages in the amount of only $1,575.00, being the profit that would have been lost in relation to the 70-100 acres which had already been seeded when Mr. Knudsen had extended his offer. [5] The Company appealed to the Court of Queen’s Bench, arguing that the trial decision was unreasonable and unsupported by the evidence and that the trial judge had improperly interfered with Mr. Sheppard’s cross-examination of Knudsen’s witnesses. The appeal judge rejected both lines of argument. He found that the trial judge’s findings of fact had been reasonable and that the trial judge had managed the trial fairly, patiently and efficiently. [6] The Company now seeks leave to appeal to this Court. Significantly, by virtue of s. 45 of The Small Claims Act, 1997, SS 1997, S-50.11, it may appeal only on question of law. Further, in order to obtain leave, the Company must establish that any question of law it wishes to raise is of both sufficient merit and of sufficient importance to warrant the attention of the Court. See: Rothmans, Benson Hedges Inc. Saskatchewan, 2002 SKCA 119 (CanLII), 227 Sask 121. [7] The Company has catalogue of complaints about the Queen’s Bench decision and about the way in which the judges in the courts below decided the matters before them. However, only a few of those complaints can properly be characterized as questions of “law”. Most are questions of “fact”. (In this regard, Mr. Sheppard appeared, during the course of his oral submissions, to believe that any error of any kind was necessarily an error of law. This is not the case. An error which involves the weighing or assessment of the evidence and the determination of what did or did not happen is an error of fact.) [8] The Company’s central complaint is that neither the appeal judge nor the trial judge understood the significance of exhibit P-5, drawing which shows the effect that water washes would have had on efforts to seed particular tract of land owned by Knudsen. The Company’s concern is that exhibit P-5 was not given sufficient effect or importance in determining whether the Company had mitigated its damages. But, if this was an error, it was an error of fact. The trial judge concluded that the Company could have seeded all but 70-100 acres of the Knudsen land but had chosen not to do so. This is conclusion that was open to him given the evidence as whole and see no possible error in the appeal judge’s decision to that effect. Further, regardless of what exhibit P-5 might show about the impact of water washes on seeding patterns, the trial judge found that the Company could have mitigated its losses by seeding the whole of the tract of land shown in P-5 plus the balance of the Knudsen property (save for 70-100 acres). The fact that water washes might have changed seeding patterns or made seeding more difficult did not entitle the Company to refuse to mitigate its losses. [9] The Company also says the trial judge erred in finding that Mr. Sheppard contacted the RCMP. This too is an issue of fact and, in any event, it has absolutely no bearing on the outcome of the case. [10] The Company does raise some issues which could be issues of law but they are all so lacking in merit as to not warrant granting leave to appeal in relation to them. Let me comment very briefly on the main points raised by the Company: (a) The trial judge refused to let Mr. Sheppard refer to exhibit P-5—this is not matter raised or dealt with by the appeal judge. As result, it does not relate to an error in his decision. In any event, have reviewed the relevant part of the transcript. The trial judge did no more than attempt to keep the trial moving forward and to require Mr. Sheppard to answer the question that he had been asked at that point. (b) The trial judge improperly cut off Mr. Sheppard’s cross-examination of Gene Knudsen—I agree with the appeal judge that the trial judge did nothing improper in this regard. He merely attempted to keep Mr. Sheppard on track in the presentation of his case and discouraged him from asking Mr. Knudsen the same question multiple times. (c) The trial judge diminished Mr. Sheppard and/or showed bias by using the phrase “people like you” to describe him and by asking if he thought mitigation meant sitting by the phone and waiting for people to respond to his ads—this issue was not raised with the appeal judge and he did not deal with it. Further, it is devoid of merit. Seen in context, the trial judge’s language was innocuous, created no unfairness and revealed no bias. [11] I conclude, therefore, that leave to appeal should not be granted to the Company. Knudsen is entitled to costs which, in the interest of expediency, set at $800. “Richards C.J.S.” Richards C.J.S.",c_2015skca77.txt,"The court denied leave to appeal.

He further stated that although “[n]o definition of ‘other special circumstances’ has been provided, however, it would seem obvious that the considerations respecting removal of an executor under the inherent jurisdiction of the Court would be included in the concept of ‘other special circumstances’”.
He also stated as follows: In Sinclair and Figley the Court spoke to the factors to be considered in determining whether an executor should be removed from administering an estate.
Analysis [16] I find that the circumstances of this case constitute “special circumstances” within the meaning of s. 17 of the Act and that, as stated by Mills J. in Whitworth, the overriding duty of the Court to ensure the administration will be properly executed consistent with an ultimate concern for the welfare of the beneficiaries.

[24] My direction for Kent Jones and Rodney Argue to take no steps to distribute assets of the estate or otherwise finalize the administration of the estate until after February 15, 2018, does not operate to prevent the executors from: a. paying outstanding obligations; b. filing tax returns and making payment of tax obligations; or c. selling and transferring title of assets of the estate, with the exception of those parcels of land identified in paras.","HELD: The application was granted.

Stooshinoff, Q.C. for Kent Jones and Rodney Argue Evan Jones on his own behalf FIAT SCHERMAN J. December 21, 2017 Introduction [1] The applicants Kent Jones [Kent] and Rodney Argue [Rodney] ask the Court to remove the respondent Evan Jones [Evan] as an executor of the estate of Edna May Jones. Their grounds are that Evan has brought an application that effectively challenges the validity of the Will he is presently an executor of and he is refusing to co-operate in taking the steps necessary to administer the estate and carry out the directions contained in the Last Will and Testament [Will] of Edna May Jones as admitted to probate. The Factual Background [2] On July 13, 2016, Evan, Kent and Rodney filed with the Court an application for grant of probate to them in respect of an October 15, 2015 Will of Edna May Jones [Edna], who died on November 19, 2015. Evan and Kent are sons of the late Ms. Edna Jones and Rodney is nephew. The three were designated in the Will as executors. Each swore an affidavit stating they believed the Will to be the Last Will and Testament of Edna and that they would faithfully administer the property and legacies contained in the Will. [3] The Will directed, inter alia, that: i. Ms. Edna Jones’ interest in the NW 20-26-16 W3 be transferred to Kent; ii. the NW 29-24-14 W3 be transferred to Evan and the NE 30-24-14 W3 be transferred to Kent with direction to the executors that prior to making the transfers they should determine the values of these parcels and “may make such subdivisions or payments to equalize the values as may be required to ensure each gets the same value and that access to my son Kent Jones’ other quarter is maintained”; iii. specific equal financial bequests be made to Ms. Edna Jones’ grandchildren; and iv. the remainder, rest and residue of her estate was to be divided equally between her two sons, Evan and Kent. [4] The schedule of assets filed with the application for probate showed that Edna had one-third interest in the NW of 20. Kent had previously purchased the other two-thirds interests in the NW of 20 from two aunts (Edna’s sisters) and had been farming it, renting Edna’s one-third interest. This schedule of assets valued the NW of 29 at $181,000 and the NE of 30 at $301,000. Evan’s home site was located on the NE of 30. [5] Some financial bequests to grandchildren have been made and partial distributions to Kent and Evan have been made. At some point differences arose between Kent and Evan, the catalyst for and details of the differences am not able to determine from the evidence before me. However, an understanding of such differences is not necessary for, and indeed has no relevance to, the determinations make. [6] On October 13, 2017, Evan and his wife, Donna Lee Jones [Donna], filed notice of application with the Court seeking revocation of the grant of probate, and an order that the Will be proven in solemn form and related relief. Among the allegations made in support of this application are that: a. Edna lacked testamentary capacity when she executed the Will; b. fraud/forgery of the Will and the testator’s signature; and c. suspicious circumstances. [7] Faced with this, Kent and Rodney brought an originating application seeking, inter alia, an order removing Evan as an executor. This application is based upon the grounds that: i. by challenging the validity of the Will and seeking revocation of the grant of probate, Evan is in conflict of interest position and in breach of the undertaking he gave to the Court in his affidavit in support of the grant of probate to faithfully administer the property of the testator and the legacies contained in the Will, and ii. by his words and actions Evan has made it clear that he is not prepared to carry out the directions contained in the Will and he is refusing to co-operate with the other executors in taking steps necessary to properly administer the estate. [8] On December 14, 2017, these applications came before me in Chambers in Battleford. Donna took the position that she had status and sought to represent herself and her husband Evan on their application and in opposition to the application brought by Kent and Rodney. She based her position that she could represent and speak for Evan on the grounds that she had obtained power of attorney from Evan. [9] held that while the power of attorney may give her the power to make decisions for Evan in respect of legal matters, including instructing counsel, she was not entitled to represent Evan before the Court. In this respect relied upon s. 30 of The Legal Profession Act, 1990, SS 1990-91, L-10.1, which directs that no person other than member of the Law Society of Saskatchewan holding current practice certificate may practise at the bar of any court in Saskatchewan or commence, carry on or defend any action or proceeding in any court. [10] heard submissions by Donna in respect of whether she herself had status as proper party to the proceedings and held that since she was neither named beneficiary under the Will nor potential beneficiary in the event of an intestacy she had no status or right to be party to the proceedings. struck her out as an applicant in the notice of application that she and Evan had filed. [11] Having held that Donna had no status and that she was not entitled to represent Evan on the applications, the Court then contacted Evan by telephone so that he could make submissions on his own behalf. In respect of his application to revoke the grant of probate in respect of the Will, informed Evan that had concerns that the materials he filed suggested profound misunderstanding of the requirements at law to obtain revocation of probate and to have proof in solemn form ordered. suggested he may wish to consider obtaining legal advice. Evan advised the Court he was requesting an adjournment of his application so that he could seek legal advice. Counsel for Kent objected to the granting of such an adjournment. Since Evan was unrepresented and to give him an opportunity to put his best case forward, granted the adjournment sought and ordered Evan’s application be adjourned sine die returnable on 14 days’ notice. [12] then proceeded to hear submissions from Mr. Stooshinoff, counsel for Kent and Rodney, on their application to remove Evan as executor and Evan’s submissions in opposition to that application. The Applicable Law [13] This Court has the jurisdiction to remove an executor of an estate both pursuant to its inherent jurisdiction and pursuant to s. 17 of The Administration of Estates Act, SS 1998, A-4.1 [Act]. See Ocean Man Trust, Re (1993), 1993 CanLII 6781 (SK CA), 113 Sask 179 (CA); Figley Figley, 2012 SKCA 36 (CanLII), 393 Sask 44; and Sinclair Sinclair, 2013 SKCA 123 (CanLII), 427 Sask 36. [14] In the Court of Queen’s Bench decision of Whitworth Estate Whitworth, 2016 SKQB 369 (CanLII) [Whitworth], Mills J. stated, at para. 5, that s. 17 of the Act is the basis most applicants rely on to remove administrators or executors. He further stated that although “[n]o definition of ‘other special circumstances’ has been provided, however, it would seem obvious that the considerations respecting removal of an executor under the inherent jurisdiction of the Court would be included in the concept of ‘other special circumstances’”. He also stated as follows: In Sinclair and Figley the Court spoke to the factors to be considered in determining whether an executor should be removed from administering an estate. Those factors included: (1) Mistake, neglect of duty or inaccuracy of conduct of trustees sufficient to endanger the trust property; (2) Want of honesty; (3) Want of proper capacity to execute the duties of executor; (4) Want of reasonable fidelity; (5) The exercise of discretion to remove an executor is not to be undertaken lightly; (6) The overriding duty of the Court is to ensure the administration will be properly executed; and (7) The ultimate concern must be for the welfare of the beneficiaries. [15] In his decision in Hazlehurst Estate Re, 2007 SKQB 343 (CanLII), 301 Sask 121, Mills J. held that where there is dissension or disagreement between the executors as to the manner in which estate assets are to be administered and there seems no prospect for settling those differences that the existence of such dissension or disagreement is basis for removing an executor or trustee. Analysis [16] I find that the circumstances of this case constitute “special circumstances” within the meaning of s. 17 of the Act and that, as stated by Mills J. in Whitworth, the overriding duty of the Court to ensure the administration will be properly executed consistent with an ultimate concern for the welfare of the beneficiaries. [17] In his January 4, 2016 affidavit in support of grant of probate, Evan swore he believed the Will to contain the original Last Will and Testament of Edna May Jones and that he would faithfully administer the property and legacies contained in the Will. Now he is by his application and actions refuting those obligations to the estate and the Court and is challenging the very existence of valid will. This places him in profound conflict of interest position. [18] Evan cannot on one hand attack the validity of the Will while at the same time claim right to be an executor of that Will with all of the obligations that entails. As an executor who was given grant of probate, he is obligated to carry out the directions contained in the Will. By making the application he has, he is effectively stating that he is not prepared to give effect to the directions in the Will. The affidavit evidence of Kent and Rodney satisfies me that Evan is refusing to co‑operate in proper administration of the Will. [19] Evan is entitled to challenge the validity of the Will, as he has done in his application, but he is not entitled at the same time to remain as an executor of the Will. Unless and until the grant of probate is set aside and proof in solemn form is ordered by this Court, the grant of probate remains operative and carries with it the obligation of the executors to continue to administer the estate in accordance with the directions of the Will. It is clear that this is something that Evan will not do and thus he must be removed as an executor. [20] There is no evidence before me that suggests that either of Kent or Rodney have acted contrary to their obligations to administer the estate in accordance with the directions contained in the Will. Further, there is no basis to conclude that they will not continue to properly do their duty. [21] I am satisfied that this is a case in which I should exercise my jurisdiction to remove Evan as an executor of the estate of Edna May Jones and I order that he is removed as an executor in the grant of probate ordered by Gabrielson J. on July 20, 2016, and that Kent Jones and Rodney Argue shall continue as executors pursuant to that grant. [22] Having before this Court an application seeking revocation of the grant of probate, and an order that the Will be proven in solemn form and related relief, it is incumbent on Evan to act promptly in respect of his application, should he decide to proceed with that application. While valid grant of probate remains in existence, it is incumbent on the executors to properly administer the estate. [23] With view to balancing the interests of efficient and proper administration of the estate and to give Evan an opportunity to advance his application, direct Kent Jones and Rodney Argue to take no steps to distribute assets of the estate to beneficiaries or otherwise finalize the administration of the estate until after February 15, 2018. This will give Evan an opportunity to bring his application back before the Court for determination. The judge deciding such an application could, if he or she deems it appropriate, extend this direction. If Evan has not given notice to bring his application back before the Court by February 15, 2018, then, subject to further order of this Court, this direction shall expire. [24] My direction for Kent Jones and Rodney Argue to take no steps to distribute assets of the estate or otherwise finalize the administration of the estate until after February 15, 2018, does not operate to prevent the executors from: a. paying outstanding obligations; b. filing tax returns and making payment of tax obligations; or c. selling and transferring title of assets of the estate, with the exception of those parcels of land identified in paras. 2(d) and (e) of the Will. Conclusion and Orders [25] For the reasons set forth above, I order as follows:a. Evan Jones is removed as an executor in the grant of probate ordered by Gabrielson J. on July 20, 2016, and Kent Jones and Rodney Argue shall continue as executors pursuant to that grant;b. Kent Jones and Rodney Argue shall take no steps to distribute assets of the estate to beneficiaries or otherwise finalize the administration of the estate until after February 15, 2018. [26] While costs of the application were requested in the originating application of Kent Jones and Rodney Argue, submissions were not made in respect thereof. Accordingly, retain jurisdiction on the matter of costs, and on notice to Evan Jones will hear an application in respect of this matter. For the information of counsel and Evan Jones, am scheduled to do Battleford chambers on January 25, 2018, or telephone application can be scheduled through the Registrar.",c_2017skqb388.txt,"HELD: The application was granted.

Publishers of this case please take note that Section 486(3) of the Criminal Code applies and may require editing of this judgment or its heading before publication. The subsection provides: (3) Subject to subsection (3.1), where an accused is charged with an offence under section 151, 152, 153, 155, 159, 160, 170, 171, 172, 173, 271, 272, 273, 346 or 347, the presiding judge or justice may make an order directing that the identity of the complainant or of witness and any information that could disclose the identity of the complainant or witness shall not be published in any document or broadcast in any way. The reasons for judgment of the Court were issued orally by: JONES, J.A.: On June 15, 1994 G.A.L. was found guilty on two counts of indecent assault against S.S. and B.J.R. between January 1, 1973 and December 31, 1977. These assaults took place in trailer where the two girls, at the time, were living with their mother who was in common‑law relationship with G.A.L.. The assaults consisted of repeated fondling of the breasts and vagina of B.J.R. when she was between 13 and 16 years old. There was one incident of fondling of the breast of S.S. when she was between 14 and 17 and on another occasion, an attempt to pull down the zipper on her pants. B.J.R. and S.S. left home in 1977. B.J.R. made complaint with respect to these incidents in 1992. S.S. complained at the same time after talking to B.J.R.. At the time the first incident occurred G.A.L. was 55 years old. He was employed full time and was not user of drugs or alcohol. Shortly after the girls left home their mother moved in with them. Approximately two years after that G.A.L. married his present wife. There was a substantial conflict in the evidence. The appellant denied assaulting the complainants. The trial judge, after carefully considering the evidence, convicted the appellant on both counts. He sentenced the appellant to nine (9) months imprisonment with respect to the assault on B.J.R. to be followed by two years probation. The sentence on the second count was one month consecutive. The appellant has appealed from his convictions. There are five grounds of appeal. We have carefully considered the grounds of appeal and we can find no error on the part of the trial judge in conducting the trial or in weighing the evidence. The main issue on the trial was the matter of credibility. In assessing that issue the trial judge carefully considered the evidence of the witnesses including the contradictions in the testimony. After carefully reviewing the evidence we cannot say that the verdict was unreasonable or not supported by the evidence and accordingly the appeal is dismissed. Jones, J.A.

869,"[8] In describing how the accident occurred the defendant, Eric Craig stated in his affidavit: “4.
As advanced toward the traffic light, my speed was approximately 10 to 15 km per hour.
The bald statement in the pleadings does not disclose the existence of an actual or probable defence and cannot fend off an application for summary judgment.” [12] have listened to the argument of the defendant and have read her affidavits and material attached thereto.
In any event, I am satisfied when you read the material there was no “air of reality” to the defendant’s argument.
[13] The defendant also argued that plaintiff ought not to be successful in her application for summary judgment because she has not been able to establish the motor vehicle accident resulted in her suffering injuries.
states as follows: “I considered if this Rule authorizes me to issue summary judgment limited only to liability for the accident itself and not causation, because of its use of the words ""a part thereof"", but on reading the whole of Civil Procedure Rule 13.01, am satisfied that it means that summary judgment is not to be granted when there is any issue other than the amount of damages still in issue between the parties, which interpret to only be the case after causation has been determined as part of the summary judgment application.” [14] am satisfied upon reading the reports of Doctor Steve Crosby and Doctor Douglas Watt attached as appendix and to the plaintiff’s affidavit that the causation of certain amount of her physical injuries resulted from the accident.
The Court must exercise caution in assessing likely recovery of plaintiff in the early stages of litigation particularly where there is lack of medical opinion in the discovery of experts where necessary.
[20] Defence counsel has gone to great extent to show the Plaintiff’s prior conditions would all combine to contribute in significant way to her current health complaints.
Defence counsel states there is long medical history involved here and has argued strenuously there are credibility issues in relation to certain claims relating to her injuries.
[21] It is not the function of this court in determining the matter of an interim payment to make findings of credibility or even to dwell on them.
I am satisfied any amount of assessed damages which might be arrived at will depend largely upon credibility and medical evidence at trial.
As well there is question as to her claim involving loss of valuable service as to whether or not the amount claimed is appropriate when the plaintiff stated in discovery that she was able to do some housework and did so.
[23] The plaintiff’s damage claim is further complicated in this particular matter as a result of the recent amendments in 2003 to the Insurance Act, R.S.N.S.
On the information provided to the Court from both parties it is conceivable with the material before me, the plaintiff’s injuries could be described as minor.
[24] Thus, Court should be extremely cautious in approaching an award in this particular category in absence of significant medical evidence which would clearly establish this injury classification could be overcome.
[25] On a review of the material supplied for this application, I am not satisfied that this is an appropriate case to order an interim payment at this point in time and I decline to do so.
[27] Each party having been partially successful, would order no costs to either side.","The plaintiff, who was injured in a rear-end motor vehicle accident, applied for summary judgment and an interim payment of damages.
Application for summary judgment granted; application for interim payment dismissed.
There was no 'air of reality' to the defendant's defence; whether or not the plaintiff's brake lights were working, to strike her vehicle from behind on these facts meant that the defendant was either travelling too close or didn't have enough care and control of his vehicle.
The plaintiff was making a significant claim for damages but she suffered from numerous previous injuries and conditions relating to her health; any damage assessment would depend largely upon credibility and the medical evidence at trial; to assess interim damages in this case would be a most difficult task and would only be a haphazard guess.
The plaintiff's claim was also complicated by the fact that it could possibly be subject to the 'minor injury' cap on damages.",41,"IN THE SUPREME COURT OF NOVA SCOTIA Citation: Fournier v.

MacDonald Heard: June 10, 2005 in Port Hawkesbury, Nova Scotia Counsel: Gerald A. MacDonald, for the plaintiff Sandra Arab Clarke, for the defendant By the Court: [1] This is an application for an Order for summary judgement pursuant to Civil Procedure Rule 13 and an interim payment under Civil Procedure Rule 31.01. have read the affidavits on file as well as the briefs submitted by counsel. as well heard Counsel representing both sides in oral argument at the chambers hearing for this application. [2] Civil Procedural Rule 13.01 states as follows: 13.01. After the close of pleadings, any party may apply to the court for judgment on the ground that: (a) there is no arguable issue to be tried with respect to the claim or any part thereof; (b) there is no arguable issue to be tried with respect to the defence or any part thereof; or (c) the only arguable issue to be tried is as to the amount of any damages claimed. [3] The Plaintiff ,in order to succeed in summary judgement application, first has the obligation to prove her claim and then the burden shifts to the Defendant to satisfy the court that he has bonafide defence or at least an arguable issue to be tried before the court. He must disclose the nature of the defence or the issue to be tried with clarity through sufficient facts to indicate that it is bonafide defence or issue to be tried. [4] comprehensive review of the law applicable in summary judgement matters can be found in the judgement of Justice Jamie Saunders in Webber et al v. Canadian Surety Company (4) (1992) 112 N.S.R. (2d) 284. [5] The court must also be aware of the comments made by MacKeigan C.J.N.S. in Lunenburg County Press Ltd. v. Deamond (1977) 18 N.S.R. (2d) 689 at para. 5: We are very conscious, however, as Judge should be in dealing with an application of this sort, that summary judgment is summary proceeding which should not be lightly granted so as to deprive litigant of his right to have any bona fide case disposed of after full trial. We must accordingly allow the appeal and set aside the order of His Honour Judge Burke dated June 14, 1976. We direct that the costs of this appeal and of the application before Judge Burke be costs in the cause of the action.” [6] In this particular application involving a rear-end collision, there is a heavier burden upon the Defendant. This authority can be found in the words of Freeman, J.A. in MacNeil v. Black [1998] N.S.J. No. 83 at paragraph where he said as follows: “A further burden of proof, and considerably heavier one, falls on the defendant in rear‑end collision cases. The driver of the rear car must rebut presumption that the collision occurred as result of his negligence. See the judgment of Roscoe J. in Wilson v. McInnis (1992), 1992 CanLII 4671 (NS SC), 111 N.S.R. (2d) 78. [7] This accident happened at the intersection of Kings Road and Alexander Street in Sydney, Nova Scotia, on the 4th of March, 2004. The Plaintiff was operating her motor vehicle and said in her affidavit that she was struck from behind by one of the Defendants named in the action. [8] In describing how the accident occurred the defendant, Eric Craig stated in his affidavit: “4. THAT the intersection of Kings Road and Alexander Street is governed by traffic lights. As approached the intersection, noticed that there were three or four vehicles ahead of mine, including Pontiac Montana van (“Montana”) being operated by an individual who was later identified to me as the plaintiff, Michelle Fournier, and which was the vehicle immediately ahead of mine. 5. THAT two or three of the vehicles referred to in paragraph above proceeded through the traffic light. As advanced toward the traffic light, my speed was approximately 10 to 15 km per hour. As the traffic light turned red, did not see brake lights on the Montana and the front of my vehicle struck the rear bumper of the Montana.” [9] In second affidavit filed by Michelle Fournier, she stated as follows in paragraph and 5: 4. THAT attached hereto and marked Exhibit “A” by the person swearing this my Affidavit is photo of vehicle similar to the vehicle that was driving, which is Pontiac Montana, and the tail lights are quite high off the ground and would have been visible to any person paying the slightest attention to the vehicle in front of them. 5. THAT have checked with Pat LeBlanc, who repaired my vehicle after the accident and have checked with Shawn Aucoin, who was the insurance adjuster for my insurance, Co-Op Insurance, and both have declared to me that the tail lights were working when took the vehicle to be appraised and took it in for repair. [10] The defendant argues summary judgment ought not to be allowed because there is an arguable issue to be tried, namely, that even if one accepts the evidence of the Plaintiff that one has to consider the issue of contributory negligence. Mr. Craig said in his affidavit, he did not see any brake lights on the Montana. Thus the defendant says there is an issue as to whether or not they were on or working. Secondly, the defence argues there might possibly be contributory negligence issue in this case because the Plaintiff suddenly stopped. [11] adopt the position of Freeman, J.A. in MacNeil Black, supra at para 10, where he said: “The threshold for showing the existence of defence worthy of trial is not high one, but the defendant has not met it. The standard pleading that the plaintiff stopped abruptly, without more by way of supporting facts, lacks an air of reality. It does not meet, nor suggest how the defendant hoped to meet, the plaintiff's assertion that she had been stopped for 45 seconds. It was necessary for the defendant in his pleadings or by way of affidavit or other evidence to assert facts capable, if proven at trial, of rebutting the presumption that the collision resulted from his negligence. The bald statement in the pleadings does not disclose the existence of an actual or probable defence and cannot fend off an application for summary judgment.” [12] have listened to the argument of the defendant and have read her affidavits and material attached thereto. I am satisfied there has to be an “air of realty” to the defendant’s argument. If the brake lights did not work then the defendant drove straight into the rear of the plaintiff’s car. Secondly if the plaintiff stopped suddenly and as the defendant noted in his affidavit, the traffic light turned red then the plaintiff’s vehicle was supposed to stop as well. To strike the plaintiff’s vehicle from behind on these facts then the defendant was travelling too close or didn’t have enough care or control of his vehicle and consequently the collision occurred. In any event, I am satisfied when you read the material there was no “air of reality” to the defendant’s argument. [13] The defendant also argued that plaintiff ought not to be successful in her application for summary judgment because she has not been able to establish the motor vehicle accident resulted in her suffering injuries. The defendant referred to the case of Griffiths Martell [1999] N.S.J. No. 285. At paragraph Hamilton J.A. states as follows: “I considered if this Rule authorizes me to issue summary judgment limited only to liability for the accident itself and not causation, because of its use of the words ""a part thereof"", but on reading the whole of Civil Procedure Rule 13.01, am satisfied that it means that summary judgment is not to be granted when there is any issue other than the amount of damages still in issue between the parties, which interpret to only be the case after causation has been determined as part of the summary judgment application.” [14] am satisfied upon reading the reports of Doctor Steve Crosby and Doctor Douglas Watt attached as appendix and to the plaintiff’s affidavit that the causation of certain amount of her physical injuries resulted from the accident. [15] I am not satisfied the defendant has met the required burden and I allow the application. Judgement is entered against the respondent/defendant as to liability with damages to be assessed. [16] INTERIM PAYMENT The Plaintiff, now having obtained summary judgement, fulfills the conditional precedent for the application for interim payment under Rule 33.01 (A)(1). Which states as follows: “Nothwithstanding the provision of rule 33.01, the court may order the defendant to make an interim payment of such amount as it thinks just, not exceeding reasonable proportion of the damages which in the opinion of the court are likely to be recovered by the plaintiff after taking into account any relevant contributory negligence and any set off, cross-claim or counter-claim on which the defendant may be entitled to relay, if the court is satisfied: (a) that the defendant against whom the order is sought had admitted liability for the plaintiff’s damages or (b) the plaintiff has obtained judgment against the defendant for damages to be assessed. [17] The general principles involving interim payments where summary judgment has been allowed was discussed in Bogaczewicz Faulkner, [1997] N.S.J. No. 237. See also Mahoney Almeco Leasing Limited [1999] N.S.J. No. 390 and MacDonald MacPherson [1999] N.S.J. No. 283 affirmed on Appeal 1999 N.S.J. No. 445. The case law may be summarized as follows: 1. It is not the function of the Court in determining the matter of an interim payment to make findings of credibility or even to dwell on them. This might ultimately be for Trial Judge at an assessment of damages. 2. An Order of an interim payment is not mandatory. It is discretionary Order of the Chambers Judge. 3. The Court must exercise caution in assessing likely recovery of plaintiff in the early stages of litigation particularly where there is lack of medical opinion in the discovery of experts where necessary. 4. An application under Rule 33.01(A) is not to be trial or mini trial where an estimate of the plaintiff’s ultimate recovery can be difficult and may amount to nothing more than haphazard guess. In such cases the Court should refrain from making an order of interim payment. 5. In cases where there is considerable uncertainty existing as to what is likely to be recovered by the Plaintiff, the proper approach is that where the Court is faced with such degree of uncertainly, it should conclude that it is unable to make determination of reaching an opinion as to what is likely to be recovered in those damage areas of uncertainty. [18] The evidence submitted by way of the Plaintiff’s affidavits causes the court difficulty. The plaintiff is making a significant claim yet when one listens to defendant’s counsel and reads the material attached to the defendant’s affidavit, one concludes there is a significant amount of other factors relating to the health of the plaintiff. There is no doubt this would impact on any assessment of damages that might be made in this particular case. am looking at the evidence submitted in the affidavits without the benefit of any examination or cross examination before me in an attempt to decide what is likely to be recovered by the plaintiff. have however, read the discovery evidence of the plaintiff submitted as attached to the affidavit of Ms. Sandra Arab Clarke, the defendant’s counsel. [19] The plaintiff blames her neck injury, shoulder injuries, tingling in her hands and arms as well as other injuries on the accident. There is conflict in her evidence about her depression and other problems she is having with her health in the report of Doctor Watt dated November 8, 2004 where the plaintiff interpreted comments from visit with her family doctor that her problems were not related to her motor vehicle accident. [20] Defence counsel has gone to great extent to show the Plaintiff’s prior conditions would all combine to contribute in significant way to her current health complaints. These range from an injury to her right shoulder and elbow prior to the motor vehicle accident, tennis elbow in the right arm, malaise and fatigue, pain in joints, as well as obstructive lung defect to name but few. Defence counsel states there is long medical history involved here and has argued strenuously there are credibility issues in relation to certain claims relating to her injuries. [21] It is not the function of this court in determining the matter of an interim payment to make findings of credibility or even to dwell on them. I am satisfied any amount of assessed damages which might be arrived at will depend largely upon credibility and medical evidence at trial. The defendant argues there has yet to even be an independent medical examination of the plaintiff. In my opinion to assess any amount in this case at this point in time would be a most difficult task and would only be a haphazard guess. [22] Serious issues exist between the parties as to whether or not the plaintiff’s injuries sustained in the motor vehicle accident have resulted in any on going inability of the plaintiff to work in any capacity. As well there is question as to her claim involving loss of valuable service as to whether or not the amount claimed is appropriate when the plaintiff stated in discovery that she was able to do some housework and did so. [23] The plaintiff’s damage claim is further complicated in this particular matter as a result of the recent amendments in 2003 to the Insurance Act, R.S.N.S. 1989, C-23, especially as it would relate to non-pecuniary general damages. On the information provided to the Court from both parties it is conceivable with the material before me, the plaintiff’s injuries could be described as minor. If, after trial, Court assessed that Ms. Fournier suffered minor injury, it would bring her under the new legislation. Her general damages could be capped at $2,500. [24] Thus, Court should be extremely cautious in approaching an award in this particular category in absence of significant medical evidence which would clearly establish this injury classification could be overcome. It must be recalled that under the legislation the onus is on the plaintiff to prove that any injuries she sustained are not minor injuries. [25] On a review of the material supplied for this application, I am not satisfied that this is an appropriate case to order an interim payment at this point in time and I decline to do so. In my opinion, to assess any amount of interim payment on facts presented would be most difficult task and would only be haphazard guess. [26] However, as I said before, I would order summary judgment be entered against the defendant with damages to be assessed. [27] Each party having been partially successful, would order no costs to either side. [28] Order accordingly.",d_2005nssc322.txt,"The plaintiff, who was injured in a rear-end motor vehicle accident, applied for summary judgment and an interim payment of damages.

[12] will begin my analysis by exploring the standard upon which we should review the judge's decision.
Standard of Review [13] Under s. 676(1) of the Criminal Code, the Crown’s right to appeal is limited to questions of law.
[14] In this case, the Crown suggests that the judge misapplied well established legal principles when reviewing the JP's decision to issue the warrant.
Specifically they say that the trial judge applied an incorrect standard of review in that he failed to accord the JP’s decision sufficient deference.
The common law required evidence on oath which gave ""strong reason to believe"" that stolen goods were concealed in the place to be searched before warrant would issue.
Section 443 [now s. 487] of the Criminal Code authorizes warrant only where there has been information upon oath that there is ""reasonable ground to believe"" that there is evidence of an offence in the place to be searched.
[18] These same principles would apply to this case where the search warrant was sought under s. 11 of the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act (1996, c. 19).
[19] This reference to the issuing judge having “credibly-based probability” has been the subject of much judicial discussion over the years.
1456‑1457: (i) Hearsay statements of an informant can provide reasonable and probable grounds to justify search.
(ii) The reliability of the tip is to be assessed by recourse to ""the totality of the circumstances"".
[21] In a thorough and careful analysis, the judge unquestionably articulated the appropriate legal principles.
This concept involves the application of common sense as well as practical and non‑technical principles and is process not dealing with certainties but with probabilities: R. v. Gatfield [2002] O.J.
[23] From the outset, the trial judge expressed concern about the lack of corroboration regarding the alleged illegal acts.
30 In this case the primary evidence which could form the required grounds comes from information received from an anonymous source.
The references to information provided concerning two other persons is only slightly helpful and adds very little if any to support the source's credibility.
[24] The judge then acknowledged that some information did in fact corroborate the alleged illegal activity.
Is the corroboration therefore of the FLIR testing and the observations about the covered windows sufficiently strong to overcome the weaknesses identified in the other aspects under consideration.
heightened levels of heat at single instance, it is not sufficiently strong or probative to confirm the existence of the marihuana grow operation and to overcome the weaknesses in the source's information noted above.
While recognize that the FLIR testing has some probative value, cannot agree that it is equivalent to hydro readings such that this case is on all‑fours with Plant as the Crown suggests.
[25] The judge then appears to address the very question that the issuing JP was tasked to answer, i.e.
[26] acknowledge that later in this same paragraph the judge appears to address whether it would be possible for the JP to have acquired the requisite reasonable and probable grounds.
[29] For all these reasons conclude that the judge's approach to this issue reveals an extricable legal error which we must address.
As revealed in the voir dire, the tipster reported to have personal knowledge as opposed to reporting hearsay.
The FLIR results were probative not only in relation to other nearby dwellings, they also confirmed that the increased heat was coming from the basement.","The accused successfully challenged the sufficiency of the grounds to issue a search warrant that was used to search her residence.
Although the Information to Obtain was based on information from an anonymous, unproven source, the source's information was corroborated by independent information as to the accused's employment and residence.
The only corroboration of the presence of a crime (a suspected marijuana grow operation) was from a FLIR test.
The court found that the evidence did not rise above the level of suspicion, albeit strong suspicion.
Corroboration of the employment and residence of the accused did not provide particular support for the informant's credibility; neither were results of the FLIR test and the presence of covered windows sufficient corroboration.
The Crown appealed.
Appeal allowed; new trial ordered.
Although the trial judge articulated the proper test and began by analyzing whether the warrant could have been issued, the issue was later mistakenly transformed into whether he, himself, would have issued it.
By weighing the probative evidence, the trial judge effectively substituted his views for those of the issuing justice and wrongly required the issuing justice to draw proper inferences as opposed to reasonable inferences.",36,"NOVA SCOTIA COURT OF APPEAL Citation: R. v. Durling, 2006 NSCA 124 Date: 20061117 Docket: CAC 263729 Registry: Halifax Between: Her Majesty The Queen v. Jennifer Cynthia Durling Respondent Judges: MacDonald, C.J.N.S.; Cromwell and Fichaud, JJ.A. Appeal Heard: October 5, 2006, in Halifax, Nova Scotia Held: The appeal is allowed and a new trial is ordered, as per reasons for judgment of MacDonald, C.J.N.S.; Cromwell and Fichaud, JJ.A. concurring. Counsel: Monica G. McQueen and David R. Greener, for the appellant Christopher Manning, for the respondent Reasons for judgment: [1] The RCMP received Crime Stoppers tip suggesting that the respondent, Ms. Jennifer Durling, was growing marijuana in home she rented in Coldbrook, Kings County. Acting on this tip, Constable Gary R. Huett applied to Justice of the Peace Elizabeth Mullaly (""the JP"") and received warrant to search the home. In executing the warrant, the RCMP found evidence confirming the grow operation. Ms. Durling was charged with producing and possessing marijuana for the purpose of trafficking. [2] At trial before Provincial Court Judge Alan T. Tufts (""the judge""), Ms. Durling challenged the validity of the search warrant, alleging that it was issued without sufficient information. The judge agreed and quashed the warrant. This rendered the search unlawful and thereby presumptive breach of Ms. Durling's Charter rights. Consequently the judge excluded the evidence obtained in the search. This led to Ms. Durling's acquittal. [3] The Crown has appealed to this court. It submits that the JP had ample evidence to justify the warrant and that the judge misapplied established legal principles in ordering it quashed. Alternatively, the Crown maintains that even had the warrant been properly quashed, the police conduct did not justify excluding the evidence obtained in the search. [4] After carefully reviewing the record, believe, respectfully, that the judge misapplied the legal standard upon which he was to review the JP’s decision. Applying the proper standard of review of the decision to issue the warrant, conclude that the warrant was validly issued and that the judge erred in law by holding otherwise. Consequently, the evidence obtained as result of the search was wrongly excluded and had it been admitted, the result would not necessarily have been the same. Therefore, I would allow the appeal and order a new trial. [5] On April 7, 2005, Officer Huett applied for the search warrant by faxing the prescribed Information to Obtain to the JP. This was his second attempt that day to secure the warrant. The first application, an hour or so earlier, had been rejected by another justice of the peace, in part due to insufficient information. Officer Huett then made certain amendments and applied second time. The amended application went before different justice as result of shift change at the JP Centre and not because of any attempt by Officer Huett to ""judge shop"". [6] The amended application included details that summarize as follows: On March 17, 2005, Officer Huett received an anonymous Crime Stoppers tip reporting that one Jennifer Durling was growing marijuana in the basement of white house she was renting on Highway #1, Coldbrook. In the basement were ""huge lights"" plugged into outlets similar to those used for large appliances like stoves and dryers. The tipster also provided phone number for Ms. Durling and reported that she worked at Shirley's Travel Agency in the Cranbrooken Court complex, also in the Coldbrook area. On March 18, 2005, follow up investigation confirmed that this reported phone number was in fact subscribed to one Jennifer Durling at 6754 Highway #1, Coldbrook. On March 21, 2005, the investigators confirmed that the property was in fact rental property, as the tipster reported. On March 22, 2005, Officer Huett made patrol past this residence and noted it to be small white single storey bungalow with brick chimney. There was small wine coloured vehicle parked near the rear door. On March 23, 2005, investigators patrolled the parking lot of Cranbrooken Court and noted parked vehicle similar to the one earlier spotted at the suspect residence. They checked the license plate number and it turned out to be registered to one Jennifer Cynthia Durling, albeit at an address other than 6754 Highway #1. On this same date, the officers called the number for Shirley's Travel Agency and Jennifer Durling answered. In the ensuing week or so, the police drove past this residence on several occasions. Although lights were on and cars were in the driveway, nothing of any consequence was observed. Around this time there was second Crime Stoppers report from the same tipster re-confirming that the grow operation was ongoing and asserting that approximately 150 plants would soon be harvested. On April 6, 2005, in an effort to confirm these tips, the investigators utilized device designed to detect variances in heat as it is emitted from different structures. It is known as Forward Looking Infrared device or “FLIR”. The hand held device was aimed at the suspect residence. It detected an increased level of heat coming from the basement, as compared to the rest of the house. This would be consistent with marijuana grow operation where high powered lights emit significant heat. It is also consistent with the tipster’s report that the alleged operation was located in the basement. Furthermore, at this time, the investigators also noted that the basement windows were covered with material apparently designed to prevent light from being observed. On the same date, the FLIR was, as well, directed at several neighbouring residences. No similar elevated heat levels were detected. [7] On this information, the warrant was issued and the impugned search ensued. [8] At trial, the judge commenced voir dire to consider Ms. Durling's Charter challenge. By agreement, the investigators were cross-examined by Ms. Durling's counsel. This resulted in the information being supplemented in one aspect; namely, that the tipster reportedly had first hand information (as opposed to hearsay). The parties agreed that the judge could consider this additional information in his review. [9] The judge, troubled by what he felt was insufficient information to justify the warrant, declared it quashed. As noted, the evidence obtained in the search was then excluded resulting in Ms. Durling’s acquittal. [10] The Crown lists the following grounds of appeal: 1. That the trial judge erred in law in finding that there was violation of the Respondent’s rights under section of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms by the execution of search warrant upon the residence of the Respondent; 2. That the trial judge erred in law in failing to place appropriate weight upon the evidence gathered by the affiant Cst. Gary R. Huett, to corroborate the information provided by the confidential informant when evaluating the sufficiency of the grounds for obtaining the search warrant, as outlined in his information to obtain search warrant and amplified in his viva voce testimony at the trial; 3. That the trial judge erred in law in failing to place appropriate weight upon the evidence provided by the examination of the Respondent’s house by police with the Forward Looking Infrared (FLIR) imaging device, when evaluating the sufficiency of the grounds for obtaining the search warrant; 4. That the Learned Trial Judge erred in law in the application of the test enunciated in R. v. Garofoli for the review of an information to obtain search warrant, in determining that the evidence contained in the information to obtain search warrant was not sufficient to conclude that the issuing justice could have issued the warrant; 5. That the Learned Trial Judge erred in law in his application of the test for admitting or excluding the evidence seized by the police upon the execution of the said search warrant, pursuant to section 24(2) of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. [11] As will become evident, to dispose of this appeal need only consider ground #4 dealing with the judge's role in reviewing the JP's decision to issue the warrant. It involves the so-called Garofoli test. [12] will begin my analysis by exploring the standard upon which we should review the judge's decision. will then analyze the judge's role when reviewing the JP's decision to issue the warrant. Finally will assess whether, in this case, the trial judge properly executed his role. Standard of Review [13] Under s. 676(1) of the Criminal Code, the Crown’s right to appeal is limited to questions of law. trial judge’s interpretation or application of legal standard involves question of law. See R. v. Araujo, [2000] S.C.R. 902. [14] In this case, the Crown suggests that the judge misapplied well established legal principles when reviewing the JP's decision to issue the warrant. Specifically they say that the trial judge applied an incorrect standard of review in that he failed to accord the JP’s decision sufficient deference. If so, this would involve an extricable legal issue which in this context we would review on correctness standard. As this court in R. v. Shiers, 2003 NSCA 138 (CanLII), [2003] N.S.J. No. 453 (C.A.) observed: The issue here is not whether the Court of Appeal believes that the Information was sufficient. The issue is whether the reviewing judge applied the appropriate standard of review to the issuing judge's determination that the Information was sufficient. 10 Whether the reviewing court applied the appropriate standard of review to the decision of the lower tribunal is an issue of law which is reviewable by this Court under the principles stated in Housen v. Nikolaisen, 2002 SCC 33 (CanLII), [2002] S.C.R. 235 at para and Dr. Q. v. College of Physicians and Surgeons of British Columbia, [2003] S.C.J. 18, 2003 SCC 19 (CanLII) at para 43 44. [Emphasis added.] The Reviewing Judge's Role [15] What then was the judge's role when reviewing the JP's decision to issue search warrant? Simply put, he was to consider not whether he would have issued the warrant but instead whether the warrant could have been issued based on the relevant information provided. [16] This test can be traced back to the Supreme Court of Canada decision in R. v. Garofoli, 1990 CanLII 52 (SCC), [1990] S.C.R. 1421, where in the analogous context of wiretap authorization, Sopinka, concluded: 56 The reviewing judge does not substitute his or her view for that of the authorizing judge. If, based on the record which was before the authorizing judge as amplified on the review, the reviewing judge concludes that the authorizing judge could have granted the authorization, then he or she should not interfere. In this process, the existence of fraud, non‑disclosure, misleading evidence and new evidence are all relevant, but, rather than being prerequisite to review, their sole impact is to determine whether there continues to be any basis for the decision of the authorizing judge. [17] In what circumstances could warrant be justified? The prescribed test is an objective one. The issuing JP would have to have reasonable and probable grounds that an offence had been committed and that the search would uncover material evidence. In other words, credibly-based probability must replace suspicion. Thus, in Hunter v. Southam Inc., 1984 CanLII 33 (SCC), [1984] S.C.R. 145 at pp. 167-168, the Supreme Court concluded: Anglo‑Canadian legal and political traditions point to higher standard. The common law required evidence on oath which gave ""strong reason to believe"" that stolen goods were concealed in the place to be searched before warrant would issue. Section 443 [now s. 487] of the Criminal Code authorizes warrant only where there has been information upon oath that there is ""reasonable ground to believe"" that there is evidence of an offence in the place to be searched. The American Bill of Rights provides that ""no Warrants shall issue, but upon probable cause, supported by Oath or affirmation ...."" The phrasing is slightly different but the standard in each of these formulations is identical. The state's interest in detecting and preventing crime begins to prevail over the individual's interest in being left alone at the point where credibly‑based probability replaces suspicion. History has confirmed the appropriateness of this requirement as the threshold for subordinating the expectation of privacy to the needs of law enforcement. Where in the state's interest is not simply law enforcement as, for instance, where state security is involved, or where the individual's interest is not simply his expectation of privacy as, for instance, when the search threatens his bodily integrity, the relevant standard might well be different one. That is not the situation in the present case. In cases like the present, reasonable and probable grounds, established upon oath, to believe that an offence has been committed and that there is evidence to be found at the place of the search, constitutes the minimum standard, consistent with s. of the Charter, for authorizing search and seizure. In so far as subss. 10(1) and 10(3) of the Combines Investigation Act do not embody such requirement, would hold them to be further inconsistent with s. 8. [Emphasis added.] [18] These same principles would apply to this case where the search warrant was sought under s. 11 of the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act (1996, c. 19). [19] This reference to the issuing judge having “credibly-based probability” has been the subject of much judicial discussion over the years. In R. v. Morris, 1998 CanLII 1344 (NS CA), [1998] N.S.J. No. 492 (C.A.), Cromwell, J.A. of this court provided the following guidance: 30 Without attempting to be exhaustive, it might be helpful to summarize, briefly, the key elements of what must be shown to establish this ""credibly based probability"": (i) The Information to obtain the warrant must set out sworn evidence sufficient to establish reasonable grounds for believing that an offence has been committed, that the things to be searched for will afford evidence and that the things in question will be found at specified place: (R. v. Sanchez (1994), 1994 CanLII 5271 (ON SC), 93 C.C.C. (3d) 357 (Ont. Ct. Gen. Div.) at 365). (ii) The Information to obtain as whole must be considered and peace officers, who generally will prepare these documents without legal assistance, should not be held to the ""specificity and legal precision expected of pleadings at the trial stage."" (Sanchez, supra, at 364) (iii) The affiant's reasonable belief does not have to be based on personal knowledge, but the Information to obtain must, in the totality of circumstances, disclose substantial basis for the existence of the affiant's belief: R. v. Yorke (1992), 1992 CanLII 2521 (NS CA), 115 N.S.R. (2d) 426 (C.A.); aff'd 1993 CanLII 83 (SCC), [1993] S.C.R. 647. (iv) Where the affiant relies on information obtained from police informer, the reliability of the information must be apparent and is to be assessed in light of the totality of the circumstances. The relevant principles were stated by Sopinka, J. in R. v. Garofoli, 1990 CanLII 52 (SCC), [1990] S.C.R. 1421 at pp. 1456‑1457: (i) Hearsay statements of an informant can provide reasonable and probable grounds to justify search. However, evidence of tip from an informer, by itself, is insufficient to establish reasonable and probable grounds. (ii) The reliability of the tip is to be assessed by recourse to ""the totality of the circumstances"". There is no formulaic test as to what this entails. Rather, the court must look to variety of factors including: (a) the degree of detail of the ""tip""; (b) the informer's source of knowledge; (c) indicia of the informer's reliability such as past performance or confirmation from other investigative sources. (iii) The results of the search cannot, ex post facto, provide evidence of reliability of the information. 31 The fundamental point is that these specific propositions define the basic justification for the search: the existence of ""credibly‑based"" probability that an offence has been committed and that there is evidence of it to be found in the place of search. [20] Incorporating these principles, Fichaud, J.A. in R. v. Shiers, supra, succinctly summarized the test: 15 Based on these principles, the reviewing judge should have applied the following test. Could the issuing judge, on the material before her, have properly issued the warrant? Specifically, was there material in the Information from which the issuing judge, drawing reasonable inferences, could have concluded that there were reasonable grounds to believe that controlled substance, something in which it was contained or concealed, offence‑related property or any thing that would afford evidence of an offence under the CDSA was in Mr. Shiers' apartment? Did the Judge Apply the Proper Test? [21] In a thorough and careful analysis, the judge unquestionably articulated the appropriate legal principles. Quite properly, he acknowledged that his task was not to rehear the matter or to substitute his views for those of the issuing JP: It is not for this court to substitute its own opinion for that of the issuing Justice of the Peace: R. v. Garofoli, 1990 CanLII 52 (SCC), [1990] S.C.R. 1421. It is not whether this court would have issued search warrant based on the Information to Obtain but whether Justice of the Peace could with the evidence now before me with the deletions made to protect the identity of the anonymous source, have properly reached that conclusion that reasonable and probable grounds existed. In short it is whether reasonable inferences can be drawn from the contents of the Information to Obtain which could establish reasonable and probable grounds to determine if evidence of crime could be found in the impugned place. As referred to above that requires consideration of whether there is present credibly based probability. The whole of the Information to Obtain needs to be considered. It does not, however, need to be based on personal knowledge: R. v. Morris (1998), 1998 CanLII 1344 (NS CA), 134 C.C.C. (3d) 539. The sufficiency of the grounds will depend on the circumstances and there is no fixed formula for what constitutes reasonable grounds. This concept involves the application of common sense as well as practical and non‑technical principles and is process not dealing with certainties but with probabilities: R. v. Gatfield [2002] O.J. No. 166. The task then is to determine if sufficient evidence is present, that is credible and probative to establish probability that evidence of crime will be found in the place named or more particularly whether Justice of the Peace could reach that conclusion. [22] However, despite this, remain concerned with how the trial judge applied the test that he so ably articulated. In reviewing his judgment as a whole, regrettably, I believe that what began as an analysis of whether the warrant could have been issued became transformed into an exercise where the judge ultimately considered whether he would have issued it. In other words, respectfully, the judge in the end substituted his view of the evidence for that of the issuing JP. This led him down the road to reversible error. Let me elaborate by referring to the relevant passages in his judgment. [23] From the outset, the trial judge expressed concern about the lack of corroboration regarding the alleged illegal acts. In other words, while many of the perfectly legal details provided by the tipster were corroborated i.e. name, address, place of work there was limited corroboration of any alleged illegal activity. He observed: 29 In my opinion, therefore, corroboration of only portion of the source's information, particularly innocent information such as his/her place of residence and employment particulars, only marginally adds to the strength of the informant's evidence and in particular where these corroborated pieces of information could be easily known by wide number of persons it adds very little to the source's credibility. 30 In this case the primary evidence which could form the required grounds comes from information received from an anonymous source. There is no other evidence of crime. The other evidence is only capable, at best, of corroborating the source's information. 31 The source is unproven and anonymous. There is very little to support the source's trustworthiness. The references to information provided concerning two other persons is only slightly helpful and adds very little if any to support the source's credibility. 32 For the reasons expressed above, corroboration of the suspect's connection to the impugned residence and her employment particulars, while confirming who the information pertains to and the location referenced, does little to strengthen the allegations regarding the marihuana grow operation. 33 There are some compelling features of the source's allegation, being the reference to the basement of the residence and the reference to the ""huge lights plugged into outlets like those for stoves or dryers."" References to the type of drugs, that is marihuana, and the fact that they are soon to be harvested, while somewhat detailed, are in my opinion not compelling details. 34 Although the Information to Obtain does not appear to reveal if the information's source of information was firsthand or not, Constable Huett in his testimony during the voir dire indicated that the source's information was firsthand. [24] The judge then acknowledged that some information did in fact corroborate the alleged illegal activity. This included the FLIR test results and the covered windows. This is where believe the judge began to slip into error. He clearly acknowledged that this information was probative. However he then proceeded to weigh this evidence; thus effectively substituting his views for those of the issuing JP. For example, he weighed the FLIR results and found them to be more probative than evidence of hydro usage: 36 It is, however, the totality of the circumstances or the whole of the evidence which needs to be examined. Here the source has provided information about specific individual ‑‑ the accused Jennifer Durling. The source is unproven and anonymous. The information about the grow operation, while disclosing few details is not, in my opinion, compelling. In my opinion the source is neither credible nor is the information compelling. Is the corroboration therefore of the FLIR testing and the observations about the covered windows sufficiently strong to overcome the weaknesses identified in the other aspects under consideration. In my opinion it is not. Clearly the FLIR testing is supportive and consistent with the allegation however because of the limited information it conveys, i.e. heightened levels of heat at single instance, it is not sufficiently strong or probative to confirm the existence of the marihuana grow operation and to overcome the weaknesses in the source's information noted above. While recognize that the FLIR testing has some probative value, cannot agree that it is equivalent to hydro readings such that this case is on all‑fours with Plant as the Crown suggests. [Emphasis added.] [25] The judge then appears to address the very question that the issuing JP was tasked to answer, i.e.: Was there enough evidence to establish credibly‑based probability? ¶ 37 In my opinion considering the totality of the circumstances, the evidence does not rise above the level of suspicion, albeit strong suspicion. It does not amount, in my opinion, to credibly‑based probability. [26] acknowledge that later in this same paragraph the judge appears to address whether it would be possible for the JP to have acquired the requisite reasonable and probable grounds. This is reflective of the proper test: ... It is not possible, in my opinion, for Justice of the Peace, given the evidence contained in the Information to Obtain, as edited, to properly draw the required inferences necessary to conclude that reasonable and probable grounds existed that evidence of marihuana grow operation were present in this residence. [Emphasis added.] [27] Yet in this same passage, the judge seems to suggest that the issuing JP had to draw proper inferences as opposed to reasonable inferences as the test prescribes (and as the judge carefully articulated earlier in his judgment). Respectfully, this is an incorrect approach. The issuing JP was entitled to draw her own inferences as long as they were reasonable. She was not restricted to only those inferences deemed proper (presumably by the reviewing judge). This approach therefore unduly restricted the level of deference to which the JP was entitled. By misapplying the standard of review in this way, the judge erred in law. [28] In summary, it appears that the judge began his analysis by properly considering whether the JP could issue the warrant, but effectively ended up considering whether he would have issued the warrant in these circumstances. Again, that was not his role. [29] For all these reasons conclude that the judge's approach to this issue reveals an extricable legal error which we must address. Specifically, it now falls to us to apply the proper test. For example, in R. v. Shiers, supra, Fichaud, J.A. observed: 27 By overturning the warrant without considering whether there was evidence in the Information from which the issuing judge could reasonably draw the connecting inferences, the reviewing judge substituted her discretion for that of the issuing judge, which was an error of law. 28 As the Supreme Court of Canada stated in Dr. Q,. supra, para 43 44, if the lower court has not applied the correct standard of review, this Court must apply that standard. [Emphasis added.] [30] Thus, based on the information provided in this case, as supplemented in the voir dire, ask whether the JP could have issued the warrant? For the following reasons, would say that she could: The tipster was specific as to the respondent's identity, her phone number, her employment, the location of her residence, and the fact that the premises were leased. This was all corroborated by the police. As revealed in the voir dire, the tipster reported to have personal knowledge as opposed to reporting hearsay. The FLIR results were probative not only in relation to other nearby dwellings, they also confirmed that the increased heat was coming from the basement. This corroborates the tipster's report. The covered basement windows further corroborated the alleged illegal activity. [31] Thus, on the evidence presented, conclude that the search warrant was quashed in error. The warrant having been valid, the search was lawful and there was no allegation that it was otherwise unreasonable. Accordingly, on the evidence, there was no breach of s. of the Charter and no basis on which to exclude the fruits of the search. Had that evidence not been excluded, the result of the trial would not necessarily have been the same. It follows that the appeal should be allowed and a new trial ordered. DISPOSITION [32] I would allow the appeal and order a new trial. MacDonald, C.J.N.S. Concurred in: Cromwell, J.A. Fichaud, J.A.",d_2006nsca124.txt,"The accused successfully challenged the sufficiency of the grounds to issue a search warrant that was used to search her residence.
Although the Information to Obtain was based on information from an anonymous, unproven source, the source's information was corroborated by independent information as to the accused's employment and residence.
The only corroboration of the presence of a crime (a suspected marijuana grow operation) was from a FLIR test.
The court found that the evidence did not rise above the level of suspicion, albeit strong suspicion.
Corroboration of the employment and residence of the accused did not provide particular support for the informant's credibility; neither were results of the FLIR test and the presence of covered windows sufficient corroboration.
The Crown appealed.
Appeal allowed; new trial ordered.
Although the trial judge articulated the proper test and began by analyzing whether the warrant could have been issued, the issue was later mistakenly transformed into whether he, himself, would have issued it.
By weighing the probative evidence, the trial judge effectively substituted his views for those of the issuing justice and wrongly required the issuing justice to draw proper inferences as opposed to reasonable inferences."

At the hearing of her motion for date and directions in appeal court Chambers on April 28, Justice Duncan R. Beveridge dismissed her application to have the Crown or the AGNS pay for the transcript certification and set dates.
Saunders in appeal court Chambers on September 28, granted the adjournment without day and gave Ms. Cummings until October 28 to file electronically everything she intended to file with respect to the Criminal Appeal specifically her fresh evidence, her factum on the merits and supplementary factum on her fresh evidence motion.
[7] On December Ms. Cummings appeared before Justice Linda L. Oland in appeal court Chambers and indicated she could file everything by February 13, 2012.
Counsel for the respondents did not move for dismissal, but declared their intention to bring motions to dismiss the Criminal Appeal if Ms. Cummings failed to file on February 13.
Justice Oland directed Ms. Cummings to file everything by the “drop-dead date” of February 13, and restated that the respondents could apply to dismiss the Criminal Appeal if she did not do so.
[10] Ms. Cummings filed her notice of appeal from Justice Coughlan’s decision in this Court on July 13, 2011.
On September 27, Ms. Cummings made motion for date and directions to be heard on October 13 and notified the court that supporting affidavit and brief would be filed by October 4.
declined to hear it until Ms. Cummings complied with Justice Beveridge’s July 28, 2011 direction to correct the named respondents.
On April 4, she filed an amended notice of appeal naming the correct respondents and also making substantive changes.

Ms. Cummings’ Motion [13] It is not necessary that respond to everything sought by Ms. Cummings in her motion, given my decision to dismiss both of her appeals for failure to perfect.
[15] Second, dismiss Ms. Cummings’ motion to have the respondents pay the cost of certifying the 1,700 pages of transcript she wants to put before this Court on her appeals.
It may also occur if an appellant fails to comply with directions given for filing the appeal book and facta.
[17] Rule 90.40(2) provides me with similar authority to dismiss civil appeal.
Her logic is that the respondents are representatives of the Crown, and are thus responsible for the actions of the police and the RCMP in arresting and charging her from time to time (which in one case she alleges caused her to lose records she feels are relevant to her appeals) and for the actions of the “Provincial Court” in continuing to try to conduct trials involving her.
But there is no suggestion they will change, so as to permit her to comply with the filing she is required to do in order to get her appeal to the point where it can be dealt with by this Court.
She has not ordered transcript in compliance with Rule 90.26, filed properly completed certificate of readiness or made proper motion for date and directions.",",  motions granted.
Both appeals are dismissed as a result of the appellant's failure to perfect, including her failure to file necessary materials or comply with the court's directions to do so.
While a dismissal of the criminal appeal is a serious remedy, since it means it will never be heard on its merits, the appellant has made it clear that she cannot provide certified transcripts unless the court orders the respondents to pay.
The court has already declined to do so.
There is no suggestion a further extension of time will result in the appellant perfecting the appeal.",389,"NOVA SCOTIA COURT OF APPEAL Citation: R. v. Cummings, 2012 NSCA 52 Date: 20120511 Registry: Halifax Between: CAC 341990 Wanda Cummings v. Her Majesty the Queen Respondent And Between: CA 352311 Wanda Cummings v. Her Majesty the Queen in right of the Province of Nova Scotia and The Honourable Judge Robert A. Stroud Respondents Judge: The Honourable Justice M. Jill Hamilton Motion Heard: May 3, 2012, in Halifax, Nova Scotia, In Chambers Held: The appellant’s motion to consolidate both appeals and to have the respondents pay to certify the transcript is dismissed. The appellant’s appeals, CAC 341990 and CA 352311, are hereby dismissed for failure to perfect. Counsel: Wanda Cummings, appellant, in person William D. Delaney, Q.C., for the Crown Sheldon Choo, for the Attorney General of Nova Scotia [1] On May 3, 2012 heard several motions concerning two appeals CAC 341990, being Ms. Cummings appeal of the November 29, 2010 decision of Justice Douglas L. MacLellan, (“Criminal Appeal”) and CA 352311, being her appeal of the June 29, 2011 decision of Justice Richard Coughlan, (“Civil Appeal”). heard Ms. Cummings’ motion to (1) consolidate her two appeals, (2) stay all matters in Provincial Court in which she is involved, (3) amend her notice of appeal in the Civil Appeal, (4) seal the court files, issue non-publication order and grant leave to file materials anonymously in her appeals and (5) require that one of the respondents pay for the preparation of the appeal book and for the certification of the approximately 1,700 pages of transcript that she has typed herself or, in the alternative, allow her to file all required materials electronically, including uncertified transcripts. also heard the Attorney General of Nova Scotia’s (“AGNS”) motions to dismiss both appeals on the basis Ms. Cummings has failed to perfect them in accordance with the Nova Scotia Civil Procedure Rules, and the motion of the Crown to dismiss the Criminal Appeal on the same basis. Criminal Appeal [2] The background of the Criminal Appeal is that on June 5, 2008, Judge Laurel J. Halfpenny-MacQuarrie of the Provincial Court found that (1) Ms. Cummings had committed the acteus reus of the offence of public mischief under Section 140 of the Criminal Code, R.S.C., 1985, c. C-46, when she reported an offence of assault with weapon to an RCMP officer, causing him to enter into an investigation, when the alleged offence had not been committed and (2) she was not criminally responsible with respect to this charge. Ms. Cummings was remanded to the Nova Scotia Forensic Hospital for disposition and on July 8, 2008 was granted an absolute discharge with respect to this charge. Approximately two years later, in July 2010, Ms. Cummings applied for an extension of time to appeal these decisions. Justice MacLellan, acting as summary conviction appeal court judge, refused to grant the extension on November 29, 2010. [3] Ms. Cummings filed notice of appeal, appealing his decision to this Court, on December 20, 2010. On January 11, 2011, she filed an amended notice of appeal and, on April 15, filed motion for date and directions, seeking dates and an order “compelling the Crown to absorb the cost of transcript certification”. On April 18, she filed motion for fresh evidence. At the hearing of her motion for date and directions in appeal court Chambers on April 28, Justice Duncan R. Beveridge dismissed her application to have the Crown or the AGNS pay for the transcript certification and set dates. Ms. Cummings was directed to file the appeal book and her fresh evidence by June 22 and her factum by July 22. The respondents were to file their facta, together with their response to the fresh evidence motion, by August 25. The Criminal Appeal was to be heard for one‑half day on October 18, 2011. [4] On June 20, 2011 Ms. Cummings filed motion seeking sealing order, publication ban and the right to file all materials anonymously with respect to the Criminal Appeal and all Provincial Court matters relating to her. On June 22 she filed an appeal book and factum “in support of Motion for Fresh Evidence”. Her “confidentiality” motion, heard in appeal court Chambers on June 30, was dismissed by Justice Peter M. S. Bryson. Subsequently, the Registrar extended the filing dates with Ms. Cummings to file on August and the respondent on September 19. [5] Nothing was filed by Ms. Cummings and on September 21, she made motion to adjourn the hearing of her appeal, to file her materials electronically, including her fresh evidence material which she estimated would be approximately 300 to 400 pages, to seal the court file, to order non-publication ban and to permit her to file anonymously. Justice Jamie W.S. Saunders in appeal court Chambers on September 28, granted the adjournment without day and gave Ms. Cummings until October 28 to file electronically everything she intended to file with respect to the Criminal Appeal specifically her fresh evidence, her factum on the merits and supplementary factum on her fresh evidence motion. He directed the parties to reappear before him on November for the purpose of setting dates for the respondents to file their facta and for the hearing of the Criminal Appeal. With respect to the “confidentiality” motion, he reminded Ms. Cummings that that issue had been determined by Justice Bryson. No material was filed by Ms. Cummings prior to the October 28 deadline. [6] At the November appearance, Ms. Cummings requested further adjournment. After attempting to ascertain from Ms. Cummings reliable date certain by which she could file her material, Justice Saunders adjourned the matter to December requesting that Ms. Cummings be prepared at that time to provide the Court with definite time-line that she could meet. He noted the demand on the Court’s and the respondents’ resources occasioned by Ms. Cummings’ delays, ordered that transcript of the appearance be produced and be provided to the parties, and stated that it would be open to the respondents on December to move to dismiss the Criminal Appeal in the event Ms. Cummings did not provide an acceptable proposal with respect to filing and hearing dates. [7] On December Ms. Cummings appeared before Justice Linda L. Oland in appeal court Chambers and indicated she could file everything by February 13, 2012. Counsel for the respondents did not move for dismissal, but declared their intention to bring motions to dismiss the Criminal Appeal if Ms. Cummings failed to file on February 13. Justice Oland directed Ms. Cummings to file everything by the “drop-dead date” of February 13, and restated that the respondents could apply to dismiss the Criminal Appeal if she did not do so. [8] Ms. Cummings did not file her materials by February 13. Instead she sent letter to the Registrar inquiring about dates when she could make motion similar to the one presently before me, which she indicated she intended to make. will now outline the background of the Civil Appeal, before setting out what happened after February 13, 2012. Civil Appeal [9] The background of the Civil Appeal begins on June 9, 2011 when Judge Robert A. Stroud of the Provincial Court ordered that Ms. Cummings’ trial with respect to number of charges (resisting arrest, assault, failure to comply with an undertaking, public mischief and false, frivolous and vexatious calls), relating to the period from September 2007 to April 2009, proceed on June 14, 2011. On June 13, Ms. Cummings filed in the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia, notice of judicial review of Judge Stroud’s decision, claiming the Provincial Court had lost jurisdiction. Orally, on June 29, 2011, Justice Coughlan (1) struck Ms. Cummings’ notice of judicial review and (2) refused to order all materials filed in that proceeding be sealed, publication ban or leave to file all materials anonymously. His written decision is dated August 24, 2011. [10] Ms. Cummings filed her notice of appeal from Justice Coughlan’s decision in this Court on July 13, 2011. In appeal court Chambers on July 28, Justice Beveridge directed Ms. Cummings to file an amended notice of appeal naming only Her Majesty the Queen and Judge Stroud as respondents, to make motion for date and directions once Justice Coughlan’s order was issued and to give notice of any further proceedings to the AGNS and the Public Prosecution Service. Counsel for the AGNS subsequently obtained the order from Justice Coughlan and filed it with the court. On September 27, Ms. Cummings made motion for date and directions to be heard on October 13 and notified the court that supporting affidavit and brief would be filed by October 4. On October 12, her motion was removed from the docket as she had not amended her notice of appeal as directed by Justice Beveridge and had not provided the supporting affidavit and brief referenced in her motion documents. [11] Ms. Cummings did nothing further on the Civil Appeal until February 13, 2012. On that date, as referred to in paragraph above, she sent letter to the Registrar inquiring about dates for motion, similar to her motion now before me, which she indicated she intended to make. The Registrar provided this information. On March 26, Ms. Cummings attempted to file her motion. declined to hear it until Ms. Cummings complied with Justice Beveridge’s July 28, 2011 direction to correct the named respondents. On April 4, she filed an amended notice of appeal naming the correct respondents and also making substantive changes. [12] On April 11 counsel for the AGNS filed his motions seeking the dismissal of both appeals. On April 12 the Crown filed its motion for the dismissal of the Criminal Appeal. Ms. Cummings sent numerous emails to and left numerous telephone messages for the Registrar during April in connection with the motions before me. directed the parties to appear before me in Chambers on April 26, at which time asked Ms. Cummings when she could file electronically everything she wanted me to consider in connection with her motion and in response to the dismissal motions. She indicated she could do this by May 1, and on that date she filed CD containing her brief and approximately 3,500 pages of historical motions, applications, affidavits, briefs, case authority, materials from court files, emails and letters dating back to 2006. Included were approximately 1,700 pages of transcript that Ms. Cummings typed and which have not been certified by certified court reporter as required by the Rules. These pages represent the transcripts of 82 court appearances involving Ms. Cummings from 2006 to the present, in Provincial Court, Supreme Court and this Court. Only two, comprising less than one hundred pages in total, are required by the Rules for her appeals. She feels, however, that she must provide all of these transcripts for her appeals, so that the issues she wishes this Court to deal with on her appeals can be dealt with. Ms. Cummings’ Motion [13] It is not necessary that respond to everything sought by Ms. Cummings in her motion, given my decision to dismiss both of her appeals for failure to perfect. will, however, deal with two. [14] First, with respect to Ms. Cummings’ motion to consolidate both appeals, do not accept Ms. Cummings’ argument that the appeals concern the same matters. If this Court’s function was to conduct an inquiry into and adjudicate her many allegations of miscarriage of justice, abuse of process, violation of the Code and the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms and the general wrongdoing of participants in the justice system with whom she has been involved from 2006 to the present, which have not been previously adjudicated and were not dealt with in the decisions under appeal, there may be some interrelationship between her two appeals. However, as has been pointed out to her, that is not the function of this Court. This Court’s function is generally to review specific decision of specific judge or tribunal for error. Ms. Cummings has not satisfied me that these appeals raise common question of fact or law, involve the same ground of appeal, involve the same or similar decision-makers, involve the same occurrences or are in the interests of the parties. To the contrary, one appeal is civil, the other criminal. The legal issues raised in each are distinct. The facts from which they arise are different. They are decisions of different judges given at different times. dismiss Ms. Cummings’ motion to consolidate. [15] Second, dismiss Ms. Cummings’ motion to have the respondents pay the cost of certifying the 1,700 pages of transcript she wants to put before this Court on her appeals. First, less than 100 of these pages are required to be included in the appeal books. Second, Justice Beveridge dismissed similar motion on April 28, 2011. Third, there is no authority under the Rules for me to order the respondents to pay the cost of transcripts for the appellant; R. v. MacDonald, 2003 NSCA 27 (CanLII), para. 6; LeBrun v. Woodward, 2001 NSCA (CanLII), para. 5. Dismissal Motions [16] Rule 91.20 authorizes me, as single judge of this court in Chambers, to dismiss criminal appeal if the appellant fails to perfect it in compliance with Rule 91. This may occur if an appellant fails to apply, within 80 days of filing the notice of appeal, for dates for filing the appeal book and facta and the hearing of the appeal (91.12(1), (2)). It may also occur if an appellant fails to comply with directions given for filing the appeal book and facta. [17] Rule 90.40(2) provides me with similar authority to dismiss civil appeal. For civil appeals, Rule 90.43(1) provides that perfected appeal is one where the appellant has complied with the Rules with regards to the form and service of the notice of appeal, has applied for date and directions in conformity with Rule 90.25 (80 days after filing the notice of appeal in this case), has filed the certificate of readiness in conformity with Rule 90.26, has ordered copies of the transcripts in compliance with Rule 90.26 and has filed and delivered the appeal book and the appellant’s factum. Criminal Appeal [18] With respect to her Criminal Appeal, Ms. Cummings has repeatedly failed to file the material necessary for her to proceed with her appeal and has failed to comply with directions given to her by various judges of this Court over many months with respect to filing these materials. She repeatedly blames the respondents for her delay. Her logic is that the respondents are representatives of the Crown, and are thus responsible for the actions of the police and the RCMP in arresting and charging her from time to time (which in one case she alleges caused her to lose records she feels are relevant to her appeals) and for the actions of the “Provincial Court” in continuing to try to conduct trials involving her. am not satisfied the respondents are responsible for any delay in connection with her Criminal Appeal. Rather, recognizing that Ms. Cummings is self-represented, they delayed bringing their motions for dismissal until they felt there was no chance she would perfect her Criminal Appeal. [19] The Criminal Appeal has dragged on for almost year. Ms. Cummings has known since at least November, 2011 that if she did not file her materials as required her Criminal Appeal may be dismissed. Despite this, we are no closer, six months later, to having the required materials filed and the appeal set down and heard. [20] Given that dismissal of her Criminal Appeal prevents Ms. Cummings from having the merits of her Criminal Appeal determined, which she makes clear are of vital importance to her personally and which she believes are also of great public importance because they involve finding that she was not criminally responsible with respect to the public mischief charge, carefully considered whether it would be just to give her one last chance to file her materials by setting new drop-dead dates and providing that, if she doesn’t comply, the respondents could apply to me on an ex parte basis for dismissal. I am convinced there is no merit to this, given Ms. Cummings’ position that she cannot provide certified transcripts, unless I order the respondents to pay, which I have indicated I am not prepared to do. As argued by the AGNS, it would be unsafe to rely on uncertified transcripts. Ms. Cummings’ suggestion at the end of the hearing, when she saw the handwriting on the wall, that perhaps she could ask legal aid to pay for this, is not realistic. [21] Ms. Cummings has fully and often explained why she has not filed her material on time. The personal circumstances she describes are difficult. But there is no suggestion they will change, so as to permit her to comply with the filing she is required to do in order to get her appeal to the point where it can be dealt with by this Court. [22] I dismiss her Criminal Appeal for failure to perfect. Civil Appeal [23] I also dismiss Ms. Cummings’ Civil Appeal for failure to perfect. Ten months after she filed her notice of appeal in her Civil Appeal, no dates have been set for the filing of the required materials or the hearing of the appeal because of Ms. Cummings’ seeming inability to comply on timely basis with the Rules. She has not ordered transcript in compliance with Rule 90.26, filed properly completed certificate of readiness or made proper motion for date and directions. [24] In summary, Ms. Cummings’ motions to consolidate her two appeals and to have the respondents pay to certify the transcripts are dismissed The respondents’ motions to dismiss her Criminal and Civil Appeals are granted. Hamilton, J.A.",d_2012nsca52.txt,",  motions granted.
Both appeals are dismissed as a result of the appellant's failure to perfect, including her failure to file necessary materials or comply with the court's directions to do so.
While a dismissal of the criminal appeal is a serious remedy, since it means it will never be heard on its merits, the appellant has made it clear that she cannot provide certified transcripts unless the court orders the respondents to pay.
The court has already declined to do so.
There is no suggestion a further extension of time will result in the appellant perfecting the appeal."

September 24, 2013 [1] This fiat deals with three applications two by the plaintiff The Crown Hand Pub Ltd., the other by the plaintiff Hello Baby Equipment Inc. to cross-examine on affidavits filed in relation to applications to stay and/or for carriage of these class action proceedings. [2] Merchant Law Group (“MLG”) has commenced proposed class action against the defendants in Saskatchewan as Q.B.G. 1206 of 2012. The action, which names The Crown Hand Pub Ltd. as the proposed representative plaintiff, will be referred to as “the MLG Action”. [3] Two law firms (Branch McMaster LLP and Camp Fiorante Mathews Mogerman, both of Vancouver, B.C.) (the “Consortium”) have commenced proposed class action in Saskatchewan as Q.B.G. 133 of 2013. That action, which names Hello Baby Equipment Inc. as the proposed representative plaintiff, will be referred to as the “Consortium Action”. [4] The MLG Action and the Consortium Action raise the identical issues of fees paid by merchants in connection with Visa and Mastercard credit card transactions. There are five other credit card class actions advancing the same claims in other Canadian jurisdictions: one in Ontario (Bancroft Snell v. Visa Canada Corporation, OSCJ No. VC-11-426591 CP (Toronto) (the “Ontario Action”); one in British Columbia [Watson v. Bank of America Corporation, SCBC No. VLC-S-S-112003 (Vancouver) (the “BC Action”); one in Quebec [9085-4886 Quebec Inc. and Bakopanos v. Visa Canada Corporation, Superior Court of Quebec No. 500-06-00549-101 (Montreal) (the “Quebec Action”); and two in Alberta [Macaronis Hair Club and Laser Centre Inc., operating as Fuze Salon v. BofA Canada Bank, Alberta QB File No. 1203-18531 (Edmonton] (the “Consortium Alberta Action”) and [1023926 Alberta Ltd. v. Bank of America Corporation, Alberta Q.B. File No. 1203-10620 (Edmonton) (the “MLG Alberta Action”)]. [5] On April 4, 2013, the Consortium Alberta Action and the MLG Alberta Action were conditionally stayed by the Alberta Court of Queen’s Bench pending the decision of the Supreme Court of British Columbia in relation to an application for certification of the BC Action. The certification application in the BC Action was heard between April 22, 2013 and May 2, 2013 by Chief Justice Bauman and the decision is currently under reserve. [6] By application filed January 4, 2013 and amended June 20, 2013, MLG applied for certification of the MLG Action. On April 12, 2013, the Consortium applied for orders granting them carriage of the proceedings in Saskatchewan and staying the MLG Action. Filed in support of the Consortium application are affidavits sworn by: i. Luciana Brasil, lawyer representing the plaintiff in the Consortium Action; ii. Jonathan Bancroft-Snell, proposed representative plaintiff in parallel class action brought by the Consortium against the same defendants in Ontario; and iii. Amy Habicht, the principal of Hello Baby Equipment Inc. [7] On July 12, 2013, the defendants applied for an order staying the MLG Action and all similar actions pending the decision of Chief Justice Bauman of the Supreme Court of British Columbia on the application for certification of the BC Action. In support of their application for stay, the defendants have filed the affidavit of Amy K. Gaskin, the head of the defendant Visa Canada Corporation’s legal department. APPLICATIONS TO CROSS-EXAMINE ON AFFIDAVITS [8] MLG brings two applications. The first is for leave to cross-examine each of Luciana Brasil, Jonathan Bancroft-Snell and Amy Habicht on their affidavits. The second is for leave to cross-examine Amy K. Gaskin on her affidavit. The Consortium application, filed after the two MLG applications, is for leave to cross-examine Steve Patrick, the owner of The Crown Hand Pub Ltd., on an affidavit sworn June 18, 2013. Mr. Patrick’s affidavit was filed by MLG in opposition to the Consortium’s application for carriage. [9] Rule 6-13 of The Queen’s Bench Rules provides: 6‑13(1) On any application or petition, evidence may be given by affidavit, but the Court may, on the application of either party, order the attendance for cross‑examination of the person making the affidavit. (2) The party applying for any cross‑examination pursuant to subrule (1) shall bear the costs of the cross‑examination. [10] Leave to cross-examine on an affidavit filed in support of an interlocutory application is discretionary matter. The applicant must demonstrate that cross-examination will assist in resolving the issue before the court and that it will not result in an injustice. Leave will generally be permitted where there is contradictory evidence or where there is sincere and legitimate need for clarification of information that is solely within the knowledge of the affiant (Canada Safeway Ltd. v. Saskatchewan (Human Rights Commission), (1993) 1993 CanLII 9112 (SK QB), 108 Sask. R. 253, [1993] S.J. No. 122 (QL)). These general principles apply to cross-examination on all affidavits filed in support of interlocutory applications, including applications for certification under The Class Actions Act, S. S. 2001, c. C-12.01 (the “Act”). [11] In Hoffman v. Monsanto Canada Inc., 2003 SKQB 564 (CanLII), 242 Sask. R. 286, G.A. Smith J. (as she then was) noted that there are number of characteristics of applications for certification under the Act that weigh in favour of granting leave to cross-examine. The court noted that pursuant to s. of the Act, certification order is not determination of the merits of an action and, for that reason, cross-examination going solely to the merits of the plaintiff’s claim is not permissible. Even so, the court emphasized the importance of providing, on certification motion, proper evidentiary record for the resolution of the issues raised by the application, including clarification of ambiguous evidence, expanding or narrowing the scope of what is said in an affidavit, or exploring matters going to the credibility of the affiant. The fundamental questions are whether the proposed cross-examination will be relevant and of some assistance in the ultimate determination of the issues. [12] Although the court in Saskatchewan has been inclined to grant leave to cross-examine deponents on affidavits filed on certification applications to ensure that it is presented with an adequate evidentiary record, leave to cross-examine is not granted routinely or automatically. There have been number of decisions in which the court has decided that cross-examination will not be permitted. See, for example, Thorpe v. Honda Canada Inc., 2010 SKQB 136 (CanLII), 352 Sask. R. 89; Wall Estate v. Glaxosmithkline, 2010 SKQB 351 (CanLII), 367 Sask. R. 21; Alves v. MyTravel Canada Holidays Inc., 2009 SKQB 517 (CanLII), 348 Sask. R. 1. [13] Applications for leave to cross-examine on affidavits must take into account the purpose for which the affidavits are filed and the effect of resulting order. Here, the affidavits have not been filed in relation to an application for certification. The affidavits of Luciana Brasil, Jonathan Bancroft-Snell and Amy Habicht have been filed in support of the application for orders staying the MLG Action and granting the Consortium carriage of the claims against the defendants. The affidavit of Amy K. Gaskin has been filed in support of the defendants’ application for an order temporarily staying the MLG Action. The affidavit of Steve Patrick has been filed in opposition to the Consortium’s application for stay and carriage. [14] By and large, the affidavits filed by the Consortium in respect of its application for carriage and stay orders, and by the defendants in support of their application for stay, deal with the progress of the credit card class action litigation in this and other jurisdictions. The information is uncontroverted and a matter of public record. Mr. Merchant was unable to explain how and why it might assist the court to have him cross-examine on what is not in dispute. [15] The affidavits filed by the Consortium also set out its intended approach to managing credit card class action claims in the various jurisdictions across Canada. In particular, they indicate that the Consortium intends to pursue its claim initially in British Columbia (a no-cost jurisdiction) followed by its claim in Ontario (an opt-out jurisdiction). While Mr. Merchant speculates that this is “suspicious” and indicates “secret agreement”, there is no evidence supporting that view. Moreover, it is contradicted by his own beliefs that the defendants intend to fully defend the claims in every jurisdiction. [16] The applications by MLG set out number of matters the proposed cross-examinations would explore. The overall thrust would be to engage Amy Habicht, the principal of Hello Baby Equipment Inc., Jonathan Bancroft-Snell, the operator of an art gallery acting as representative plaintiff in the Ontario Action, one of the Consortium lawyers, Luciana Brasil, in examinations for discovery respecting their solicitor client communications or their opinions regarding purely legal issues such as the implications of recent Competition Tribunal Decision and the reasons for interlocutory decisions in other jurisdictions. Even if the affidavits raised these issues, they would not be the subject of useful cross-examination. [17] The affidavit of Amy Habicht, the principal of Hello Baby Equipment Inc., asserts her support for the Consortium as her counsel. Similarly, the affidavit of Steve Patrick, the owner of The Crown Hand Pub Ltd., asserts his support for MLG as class counsel. Both affidavits are based on what each of the affiants have been told by their respective counsel. In my view, cross-examination on what they have been told, and about their individual opinions related to the qualities of their respective counsel, would add nothing to the evidentiary record. [18] Finally, at least two of the affidavits (the affidavit of Luciana Brasil and the affidavit of Amy K. Gaskin) contain legal argument that does not belong in an affidavit, but in brief of law. It is unacceptable for legal counsel to present argument in the form of an affidavit, but it does not follow that by doing so, the affiant lawyer becomes obliged to open up his or her client files for review by third parties, nor examined for discovery with respect to their proposed legal strategies, nor required to debate the merits of future legal arguments by way of cross-examination. MLG has applied to strike portions of the affidavits, and that application will be heard on date to be set by the Local Registrar in consultation with the parties. [19] The arguments presented during the hearing of these applications dealt exclusively with the two applications by MLG to cross-examine on affidavits filed by the Consortium and the defendants. No submissions were made by any party in respect of the Consortium’s application to cross-examine Steve Patrick on his affidavit in opposition to those applications. However, it is apparent that if MLG’s applications to cross-examine the various affiants are dismissed, then the defendants’ application to cross-examine Mr. Patrick must also be dismissed. [20] In summary, the MLG applications for leave to cross-examine on the affidavits is dismissed for the following reasons; 1. I am not satisfied that MLG’s desire to question the deponents is based on a real and sincere need to clarify any issues relevant to the applications for which the affidavits have been filed. 2. The answers to questions arising from the sought-after cross-examinations would be of no assistance to the court’s inquiry into issues raised by the applications on which the affidavits have been filed. 3. Virtually all of the reasons cited by MLG to support the request to cross-examine the affiants focus, not on evidentiary issues, but on the relative merits of legal issues. [21] For the same reasons, the Consortium’s application to cross-examine Steve Patrick on his affidavit, sworn June 18, 2013, is dismissed. [22] There will be no order as the costs.",d_2013skqb348.txt,"HELD: The Court dismissed the application.

During the years 1988-1991 inclusive, the applicant was paid-up practising member of the Law Society of Saskatchewan.
In 1992 on his undertaking to refrain from the practice of law, the applicant was granted an inactive membership in the Law Society of Saskatchewan.
Commencing January 1, 1993 the applicant did not pay an inactive membership fee.

On October 10, 1991, he was sentenced to 18 months imprisonment and was ordered to pay compensation to the victims of his crimes.

He also requested that he be provided with reasonable notice of any proposed actions.
The respondents concede that no action was taken with respect to the sentencing of the applicant between August 9, 1995 and May 30, 1997.
The respondents say that they were advised that it would be inappropriate for them to proceed in the face of challenge to its jurisdiction.
The Hearing Committee provided its report to the chairperson of the Discipline Committee on July 4, 1997.
The notice of sentencing dated July 21, 1997 was issued by the chair of the Discipline Committee and was sent to the applicant by registered mail notifying the applicant that sentencing on the matters referred to in the report of the Hearing Committee would be held on Thursday, September 18, 1997.
During the period of almost two years since the date of the hearing before the Hearing Committee the applicant has been working at establishing an international consulting business and for this purpose has begun the process of studying for Ph.D. in International Business.
(1) Did the Hearing Committee breach s. 53 of The Legal Profession Act, 1990 by providing its report more than 45 days after the hearing?
(2) If the answer to the first question is in the affirmative, do the respondents have jurisdiction to proceed further against the applicant?
THE LAW The pertinent provisions of The Legal Profession Act, 1990 are: 53(1) hearing committee shall provide its decision to the chairperson of the discipline committee in accordance with the rules, not later than 45 days after the hearing.
(5) The chairperson of the hearing committee shall send copy of the committee's decision to the member whose conduct was the subject of the hearing.
56(1) Where complaint against member is determined by the hearing committee to be well founded, the member may appeal the decision of the hearing committee or penalty assessed or requirement imposed by the hearing committee or the discipline committee resulting from the decision to the Court of Appeal within 30 days after the day of the decision or the assessment of penalty or imposition of requirement, whichever is later, by: (a) filing notice of appeal with the registrar of the Court of Appeal; and (b) serving the secretary-treasurer with copy of the notice of appeal.
(3) Subject to subsection (4), the commencement of an appeal to the Court of Appeal does not stay the effect of penalty assessed or requirement imposed by the hearing committee or the discipline (4) An appellant, on five days' notice to the secretary-treasurer, may apply to the Court of Appeal for stay of proceedings pending the disposition of the appeal.
(emphasis added) Rule 450(10) of Rules of the Law Society of Saskatchewan reads: 450(10) The hearing committee shall, not later than 45 days after completion of the hearing, deliver to the Chairperson of the Discipline Committee written statement of: (a) its findings as to the facts in issue, (b) its decision as to whether each allegation in the formal complaint is well-founded, and (c) the penalty assessed or requirements imposed, if it acts under section 53(3) of the Act.
(emphasis added) Section 27(3) of The Interpretation Act, 1995, S.S. 1995, c. I-11.2 provides: 27(3) In the English version of an Act: (a) ""shall"" shall be interpreted as imperative; and (b) ""may"" shall be interpreted as permissive and empowering.
Counsel for the respondents argues that if this court finds that the Hearing Committee was in breach of s. 53 of The Legal Profession Act, 1990, by providing its decision to the chairperson of the Discipline Committee more than 45 days after the hearing, the s. 53 requirement is not mandatory but directory.
find that the Hearing Committee was in breach of s. 53 since the hearing concluded on August 9, 1995 and the Hearing Committee did not provide the chairperson of the Discipline Committee with its decision until July 4, 1997.
In support of his submission that the s. 53 requirement is not mandatory but directory, counsel has referred to number of decisions including Teskey v. Law Society of British Columbia (1990), 1990 CanLII 8033 (BC SC), 71 D.L.R.
The Teskey decision is distinguishable in that the court dealt with rule which provided that ""the Secretary shall promptly notify the respondent in writing of referral to the Benchers ."".
The court did not deal with statutory requirement, as is the case before me.
The powers of the respondents to regulate and discipline its members is conferred by statute and as such, am of the view that the exercise of such powers must be complied with strictly.
This is so, even though it may enable him to escape upon technicality.
Disciplinary proceedings expose member of the Law Society to punishments including suspension of the right to practice and disbarment.
The nature of disciplinary proceedings can have devastating effect on the most valuable asset barrister and solicitor has his or her reputation.
This reinforces my view that s. 53(1) must be strictly interpreted.
am of the view that the purpose of s. 53(1) of The Legal Profession Act, 1990 is to provide the chairperson of the Discipline Committee with decision of the Hearing Committee within 45 days so that disciplinary matters against its members may be dealt with in timely manner.
The process must be completed without undue delay and thus protect the member's interest.
This is also implicit in s. 56 of the Act which provides that member may appeal the decision of the Hearing Committee and that the appeal process does not stay the effect of the decision of the Hearing Committee.
Section 56(4) provides that an appellant may apply to the Court of Appeal for stay pending the decision of the appeal.
This the respondents did not do to the detriment of the applicant's interests.
find that the respondents have lost jurisdiction to take further proceedings against the applicant and so order.","HELD: The last two sentences were to be substituted by the appeal was dismissed by the SCC on March 21, 1995 and the Hearing Committee set August 8, 1995 as the date for a hearing.",582,"nan Editor's Note: Corrigendum released February 25, 1998.

HAWRISH and THE LAW SOCIETY OF SASKATCHEWAN, THE BENCHERS, THE COMMITTEES AND THE OFFICERS OF THE LAW SOCIETY OF SASKATCHEWAN RESPONDENTS E.A.J. Hawrish on his own behalf A.T. Snell, Q.C. for the respondents JUDGMENT HRABINSKY J. November 10, 1997 The applicant applies for an order that the respondents be prohibited from any further proceedings or actions in relation to the formal complaint against him, dated December 15, 1988, as amended, alleging that he is guilty of conduct unbecoming barrister and solicitor. The application is made pursuant to The Legal Profession Act, 1990, S.S. 1990-91, c. L-10.1 on the following ground: That the Discipline Committee of the Law Society of Saskatchewan does not have jurisdiction to proceed with any further proceedings against the Applicant on the said complaint by virtue of the fact that the decision of the Hearing Committee, dated July 2, 1997, and upon which the Disciplinary Committee proposes to act, was not provided to the chairperson of the Discipline Committee within 45 days after the hearing of the said complaint, as required by Section 53(1) of The Legal Profession Act, 1990. FACTS In 1988, the applicant, member who was then in good standing with the Law Society of Saskatchewan, was charged with several counts of theft and fraud pursuant to the Criminal Code. The Law Society Investigation Committee report recommended that hearing be held to inquire into substantially the same circumstances as those contained in the criminal charges. On December 15, 1988 the Law Society of Saskatchewan appointed Hearing Committee to hear formal complaint against the applicant. At the first meeting of the Hearing Committee on May 1, 1989, the applicant challenged the jurisdiction of the Hearing Committee to proceed on the basis that he had not been treated fairly by the investigation process and therefore, the Hearing Committee had no jurisdiction. This application was dismissed on May 31, 1989. During the years 1988-1991 inclusive, the applicant was paid-up practising member of the Law Society of Saskatchewan. In 1992 on his undertaking to refrain from the practice of law, the applicant was granted an inactive membership in the Law Society of Saskatchewan. Commencing January 1, 1993 the applicant did not pay an inactive membership fee. The applicant then applied to the Court of Queen's Bench for stay of the Law Society disciplinary proceedings on the ground that those proceedings should be stayed until the criminal matter was complete. The stay was granted August 29, 1989, but was lifted by justice of the Saskatchewan Court of Appeal in January of 1990, to allow counsel for the Investigation Committee to examine witness who was terminally ill. As the criminal matter proceeded through the courts, the Hearing Committee met intermittently, often by telephone conference calls, and the matter was adjourned from time to time, firstly because the court had imposed stay and latterly because the criminal matters were still before the court. The applicant was convicted of one count of theft and two counts of fraud on September 6, 1991. On October 10, 1991, he was sentenced to 18 months imprisonment and was ordered to pay compensation to the victims of his crimes. The applicant appealed the conviction. The appeal was dismissed by the Saskatchewan Court of Appeal on October 14, 1993. The applicant then sought leave to appeal further to the Supreme Court of Canada. The appeal was dismissed by the Supreme Court ofCanada on March 21, 1995 and the Hearing Committeeset August 8, 1995 as the date for a hearing. transcript of the meeting of the Hearing Committee on August and 9, 1995 discloses that the applicant challenged the jurisdiction of the Hearing Committee to proceed with the matter. The Hearing Committee found that it had jurisdiction and proceeded with the hearing. The applicant absented himself from the hearing following the Hearing Committee's decision to proceed. On August 9, 1995 the Hearing Committee unanimously found beyond reasonable doubt that each of the complaints numbered 11, 12 and 13, were well founded and that because the Law Society of Saskatchewan presented no evidence on counts to 10 inclusive, these complaints were dismissed as being unfounded. The transcript of the proceedings discloses that the chairman of the Hearing Committee stated, "". the Hearing Committee will report, in accordance with the Act, its findings to the Benchers."" By notice of appeal dated August 24, 1995 the applicant appealed the decision of the Hearing Committee made on August 9, 1995 to the Court of Appeal pursuant to s. 56(1) of The Legal Profession Act, 1990, S.S. 1990-91, c. L-10.1. The applicant applied to the Saskatchewan Court of Appeal challenging the jurisdiction of the Hearing Committee on the basis that he was no longer member of the Law Society. This application was dismissed by the Saskatchewan Court of Appeal on November 18, 1996. On August 25, 1995, the applicant sent facsimile to the Law Society of Saskatchewan requesting that he be heard if any further actions, procedures or sanctions be taken against him. He also requested that he be provided with reasonable notice of any proposed actions. The applicant received no response to his facsimile. He never received copy of the Hearing Committee's report which is dated July 2, 1997 until July 28, 1997. The report of the Hearing Committee is addressed to ""The Chairperson of the Discipline Committee"". The applicant then sought leave to appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada. Leave was denied on May 22, 1997. The respondents concede that no action was taken with respect to the sentencing of the applicant between August 9, 1995 and May 30, 1997. The respondents say that they were advised that it would be inappropriate for them to proceed in the face of challenge to its jurisdiction. The Hearing Committee provided its report to the chairperson of the Discipline Committee on July 4, 1997. The notice of sentencing dated July 21, 1997 was issued by the chair of the Discipline Committee and was sent to the applicant by registered mail notifying the applicant that sentencing on the matters referred to in the report of the Hearing Committee would be held on Thursday, September 18, 1997.

(5) The chairperson of the hearing committee shall send copy of the committee's decision to the member whose conduct was the subject of the hearing. 56(1) Where complaint against member is determined by the hearing committee to be well founded, the member may appeal the decision of the hearing committee or penalty assessed or requirement imposed by the hearing committee or the discipline committee resulting from the decision to the Court of Appeal within 30 days after the day of the decision or the assessment of penalty or imposition of requirement, whichever is later, by: (a) filing notice of appeal with the registrar of the Court of Appeal; and (b) serving the secretary-treasurer with copy of the notice of appeal. (3) Subject to subsection (4), the commencement of an appeal to the Court of Appeal does not stay the effect of penalty assessed or requirement imposed by the hearing committee or the discipline (4) An appellant, on five days' notice to the secretary-treasurer, may apply to the Court of Appeal for stay of proceedings pending the disposition of the appeal. (emphasis added) Rule 450(10) of Rules of the Law Society of Saskatchewan reads: 450(10) The hearing committee shall, not later than 45 days after completion of the hearing, deliver to the Chairperson of the Discipline Committee written statement of: (a) its findings as to the facts in issue, (b) its decision as to whether each allegation in the formal complaint is well-founded, and (c) the penalty assessed or requirements imposed, if it acts under section 53(3) of the Act. (emphasis added) Section 27(3) of The Interpretation Act, 1995, S.S. 1995, c. I-11.2 provides: 27(3) In the English version of an Act: (a) ""shall"" shall be interpreted as imperative; and (b) ""may"" shall be interpreted as permissive and empowering. Counsel for the respondents argues that if this court finds that the Hearing Committee was in breach of s. 53 of The Legal Profession Act, 1990, by providing its decision to the chairperson of the Discipline Committee more than 45 days after the hearing, the s. 53 requirement is not mandatory but directory. find that the Hearing Committee was in breach of s. 53 since the hearing concluded on August 9, 1995 and the Hearing Committee did not provide the chairperson of the Discipline Committee with its decision until July 4, 1997. This is in contravention of the statute. In support of his submission that the s. 53 requirement is not mandatory but directory, counsel has referred to number of decisions including Teskey v. Law Society of British Columbia (1990), 1990 CanLII 8033 (BC SC), 71 D.L.R. (4th) 531. The Teskey decision is distinguishable in that the court dealt with rule which provided that ""the Secretary shall promptly notify the respondent in writing of referral to the Benchers ."". The court did not deal with statutory requirement, as is the case before me. This court has the jurisdiction to waive rules but does not have jurisdiction to waive statutory requirements. Accordingly, the Teskey decision is inapplicable to the matter before me. The powers of the respondents to regulate and discipline its members is conferred by statute and as such, am of the view that the exercise of such powers must be complied with strictly. In Maxwell on The Interpretation of Statutes, 12th ed. (Sweet Maxwell, London, 1969) at p. 245 the author states: Similarly, statutes dealing with jurisdiction and procedure are, if they relate to the infliction of penalties, strictly construed: compliance with procedural provisions will be stringently exacted from those proceeding against the person liable to be penalised, and if there is any ambiguity or doubt it will, as usual, be resolved in his favour. This is so, even though it may enable him to escape upon technicality. Applying s. 27(3) of The Interpretation Act, 1995, conclude that the word ""shall"" in s. 53(1) of The Legal Profession Act, 1990, must be interpreted as imperative. It is mandatory. It is not directory. Disciplinary proceedings expose member of the Law Society to punishments including suspension of the right to practice and disbarment. The nature of disciplinary proceedings can have devastating effect on the most valuable asset barrister and solicitor has his or her reputation. This reinforces my view that s. 53(1) must be strictly interpreted. The duty of the respondents is the protection of the rights not only of members of the public but also the members of the Law Society of Saskatchewan. am of the view that the purpose of s. 53(1) of The Legal Profession Act, 1990 is to provide the chairperson of the Discipline Committee with decision of the Hearing Committee within 45 days so that disciplinary matters against its members may be dealt with in timely manner. The process must be completed without undue delay and thus protect the member's interest. This is also implicit in s. 56 of the Act which provides that member may appeal the decision of the Hearing Committee and that the appeal process does not stay the effect of the decision of the Hearing Committee. Section 56(4) provides that an appellant may apply to the Court of Appeal for stay pending the decision of the appeal. Although stay of proceedings was ordered for the period from August 29, 1989 until January, 1990, it was incumbent upon the respondents to move without delay before the stay was granted and after it was lifted on the application of the respondents. This the respondents did not do to the detriment of the applicant's interests. find that the respondents have lost jurisdiction to take further proceedings against the applicant and so order. Leave is given to speak to costs. J. Q.B. A.D. 1997 No. 1781 J.C.S. IN THE QUEEN'S BENCH JUDICIAL CENTRE OF SASKATOON BETWEEN: ERNEST A.J.

IN THE QUEEN’S BENCH (FAMILY LAW DIVISION) JUDICIAL CENTRE OF SASKATOON BETWEEN: SHELLY MARIE HARDER and ALLAN ROBERT HARDER RESPONDENT E.A. Connick for the petitioner Allan Robert Harder on his own behalf FIAT RYAN-FROSLIE J. June 19, 2003 [1] Pursuant to s. 17 of Divorce Act, R.S.C. 1985, c. (2nd Supp.), the applicant, Allan Harder, seeks to vary child support order made May 17, 2002. [2] Mr. Harder argued that variation of the order is warranted because his income has decreased as result of his being laid off his employment, that the parties’ oldest child, Jasmine, is no longer child within the meaning of the Divorce Act and that Jasmine’s s. expense for riding lessons has not been incurred for more than year. Shelly Harder opposes the application arguing Mr. Harder’s lay-off is only temporary, that Jasmine continues to be child of the marriage and that Jasmine will be resuming riding lessons at the end of May, 2003. Ms. Harder also asked this Court to increase Mr. Harder’s contribution for her son’s hockey, golf and baseball expenses. [3] The issues are as follows: 1. Has there been a change of circumstance since May 17, 2002 which would warrant variation of the support order? 2. Is Jasmine a child of the marriage within the meaning of the Divorce Act? 3. Does Mr. Harder have an obligation to contribute to Jasmine’s riding lessons? 4. Mr. Harder’s income for child support purposes. 5. Should Sloane’s s. 7 expenses (hockey, golf and baseball) be increased? [4] The facts are not in dispute. [5] The parties were married on June 14, 1980 and separated in 1998. They have two children, namely: Jasmine Marie Harder, born November 10, 1984 (age 18) and Sloane Allan Harder, born April 8, 1986 (age 17). [6] On May 17, 2002, Justice Milliken granted consent judgment pursuant to the Divorce Act. In that judgment, Mr. Harder’s income for child support purposes was set at $39,219 and Ms. Harder’s income for child support purposes was set at $23,945. Mr. Harder was ordered to pay child support of $534 per month for Jasmine and Sloane commencing September 1, 2001 plus $70 per month for Jasmine’s riding lessons and $60 per month for Sloane’s hockey. [7] At the time the judgment was granted, both children were under the age of 18 and in full-time attendance at school. Jasmine turned 18 on November 10, 2002. She graduated from Grade 12 in January, 2003 and on February 10, 2003 started full-time employment with Mitchell’s Gourmet Foods Inc. earning $8.50 per hour, 37 hours per week. Jasmine was laid off this employment for two weeks in March, 2003. Other than this two-week lay-off, she has been employed full time. [8] The evidence indicates Jasmine intends to take 13-month executive administrator course commencing in September, 2003. Her tuition and books for that course are estimated at $7,135 and $1,300, respectively. Jasmine has applied for student loan. She has savings of $600. There is no indication what amount Jasmine will receive from the loan or what other resources may be available to her for funding her post-secondary education. Jasmine resides with her mother, rent free. [9] In May, 2002, in support of the application for judgment, Ms. Harder filed material indicating Jasmine was taking riding lessons. Ms. Harder sought contribution from Mr. Harder for the cost of those lessons in the amount of $70 per month. In fact, Jasmine’s horse had been injured in April, 2002 and she was not taking riding lessons at the time the judgment was granted, nor has she taken riding lessons since April, 2002. Ms. Harder’s affidavit of May 27, 2003 attests that Jasmine will resume her riding lessons the week of May 27, 2003. [10] The parties’ son, Sloane, is 17 and continues to be in full-time attendance at school. He is involved in hockey, golf and baseball. Ms. Harder’s financial statement sworn May 27, 2003 shows the cost for these extracurricular activities as $1,901.24 per year. This is the same amount, for the same activities, as set out in her financial statement of July 20, 2001 and filed in support of the original application for divorce. [11] Mr. Harder is sheet metal worker. At the time of Justice Milliken’s judgment, he was employed at Pow City Mechanical earning $39,219 gross per year. Ms. Harder was employed by the Saskatoon Health District Board earning $23,945 per annum. [12] Mr. Harder was laid off his employment prior to the filing of his application for variation. He receives employment insurance of $414 per week before deductions ($21,528 per annum). Following the filing of his application for variation, Mr. Harder was employed at Estevan, Saskatchewan for brief period of time. [13] Mr. Harder earned $39,259 in 2002 according to his 2002 Notice of Assessment from Canada Customs and Revenue Agency. He paid union dues of $1,843 leaving net income for child support purposes of $37,416. [14] Ms. Harder is still employed with the Saskatoon Health District. She earned $30,285 in 2002 according to her 2002 Notice of Assessment from Canada Customs and Revenue Agency. According to her pay stub, Ms. Harder pays union dues of $14.15 every two weeks or $367.90 per year leaving net income for child support purposes of $29,917. 1. Has there been change of circumstance since May 17, 2002 which would warrant variation of the support order? [15] Section 17(4) of the Divorce Act provides that before court makes variation order in respect of child support order, the Court must satisfy itself that change of circumstances as provided for in the Federal Child Support Guidelines [Divorce Act Regulations, SOR/97-175] has occurred since the making of that order or the last application for variation. [16] Section 14 of the Guidelines sets out that “...any change in circumstances that would result in different child support order or any provision thereof...” is circumstance that will give rise to variation. [17] In support of his application, Mr. Harder claims three changes in circumstances, namely: 1. that Jasmine is no longer child within the meaning of the Divorce Act; 2. that Jasmine has not been taking riding lessons for more than year; and 3. that his income has decreased as result of his unemployment. If any of these circumstances are established, it would come within the meaning of s. 14 of the Guidelines and would warrant variation of the current order. 2. Is Jasmine child of the marriage within the meaning of the Divorce Act? [18] For the purpose of the Divorce Act, “child of the marriage” is defined in s. as “...a child of two spouses or former spouses who, at the material time is ... the age of majority or over and under their charge but unable by reason of illness, disability or other cause, to withdraw from their charge or to obtain the necessaries of life”. [19] Ms. Harder argues that Jasmine is still child of the marriage because she is living with Ms. Harder, she intends to take post-secondary education in September, 2003 and she requires financial support in the interim so that she can save money to go to school and pay off debt to SGI. That debt is the result of an automobile accident Jasmine was involved in with an unregistered vehicle. As of May 27, 2003 Jasmine owes SGI $721. She is paying $100 per month towards this debt. [20] The definition of “child of the marriage” has been considered in numerous cases. The law is well-settled that the pursuit of post-secondary education may be sufficient reason for an adult child’s inability to withdraw from their parents’ charge or obtain the necessaries of life. That inability however must be proved. The burden of proof lies on the party seeking support, in this case Ms. Harder. See: Duncan v. Duncan (1989), 1989 CanLII 4502 (SK QB), 74 Sask. R. 100 (Q.B.); Hildebrandt v. Rossmo, [1997] S.J. No. 630 (Q.B.); and Whitton v. Whitton (1989), 21 R.F.L. (3d) 261 (Ont. C.A.). [21] The Saskatchewan Court of Appeal in Zaba v. Bradley (1996), 1996 CanLII 4930 (SK CA), 137 Sask. R. 295 (C.A.) set out number of factors court should consider in determining whether an adult child continues to be “child of the marriage” by reason of the pursuit of post-secondary education. The British Columbia Supreme Court in Farden v. Farden (1993), 1993 CanLII 2570 (BC SC), 48 R.F.L. (3d) 60 (B.C. S.C.) and the Saskatchewan Court of Queen’s Bench in MacDonald v. Rasmussen (2000), 2000 SKQB 494 (CanLII), 198 Sask. R. (Q.B.) have suggested additional factors for consideration. The factors enunciated in these three cases may be summarized as follows: 1. whether the child is in fact enrolled in course of studies and whether that enrollment is full time or part time; 2. the age of the child; 3. the child’s past academic performance; 4. whether the child has reasonable career plans; 5. whether the child is demonstrating success in their chosen course of studies; 6. whether the child is eligible for student loans or other financial assistance; 7. the ability of the child to contribute to his or her own support through part-time employment; 8. parental plans for the child’s education, particularly those made during cohabitation; 9. whether or not the child has unilaterally terminated his or her relationship with the parent from whom child support is sought; 10. whether the child could reasonably have expected support from the parents if the marriage had not broken down. [22] In this case Jasmine is not enrolled in school, nor is she taking any classes, though her “plan” is to do so in the fall of 2003. It is undisputed that Jasmine is currently employed full time earning $8.50 per hour. She has had this employment since February 10, 2003, although she was laid off for two weeks in March. There is no evidence as to the reasonableness of Jasmine’s plans or her ability to contribute to the cost of any post-secondary education she decides to pursue. The factors set out in Zaba, Farden and MacDonald, supra, have not been covered by the material. Based on the evidence, cannot find that Jasmine is “child of the marriage” within the meaning of the Divorce Act. She is currently employed full time and while her income is low, it would be sufficient to provide her with the necessaries of life. Saving money for school and paying off debts does not constitute an “other cause” as contemplated in the Divorce Act definition of “child of the marriage”. Choosing not to withdraw from her mother’s care is not the same as being unable to withdraw from that care. [23] While an adult child may require reasonable length of time to become financially independent after finishing school or attaining the age of majority, that time certainly arrived in this case by the end of March, 2003. By that time Jasmine had obtained full-time employment and had received at least full month’s wages. This case is distinguishable on its facts from the case of Bain v. Bain (1994), R.F.L. (4th) 451 (Man. Q.B.) where the parties had reached an agreement to continue support for their daughter. It is also distinguishable on its facts from Mitchell v. Mitchell (1992), 1992 CanLII 8039 (SK QB), 41 R.F.L. (3d) 443 (Sask. Q.B.) where the child was “forced” by her father to remain out of school until her car debt was paid. Moreover, in Mitchell, the child in question was in full-time attendance at post-secondary institution, circumstance that does not exist in this case. I find that Jasmine ceased to be a child of the marriage within the meaning of the Divorce Act effective March 31, 2003. [24] Should Jasmine follow through with her plan and actually commence post-secondary education she may requalify as “child of the marriage”. See: Horvath v. Horvath, 2000 MBCA 93 (CanLII); (2000), 150 Man. (2d) (C.A.); Stocchero v. Stocchero (1997), 1997 ABCA 196 (CanLII), 29 R.F.L. (4th) 223 (Alta. C.A.); and Olsen v. Olsen (1997), 1997 CanLII 11249 (SK QB), 159 Sask. R. 67 (Q.B.). In that event, application may be made to seek support from Mr. Harder. In bringing such an application, Ms. Harder should keep in mind the considerations listed herein and provide the necessary evidence to support Jasmine’s claim. 3. Does Mr. Harder have an obligation to contribute to Jasmine’s riding lessons? [25] As Jasmine is no longer a child of the marriage, Mr. Harder has no obligation to contribute towards the costs of her riding lessons pursuant to s. 7(f) of the Guidelines. [26] It is noted that no expense has been incurred for Jasmine’s riding lessons since May, 2002, the very month in which the judgment being varied was rendered. The undisputed evidence is that Jasmine’s last riding lesson occurred in April, 2002. The fact Ms. Harder has received money from Mr. Harder for this expense when it was not actually incurred is reprehensible. Parents who receive contribution for s. expenses have an obligation to terminate those payments when the s. expense is no longer incurred. Ms. Harder’s actions have resulted in her receiving $70 per month from Mr. Harder for riding lessons which never took place. She has received $980 ($70 per month for 14 months) that she is not entitled to. Mr. Harder has indicated he does not want that money repaid to him. It is only the generosity of Mr. Harder that keeps this Court from making reimbursement order. Mr. Harder’s obligation to contribute to Jasmine’s riding lessons is terminated effective March 31, 2003. 4. Mr. Harder’s income for child support purposes. [27] Mr. Harder argues his income has decreased since the May, 2002 order because he was laid off his employment. The exact date Mr. Harder became unemployed is not known. In paragraph of his affidavit sworn April 23, 2003 Mr. Harder attests as follows: That at the time of the filing of this variation I, Allan Robert Harder, have been unemployed for over two weeks with vague knowledge of when may be hired in my trade as sheet metal worker. My present income is $414.00 per wk. from unemployment insurance before deductions. It is clear that while Mr. Harder is currently unemployed, he has “vague knowledge” of when he may be rehired. That knowledge was not shared with this Court. [28] copy of Mr. Harder’s 2002 income tax return was not filed in support of this application. review of the financial information filed prior to Justice Milliken’s judgment of May, 2002 indicates that Mr. Harder received employment insurance benefits in 1999 and 2000. There are no documents filed with this Court to substantiate whether or not employment insurance was received by him either in 2001 or 2002. Mr. Harder’s employer has at all relevant times been Pow City Mechanical. [29] The burden of proving change in income which would constitute change in circumstance lies with Mr. Harder. As the Supreme Court of Canada stated in Willick v. Willick, 1994 CanLII 28 (SCC), [1994] S.C.R. 670, the change must be of such magnitude that if the court had known of the change of circumstance at the time the original order was granted, it is likely the order would have been made in different terms. Based on the evidence, Mr. Harder has not met this burden. His affidavit material indicates he has some knowledge of when he will be rehired. The financial information indicates he has received employment insurance in the past. In order for change in income to warrant change in child support, that change must be significant and long-lasting. Temporary unemployment will not qualify as such change especially if it is regular circumstance of the payor’s employment. The total income potential of the payor must be examined in order to determine whether reduction has in fact occurred. Such reduction cannot be found in this case on the evidence presented. This decision is made without prejudice to Mr. Harder to reapply to this Court should his unemployment continue for an extended period. [30] find that Mr. Harder’s income for child support purposes is $37,416 being the income shown on his 2002 Notice of Assessment less his union dues. find Ms. Harder’s income for child support purposes to be $29,917 being the income shown on her 2002 Notice of Assessment less her estimated union dues. It is hereby ordered that Mr. Harder shall pay to Ms. Harder for the support of their son, Sloane Allan Harder, born April 8, 1986, the sum of $308 per month commencing April 1, 2003 and continuing on the first day of each and every month thereafter so long as Sloane remains a child within the meaning of the Divorce Act. 5. Should Sloane’s s. expenses (hockey, golf and baseball) be increased? [31] Ms. Harder claims an increase in Mr. Harder’s contribution to their son’s extracurricular activities. In argument she admitted these activities are the same activities that Sloane was engaged in at the time of Justice Milliken’s judgment in May, 2002 and that the cost of those activities is identical to the cost claimed at that time. The judgment provides that Mr. Harder contribute only to Sloane’s hockey expenses. There is no change in circumstance that would warrant expanding that judgment to include costs for Sloane’s golf or baseball expenses. These activities and their costs were known and considered at the time of the May, 2002 judgment. [32] Ms. Harder argues that in calculating Mr. Harder’s share of Sloane’s hockey expenses, the judgment contemplated that the parties would split bingo proceeds which would help defray some of the hockey costs. She attests that Mr. Harder did not do this. She alleges he received $150 from bingos which were used to defray his personal expenses in attending Sloane’s tournaments as opposed to reducing Sloane’s hockey expenditures. Exhibit “A” attached to Ms. Harder’s affidavit of May 27, 2003 indicates that Sloane’s account had surplus of $272.85 in it and that Mr. Harder had earned only $50 from bingo which was credited to his personal account. The judgment refers only to the splitting of bingos. The balance of the money earned by Mr. Harder related to the washing of uniforms and does not fall within the terms of the judgment. The evidence does not establish that the bingos were not split. Even if this Court accepts that Mr. Harder earned $50 from bingos which should have been attributed to Sloane’s expenses, there is no evidence of how failure to do so affected the sharing of costs between Ms. Harder and Mr. Harder. There is no evidence to support Ms. Harder’s claim for an increase in contribution for Sloane’s extracurricular activities. [33] Ms. Harder’s income has increased since the May 17, 2002 judgment from $23,945 per annum to $29,917 per annum. Ms. Harder attests that she will be undergoing surgery and will be off work for period of time. She does not provide any information as to the length of time she will be off work or how that may affect her projected income for 2003. Mr. Harder’s income for child support purposes is $37,416 per annum. In light of the parties’ current incomes, Mr. Harder’s proportionate share of Sloane’s s. 7(f) hockey expenses should be reduced to 55.57%. [34] Neither the May 17, 2002 judgment nor the material filed with this Court sets out the amount of Sloane’s hockey expense. That amount, however, can be calculated based on the fact that Mr. Harder’s 62% of those expenses totalled $60 per month. Based on that, the annual hockey expense is $1,161.29. Mr. Harder’s 55.57% of that amount would be $54 per month. [35] Mr. Harder shall pay to Ms. Harder for Sloane’s s. 7(f) hockey expenses the sum of $54 commencing June 1, 2003 and continuing on the first day of each and every month thereafter so long as that expense is incurred by Sloane. [36] Pursuant to rule 608(2) of The Queen’s Bench Rules of Court there is presumption that successful party is entitled to the costs of family law proceeding or step in family law proceeding. In this case Mr. Harder was successful in his application. Normally, self-represented parties are not awarded costs. However, costs are warranted in this situation because of Ms. Harder’s refusal to terminate Mr. Harder’s s. contribution for Jasmine’s riding lessons even though that expense was not being incurred. The unreasonableness of her position warrants an assessment of costs. Costs provide some compensation to party for legal expenses as well as disbursements incurred for the application. order that Ms. Harder pay to Mr. Harder as costs of the within application the sum of $250 being Mr. Harder’s estimated out-of-pocket expenses. These costs are payable forthwith. See: Fry v. Hendrickson (1998), 1998 CanLII 13542 (SK QB), 166 Sask. R. 305 (Q.B.). [37] There shall be an order varying Justice Milliken’s judgment of May 17, 2002 with respect to child support and s. expenses as follows: 1. That Jasmine ceased to be a child of the marriage within the meaning of the Divorce Act effective March 31, 2003. Mr. Harder’s obligation to provide ongoing support to Jasmine and his contribution for s. 7 expenses relating to her riding lessons shall terminate as of that date. 2. find that Mr. Harder’s income for child support purposes is $37,416 per annum and Ms. Harder’s income for child support purposes is $29,917 per annum. Mr. Harder shall pay to Ms. Harder for the support of Sloane Allan Harder, born April 8, 1986, the sum of $308 per month commencing April 1, 2003 and continuing on the first day of each and every month thereafter so long as Sloane remains a child within the meaning of the Divorce Act. 3. Ms. Harder’s application to increase Mr. Harder’s contribution for Sloane’s extracurricular activities is dismissed. 4. I find that Sloane’s current hockey expense is approximately $1,161.29 per annum. Mr. Harder shall pay to Ms. Harder his proportionate share of that expense being 55.57% or $54 per month commencing June 1, 2003 and continuing on the first day of each and every month thereafter so long as that expense is incurred by Sloane. 5. Ms. Harder shall pay to Mr. Harder costs of the within application in the sum of $250, payable forthwith.",e_2003skqb286.txt,"FIAT.

Wempe For the Crown B. Pfefferle For the Accused JUDGMENT M.L. GRAY, [1] The accused entered guilty plea to one count of driving motor vehicle while her blood alcohol content was over 80 milligrams of alcohol in 100 millilitres of blood and now asks to be granted curative discharge pursuant to s. 255(5) of the Criminal Code. The Court has been provided the following information in support of her application: (i) an Affidavit of Janine Fellner; (ii) her Criminal Record; (iii) discharge summary from the Leipzig Serenity Retreat; (iv) Prosecutor Information Sheet setting out the circumstances of the offence before the Court; and (v) viva voce evidence from the accused, Larry Foster, Brenda Hearn and Angela Fellner. [2] The circumstances of the offence to which Ms. Fellner has entered guilty plea are straight- forward and undisputed. Shortly after 1:00 p.m. on April 25, 2014, the police received complaint about vehicle that was travelling in excess of the speed limit and overtaking vehicles when it was unsafe to do so. At one point, it ran off the road into the ditch and then continued north bound on the highway. police officer was able to stop the vehicle and speak to the accused who was the driver. He noted that she appeared nervous, used words in an odd order and handed him memorial card for her grandfather when asked for her vehicle registration. He also noted smell of beverage alcohol that was somewhat masked by the odour of mouth wash. The accused complied with demand that she provide sample of her breath into roadside device and, when that resulted in fail, she also complied with demand that she provide sample of her breath pursuant to s. 254(3) of the Criminal Code. Those tests resulted in two readings of .29. The officer expressed shock at those readings as the accused’s speech was clear and her walking gait appeared normal. The accused admitted to the officer that she has been an alcoholic for many years and lived daily under the influence of alcohol. [3] Ms. Fellner testified that she has consumed alcohol since she was 15 or 16 years old. Until she was in her 20's her drinking pattern may have been considered excessive, but was primarily social. She would drink from Friday to Sunday, usually with the objective of getting drunk and often to the point of blacking out. In her mid 20's, she continued this pattern but also began to drink alone one or two times month. By the time she was in her late 20's, her drinking increased and she was drinking alone about five times week and would consume two bottles of wine in sitting. In 2006, at the age of 26, she was convicted of driving while over the legal limit. In 2010, she returned to Saskatchewan to be near her family but she continued to drink heavily. She was convicted and imprisoned that year for another drinking and driving offence; her sentence was served at the Impaired Driver Treatment Centre. She remained sober for only few months before resuming old habits. After her arrest in April 2014, her consumption escalated; she was drinking daily with periodic binges. In those binge times, she would consume 40 ounce bottle of liquor and two bottles of wine daily for three or four days. Throughout the years, she was able to maintain her employment but occasionally did miss work as result of her alcohol consumption. [4] In June 2014, she was admitted to Larson House for detoxification but, on discharge, immediately went back to drinking. In August, she described having “a moment of clarity” when she realized that she would either have to quit drinking or die. As result, she admitted herself into treatment the next day, August 19, 2014. She completed one week of detoxification followed by five weeks of intensive treatment at the Leipzig Serenity Retreat. She sold her home to fund this treatment. [5] Upon discharge, she was given number of guidelines intended to assist her in maintaining sobriety, including regular attendance at Alcoholics Anonymous (AA). She now works in Regina to be near supportive family and friends, attends two or three AA meetings week, meets with group to work through the AA steps and has made friends who are also in recovery. At the time of the application, she had been sober for approximately 572 days and accepts that she can never drink alcohol again. [6] Angela Fellner, sister-in-law and long time friend of the accused, confirmed some of the above evidence with respect to the drinking habits of the accused. She also testified to the changes that the accused has made in the last 18 months and noted that she is now very open about her addiction. She confirmed that the accused has re-established connections with family members rather than isolating herself as she had been prone to do in the past. [7] Larry Foster retired in October 2015 from his position as an addiction counsellor at Leipzig. He is recovering alcoholic who has been sober since 1985. He has daily post on Facebook related to alcoholism recovery. He came to know the accused as client at the Leipzig centre where she was involved in very in-depth 12-Step Program, as well as the emotional health program offered there. Since her discharge, he has met with her personally on four or five occasions and noted that she responds to his posts on Facebook almost daily. [8] Brenda Hearn has been chemical dependance counsellor and consultant since 2008; it was agreed that she was qualified to express opinion evidence with respect to alcohol addiction, treatment and counselling. She has not seen the accused on professional basis, but did listen to her testimony. Ms. Hearn described detoxification as serving the narrow function of physical stabilization as individuals often feel ill as they withdraw from regular use of alcohol. Detoxification is necessary to enable individuals to focus on subsequent treatment. She is familiar with the programs offered at the Leipzig Serenity Retreat and with the tenets of the 12-steps program espoused by Alcoholics Anonymous. She frequently refers individuals to AA as it provides “community of like minded people prepared to support each other in similar goals”. She views this as vital to any recovery. In her opinion, Ms. Fellner will never be able to consume alcohol socially without risk of relapse. Further, it was her view that the manner in which the accused spoke of her involvement in AA suggests that she is immersed in and committed to her treatment regimen. [9] When asked about the recovery time for alcoholism, Ms. Hearn opined that physical recovery of the brain can occur in about 24 months from the onset of sobriety. After five or six years of sobriety, some would say recovery is complete; she suggests that this is late stage or long term recovery which still requires that person continue with the maintenance tasks to maintain sobriety. In her experience, there can be rapid return to stage of denial and attendance at AA meetings serves as reminder of what brought one to treatment. There is no scientific way to predict relapse, but continued attendance at AA will assist in identifying the triggers that cause individuals to turn to alcohol. She characterized 572 days of sobriety as “a good start” and suggested that the accused should continue attending AA two to three times week for the next year at minimum. Ideally, the accused should attend two to three meetings week for the next three years. She was also of the view that continued contact with professional addictions counsellor is necessary to ensure any signs of relapse are recognized. [10] listened closely to all of the evidence and have since taken the time to review and consider all of the evidence and exhibits, the able arguments of counsel, the decision of the Saskatchewan Court of Appeal in Ahenakew 2005 SKCA 93 (CanLII) [Ahenakew] as well as the other cases to which reference is made in this decision. These cases illustrate that our Courts are too frequently called upon to deal with the aftermath of drunk drivers. As Justice Cory so graphically stated in Bernshaw, 1995 CanLII 150 (SCC), [1995] SCR 254 at para 16: Every year drunk driving leaves terrible trail of death, injury, heartbreak and destruction. From the point of view of numbers alone, it has far greater impact on Canadian society than any other crime. In terms of death and serious injuries resulting in hospitalization drunk driving is clearly the crime which causes the most significant social loss to the country. [11] Sadly, in spite of an increasing recognition in society of the perils of drinking and driving, the number of people who offend in this manner is increasing in Saskatchewan. Nonetheless, there is also concurrent recognition that increased penalties for drinking and driving are not always the appropriate way to deal with the problem. Accordingly, Parliament has granted to the Courts, in s. 255(5) of the Criminal Code, discretion to grant curative discharge to an offender if: (i) the accused is in need of curative treatment regarding his or her alcohol consumption; and (ii) curative discharge would not be contrary to the public interest. [12] The onus lies with the applicant to establish these factors on balance of probabilities. In the words of Griffins JA, in Ashberry (Mills), (1989) 1989 CanLII 7230 (ON CA), 47 CCC (3d) 138 (Ont CA) [Ashberry], at page 161, the onus lies with the applicant to establish that particular case is “...sufficiently exceptional to warrant recourse to the curative/conditional discharge provision of the Code ...” [13] The Saskatchewan Court of Appeal in Ahenakew adopted the non-exhaustive list of factors referred to by the Ontario Court of Appeal in Ashberry in determining whether case is “sufficiently exceptional” to merit discharge. Those factors are: (i) the circumstances of the offence and whether an accident, death or serious bodily harm was involved; (ii) the motivation of the offender and its relation to the probable benefits of treatment; (iii) the availability and calibre of the proposed treatment facilities and the ability of the offender to complete the programming; (iv) the probability of the success of the offender and the likelihood that he or she will ever drive again while under the influence of alcohol; and (v) the prior criminal record as measure of risk of recidivism posed by the particular offender. [14] In the case at hand, the evidence is clear that this accused is in need of treatment to deal with her alcohol consumption and addiction. The main question is whether it would be contrary to the public interest to grant discharge in her particular circumstances. Although the offence before the court did not involve an accident, death or serious personal injury, it is always grave situation when an individual, having consumed as much alcohol as this accused did, operates vehicle on public road at highway speeds and places others in jeopardy. In this instance, it was only fate, the grace of God or the quick wit of others that prevented an accident, death or serious injury; it certainly had nothing to do with the actions or decisions of the accused. On the other hand, there is no question that this accused is highly motivated to overcome or control her addiction and that for approximately 18 months has greatly benefited from treatment. Her actions in selling her home to pay for in-patient treatment, moving to another city and taking lower paying job in order to be near the support system that she needs, as well as her dedication to the AA program speaks volumes about her motivation and the success of the treatment on which she has embarked. That success speaks not only to her dedication but to the efficacy of the treatment facility and program that she has chosen. Further, the probability of her continued abstinence, according to Ms. Hearn, is closely related to the connections that she has established in the treatment community and in her personal life. conclude that she now has the support of number of individuals, in large part, because of her honesty and candour about her problem and her need for help in dealing with it. This bodes well for her long term success according to the professional opinion of Ms. Hearn; in turn, her continued success increases the probability that she will never drink and drive again. [15] The greatest concern for the Court centres on the fact that this accused has two prior convictions for identical offences and has, in fact, been through the program for drinking drivers offered at the Impaired Driver Treatment Centre in 2010. After her first conviction in 2006, it appears that her pattern of drinking remained unchanged and criminal conviction, fine and licence suspension did nothing to deter her conduct or address her addiction. Similarly, second conviction, which resulted in custodial sentence and programming, did nothing to deter her from offending. prior record, however, does not preclude the granting of curative discharge: see Redding, [2009] SJ No 134, Mostoway, 2012] SJ No 165, Almassey, [2013] SJ No 26 but it does place somewhat greater burden on an accused to satisfy the Court that his or her case is an exceptional one: see Ahenakew at para 46. [16] Although it can never be said with certainty that Ms. Fellner will not drink and drive again, her conduct over the last 18 months suggests that it is probable she will not. I am satisfied, on a balance of probabilities, that Ms. Fellner has shown that hers is the exceptional case contemplated in Ashberry and Ahenakew and that a curative discharge would not be contrary to the public interest. It is my view that, in this case, curative discharge will better serve the public interest than would the imposition of fine or custodial sentence. Ms. Fellner has demonstrated sincere commitment to change as demonstrated by 18 months of sobriety and the course of treatment in which she engaged; this bodes well for her continued sobriety. It is her adherence to her treatment program that will best provide public protection and thus, best serve the community interests. [17] In conclusion, the Court is satisfied that Ms. Fellner has met the onus placed on her in this application and she will be granted a curative discharge. accept the evidence of Ms. Hearn that Ms. Fellner has made “good start” and that conditions should be imposed for period of three years. In addition to the statutory conditions, those conditions are that Ms. Fellner:(i) report forthwith, and no later than 4 p.m. March 1, 2016 to a probation officer and thereafter at the times and places directed by the probation officer;(ii) reside at a residence approved by the Probation Officer and not change that address without the permission of the Probation Officer;(iii) make and maintain any appointments with an addictions counsellor as directed by the Probation Officer;(iv) participate in any addictions assessment, programming or education, including in-patient and out-patient treatment, as directed by the Probation Officer and not give cause to be dismissed from any treatment program to which referred;(v) provide proof of attendance at appointments or treatment as requested by the Probation Officer;(vi) attend and participate in Alcoholics Anonymous meetings on a regular basis and no less than twice per week except with prior permission of your Probation Officer;(vii) provide your consent to AA to release proof of attendance at AA meetings;(viii) at the direction and request of the probation officer provide proof of attendance at AA meetings;(viii) not to have, possess, keep or consume alcohol or enter any licenced premises where the main purpose is the sale or consumption of alcohol;(x) submit, on demand of a peace officer, without reasonable grounds, to supply a breath sample in order to determine compliance with this order; and(xi) attend and participate in any personal counselling including psychological or psychiatric treatment as directed by the Probation Officer. [18] Further, given her two prior convictions for drinking and driving, Ms. Fellner’s driver’s licence is immediately cancelled and she is prohibited from operating any motor vehicle on any street, road, highway or other public place anywhere in Canada for a period of two (2) years, commencing today.

History of Proceedings [6] The mother and father lived together as common-law spouses from January 2005 until January 2008.
[7] In the father’s Answer he did not dispute the mother’s claim for declaration of parentage, her claim for child support or her request that the children be designated as beneficiaries of any life insurance, pension plan or health care plan he owned.
[8] The father brought notice of motion in March of 2009 requesting an interim order for joint custody of the two children.
[11] It was not until after the mother’s death in January 2015 that matters regarding the children came back before the Court.
In May 2015 the grandmother brought an application requesting she be joined as party to the proceedings and she be named person of sufficient interest regarding the children.
[12] On May 20, 2015 Gabrielson J. made an interim order designating the grandmother as person of sufficient interest to the children and added her as party to the action.
[15] On January 7, 2016 the matter proceeded to pre-trial settlement conference.
Unfortunately, no agreement could be reached regarding the ongoing parenting arrangement for the two children.
[16] At the conclusion of the trial made an order respecting access for the summer of 2017.
In essence, set out specific dates such that the grandmother and the father would share the summer holidays in an approximately equal arrangement.

[22] The grandmother testified she looked after the children lot while the mother was living with her from 2008 to 2011.
[23] The maternal grandmother was looking after the children full time, and she brought them to the hospital to see their mother every day.

photo taken in the summer of 2016 shows the father, the two boys and their cousin having fun in great tent in the back yard.
[32] When asked why he had so many employment positions, the father said he had to quit or was fired as result of false allegations being made about him.
[33] As set out previously, an interim order in this matter was granted in March 2009 specifying the father would have supervised access to the children.
The Maher J. order of December 11, 2009 continued the father’s every second weekend unsupervised access.
[35] The father testified he stopped doing drugs approximately three years ago and only has one beer on occasion.
[36] In accordance with the order of Maher J. the father was to be having time with the children every second weekend.
[37] It is not disputed that the mother entered into relationship with Josh Melnyk and commenced cohabitation with him in approximately February 2011.
The father testified he could not contact the mother even though he sent messages to her numerous times.
Despite his knowledge, the father took no steps to bring this matter back to court requesting continuation of his access visits with the children.
However, the father could have served her with an application for contempt by obtaining an order for substitutional service on the grandmother.
[41] The father first contacted the grandmother via Facebook January 21, 2015.
After expressing his condolences, his message to the grandmother says that he is “hoping that we can talk about the boys.
In addition, the grandmother and the father were to split the spring break and Easter holidays on an equal basis.
[46] The father said he would have lot of help and support if the children were to come into his sole custody.
The Grandmother [47] The grandmother is 48 years old and is the mother of four children.
[49] The grandmother had been working at pharmacy when the mother went into the hospital in February 2014.
The grandmother says it is not necessary for her to return to work as she receives monthly workplace insurance funds as result of the death of Dion.
In addition to the monthly pension funds, the grandmother received lump sum payment of $69,000.
[50] The grandmother has been one of or the primary care provider for the two boys for significant portion of their lives.
One of the photos shows the two boys with large teddy bear they brought to their mother in the hospital.
[53] After their mother’s death, the grandmother wanted the children to attend counselling to deal with their grief.
[54] As result of the refusal of the father to allow for counselling, Tholl J. made an order on August 2015.
She is of the view the children are doing much better at this time, which is reflected in their school marks and achievements.
[56] The grandmother wants the children to remain in her primary care and attend the same school they have been attending.
It is the grandmother’s view that the two children have settled into the current parenting arrangement and enjoy the time they have with their father.
They like to bake, and there are lovely photos of the boys making biscuits for supper as well as gingerbread cake at Christmas.
[59] heard evidence from Darlene Callaghan, who described the grandmother as one of her best friends.
Further, she has witnessed their excitement to see the grandmother when they return from visit from their father’s home.
[62] As regards Haydn, the grandmother said he liked school but not as much as his brother Arty.
[66] reviewed the children’s school report cards for the years from 2013/2014, 2015/2016 and to March 2017.
[67] Arty’s report card of March 2017 shows how well Arty is doing in school.
[70] was very pleased to receive evidence that the two children are basically healthy and have come long way after their mother’s death towards being happy.
[72] The father argued that he was entitled to custody of the children pursuant to s. 4(1) above.
However, the father failed to consider s. 6(1) which provides the Court with jurisdiction to order custody to parent or other person.
Section 6(1) commences with the words “Notwithstanding sections to 5” allowing the Court to order custody to someone other than the surviving parent.
The matter will not be determined solely on the basis of the physical comfort and material advantages that may be available in the home of one contender or the other.
Parental claims must not be lightly set aside, and they are entitled to serious consideration in reaching any conclusion.
[Emphasis added] 107 It is obvious that parental ties are an important factor in determining custody.
In the case of an infant, the Court must consider the potential harm to child in disrupting attachments that have developed or are in the advanced stages of formation.
[77] After consideration of these legal principles as applied to the circumstances before him, Smith J. dismissed the biological father’s claim for custody.
Maher J. refers to the summary of law as set out by Smith J. in Hendricks and concludes that there is strong psychological bond between the grandmother and granddaughter.
He says neither of the biological parents have the same bond as they only recently became part of their child’s life.
[79] Of course, determination of the best interests of child is to be made on case-by-case basis with reflection on the circumstances of the family before the Court.
[81] review of the factors as they relate to the family before me is as follows: (i) The quality of Arty and Haydn’s relationship to the grandmother and the father.
[82] The grandmother has provided stability for the two children throughout their lives.
She was there for them as they grieved their mother’s death, and she arranged for counselling to assist the children with the grieving process.
There is lovely photo of the two boys sending balloons into the air with messages to their mother inside on Mother’s Day.
27 at 92-93, L’Heureux-Dubé J. comments on the significance of the primary caregiver and psychological parent: The assessment of the child’s best interests also involves consideration of the particular role and emotional bonding the child enjoys with his or her primary caregiver.
There is growing body of evidence that this relationship may well be the most determinative factor on the child’s long-term welfare.
[87] When the children are in the care of the father, it is obvious they enjoy being with him and doing all the activities he arranges for them.
Both the grandmother and the father gave evidence that they would like to see the boys active and involved in activities other than “screen” games.
[92] After finding out the mother had cancer, the father did not attempt to provide support to the children.
[93] am also concerned the father believes nothing would really change if the children were transferred from the care of the grandmother to his home.
The father’s comments show an entire lack of understanding about the psychological issues for children when they are removed from their primary caregiver and are forced to change schools and neighbourhoods.
At present, the children are assisted with their homework by either the grandmother or the father or someone else in their respective homes.
It is my belief that both the grandmother and the father want the children to be happy, healthy and independent at some point in their future.
On the other hand, heard evidence that the children are very happy to see their grandmother when they return from an access visit with the father.
The father should play significant role in the children’s lives and become more of parent than the “Disneyland dad” he described.
strongly believe that the grandmother and the father will be able to work together as they both recognize it is in the best interests of the children to do so.
The parties shall discuss and decide jointly all major decisions with respect to health, education and religion of the children.
In the event the parties cannot agree on significant issue, the grandmother shall make the determination.
The grandmother shall have the sole authority to make all day-to-day decisions regarding health, dental care and counselling.
[103] This was very difficult matter, and both the grandmother and the father have been partially successful.","HELD: The court found the following with respect to each issue: 1) the grandmother was a person of sufficient interest regarding the children pursuant to s. 6 of The Children’s Law Act, 1997 and had standing to bring her application for custody; 2) it would be in the best interests of the children, now aged ten and nine years of age, to have their primary residence with their grandmother as she was their psychological parent.
They had resided with their grandmother for most of their lives and it was important to maintain their relationships with their school and friends.
The respondent would have regular weekly parenting time with the children; and 3) the evidence was inadequate to consider child support.",51,"nan QUEEN’S BENCH FOR SASKATCHEWAN Citation: 2017 SKQB 219 Date: 2017 07 17 Docket: FLD 269 of 2008 Judicial Centre: Saskatoon (Family Law Division) BETWEEN: MEGAN ASHLEY WOLFE and SHAWN SCOTT DIEDERICHS and COLLEEN WOLFE THIRD PARTY Appearances: (Megan A. Wolfe deceased) Shawn S. Diederichs appearing on his own behalf Davin R. Burlingham appearing for the third party JUDGMENT WILSON J. July 17, 2017 Introduction [1] The third party in this matter is the maternal grandmother of the two children, Gage Arthur Diederichs [Arty], born September 18, 2006 and Haydn Lee Dion Wolfe, born May 1, 2008. The respondent, Shawn Diederichs, is the biological father of the two children. Sadly, the petitioner, Megan Wolfe, died of cancer on January 19, 2015. She was the biological mother of the two children. [2] The grandmother argues she is person of sufficient interest with respect to the two boys. Her position is that she and the father should have joint custody of the boys but her home be the children’s primary residence. She also seeks an order providing her with sole decision-making authority regarding medical care, counselling and education. She is willing to provide the father with parenting time with the children. [3] The father takes the position that it would be in the best interests of the children to move from the primary care of the grandmother to his primary care. He seeks an order that he have custody of the children. He is not opposed to the grandmother having reasonable and liberal access with the children. [4] Finally, the grandmother requests an order obligating the father to pay child support for the children if she is successful in her request for primary care of the children. [5] The following issues must be determined: 1. Is the maternal grandmother person of sufficient interest with respect to the children; 2. If the grandmother is person of sufficient interest, what parenting arrangement would be in the best interests of the children; and 3. If conclude that the children should remain in the primary care of the maternal grandmother, what, if any, child support should be payable by the father to the grandmother. History of Proceedings [6] The mother and father lived together as common-law spouses from January 2005 until January 2008. After the parties separated the mother proceeded with Petition, issued August 26, 2008, claiming custody of the children. The father did not respond to the Petition and was noted for default on October 7, 2008. However, the father subsequently obtained the services of counsel, and motion was made to set aside the noting for default. With the consent of counsel for the mother, the noting was set aside January 26, 2009. The father then filed his Answer and Counter-Petition. [7] In the father’s Answer he did not dispute the mother’s claim for declaration of parentage, her claim for child support or her request that the children be designated as beneficiaries of any life insurance, pension plan or health care plan he owned. He opposed the mother’s claim for custody and her request that she be allowed to appoint person to have custody of the children and be guardian of the property of the children upon her death. [8] The father brought notice of motion in March of 2009 requesting an interim order for joint custody of the two children. He also asked for liberal access to the children and declaration by the Court that he was the father of the children. After reviewing the extensive affidavit material filed and hearing from counsel on behalf of both the mother and father, Mills J. granted an interim order on March 27, 2009. Pursuant to the terms of the interim order, the father was declared to be the father of the two children. The father was granted supervised access to the two children through the Supervised Access Program offered by Family Justice Services. His access was stated to be “no more than one hour per week for the first month from the date of this order” and “no more than two hours per week for the next four months following”. [9] In August 2009 Family Justice Services filed with the Court the Supervised Access Program Reports regarding the father’s supervised access visits for the time period from April 2009 to August 2009. The issue of the father’s access was then argued before Dufour J. on October 9, 2009. Dufour J. amended the father’s access from supervised to unsupervised. He granted the father access every second weekend from Friday evening to Sunday evening. He did, however, specify that all access would be exercised in Saskatoon. Further, due to continuing conflict between the parents, exchange of the children was to be supervised by the Family Justice Services Supervised Exchange Program. Finally, Dufour J. indicated that the matter should once again come before the Court on December 11, 2009 for an update on the father’s access. [10] At the December 11, 2009 court appearance, Maher J. continued the access as set out by Dufour J. However, he added conditions to the father’s access. Specifically he ordered that the father not have in his residence alcohol or non-prescription drugs and not be under the influence of alcohol or non-prescription drugs for minimum of 12 hours prior to him obtaining access to the children and throughout the time the children were with him. [11] It was not until after the mother’s death in January 2015 that matters regarding the children came back before the Court. In May 2015 the grandmother brought an application requesting she be joined as party to the proceedings and she be named person of sufficient interest regarding the children. Further, she requested an interim order granting her sole custody of the children and an order that the father have supervised access to the children. [12] On May 20, 2015 Gabrielson J. made an interim order designating the grandmother as person of sufficient interest to the children and added her as party to the action. With respect to the father’s access with the children, he ordered the father’s access to be supervised by his aunt, Arlene Viden. [13] To their credit, the grandmother and father were able to come to an agreement and an interim consent order was granted by Dufour J. on July 15, 2015. In accordance with the terms of that order, the father’s access went from supervised to unsupervised and was to continue to occur every second weekend from Friday at 6:00 p.m. to Sunday at 6:00 p.m. The parties further agreed that the father would have telephone access to the children once per week. The matter was then adjourned over to the specific date of August 14, 2015. [14] On August 14, 2015 Tholl J. made an order that the grandmother and father have interim joint custody of the children. However, he granted the grandmother sole authority to make all decisions and provide all authorizations and consents regarding medical care, counselling and education for the two children. In his order he indicated that the father would have the right to be provided with all information regarding medical, counselling, educational issues directly from the care providers or the school or educational institution in the same manner as parent with sole custody would have. Finally, Tholl J. ordered the father would continue to have access to the children as ordered by Dufour J. and the children would continue to reside primarily with their grandmother. Tholl J. then directed the matter to proceed to an expedited pre-trial. [15] On January 7, 2016 the matter proceeded to pre-trial settlement conference. After settlement discussions, the parties agreed to an interim parenting arrangement whereby the father would have access with the boys for three weekends in row with no access on the fourth weekend. The parties also agreed to split the spring break and Easter holidays on an equal basis. This agreement was considered an interim arrangement to be tried by the parties. On November 16, 2016 the pre-trial conference was reconvened. Unfortunately, no agreement could be reached regarding the ongoing parenting arrangement for the two children. The matter then proceeded to trial before me. [16] At the conclusion of the trial made an order respecting access for the summer of 2017. In essence, set out specific dates such that the grandmother and the father would share the summer holidays in an approximately equal arrangement. Person of Sufficient Interest [17] There is an interim order designating the grandmother as a person of sufficient interest. This designation was made pursuant to s. 6 of The Children’s Law Act, 1997, SS 1997, c C-8.2. The designation of the grandmother as person of sufficient interest on an interim basis does not bind me when considering whether or not to grant person of sufficient interest status to the grandmother after having heard all of the evidence at trial. It is only if grant the grandmother the appropriate status that she can apply for custody of the children. Section 6.1 of The Children’s Law Act reads as follows: 6(1) Notwithstanding sections to 5, on the application of parent or other person having, in the opinion of the court, sufficient interest, the court may, by order: (a) grant custody of or access to child to one or more persons; (b) determine any aspect of the incidents of the right to custody or access; and (c) make any additional order that the court considers necessary and proper in the circumstances. [Emphasis added] [18] The Saskatchewan Court of Appeal decision in S.(G.E.) C.(D.L.), 2006 SKCA 79 (CanLII), 285 Sask 19 [S.(G.E.)], provides guidance regarding the steps must take when applications are brought by individuals other than mother or father. At para. 47 of that decision, Richards J.A. (as he then was) stated as follows: 47 The proper focus of an inquiry in relation to the “sufficient interest” question, in my view, is the nature of the relationship between the applicant and the child. The question of the child's best interests does not enter the analysis at that point. In determining whether non-family applicant is person with sufficient interest, the court should consider variety of factors including, but not necessarily limited to: (a) the extent or degree of the applicant’s involvement in the child’s life, (b) the duration of that involvement, (c) the level of intimacy and the quality of the relationship between the applicant and the child, (d) how the relationship between the applicant and the child was represented to the world, and (e) whether the applicant provided financially for the child. Further, at least in relation to situations such as the one at issue in this appeal where there is no traditional family or blood relationship between the applicant and the child, it is necessary to consider whether the applicant can show settled commitment to the child and an intention to be continuing and meaningful presence in the life of the child. Overall, in the kinds of circumstances involved here, s. generally should be applied to screen out applicants who do not have both significant relationship with the child and demonstrated and settled ongoing commitment to the child. [19] The Court of Appeal in S.(G.E.) was dealing with request by third party “friend” of the children’s biological mother. He sought access visits with the mother’s twins. In the matter before me, the applicant is the maternal grandmother who is making an application for custody of the two boys. The two-stage analysis is equally applicable when family member pursues custody. [20] It is not disputed that the mother and father commenced cohabitating relationship in January 2005 when the mother was 18 and the father was 25 years old. The mother and father resided together until their separation in 2008. At the date of the separation the parties’ youngest child, Haydn, had not yet been born. The mother left with the oldest child, Arty, after police involvement. The father was charged with assault of the mother, but he denies having assaulted her. He did, however, acknowledge he signed peace bond to, as he put it, “get it over with”. The mother moved into the maternal grandmother’s home with Arty. The parties’ second child, Haydn, was born while the mother was continuing to reside with the maternal grandmother. As set out previously, the father’s initial access with the children was supervised and then proceeded to unsupervised access. [21] The mother and the two children lived with the maternal grandmother until the mother moved in with her boyfriend, Josh Melnyk, in approximately February 2011. The mother gave birth to twins from her relationship with Josh on November 26, 2011. The mother lived with Josh, the twins and Arty and Haydn until she went into the hospital in February of 2014. [22] The grandmother testified she looked after the children lot while the mother was living with her from 2008 to 2011. Further, even after the mother moved out to live with Josh, the maternal grandmother indicated that she stayed very involved. In February 2014 the children, Arty and Haydn, moved into the grandmother’s home as the mother needed to be hospitalized. The mother was in hospital for almost year before she passed away January 19, 2015. [23] The maternal grandmother was looking after the children full time, and she brought them to the hospital to see their mother every day. She ensured the children attended school and did everything she could to support the children as their mother was dying. [24] I have no difficulty determining that the maternal grandmother is a person of sufficient interest regarding Arty and Haydn. Not only does the grandmother have “blood tie” to the children, but the children have lived with the grandmother for significant portion of their lives. The grandmother has standing under The Children’s Law Act to bring her application for custody. CUSTODY AND ACCESS [25] The father was born July 7, 1979. He is now 38 years old. [26] The father currently resides at home in Saskatoon located at 3421 Harrington Street. There are four people living full time in the home. The father’s sister Tammy lives in the home and works days. The father’s nephew Gabriel lives in the home and attends school at Evan Hardy Collegiate. Finally, Arlene Viden, the father’s aunt, resides in the home on Harrington Street. She is currently not working as she is receiving disability as result of car accident. The father testified that the home is huge home located in friendly and safe neighbourhood. [27] The father filed photo album which includes number of photos of the home. There is delightful photo showing the front of the house with the children all dressed up for Halloween. There is photo of the bedroom where the two boys sleep when they stay at the father’s home. Each of the boys has single bed, and they appear to have decorated their room with movie posters. There is photo of the backyard of the home. There is large deck and large green space where the father said trampoline can be set up, and the kids can play catch. The large backyard is also used for activities like bonfires and tenting. photo taken in the summer of 2016 shows the father, the two boys and their cousin having fun in great tent in the back yard. [28] Across the street from the father’s home is very large park. The father testified that the children play in the park frequently. He also testified that there are three schools within walking distance of the home surrounding the park. If granted custody of the children, the father would move the children before September of 2017 from their current school into school closer to the home. [29] The father says he will remain in the Harrington Street home indefinitely. He acknowledged he was renting the home as opposed to purchasing the home but indicated that he had signed lease. Under cross-examination the father agreed he had moved many times in the past. The mother and father moved to Prince Albert when the mother was pregnant with the parties’ oldest son, Arty. The mother and father returned to Saskatoon and lived on Avenue North for few months and then separated while they were living at home on Avenue L. The father then lived at home on Wiggins Avenue, in trailer court on Rayner Avenue in Sutherland and has now moved into the College Park area with the home on Harrington Street. [30] The father is currently working in the construction industry doing renovations. He testified he is not employed for any one company and works on contract basis. He earns approximately $2,000 $3,000 per month. The father works from 9:00 a.m. until approximately 5:00 p.m. each day. [31] The father has had numerous employment positions in the past. When the parties were in Prince Albert, he worked for Husky Gas. He has subsequently worked for Night Owl Confectionery, Gas Plus, Saskatoon Wash World, Ramada Hotel in maintenance, the City of Saskatoon and Got Mold. [32] When asked why he had so many employment positions, the father said he had to quit or was fired as result of false allegations being made about him. He testified that the police were always showing up with accusations. This was during the time period after he had separated from the mother. He acknowledged, however, that not long after the mother left he was experiencing extreme stress and had to stop work as result of his health. [33] As set out previously, an interim order in this matter was granted in March 2009 specifying the father would have supervised access to the children. It is clear there were concerns regarding the father’s use of alcohol and drugs. Under cross-examination he conceded he smoked marijuana and “maybe” hashish. He acknowledged that when he was 20 he used crystal meth but said he never did meth on regular basis. [34] After the father’s supervised access returned to court for review, an order was made that he would have unsupervised access every second weekend from Friday to Sunday evening. The father’s access to the children was to be reviewed approximately two months later by the Court. The Maher J. order of December 11, 2009 continued the father’s every second weekend unsupervised access. However, there remained concerns about the father’s possible addictions to alcohol and drugs. Maher J. ordered the father not have any alcohol or non-prescription drugs in his residence. Further, Maher J. ordered the father not be under the influence of alcohol or non-prescription drugs for minimum of 12 hours prior to him obtaining access to the children and throughout the time the children were with him. [35] The father testified he stopped doing drugs approximately three years ago and only has one beer on occasion. He said “I do drink, but not lot”. He further clarified that the two children were not in his care when he would have drink. [36] In accordance with the order of Maher J. the father was to be having time with the children every second weekend. There is some conflict in the evidence as regards the father’s reliability in his access visits with the children. The grandmother testified that approximately year or so after his unsupervised visits started in December 2009, the father’s visits “fizzled out”. From the father’s evidence, which is not entirely clear, he was regularly having every second weekend with the children until August 2013. [37] It is not disputed that the mother entered into relationship with Josh Melnyk and commenced cohabitation with him in approximately February 2011. As set out previously, the mother and Josh had twins in November 2011. The mother and Josh originally lived in Saskatoon and subsequently lived in Young and Watrous, Saskatchewan. [38] The grandmother testified it was her understanding the father had not been involved with the children between 2011, when the mother moved in with Josh, until he expressed interest in seeing them month after the mother’s death. The father says he was seeing the children until August 2013 when the mother “abducted” the children. The father testified he could not contact the mother even though he sent messages to her numerous times. He said he went to the police, Social Services and the legal organization CLASSIC but was unable to get any help. However, the father admitted he was aware the mother had moved to Young, then to Watrous. He further acknowledged he knew where the grandmother resided at all times. Despite his knowledge, the father took no steps to bring this matter back to court requesting continuation of his access visits with the children. do not condone the mother’s actions of moving with the children without the consent of the father or an order of the Court. At minimum she should have given him notice of her intention to move. However, the father could have served her with an application for contempt by obtaining an order for substitutional service on the grandmother. am sure he would have been assisted by CLASSIC to represent himself. The father represented himself at trial. He was very prepared, and he more than adequately conducted his case before me. [39] If accept the father’s evidence, he was not seeing the children from August 2013 to May 2015, period of approximately two years. If accept the grandmother’s evidence, he was absent for approximately four years. It is likely that the father’s access visits were sporadic prior to the mother’s move. The father’s testimony on this point was weak. However, there are photos of the father with the children in the summer of 2011, the spring and summer of 2012, and the spring and summer of 2013. [40] In August 2014 the father found out the mother had been diagnosed with cancer. He connected with the mother via Facebook to express his sympathy and asked her to call him. This did not happen. Subsequently he saw the Facebook message saying that the mother had passed away on January 19, 2015. [41] The father first contacted the grandmother via Facebook January 21, 2015. After expressing his condolences, his message to the grandmother says that he is “hoping that we can talk about the boys. Would love to hear from them so much”. This was the day before the mother’s funeral. He did not hear back from the grandmother. [42] The father went to the children’s school on January 26, 2015 and showed the secretary copy of the court order providing him with every second weekend time with the children. He was told the principal would need to contact him. On February 5, 2015 he again went to the school. At that time he met with the grandmother and the school principal. He said he asked if his every second weekend time with the children could be reinstated. The grandmother said no. She told him the children were too emotional to see him at that time. [43] The grandmother applied for custody of the children. She was granted interim custody. By court order the father began seeing the children in late May 2015. His time with the children was supervised by his aunt, Arlene. His time with the children went from supervised to unsupervised by July 2015. In January 2016 the father and grandmother reached an agreement whereby the father would have access with the boys for three weekends in row with no access on the fourth weekend. In addition, the grandmother and the father were to split the spring break and Easter holidays on an equal basis. This agreement was considered an interim arrangement by the parties. This arrangement is currently the arrangement in place. However, at the conclusion of the trial, ordered specific access for each of the grandmother and the father during summer holidays of 2017. During this summer, the parties are having the children in their respective care in an approximately equal arrangement. [44] The father’s aunt, Ms. Viden, testified at the trial. She confirmed she currently resides with the father and two others in the home located on Harrington Street in Saskatoon. She has had the opportunity of watching the father parent the children during the times the children are in his care. She testified the father is very attentive, helping the children do homework, ride bikes and other activities. She believes the relationship between the father and the children to be “great”. She says the children are always saying “dad, dad, let’s do this”. She has seen the father attend to matters such as hygiene with teeth brushing and showers every night. [45] The father has been seeking custody of the children for some time. Originally he suggested that the children move to his full-time care as at July 1, 2016. His position at trial was that the children should be moved to his care during the summer of 2017 so that they could commence attending their new school, close to the father’s home, in September 2017. The father was clear he did not want to be weekend dad or what he referred to as “Disneyland dad”. [46] The father said he would have lot of help and support if the children were to come into his sole custody. He was of the view that the change in custody would go very smooth and that the children’s lives would “continue as normal” for the most part. The Grandmother [47] The grandmother is 48 years old and is the mother of four children. Her oldest child was the mother of Arty and Haydn. The grandmother resided in common-law relationship with Dion Palmer for 25 years. Dion was employed as long-haul truck driver. Sadly, Dion died in workplace accident in November 2013. The grandmother is not in relationship at this time. [48] The grandmother resides at 135 Avenue South in Saskatoon. She has lived in this home for 18 years. The grandmother owns the home in her sole name, and there is no mortgage on the home. There are five people currently residing in the home. In addition to the grandmother, Arty and Haydn, two of her other children live in the home. Macayla is 20 years old and works as nail technician. Kody is 24 years old and drives for moving company. [49] The grandmother had been working at pharmacy when the mother went into the hospital in February 2014. She left her employment to stay home to look after Arty and Haydn full time. The grandmother says it is not necessary for her to return to work as she receives monthly workplace insurance funds as result of the death of Dion. She will receive the approximate sum of $2,000 per month for the rest of her life. In accordance with the letter to the grandmother from the Workplace Safety and Insurance Board, the grandmother’s monthly payments will be adjusted every year to account for cost of living. In addition to the monthly pension funds, the grandmother received lump sum payment of $69,000. Finally, she receives approximately $1,000 for the children. [50] The grandmother has been one of or the primary care provider for the two boys for significant portion of their lives. The mother and the two boys moved into the grandmother’s home after the mother’s separation from the father and stayed from 2008 to 2011. The grandmother, once again, commenced providing daily care to Arty and Haydn when the mother went into the hospital in February 2014. After the death of the mother, the grandmother’s home has continued to be the primary residence for the children with the father commencing visits with the children in May 2015. In total, the children have resided with the maternal grandmother for period of seven years during their lives. The children are now 10 and 9 years old. It is apparent the youngest boy, Haydn, has known his grandmother’s home as the only home where he resides, as seven of his nine years have been spent living in the grandmother’s home. [51] During the year the mother was in the hospital prior to her death, the grandmother took the children to the hospital every day. The children were attending St. Marie Goretti school where they continue to attend. The oldest child, Arty, had been at that school before when the mother and two children were living with the grandmother after the mother’s separation from the father. [52] The grandmother provided numerous photos of the children. The first photos she submitted into evidence are heartbreaking. One of the photos shows the two boys with large teddy bear they brought to their mother in the hospital. The second photo shows their mother in her hospital bed with tiara on her head and the two boys standing around her bed. The next two photos show the urn containing the mother’s ashes. The grandmother said the urn sits on the fireplace hearth and the children decorate around the urn on Mother’s Day and other special occasions like Christmas. One photo shows two beautiful Mother’s Day cards beside the urn. [53] After their mother’s death, the grandmother wanted the children to attend counselling to deal with their grief. The father would not agree. The grandmother needed his consent before counselling became available to the children. According to the grandmother, the father said the children do not need counselling, “they just needed him”. The father, on the other hand, says he was unwilling to agree to counselling at Catholic Family Services as he wanted the children to move into his full-time care and do counselling at Sutherland school where he anticipated they would attend. At this time, the father was living in trailer court in Sutherland. [54] As result of the refusal of the father to allow for counselling, Tholl J. made an order on August 2015. Pursuant to that order, the grandmother was granted sole authority to make all decisions and provide all authorizations and consents regarding medical care, counselling and education for Arty and Haydn. After receiving this court order, the two children were in counselling for approximately year. The grandmother filed receipts showing her payments to Catholic Family Services for the counselling. The father did not contribute to the costs of the counselling. [55] The grandmother testified the boys were devastated by the loss of Dion in November 2013 and even more so with the loss of their mother in early 2015. She said the boys talk about their mother lot, as well as Dion. She is of the view the children are doing much better at this time, which is reflected in their school marks and achievements. [56] The grandmother wants the children to remain in her primary care and attend the same school they have been attending. She would like to see the children proceed on to college, and she has put money away, from the accident settlement, in order to pay for college. As regards the relationship with their father, the grandmother said she wanted the children to have good relationship with their father and believed she and the father had been working well together on planning holidays, changing the schedule to provide extra nights for the father and arranging phone calls between the children and their father. It is the grandmother’s view that the two children have settled into the current parenting arrangement and enjoy the time they have with their father. [57] The two children enjoy many activities while in the home of the grandmother. Each summer the children swim in the large above-ground pool in the grandmother’s backyard. They like to bake, and there are lovely photos of the boys making biscuits for supper as well as gingerbread cake at Christmas. The boys like to play games with the grandmother as well as Macayla and Kody. There are number of photos of the boys playing “Speak Out”. The children also go to parks and Ruckers with the grandmother or their aunt Macayla or uncle Kody. [58] According to witnesses who testified on behalf of the grandmother, the grandmother has very close relationship with the children. Macayla testified the boys are “so good” with their grandmother. Dave McCrea has been friend of the grandmother for 20 years. Dion and Mr. McCrea had close friendship, and after Dion died, Mr. McCrea maintained relationship with the grandmother. He was there to help the family after Dion died. His observations of the grandmother are very positive. He observes the grandmother interacting with the children as if she was their mother. It was his view the children feel safe with her and rarely misbehave. He indicated that if the grandmother ever needed anything, he and his wife, Melanie, would be there for her, day or night. [59] heard evidence from Darlene Callaghan, who described the grandmother as one of her best friends. Ms. Callaghan has weekly contact with the grandmother either by text, phone or visits. She has observed the interaction between the grandmother and the children and says they are “very close”. She testified that in her view Haydn was “nanny’s” boy. Further, she has witnessed their excitement to see the grandmother when they return from visit from their father’s home. She describes the grandmother as being very loving, supportive and kind. The Children [60] As set out previously, Arty is now 10 years old and Haydn is now years old. heard wonderful things about the children from the individuals who testified at trial. [61] The grandmother testified that the two children are quite different. She said that Arty is quieter than Haydn and more of thinker. She said Haydn was the “goofy” one. According to the grandmother, Arty is particularly interested in science and math and has told the grandmother that he wants to go to college. He has said he may want to be policeman, or perhaps join the army. The grandmother said Arty loves books and movies like The Chronicles of Narnia. [62] As regards Haydn, the grandmother said he liked school but not as much as his brother Arty. According to the grandmother, Haydn is very interested in cooking and consistently helps her make supper. He also watches cooking shows. Some days Haydn tells her he will go on to college and on other days he says he will complete grade 12 and then work as chef. [63] The children’s aunt, Macayla, confirms the grandmother’s testimony about the personalities of the children. She said that Haydn was very outgoing and adventurous. Arty is more laid back and more emotional. [64] Mr. McCrea saw the children couple weeks prior to the trial. It was his impression that the children were doing well and appeared happy. He said the children were “good kids”. Ms. Callaghan remarked that the children were very polite, very well-behaved, kind and generous. [65] The father talked lot about the activities he and the children do when the children are in his care. He did not provide his view as to the children’s personalities. Likewise, his aunt, Ms. Viden, talked primarily about the home the children live in when they are in the father’s care and the activities the children do with the father. [66] reviewed the children’s school report cards for the years from 2013/2014, 2015/2016 and to March 2017. The report cards reflect the struggles of the children during the year after their mother died. Haydn had more difficulty than Arty in school after his mother’s death. However, school reports show great improvement by March 2017. As testified to by the grandmother, Haydn received lot of “Y’s” but also some “S’s”. The stands for “usually evident” with the standing for “sometimes evident”. [67] Arty’s report card of March 2017 shows how well Arty is doing in school. He received solid Y’s and was meeting expectations in almost all subject matters. In fact, in “participation” he was shown as surpassing expectations. [68] Both Arty and Haydn have been awarded certificates for various activities and doing well in school. Arty has received the following awards: 1. Award for personal success for being humble and respecting others (December 10, 2014); 2. certificate from Run Jump Throw Athletics Canada for successfully completing their program (June 2015); 3. personal success award for continuing to be friendly, energetic and helpful classmate (May 12, 2016); 4. certificate of achievement for having completed program called Kids Kitchen (May 3, 2016); 5. further certificate for having completed the Run Jump Throw program (June 9, 2016); and 6. personal success award for being an example of participation to others (November 28, 2016). [69] Haydn has also received certificates from school. The two certificates filed with the Court are: 1. An award for personal success for being courageous person (June 9, 2015); and 2. certificate where he is named BOKS Kid of the Day for being friendly, showing good effort, having good attitude and being team player (October 15, 2016). The grandmother described the BOKS program as standing for Building Our Kids’ Success. It requires Haydn to go in early to school and do physical activity like running. The grandmother said that Haydn was very excited when he got his certificate as he had worked very hard on running laps. [70] was very pleased to receive evidence that the two children are basically healthy and have come long way after their mother’s death towards being happy. Legal Principles [71] This action is governed by The Children’s Law Act. The relevant portions of The Children’s Law Act are as follows: 3(1) Unless otherwise ordered by the court and subject to subsection (2) and an agreement pursuant to subsection (3), the parents of child are joint legal custodians of the child with equal rights, powers and duties. 4(1) Subject to subsection (3), if parent is deceased, the surviving parent of child: (a) is the legal custodian of that child. 6(1) Notwithstanding sections to 5, on the application of parent or other person having, in the opinion of the court, sufficient interest, the court may, by order: (a) grant custody of or access to child to one or more persons; (b) determine any aspect of the incidents of the right to custody or access; and (c) make any additional order that the court considers necessary and proper in the circumstances. (5) When making an order pursuant to subsection (1), the court shall: (a) give effect to the principle that child should have as much contact with each parent as is consistent with the best interests of the child and, for that purpose, shall take into consideration the willingness of the person seeking custody to facilitate that contact; and (7) When making an order pursuant to this section, the court, in the manner and on the conditions that the court considers appropriate, may provide for: (a) the division and sharing of parental responsibilities; and (b) the granting of access. nan In making, varying or rescinding an order for custody of child, the court shall: (a) have regard only for the best interests of the child and for that purpose shall take into account: (i) the quality of the relationship that the child has with the person who is seeking custody and any other person who may have close connection with the child; (ii) the personality, character and emotional needs of the child; (iii) the physical, psychological, social and economic needs of the child; (iv) the capacity of the person who is seeking custody to act as legal custodian of the child; (v) the home environment proposed to be provided for the child; (vi) the plans that the person who is seeking custody has for the future of the child; and (vii) the wishes of the child, to the extent the court considers appropriate, having regard to the age and maturity of the child; (b) not take into consideration the past conduct of any person unless the conduct is relevant to the ability of that person to act as parent of child. [72] The father argued that he was entitled to custody of the children pursuant to s. 4(1) above. He said he is the surviving parent of the children and is, therefore, automatically the legal custodian of the children. However, the father failed to consider s. 6(1) which provides the Court with jurisdiction to order custody to parent or other person. Section 6(1) commences with the words “Notwithstanding sections to 5” allowing the Court to order custody to someone other than the surviving parent. [73] The father also argued that he has constitutional right to have custody of his children. He did not point to any provision of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms where such right is granted. In fact, there is no constitutional right. This case is not about the rights of the father. It is about the best interests of the children. [74] The father’s status as the biological father of the children is, however, factor that must be considered when determining the best interests of the children. As set out by Ryan-Froslie J. (as she then was) in S.A.L. K.H., 2011 SKQB 397 (CanLII), 384 Sask 263 [S.A.L.], the relationship between child and his biological parents is special one. In her decision she refers to the approach adopted by the Supreme Court of Canada in King Low, 1985 CanLII 59 (SCC), [1985] SCR 87. She states at paras. 106 and 107 of her decision as follows: 106 In King v. Low, supra, an unwed mother gave her son up for adoption few days after his birth to couple she had chosen. Less than three months later, she requested the child be returned to her care. The adoptive parents refused and an application for custody was initiated. In unanimous decision by the Supreme Court of Canada, McIntyre J. set out the law at para. 27 as follows: [27] This conclusion is consistent with modern authority in this Court and others: see Racine, Beson, and Re Moores and Feldstein. [Racine v. Woods, 1983 CanLII 27 (SCC), [1983] S.C.R. 173; Beson v. Director of Child Welfare (Nfld.), 1982 CanLII 32 (SCC), [1982] S.C.R. 716; and Re: Moores and Feldstein, 1973 CanLII 535 (ON CA), [1973] O.J. No. 2113, (1973), 12 R.F.L. 273(Ont. C.A.)] would therefore hold that in the case at bar the dominant consideration to which all other considerations must remain subordinate must be the welfare of the child. This is not to say that the question of custody will be determined by weighing the economic circumstances of the contending parties. The matter will not be determined solely on the basis of the physical comfort and material advantages that may be available in the home of one contender or the other. The welfare of the child must be decided on consideration of these and all other relevant factors, including the general psychological, spiritual and emotional welfare of the child. It must be the aim of the Court, when resolving disputes between rival claimants for the custody of child, to choose the course which will best provide for the healthy growth, development and education of the child so that he will be equipped to face the problems of life as mature adult. Parental claims must not be lightly set aside, and they are entitled to serious consideration in reaching any conclusion. Where it is clear that the welfare of the child requires it, however, they must be set aside. [Emphasis added] 107 It is obvious that parental ties are an important factor in determining custody. They must, however, give way to the welfare of the child. [75] In S.A.L. Ryan-Froslie J. refers to two decisions of our Court: Hendricks Swan, 2007 SKQB 36 (CanLII), 292 Sask 206 [Hendricks], decision of Smith J. and Edin Edin, 2008 SKQB 490 (CanLII), 328 Sask 54 [Edin], decision of Maher J. In Hendricks the dispute was between biological father and third-party respondents who had the care and custody of the child from the child’s birth. At para. 92 of his decision, Smith J. states as follows: 92 The direction from judicial authorities is crystal clear, namely, that consideration of any single factor, including kinship, must always remain and be subject to the primary consideration, namely, the best interests of the child. [76] After stating that the primary consideration for court in contests between birth parents and others is the best interests of child, Smith J. provides summary of the law as follows: 93 In summary, the instruction draw from the case law is that the critical elements the Court must consider in debate such as this are: (i) The paramount consideration is the best interests of the child; (ii) Blood ties are factor to be considered in determining the best interests of the child but they are to be considered from the point of view of the significance to the child, rather than the significance to the biological parent; (iii) The question must be asked which environment can best provide for the health, emotional well being, education, training, intellectual, economic and psychological needs of the child; (iv) The Court must consider uncertainties associated with transferring custody of child from known situation of security and stability to situation with many unknowns. In the case of an infant, the Court must consider the potential harm to child in disrupting attachments that have developed or are in the advanced stages of formation. [77] After consideration of these legal principles as applied to the circumstances before him, Smith J. dismissed the biological father’s claim for custody. [78] In Edin, the maternal grandmother petitioned for sole custody of her granddaughter. Maher J. refers to the summary of law as set out by Smith J. in Hendricks and concludes that there is strong psychological bond between the grandmother and granddaughter. He says neither of the biological parents have the same bond as they only recently became part of their child’s life. He makes comments about the child being able to stay at the same school, maintain relationships with her teachers, her friends and both of the biological parents if the child stayed in the care of the grandmother. [79] Of course, determination of the best interests of child is to be made on case-by-case basis with reflection on the circumstances of the family before the Court. There are Saskatchewan cases where biological fathers are granted custody as opposed to grandparent (see for example Haygarth Martel, 2012 SKQB 439 (CanLII), 410 Sask 96). [80] In making an order for custody must take into account only the best interests of these two children and, further, take into account the factors as set out in s. of The Children’s Law Act. [81] review of the factors as they relate to the family before me is as follows: (i) The quality of Arty and Haydn’s relationship to the grandmother and the father. [82] The grandmother has provided stability for the two children throughout their lives. She was there for them on daily basis to provide support when the relationship between the mother and father terminated. She was their primary caregiver during their mother’s one-year hospital stay before her death. She was there for them as they grieved their mother’s death, and she arranged for counselling to assist the children with the grieving process. The grandmother is keeping the children’s memories of their mother alive by marking special occasions like Mother’s Day. There is lovely photo of the two boys sending balloons into the air with messages to their mother inside on Mother’s Day. [83] The children refer to the grandmother as “nanna” and Ms. Callahagn described Haydn as “nanny’s” boy. On all of the evidence before me, the grandmother is the “psychological” parent for the boys. [84] The Saskatchewan Court of Appeal decision in Haider Malach (1999), 1999 CanLII 12363 (SK CA), 177 Sask 285, provides insight into the matter of psychological parents. Paragraph 82 of that decision states: 82 In Goertz v. Gordon, 1996 CanLII 191 (SCC), [1996] S.C.R. 27 at 92-93, L’Heureux-Dubé J. comments on the significance of the primary caregiver and psychological parent: The assessment of the child’s best interests also involves consideration of the particular role and emotional bonding the child enjoys with his or her primary caregiver. The importance of preserving the child’s relationship with his or her psychological parent has long been recognized by this Court on number of occasions (Catholic Children’s Aid Society of Metropolitan Toronto v. M.(C.), 1994 CanLII 83 (SCC), [1994] S.C.R. 165, at p. 202; Racine v. Woods, supra, at p. 188; King v. Low, 1985 CanLII 59 (SCC), [1985] S.C.R. 87, at p. 101). There is growing body of evidence that this relationship may well be the most determinative factor on the child’s long-term welfare. As mentioned in Young, supra, at p. 66 [1993 CanLII 34 (SCC), [1993] SCR 3], the vital link between continuity in the emotional bonding of the child with his or her psychological parent and the best interest of the child finds ample support in the literature: Goldstein, Freud and Solnit’s Beyond the Best Interests of the Child, supra, while perhaps lacking in empirical data, remains an influential analysis of the psychological needs of children following divorce. The authors emphasize, among other factors, the importance of continuity in the child’s relationships and conclude that the major focus of custody decisions should be to preserve and protect the relationship between the child and his or her psychological parent. [L’Heureux-Dubé J.’s emphasis] [85] The children are clearly emotionally bonded to their grandmother, and must recognize the importance of continuity in the children’s relationship with her. [86] The children have bond with their father as well. Since May 2015 the children have had time with their father on regular basis. His time with the children was set by adopting “staged” re-entrance into the children’s lives. [87] When the children are in the care of the father, it is obvious they enjoy being with him and doing all the activities he arranges for them. There is no evidence the children fear their father and do not want to have visits with him. Further, there is no evidence that the father is currently utilizing drugs or drinking in excess. commend the father for having been on the road to recovery for three years. (ii) The personality, character and emotional needs of the children [88] The evidence establishes that the two children have different personalities but are both considered polite, well-behaved, kind and generous children. It was pleasure to hear about the numerous activities the children enjoy when they are in the care of the grandmother and when they are in the care of the father. In my view, the two children have emotional needs that are unusual for children of their age. They have suffered two significant losses in their young lives. The death of Dion, their step-grandparent, was not easy to deal with for the children. Then, their mother passed away. The children’s mother had been the children’s primary caregiver from the time the mother and father separated in 2008. To lose their mother at such young age must, no doubt, have had and continue to have, huge effect on the children and what they require emotionally. (i) The physical, psychological, social and economic needs of the children [89] am satisfied both the grandmother and the father can provide for the physical, social and economic needs of the children. Both the grandmother and the father gave evidence that they would like to see the boys active and involved in activities other than “screen” games. The father had concerns regarding Haydn’s weight. It appears the grandmother, in conjunction with the school, is working on more physical activity. Thankfully neither child has any major medical issues and both parties would, in my view, be capable of handling any medical issues. [90] As regards the economic needs of the children, both the grandmother and the father can provide financially for the children. My only concern here is with regards to the father’s lack of stability in his employment. [91] The psychological needs of the children take on more significance in this matter given the losses of the children. The grandmother has, through her actions, satisfied me that she will always keep the children’s mother alive in their hearts. question whether the father will also do so. He provided no evidence that he ever discussed the mother in positive way with the children. Further, although the children have lovely bedroom in the father’s home, could not see picture of their mother. The only picture is of the father and the boys. [92] After finding out the mother had cancer, the father did not attempt to provide support to the children. This is troubling. He was aware of the mother’s cancer diagnosis and was aware of the grandmother’s place of residence. Short visits with the father may have assisted the children in coping with the fact they were losing their mother. His excuse for not doing so was that he did not think it was right to just show up and ring the grandmother’s doorbell. wonder why he did not prepare note to the grandmother and place it in her mailbox. His note could have expressed his willingness to do whatever was necessary and appropriate to support the children. [93] am also concerned the father believes nothing would really change if the children were transferred from the care of the grandmother to his home. He testified it would “continue as normal for them”. The father’s comments show an entire lack of understanding about the psychological issues for children when they are removed from their primary caregiver and are forced to change schools and neighbourhoods. have great doubt that he would, if determined he have custody, utilize counsellors to assist the children with the significant change in their lives. His opposition to counselling in the past is telling. accept the grandmother’s evidence that the father’s view is that the children only need him and all will be fine. (iv) The capacity of the person who is seeking custody to act as legal custodian of the children [94] On the evidence have determined that both the grandmother and the father have the capacity to act as legal custodians of the children. As set out previously, there is no evidence before me the father is struggling with the addictions he had in the past. Further, there is no evidence before me that he disciplines the children inappropriately, has an anger management issue or any other problem that would lead to the conclusion he could not parent the children. [95] The grandmother has raised her own children and has been raising Arty and Haydn for some time. The father provided no evidence of any concerns with the grandmother’s care of the children. The grandmother is physically capable of assuming custody of the children. Her age is not factor as she is very young grandmother, being 48 years old. (v) The home environment proposed to be provided for the children [96] Both parties have homes that can adequately provide for the children’s needs. Both the grandmother and the father have others living in their homes that provide support to the children. The boys share room in each home, and there is large backyard where the boys can play in each home. (vi) The plans that the person who is seeking custody has for the future of the children [97] Both the grandmother and the father would encourage the children to pursue post-secondary education. At present, the children are assisted with their homework by either the grandmother or the father or someone else in their respective homes. It is my belief that both the grandmother and the father want the children to be happy, healthy and independent at some point in their future. (vii) The wishes of the children, to the extent the Court considers appropriate, having regard to the age and maturity of the children [98] The children are only and 10 years old. It is not until they are older that any weight would be put on their wishes. With respect to their wishes, neither the grandmother nor the father testified that the children have expressed desire to either move to the father’s home or stay with the grandmother. The children did, according to the father, wish to spend the entire Easter week with their father as opposed to have the week shared between the grandmother and the father. This is quite normal. The children obviously wanted few more days with their father when it was holiday period. On the other hand, heard evidence that the children are very happy to see their grandmother when they return from an access visit with the father. Conclusion [99] After taking into account the factors as set out in s. 8 of The Children’s Law Act, and considering only the best interests of the children, I have determined that it is in the children’s best interests to remain in the custody of the grandmother. Although the children have accepted their father back into their lives and clearly enjoy spending time with him, the grandmother is their psychological parent, and stability is found by leaving the children in the grandmother’s care. The children can continue to go to the same school they have attended and where they know their teachers. They can continue to celebrate the life of their mother while in the home of the grandmother. The bond they have with their grandmother is strong, and believe the grandmother will best provide for the children’s psychological needs. [100] This is not to say that the father is inadequate and should have minimal time with his children. accept his evidence that he is very passionate about his children and loves them very much. also have no doubt that the children love their father. The father should play significant role in the children’s lives and become more of parent than the “Disneyland dad” he described. strongly believe that the grandmother and the father will be able to work together as they both recognize it is in the best interests of the children to do so. The children have already been through enough. Conflict between the grandmother and the father would damage the children. [101] am ordering the following: 1. The grandmother and the father shall have joint custody of Arty and Haydn. 2. The parties shall discuss and decide jointly all major decisions with respect to health, education and religion of the children. In the event the parties cannot agree on significant issue, the grandmother shall make the determination. 3. The grandmother shall have the sole authority to make all day-to-day decisions regarding health, dental care and counselling. She shall choose the children’s doctor and dentist but provide the names to the father. 4. The father shall be entitled to obtain all information direct from the school that the grandmother receives. He shall be entitled to attend parent/teacher interviews, either with the grandmother or on his own. 5. The residence of the grandmother shall be the primary residence for the children, and she shall have the primary care of the children. 6. The father will have the following parenting time with the children: a) Every second week from Wednesday after school to Sunday at 8:00 p.m. b) Every alternating week on Wednesday evenings from after school until 8:00 p.m. c) The parties shall each parent the children for one-half of all school holidays unless otherwise agreed. For example, the parties could agree that one party have the entire Easter break while one party have the entire February break. d) The grandmother shall be allowed to register the children for soccer. The father shall be allowed to register the children for Cubs/Scouts. CHILD SUPPORT [102] Although the grandmother suggested that the father should pay child support to her for the children, no argument was put forward for child support at the conclusion of the trial. Further, I do not, at this time, have adequate evidence to consider the child support issue. will order, however, that the grandmother pay for activities she arranges for the children and the father pay for activities he arranges for the children. In addition, the parties should share any medical or dental expenses, over and above any amount paid by insurance, on an equal basis. The grandmother can pursue child support through an application to the court should she desire. [103] This was very difficult matter, and both the grandmother and the father have been partially successful. Although determined that the grandmother would be the primary caregiver for the children, substantially increased the father’s time with the children and provided parenting time for him with the children during school weeks. In such way, the father will be more involved in their schooling and will do all things parenting entails like making school lunches, checking school bags and ensuring homework is done. There has been mixed success in this matter. For these reasons am not awarding costs be paid by either party. J. D.L. WILSON",e_2017skqb219.txt,"HELD: The court found the following with respect to each issue: 1) the grandmother was a person of sufficient interest regarding the children pursuant to s. 6 of The Children’s Law Act, 1997 and had standing to bring her application for custody; 2) it would be in the best interests of the children, now aged ten and nine years of age, to have their primary residence with their grandmother as she was their psychological parent.
They had resided with their grandmother for most of their lives and it was important to maintain their relationships with their school and friends.
The respondent would have regular weekly parenting time with the children; and 3) the evidence was inadequate to consider child support."
