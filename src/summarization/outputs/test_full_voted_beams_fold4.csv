At a January 13, 2003 meeting of the Trustee, 2 failed to file proofs of their claims and 1 opposed the proposal, although the Trustees were bound by the collective bargaining agreement applicable to certain production employees, the meeting of creditor members was adjourned to allow certain questions raised by the creditors at the December meetings to be further investigated and to permit examination of the director of the Company. At January 13 the Truste made an application to the Registrar in Bankrupty for court approval. Notice of Objection was filed on behalf of an unsecured creditor. The Trustee was appointed by the Trust to act as trustee of the Proposal. Taking into account all of the interests the Court concluded the proposal presented by the trustee did meet the statutory and judicial criteria for acceptance.

The trustees were entitled to preferred or secured creditor status. Taking the interests of the creditor, the Court found that the proposal did meet all of these criteria. Taking consideration all of those interests the court concluded the Pro proposal presented was reasonable and calculated to benefit the general body of creditors. The trustees were in agreement with the second ground of the objection and 89 percent of all creditors reached the same apparent conclusion in voting in favour.

The amount of indemnification proposed by terms of his proposed pension plan was inappropriately broad. The pension plan members should be treated as a different class of creditor than the unsecvened creditor classification ascribed to them by the Propo. The liability of past officers and directors was inappropriately large. The liabilities were not classified as trust funds pursuant to provincial pensions legislation.

These area operators and their contractors have Forest Management Agreements and Forest Product Processing Facility Licences.

The accused does not have a Forest Product Processing Facility Licence. The issue in this case is whether the Crown has shown that the accused requires such a licence. HELD: 1) The definition of 'manufacture' in the Act is extremely broad as it says, 'means any step taken'. Given this definition is not difficult to find based on the evidence presented that the steps taken by the contractor in cutting the logs is more than simply harvesting as it is defined in the legislation. See R. v. Provincial Forest Products, 2000 SKQB 371. 2) The Court is satisfied that the accused corporation, Chisum, took steps to manufacture the forest product for the log home market. Steps such as debarking were steps taken in the manufacture of a forest product for market.  3) Given the wide definition it is the Court's view that many facilities, including a retail lumberyard, could be captured within the definition. Given the stated purpose of the Act, it is appropriate that the requirement for a Processing Facility Licence be restricted so that it does not apply to every entity that manufactures a forest product. 4) The processes Chisum is involved in encompass the substantial conversion of the forest product into logs to be used in the log home industry.

The accused was required because the Crown did not show that Chiscum requires a processing license. The application was dismissed. The facts were not supported by the Crown's argument. The only conclusion that could be drawn was that the process utilized was more than just harvesting as the Act required a processing of the wood. The production of the loghome was not a mere process. It was a process which was removed from sustainable use and the health benefits of forestland.

(referred to as “Chisum”) and Garry Varga (referred to as “Varga”) are charged as follows:

Information 37262946: Count 1: between the 7th day of August, 2007 and the 8th day of September, 2007, did operate a processing facility without a licence, contrary to section 18.1(1) of The Forest Resources Management Act, F-19.1. The issue in this case is whether the Crown has shown that Chisum requires such a licence. These steps may not be significant but I am satisfied that the process utilized by P & E is more than simply harvesting as it is defined in the legislation. I am also satisfied that Chisum took steps to manufacture the forest product for the log home market. I find that paragraph 5 of P-1 clearly establishes the steps taken by Chisum, including debarking, were steps taken in the manufacturing of a forest product for market. I have therefore concluded that Chisum was required to have a Processing Facility Licence. CONCLUSION [29] I therefore find Chisum Log Homes and Lumber Ltd. and Garry Varga guilty of violating s. 18.1(1) of The Forest Resources Management Act, F-19.1.",0.4823943661971831,0.649122807017544,"The defendant, Chisum Log Homes and Lumber Ltd., was charged with operating a processing facility without a licence contrary to s. 18.1(1) of the Forest Resources Management Act. The defendant was the President and sole Director of the company. The company assembles log home packages in the Weyakwin district north of Prince Albert. These packages are sold to customers across Canada and around the world. The defendants suggest that once a forest product is harvested and the dues and fees paid, they are no longer forest products and are thus governed by provincial legislation. HELD: The court found that the defendant did not have a Forest Product Processing Facility Licence. The issue in this case was whether the Crown has shown that the Crown requires such a licence. The steps taken by the defendant, which included cutting the logs were specifically taken to prepare them for the log home market. The process utilized by the corporation is more than simply harvesting as it is defined in the legislation. The Crown's position creates an absurdity in that it would require any manufacturer, at any point in the market chain, to obtain a processing licence for any processing of product that had as its point of origin, Crown Forest Land. It creates a two tiered system of regulation of processing facilities that process product originating from private land. The definition of'manufacture' in the forest resources management act, F-19.1 is extremely broad as it says 'any step taken' and it is not difficult to find based on the evidence presented that the steps taken were specifically those of a logging company. These steps may not be significant but the Crown's interpretation would create an absurdity. The nature of the business as noted in the Corporate Registry is 'logging, manufacturing building products'. The creation of a chisum log is processing and must require a processing license. There are two types of processing facility: one for logging and one for processing. The logging is not an insignificant process, nor is it process which is removed from the sustainable use of forest lands and the need to maintain and enhance the health of forest land.",0.649122807017544

The damage to the floor is $22,281 and the tenant is contributorily negligent to the extent of 25% of the damage. The evidence does show that a part of the moisture entering into the building was due to the negligence of the tenant in failing to properly maintain the floor. Leaking of water through the ceiling onto the floor did necessitate closure of the restaurant, causing reduction of customers who could reasonably be expected to be put off by the unsightly ceiling and floor tiles, and the catchment of the dripping water. Although the evidence shows that the restaurant was closed for several days even though daily overhead costs of $1,600 continued, no evidence was offered as to the landlord's failure to test for moisture or humidity levels. Moisture from the building material samples recently tested by the certified building inspector are five times in excess of standard reading for normal building samples, and accept his observations as to structural defects of the building giving rise to water infiltration. A part, but only a part, of moisture entered into the subfloor was attributed to the negligent tenant. HELD: 1) The damage is to the ceiling and the floor and only a small percentage of the cause of the lifting and cracking of the vinyl floor tiles could be attributed to poor maintenance lack of sufficient polish and waxing.  2) In view of all of the evidence excessive moisture and high humidity within the building undermined the basement, causing instability and resulting in lift and cracking. The plaintiff is liable to the loss of $20,000.  3) There is no evidence of tortious interference by the landlord in preventing the sale of its restaurant. 4) The tenant is responsible for 25% to $25,000 in lost profit. 5) The evidence is not conclusive that negligence was involved. The tenant's expert in the field of installation and physical properties of floor coverings was unequivocal that the movement and instability of the sub floor is primarily the result of moisture arising from structural defects. The only small percentage, perhaps 25%, of the causes of the lift and crack of the floor tile could be explained by poor maintenance. The installation of the new floor in 2001 was also of the view that water in the basement could cause the problem with the tiles but did not do so here since there was","[1] The plaintiff, the landlord, claims damages against its tenant, the defendant, asserting negligence by failing to clean, wax and polish the vinyl tile floor in the building, thereby permitting moisture to penetrate between and underneath the tiles resulting in lifting and cracking. The tenant denies responsibility, contending the cause is normal wear and tear or high humidity arising from water entering the building due to inherent structural defects for which the landlord is responsible.

The defendant solicitor, who represented several farmers and farming companies in suits brought against Saskatchewan Crop Insurance Corporation on a contingency fee basis, confirmed in writing in 1993 that his office would undertake to protect the plaintiff consultants for their fees and disbursements and to pay interest at a rate of 12% per annum. The plaintiff was hired to provide technical evidence as to crop losses and damages the farmers claimed as a result of actions of SCIC.

During his employment as professional truck driver, the accused had driven into construction zone on highway and hit another vehicle that had been stopped. The three teenage occupants of the vehicle were killed and flag person was severely injured as result of the collision. The accused was sure that he had not been asleep at the time of the accident but felt that he had not been paying attention. He had not noticed any of the signs posted at 100-metre intervals after the start of the construction zone 1.6 km south of the accident. The accused was 41 years of age. He had obtained his A-1 driver’s licence in 2009 and had clean driving abstract. He was married and had three children. He had recently been diagnosed with mild sleep apnea. He expressed remorse to the victim’s families and suffered from post-traumatic stress disorder.| HELD: The accused was sentenced to three years in imprisonment on the first count and three years concurrent for the second and third counts, and one year concurrent to the other counts on the fourth count. He was prohibited from operating a motor vehicle for five years and from possessing a firearm for 10 years after his release from imprisonment. The aggravating factors in the case were that the accused’s inattentiveness caused the death of three people and severely injured another person. The impact of the children’s deaths was devastating on their families. The accused was a professional driver and capable of exercising more skill and vigilance, especially when he was operating a semi-trailer truck in a construction zone. The mitigating factors were that the accused pled guilty and expressed profound remorse. He had not been drinking and had a clear driving record. The accused was at low risk to re-offend.","The accused was charged with three counts of operating a motor vehicle in a manner dangerous to the public and thereby causing the death of three young flag people. The accused had been convicted of operating the vehicle while intoxicated and had been charged with operating a vehicle while under the influence of drugs. The Crown had not proven that the driver had been aware of the stopped vehicles and had not taken appropriate steps to alert the public. The Court was also aware that the accused had a history of mental health problems and was being assessed for post-traumatic stress disorder. The court was also cognizant of the fact that the Crown had been unsuccessful in finding a driver for the past two years. The Criminal Code provides a range of sentencing principles, including: 1) a reasonable sentence must be imposed; 2) a significant amount of time must be spent on mental health issues; 3) the Court was cognizantly aware of a significant risk of mental breakdown and depression. The defendant had been assessed for depression and was on medication for posttraumatic stress. The evidence showed that he was suffering from post-psychiatric symptoms. The impact of the collision on the three young flags was significant and the Court could not predict the future. The driver was found to have been in poor health and was in a high risk of post-conviction sleep deprivation. The trial judge was also unable to determine the impact of his driving on the young flag person. The judge also found that the defendant had a significant history of driving while under influence. The only thing the Court can do to remedy what has happened is to sentence the offender in accordance with the objectives and principles of sentencing as contained within the Criminal Code. The offence was committed while under control. The offender was found guilty of operating an auto-pilot vehicle in an active construction zone. The vehicle was found in the middle of the construction zone and was travelling at a speed of 84 km/h. The collision was fatal. The officer who was driving the vehicle was charged as a result of the officer's negligence. The victim's injuries were severe and were treated as a pre-sentence report. The aggravating and mitigating factors in this case were not considered. The offences were found to be related to the defendant's driving history and his driving record. The driving was found not to be dangerous to public safety. The conviction was found on the driver's record.","Count #1: On or about the 3rd day of May A.D. 2015, at the district of Spalding in the Province of Saskatchewan, did, operate a motor vehicle in a manner that was dangerous to the public and thereby caused the death of Justin Gaja, contrary to Section 249(4) of the Criminal Code of Canada.

During his employment as professional truck driver, the accused had driven into construction zone on highway and hit another vehicle that had been stopped. The three teenage occupants of the vehicle were killed and flag person was severely injured as result of the collision. The accused was sure that he had not been asleep at the time of the accident but felt that he had not been paying attention. He had not noticed any of the signs posted at 100-metre intervals after the start of the construction zone 1.6 km south of the accident. The accused was 41 years of age. He had obtained his A-1 driver’s licence in 2009 and had clean driving abstract. He was married and had three children. He had recently been diagnosed with mild sleep apnea. He expressed remorse to the victim’s families and suffered from post-traumatic stress disorder.| HELD: The accused was sentenced to three years in imprisonment on the first count and three years concurrent for the second and third counts, and one year concurrent to the other counts on the fourth count. He was prohibited from operating a motor vehicle for five years and from possessing a firearm for 10 years after his release from imprisonment. The aggravating factors in the case were that the accused’s inattentiveness caused the death of three people and severely injured another person. The impact of the children’s deaths was devastating on their families. The accused was a professional driver and capable of exercising more skill and vigilance, especially when he was operating a semi-trailer truck in a construction zone. The mitigating factors were that the accused pled guilty and expressed profound remorse. He had not been drinking and had a clear driving record. The accused was at low risk to re-offend.","The accused was charged with three counts of operating a motor vehicle in a manner dangerous to the public and thereby causing the death of three young flag people. HELD: The Court found that the accused was guilty of both offences. 1)The accused had no previous driving record. He failed to recognize stopped vehicles in the active construction zone and to allow sufficient distance to bring his vehicle to a safe stop before colliding with the rear of the Cobalt.  2)The Court considered all of the purposes and principles of sentencing as contained in ss. 718 to 718.2 of the Criminal Code, including aggravating and mitigating factors and similar sentences imposed for individuals convicted of dangerous driving causing death and causing bodily harm. 3)There was no evidence that the defendant had ever travelled on Highway No. in the Province of Saskatchewan before May 3, 2015 and, in particular, had ever driven through the construction zone south of Spalding, Saskatchewan.","Count #1: On or about the 3rd day of May A.D. 2015, at the district of Spalding in the Province of Saskatchewan, did, operate a motor vehicle in a manner that was dangerous to the public and thereby caused the death of Justin Gaja, contrary to Section 249(4) of the Criminal Code of Canada. Count #2: On or about the 3rd day of May A.D. 2015, at the district of Spalding in the Province of Saskatchewan, did, operate a motor vehicle in a manner that was dangerous to the public and thereby caused the death of Carter Stevenson, contrary to Section 249(4) of the Criminal Code of Canada. Count #3: On or about the 3rd day of May A.D. 2015, at the district of Spalding in the Province of Saskatchewan, did, operate a motor vehicle in a manner that was dangerous to the public and thereby caused the death of Kristian Skalicky, contrary to Section 249(4) of the Criminal Code of Canada. Count #4: On or about the 3rd day of May A.D. 2015, at the district of Spalding in the Province of Saskatchewan, did, operate a motor vehicle in a manner that was dangerous to the public and thereby caused bodily harm to Samuel Fetherston, contrary to Section 249(3) of the Criminal Code of Canada. [17] Normand is extremely remorseful for the catastrophic situation he has caused as a result of his unexplained inattentiveness. [35] In addition, Normand Lavoie’s unlawful conduct must be denounced. The aggravating factors include:
(a) by far the most aggravating factor is the death of three innocent teenagers and the serious injury of a fourth person, a 22‑year‑old flag person;
(b) the devastating impact the death of these three teenage boys has had on their families;
(c) Normand Lavoie was a professional driver and, thus, capable of exercising more skill and vigilance;
(d) the fact that a larger, heavier vehicle was involved, requiring more care; and
(e) the accident occurred within a construction zone. [56] The mitigating factors include:
(a) Normand Lavoie consented to his committal to trial in Queen’s Bench and pled guilty, accepting full responsibility for this horrific accident;
(b) Normand Lavoie’s sincere and profound remorse;
(c) alcohol and/or drugs were not a factor in this accident;
(d) Normand Lavoie had a clear driving abstract for driving offences and a dated minimal criminal record;
(e) Normand Lavoie is a low risk to re‑offend in the future; and
(f) Normand Lavoie has the continued support of his family and community. [60] Considering all of the objectives and principles of sentencing as contained within s. 718 of the Criminal Code, including, in particular, denunciation and deterrence, both the aggravating and mitigating factors associated with this tragic occurrence, the principles of parity and totality and the voices of all of the victims involved in this matter, I sentence you with regard to Count No. 1, namely, dangerous driving causing the death of Justin Gaja, to a term of imprisonment of three years to be served in a federal institution. [61] As to Count No. 2, being dangerous driving causing the death of Carter Stevenson, I sentence you to a term of imprisonment of three years to be served in a federal institution concurrent to Count No. 1. [62] As to Count No. 3, being dangerous driving causing the death of Kristian Skalicky, I sentence you to a term of imprisonment of three years to be served in a federal institution concurrent to Count No. 1 and Count No. 2. [63] As to Count No. 4, being dangerous driving causing bodily harm to Samuel Fetherston, I sentence you to a term of imprisonment of one year to be served in a federal institution concurrent to Counts No. 1, 2 and 3.

The accused had been convicted of operating the vehicle while intoxicated and had been charged with operating a vehicle while under the influence of drugs. The Crown had not proven that the driver had been aware of the stopped vehicles and had not taken appropriate steps to alert the public. The Court was also aware that the accused had a history of mental health problems and was being assessed for post-traumatic stress disorder. The court was also cognizant of the fact that the Crown had been unsuccessful in finding a driver for the past two years. The Criminal Code provides a range of sentencing principles, including: 1) a reasonable sentence must be imposed; 2) a significant amount of time must be spent on mental health issues; 3) the Court was cognizantly aware of a significant risk of mental breakdown and depression. The defendant had been assessed for depression and was on medication for posttraumatic stress. The evidence showed that he was suffering from post-psychiatric symptoms. The impact of the collision on the three young flags was significant and the Court could not predict the future. The driver was found to have been in poor health and was in a high risk of post-conviction sleep deprivation. The trial judge was also unable to determine the impact of his driving on the young flag person. The judge also found that the defendant had a significant history of driving while under influence. The only thing the Court can do to remedy what has happened is to sentence the offender in accordance with the objectives and principles of sentencing as contained within the Criminal Code. The offence was committed while under control. The offender was found guilty of operating an auto-pilot vehicle in an active construction zone. The vehicle was found in the middle of the construction zone and was travelling at a speed of 84 km/h. The collision was fatal. The officer who was driving the vehicle was charged as a result of the officer's negligence. The victim's injuries were severe and were treated as a pre-sentence report. The aggravating and mitigating factors in this case were not considered. The offences were found to be related to the defendant's driving history and his driving record. The driving was found not to be dangerous to public safety. The conviction was found on the driver's record.",0.5012919896640827

The court was satisfied that the parties could communicate better and that the mother was insistent that the child's health be met with additional support. The issue was whether the father could communicate with the children better and with greater flexibility. The Court was also satisfied that both parents were aware of the children's health needs and that they could communicate more effectively. The only issue was access to the petitioner's paternal grandparents. The parents were to have access to each other on weekends. The custody was to be shared equally.

The petitioner was to have interim joint custody of the children. 4)Costs of child care were to be determined by agreement between the parties. 5)There was no suggestion that the parties had a better understanding of each other's needs. 6)The children were to spend alternate weeks with each parent except during the first two months of the marriage. 7)The respondents were to pay the petitioner 54% of the net cost of the child care expenses incurred as a result of the petitioner's employment upon the petitioner producing her receipts each month and advising the respondent of net cost. 8)It was assumed that with resolution of this matter the parties could work on improving communication and parenting in the best interests of their children.",0.5898437500000001
c_2011skqb100.txt,A judgment issued from the Court along with a writ of execution. The plaintiff discovered that one of the defendants had shares being held at the defendants' solicitor's office and instructions were given to the sheriff to seize and sell the shares. The sheriff attended to seize the shares but the defendants' lawyer objected. At issue was whether the legal office could refuse to hand over the shares to the sheriff pursuant to a solicitor's lien and whether the shares were exempt from seizure pursuant to the Saskatchewan Farm Security Act. HELD: The law firm was ordered to produce and deliver to the sheriff the shares of the defendant in the third corporation; costs were fixed at $750. 1) The right of the law office to refuse to produce and deliver the shares to the sheriff had not been made out and court process was thwarted. There was no evidence to determine the amount owing from the defendant or the third corporation for legal work; a valid solicitor's lien was not demonstrated. 2) There is a difference between the seizure and sale of shares in a company and the seizure and sale of a piece of farmland and the argument that the Executions Act or the Saskatchewan Farm Security Act restricts the seizure fails.,"FIAT. The court ordered the legal office of Eggum, Abrametz and Eggum to produce to the sheriff of Prince Albert the shares of Barry Jensen in Jen-Sim Cattle Co. Ltd., pursuant to a writ of execution. The solicitor's lien is a common law lien and is not a substitute for a solicitor's one. The sheriff has no obligation to deliver the shares to the plaintiff. The plaintiff has a right to refuse production of the shares. The claim for lien was not made out. The summary provided by Eggum does not allow the court to determine the amount owing by the plaintiff for legal work done for him. The order does not permit the sheriff to determine his lien. The action is dismissed. HELD: 1) The court found that the solicitor's Lien was a valid lien as it was not a valid instrument. The Court ordered the lawyer to produce the shares within seven days of service.  2) The solicitor was not required to deliver any documents to the court. The Sheriff had no power to seize the shares and the court was unable to enforce the writ. The process of the court thwarted.  3) The lawyer's liens are not made up. There is no restriction in the Executions Act nor in the Saskatchewan Farm Security Act nor is there a difference between the seizure and sale of shares in a company and the seizure of a piece of farm land. There was no restriction on the solicitor’s lien in the Act. 4) The Court was unable, however, to enforce its writ of Execution. The proceedings were thwarted. The lawyer’d lien had been claimed. 5) The claim was not properly made out and the claim for a lien could not be determined. 6) The summary did not allow me to determine whether the solicitor had rights greater than those of the client vis-à-vis the solicitor. The evidence before the court did not support the claim. The s. 66(3) of the Legal Profession Act had been established. The judge was unable and unwilling to enforce his writ. 7) The sheriff was unable because the solicitor was unable or unwilling to produce. The issue was whether the shares in the plaintiff were exempt from seizure pursuant to the Saskatchewan farm security act. The lien for lins is not made as a result of the sheriff refusing to deliver them to the solicitor pursuant to s. 21(1) of The Saskatchewan Farm security Act. The law is only as between the client and him.","[1] ACS seeks an order from this court requiring the legal office of Eggum, Abrametz and Eggum to produce to the sheriff of the Judicial Centre of Prince Albert, the shares owned by Barry Jensen in Jen-Sim Cattle Co.

During discovery of the borrower's former solicitor it was revealed that the solicitor may have given the borrower a warning that the financing arranged was inadequate. No privilege was claimed during the discovery process. The defendant brought an application for production of the solicitor's files and a copy of the borrower's employer and bank records intended to show his familiarity with business and financial affairs. Application allowed in part; solicitor's files with respect to terms of solicitor's retainer and non-legal advice or services are to be produced; employer's and banker's records not to be produced. The claim of negligent misrepresentation raised the question of reliance; evidence of knowledge would go to the borrower's state of mind and the solicitor's warning, if timely, would be relevant. The conduct of the borrower's present counsel in making no objection at the discovery amounted to waiver. There were no special circumstances existing with respect to the employer's and bank's records; the applicant made no effort to obtain the records until too late and the documents would have little, if any, relevance.","HELD: The court granted leave to obtain the documents.

The applicant asks for a vesting order regarding a presently unsubdivided parcel of land owned by the respondent. The respondent argues that the provisions of the Planning and Development Act must, of necessity, be considered merged in conveyance. HELD: The court is not free to subvert the statutory requirements in the exercise of its authority to make vesting orders. The application is dismissed. The court found that the respondent is a bona fide purchaser without notice of the Flads' interest and relying on the indefeasibility of his title. The Court found that in 1994, the School Division sold a 7.5 acre parcel of farm land to purchasers (the Flads). The transfer was registered, however the reservation of the farm site could not be registered because it purported to effect an unauthorized subdivision of the land. The Flads filed a caveat to protect his interest. The land was then sold to the Logels who had notice of Redmond's interest although, again, the transfer was not registered without any reservation of Redmond. The plaintiff commenced proceedings. The School Division then applied for a subdivision approval. The applicants applied for relief. HOLD: The Court is not Free to subVERT the statutory requirement in the exercising of its power to make a vestencing order. The Act is not a substitute for the use of the common law rights. The provisions of The Planning and Determining Authority (PDA) have curtailed common law right. The Land Registry Act is a prohibition against the transfer of land. It is not the only instrument in controlling subdivisions and passing zoning bylaws is to control land development. The only remedy is to order the Registrar to apply for subdivision approval as a precondition to the vesting. The original transaction between the School and the Flad was concluded in 1996, conditional on subdivision approval, which the Court was obliged to obtain at its own cost. The agreement was concluded prior to the commencement of subdivision approval and the parties were to apply to apply. The issue on appeal was whether the trial judge erred in holding that Redmond retained a legal interest in the farm property which could form the basis of a registrable transfer under The Land Titles Act. The Appeal Court held that at the time of the purported reservation of title in favour of the respondent, no subdivision of agricultural land was permitted in respect of an area less than five acres. The proposed subdivision would therefore not have been permitted, if applied for.

It did not conclude that such was the result as it was too remote.  5) The impossibility of contemplating the extent and potential liability constitutes a valid reason for not distinguishing emotional damages resulting from a loss to a person under the insurance policy. 6) It was impossible to conclude that Section 139 provisions of the M/V insurance policy extend to protect a person who suffered psychic injury as a result of the 'injury or death' of the insured.","1. This action arises out of a motor vehicle / bicycle accident which
occurred on June 27, 2002. She was present, although she did not suffer any physical injuries and was not directly involved in the accident, she commenced this action to advance a claim for nervous shock. ISSUE [3] Do the Section D provisions of the M/V Insurance policy issued by Wawanesa extend to protect Alicia Hartling, who suffered psychic injury as a result of the “injury or death” of Jonathan Hartling, an “insured person” under the policy? [14] Upon consideration I conclude that such is not the result. I do so because the emotional harm suffered by Alicia Hartling is simply too remote from the obligations contemplated by the contracting parties. I conclude that the emotional injury of an uninjured person is not covered under the “Section D” provisions by reason of the fact that it is too remote from the original contract contemplated.",0.47264770240700227,0.3941605839416058,"The plaintiff was the step-father of the deceased victim of motor vehicle accident. She commenced this action to recover damages for nervous shock from the defendant. The defendant was an uninsured motorist at the time of the accident. Since the plaintiff was not insured under the contract, she was not entitled to recover for the nervous shock. The plaintiff's claim against the defendant was being defended by the Facility Association which maintained the Uninsured Motorist Claims Fund for Nova Scotia. The emotional harm suffered by the cousin was simply too remote from the obligations contemplated by the contracting parties. HELD: 1)The emotional harm caused by the deceased cousin was not the result of her action for emotional shock. 2)The Section D provisions of the M/V Insurance policy issued by the defendant extended to protect the plaintiff, who suffered psychic injury as a result of the 'injury or death' of Jonathan Hartling, an 'insured person' under the policy.  3)The Court concluded that such a result would be impossible because the emotional harm inflicted by the victim was simply not remote. It did not conclude that such an outcome was the result.",0.5555555555555556

They nevertheless continued to the residence, where they heard a scream from inside. Knowing that the defendant was a suspected drug dealer and potentially violent, they demanded entry into the home. The daughter opened the door and told them everything was fine, there had been no assault and she had simply wanted a ride home. From where they entered, the officers could see a person lying down in the bedroom. They approached the man, searched him for officer safety and then conducted a warrantless search to locate any other occupants. During the search, certain items were noted that caused them to obtain a search warrant, following which drugs were found. The defendant's argument that the search was illegal was unsuccessful as the court found that, in these particular circumstances, the police had a responsibility to enter the home without a warrant, do a pat down search of the accused and search for other occupants. Once drugs were seen in plain view, they proceeded to obtain a search warrant. Judicial notice was taken of the fact that complainants in domestic situations often recant due to threats of coercion by their partners. The defendant appealed. Appeal allowed; conviction set aside; although a violation of the defendant's Charter rights had occurred, the record was insufficient for this court to engage in a s. 24(2) analysis. Although it was reasonable, in the circumstances, for the police to search for the girl, go to the defendant's home and not simply leave once she told them she was fine, the trial judge erred in failing to consider alternatives short of police entry (such as conferring with the girl after they had her step outside and close the door) and the search of the home, without a warrant. Police authority to investigate such a call includes locating the alleged victim and determining if their assistance is required, but, without more, does not extend to the entry or search of the premises.","The accused was charged with possession of cocaine and other drugs contrary to s. 18(a) of the Charter. The accused had been charged with trafficking. The evidence found at the scene was not supported by the evidence. The police entered the accused's home and searched the premises without a warrant. The complainant called the police and said that she was being abused. The officers entered the residence and searched for the complainant. The appellant's mother called the RCMP. The RCMP entered the house and searched. The officer testified that she had just left the house. The Crown alleged that the police entered because they were concerned that the complainant was lying about being okay and had arranged for a drive home. The trial judge held that the call was not a 911 call but rather a 'distress' call. The court held that once inside the complainant's home, the police were justified in checking the house to ensure that there were no other occupants and in searching the complainant to ensure he had no weapon. The Court held that this was not an unreasonable search and seizure and that the Crown had not breached s. 24(2) of their Charter.","The appellant was found guilty of several drug offences.

She did not ignore the process. 3) The hearing officer was not advised of any of the issues before the hearing but took the necessary time within which to make arrangements to attend and to inform herself about her legal position and the nature of her legal situation and obtain assistance or advice from the Director of the Office or other persons in position to provide the same to her. 4) The court found that both the failure to properly consider and grant the tenant the applied for adjournment in the particular circumstances of this case and the failure by the hearing officer to provide her with the particulars of her claim constitute reversible error. 5) Rules of procedural fairness and natural justice apply to the exercise by Hearing Officers and their conduct of hearings under the Act. The tenant was advised that her boyfriend was now incarcerated and therefore no longer in a position to create any further disturbances, cause any further damage and/or threaten any other occupants of the premises including her daughter. Since she was not personally present at the hearing she could not even respond to such evidence or new allegations since she was completely unaware of them. The evidence in that regard was presented by the landlord and Trevor Allen, fellow tenant in the building. 6) The decision of whether or not an adjournment should be granted is inherently discretionary. No notice is needed to proceed to hearing.","[1] The tenant Geneviève Clouâtre appeals from the decision of the Hearing Officer rendered March 11, 2008 granting the landlord Art Hosie possession of her rental premises at suite “B”, 1909 Reynolds Street, Regina.

That order had been made pursuant to s. 242 of The Planning and Development Act and required the respondent to comply with the zoning bylaw by desisting from operating an equipment storage yard on a parcel of land owned by him and to restore it to the condition it was in prior to his use of it. The respondent had purchased the land in 2009 and immediately began storing equipment and leaving junk cars and other materials on it. The applicant had tried to encourage the respondent’s voluntary cooperation with the bylaw but eventually issued the order. After the court granted the order, the respondent took no steps to comply with it and in August 2014, the applicant applied for an order declaring the respondent to be in contempt of court. The application was heard in September at which time the respondent submitted by affidavit that he had removed the old cars but believed that he was allowed to keep his equipment. He requested that he receive additional time. The respondent was given until December 2014 to comply with the order. At the hearing he deposed that he had spent a significant amount of time and money removing materials from the land and that he had found out from his counsel that his belief regarding the permitted use of the land was incorrect. Based on the appearance of the site, the applicant was not satisfied but agreed to adjourn the matter until May 2015 as nothing could be done during the winter. When the matter was reviewed in May, the respondent had removed more equipment but said that he was not able to move it all as he had no place to put the rest of it. The applicant requested that the court find the respondent in contempt and to impose appropriate penalties, authorize it to remove any remaining machinery and to add the costs of this removal and disposal to the taxes on the land and to make an order for solicitor-client costs in its favour. HELD: The respondent was found to be in contempt of court pursuant to Queen’s Bench rule 11-16(3) for his failure, without reasonable excuse, to comply with the terms of the May 2014 court order. The court authorized the applicant to remove and dispose of the equipment if the respondent had not done so within 30 days of the order issued. The court awarded solicitor-client costs to the applicant in the amount of $15,000 because of the respondent’s continued and unjustified failure to comply with the zoning bylaw. As the applicant might incur additional costs to remove the equipment, those costs would be added to the tax rolls of the property and become payable by the respondent if he had not purged his contempt within the allotted time.","The Rural Municipality of Edenwold was granted an order requiring the respondent to comply with the court order regarding the respondent's failure to comply. The respondent had previously taken significant steps to comply, including removing signage, cutting grass, removing fences and removing various vehicles and equipment. The RM then applied for an order declaring the respondent in contempt of court for his failure to obey the order. The applicant applied for a contempt order and the court granted the order, which was subsequently granted. The application was subsequently heard in August 2014. The court found that the respondent had not complied with the order and was in contempt. The Court ordered the respondent, who had been in contempt since May 2014, to return to his property and remove all of the offending equipment. It ordered that the RM take further steps to remove the equipment. Failure to comply would result in the respondent being in contempt for the entire period of time he had been on the property. The defendant was fined $15,000. The costs of the contempt application were set at $15.00. The plaintiff was also fined $5,000 for failing to comply and $6,000 was ordered to pay solicitor fees. The judge also ordered that he pay solicitor/client costs. The solicitor/custodian costs were to be paid in full. The amount of solicitor/ client costs was reduced to $15 per month.

The application was heard in September at which time the respondent submitted by affidavit that he had removed the old cars but believed that he was allowed to keep his equipment. He requested that he receive additional time. The respondent was given until December 2014 to comply with the order. At the hearing he deposed that he had spent a significant amount of time and money removing materials from the land and that he had found out from his counsel that his belief regarding the permitted use of the land was incorrect. Based on the appearance of the site, the applicant was not satisfied but agreed to adjourn the matter until May 2015 as nothing could be done during the winter. When the matter was reviewed in May, the respondent had removed more equipment but said that he was not able to move it all as he had no place to put the rest of it. The applicant requested that the court find the respondent in contempt and to impose appropriate penalties, authorize it to remove any remaining machinery and to add the costs of this removal and disposal to the taxes on the land and to make an order for solicitor-client costs in its favour. HELD: The respondent was found to be in contempt of court pursuant to Queen’s Bench rule 11-16(3) for his failure, without reasonable excuse, to comply with the terms of the May 2014 court order. The court authorized the applicant to remove and dispose of the equipment if the respondent had not done so within 30 days of the order issued. The court awarded solicitor-client costs to the applicant in the amount of $15,000 because of the respondent’s continued and unjustified failure to comply with the zoning bylaw. As the applicant might incur additional costs to remove the equipment, those costs would be added to the tax rolls of the property and become payable by the respondent if he had not purged his contempt within the allotted time.","The Rural Municipality of Edenwold was granted an order requiring the respondent to comply within 60 days with an order of the Development Officer of the RM dated February 3, 2014. The respondent took no significant steps to comply with the order. HELD: 1) The respondent was found to be in contempt of court. 2) The court found that the respondent had no place other than his home acreage to park his tractor trailers between jobs or to store equipment that he requires from time to time in his contracting business. The only real issue in dispute was the appropriate penalty or sanction to be imposed by this court.  3) Although the respondent's conduct prior to the commencement of these proceedings may not generally warrant an award of solicitor and client costs, his continued and ongoing unjustified failure to comply has resulted in the respondent having to pay significant legal fees and disbursements to the applicant. The Court found that this was not a situation where there was a genuine issue between the parties as to whether there had been substantial compliance with any given order. It was more likely that he had simply not liked how the Zoning Bylaw impacted his personal interests and he had therefore chosen not to comply.","[12] The RM asks the court to:

1. To impose an award on the appellant whose [sic] was acting not in his own right but as a representative for a landlord. 2. To impose an award on an appellant who had not received notice that he was to be a named party at a hearing where an award could be made against him. 3. To impose an award against an appellant who was unable to prepare and present a defence on his own behalf.

Mr. Black is seeking to challenge the finding of fact by Palmeter, A.C.J., that, for the purposes of the s. 38 application, the respondents are creditors of the bankrupt estate. The appellant's attempt to challenge the validity of the s. 38 Order, in the proceeding before MacDonald, J. was a collateral attack. Accordingly, I would find that this ground of appeal fails. I would dismiss this ground of appeal.
 I would dismiss this ground of appeal. I would dismiss the appeal with costs to the respondents in the amount of $1500.00 inclusive of disbursements.",0.49236641221374045,0.575268817204301,"The respondent companies sought leave to initiate an action against the appellant pursuant to s. 38 of the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act. The appellant unsuccessfully applied for an order declaring that the respondents were creditors of the bankrupt company. The respondent companies argued that the appellant had jurisdiction to strike the respondent's Statement of Claim, as it was the respondent company's controlling mind. The Chambers judge refused to grant the order and the appellant applied to have the order declared null. The plaintiff sought to tender fresh evidence at the hearing in the form of an Affidavit of several persons which he maintains is relevant to the relationship between the trustee of the bankruptcy company and the status of Krupp as creditor. The judge refused the application and the plaintiff's application was dismissed. The court reviewed the transcripts of the pre-hearing conference and the hearing and concluded that the Chambers judge was of the firm view that he did not have jurisdiction to review the respondent order. The Court of Appeal dismissed the application. Fresh evidence was not sought. The Chamber judge was correct in his finding that the respondent companies were creditors. The issue before the court was whether the Chambers Judge had jurisdiction in the context of the application before him to strike a respondent's statement of claim on the basis that, as submitted by the appellant, the respondents are creditors of that company. It was not helpful on the issue of MacDonald, J.'s jurisdiction to examine the order.",0.5354691075514874
8_2012skqb249.txt,"The accused was convicted of aggravated assault after stabbing another person several times in the mid-section. The Crown brought a dangerous offender application. The accused was 22 years old at the time of sentencing. His prior criminal record consisted of mostly youth convictions. The offender was a known member of an aboriginal gang. The evidence suggested he was somewhere in the middle of the gang hierarchy. The accused had professed some desire to leave the gang. He had written an article directed at other youth warning them of the pitfalls of gang affiliation. The article was published in a book distributed to at risk youth. The accused had looked into getting help to leave the gang, but admitted on the stand that he was not prepared to take steps to leave because he might need protection from the gang in the penitentiary. While incarcerated, he had gang drawings confiscated from him and he had been jumped by members of a rival gang while in custody. The accused had shown some initiative in taking anger management courses and had completed his GED while incarcerated. HELD: The offence was a serious personal injury offence within the meaning of s. 752 of the Criminal Code. The criminal record together with the evidence heard at the hearing establishes that when the accused has committed violent offences he has been under the influence of alcohol or drugs, under supervision by court orders in the community, has used a knife or had one in his possession and most of the offences were a result of the accused's affiliation with the Indian Posse gang. The Crown has established a pattern of repetitive behaviour within the meaning of s. 753(1)(a)(i). Dr. Holden assessed the accused and found him to be a high risk to re-offend violently. The Crown has also proven that the accused constitutes a threat to the life, safety, and physical or mental well-being of other persons as set out in s. 753(1)(a)(ii). The accused was declared a dangerous offender. However, the Court found that given the accused's youth, the fact that he had not had any of the intensive programming that is available in a federal institution and the fact that there was some chance the accused might leave the gang, a determinate sentence and long term supervision order would adequately protect the public. In imposing a determinate sentence, the Court also considered that the accused's acts of violence, with the exception of the predicate offence, had generally resulted in less than severe injuries to the victim and the accused had voluntarily taken some steps to address his issues while incarcerated. The accused was sentenced 6 years or 72 months in custody, less credit for remand, to be followed by a 9 year supervision order under s. 753.4(b).","HELD: The Court found the accused guilty of aggravated assault contrary to s. 268 of the Criminal Code and breach of an undertaking contrary to S. 145(3) of the Code. The Crown applied to have the accused declared a dangerous offender. The Court held the predicate offence was a serious personal injury offence within the meaning of s. 752 of the criminal code. The court found that the accused had a history of violent behaviour and that long-term offender designation was appropriate. The sentence was increased to an indeterminate sentence. The accused was sentenced to an indefinite period of incarceration. The predicate offence is a serious injury offence. Given the conviction and the Criminal code provisions for imprisonment, the Court was satisfied the predicate offences were a serious offence within s.752 of s752.

[18] Given the conviction and the Criminal Code provisions for imprisonment, I am satisfied that the predicate offence is a serious personal injury offence within the meaning of s. 752 of the Criminal Code.

5_2018skqb209.txt,"Contract Law – Sale of Land – FormationReal Property – Sale of Land – Oral Contract The plaintiff brought an action against the defendant for specific performance and damages. The plaintiff claimed that the defendant agreed to sell him three quarters of land. The defendant’s position was that there was no agreement and if there was, it was not in writing as required by The Statute of Frauds. The plaintiff made this application for a resolution of the initial question of liability as to whether an agreement was created and if it was, then proof of damages would follow. The plaintiff argued that a contract was created and that it complied with the statute because he made his offer in writing, via an internet-based land auction program, and the acceptance was orally communicated by a telephone conversation. Therefore, all the requisite elements of a valid land sale were present. The defendant had used a website to list 17 quarters of land for sale, including six quarters of relevance to the action. The website was intended to connect sellers of farmland with interested buyers in a type of “non-binding auction” to permit sellers to gauge interest in their land, find the best possible price and avoid realtor’s commissions if a sale were completed. The listing showed three groups of the farmland for sale, described as 1) three adjoining quarters (the subject quarters); 2) two quarters (the adjacent quarters) and 3) one quarter (unsold quarter). In his online comments to the defendant during the auction, the plaintiff said that he wanted all five quarters (the subject and adjacent quarters). The plaintiff bid on each of the above parcels and had the highest bid on the subject quarters, but that in itself did not guarantee the purchase under the terms of the online auction program. He stopped bidding on the adjacent quarters because he thought they were becoming overpriced. After the auction, the plaintiff consulted with family members regarding whether to pursue negotiations with any of the bidders. They discussed the problems that would occur if the subject quarters were separated from the adjacent quarters because the two blocks were owned by different individuals. The defendant then telephoned the plaintiff and gave him two package options for the sale, both of which resolved the identified problem by including the purchase of the adjacent quarters. The package options were to purchase the subject and the adjacent quarters for $1,050,000 (which was 5 percent more than the $625,000 the plaintiff offered for the subject quarters and his last bid of $375,000 on the adjacent quarters) or the subject quarters and one of the adjacent quarters for $840,000. At the end of the conversation, the plaintiff testified that he wanted to be sure that regardless of his response to the package option offers, he would be able to buy the subject quarters for $625,000. The plaintiff did not have concerns about the purchase because he said that the defendant told him that “we had them”. He believed that this indicated the defendant’s willingness to accept his bid on the subject quarters and that if he accepted either of the two options, then either of the newly accepted offers would replace the agreement respecting the subject quarters. The defendant’s interpretation of the conversation was that he declined to accept the offer on the subject quarters until he heard back from the plaintiff respecting the package options and then he would decide whether or not he would sell the subject quarters. He either misheard or misunderstood the plaintiff’s question about the subject quarters and denied that he gave any assurance that he would sell them to him regardless of his response to the package offers. The plaintiff called the defendant shortly after the first conversation and advised that he would not accept either of the package option offers but would immediately bring the deposit for the purchase of the subject quarters. The defendant told him to “hold off”. The plaintiff interpreted that to mean that there was no urgency regarding the deposit rather than that no agreement existed respecting the subject quarters. The defendant testified that he said he was not prepared to accept the deposit at this time, which meant that he was not prepared to accept the plaintiff’s bid on the subject quarters. Three days later, the defendant emailed the plaintiff and said that he would not be accepting the bid. The issues were: 1) whether a contract was formed; 2) if so, did the Statute of Frauds apply.  HELD: The plaintiff’s action was dismissed. He had not established on a balance of probabilities that he and the defendant were parties to a valid and enforceable agreement of sale regarding the subject quarters. The court found with respect to each issue that: 1) there was no contract. In interpreting the words of the first telephone conversation and the context of the bidding process, using the standard of the reasonable bystander, there was no consensus ad idem between the parties. The second telephone conversation had done nothing to alter that finding. Both the plaintiff and the defendant reasonably believed different things; and 2) the Statute did not apply as there was no contract.","The plaintiff and defendant entered into a contract respecting the sale of three quarters of his farmland. The defendant alleged that the offer was in writing via the internet-based land auction and the acceptance was orally communicated to the plaintiff. The plaintiff alleged that no agreement was created and, regardless, even if an agreement existed, it was not in writing as required by the Statute of Frauds. The issue was whether the contract was in fact created and whether the formalities of the Statutes had been satisfied. HELD: The plaintiff was awarded specific performance and damages. The court accepted the plaintiff's claim that the plaintiff had breached the Statut of Fraud. The central issue in this lawsuit is the application of the statute of frauds to the land sale agreement. The plaintiffs claim that there was no agreement respecting the purchase of the land. The Court accepts the defendant's claim of having received a better offer than the plaintiff did. The issues are whether the plaintiff has received a satisfactory offer in the amount of $625,000 or $875,000. The contract was created by the defendant and the plaintiff was breached. The trial judge also accepted the defendant’s claim that he had received better offers than the defendant. The evidence from the plaintiff’ s witnesses was that the defendant had not received a favorable offer from the defendant prior to the bidding process. The judge also acknowledged that the parties had not communicated to each other the essential essential elements of a valid contract. The dispute was also a matter of law. The parties agreed that the central issue was the application to the Act of Fraud to the Land Sale Agreement. The two parties agreed the Act was an instrument to create a legal relations between the parties. The Act was intended to protect the interests of the parties and to protect their common interest. The agreement was not created by any means exclusive to the defendant but was in the context of the agreement.","[34] The court must determine whether a contract was created between Mr. Petrie and Mr. Ziola respecting the Subject Quarters.

The defendant contended that the central issue in this lawsuit was the application of the Statute of Frauds to the land sale agreement. The plaintiff asserted that the offer was in writing via the exchange during the internet-based land auction and the acceptance was orally communicated to the defendant. The issue was whether the contract was created and, regardless, even if an agreement existed, it was not in writing as required by the Statutes. The issues were whether there was an agreement respecting the purchase of the land and whether the parties' intent was to create legal relations, and whether there had been a breach of any of the essential essential elements of a valid contract. The plaintiffs also claimed that the defendant had not disclosed any information to them as part of the bidding process. HELD: 1) The plaintiff must prove on a balance of probabilities that a contract existed between the defendant and the plaintiff respecting the Subject Quarters. Proof of damages will follow if the court finds that an agreement was breached. 2) The central issue is whether a contract was formed between the defendants respecting the subject quarters. The central issues in this case are the application to the Act of Fraud and whether a contractual agreement was created. The parties agree that the requirement of writing under the Statut of Fraud is an additional requirement to the usual essential elements. 3) The plaintiffs must prove that the contractual agreement existed between them and the defendant, that the formalities of the Act have been satisfied, and that the parties have agreed to the terms of the agreement. 4) The Court accepts the plaintiff's claim that the plaintiff has breached the Statutory Frauds. The court accepts the defendant’s claim that there was no agreement between the parties respecting the two parcels of land. 5) The issues are whether the plaintiff was prepared to accept the offer made by the defendant or not. 6) The issue is if an Agreement Respecting the Sale and Purchase of Land was created by the defendants. The fact that the plaintiffs were unable to agree on the terms was at the heart of this lawsuit. The Court also accepts the respondent’ s claim that he was not prepared to participate in the sale. 7) The parties have brought the initial question of liability.

The defendant argued that the central issue in this lawsuit is the application of Statute-of-Frauds to the land sale agreement. Both parties agree that the requirement of writing under the Act is an additional requirement to the usual essential elements of a valid contract. These elements include an intention to create legal relations, an understanding of the terms of the Act, and a willingness to compromise. HELD: 1) The plaintiff must prove on a balance of probabilities that a contract was created between the defendant and the plaintiff respecting the Subject Quarters. Proof of damages will follow if the court finds that an agreement was breached. 2) The central issue is whether there was an agreement between the plaintiff and the defendant respecting the subject quarters. There is no evidence to support this conclusion. The court accepts the plaintiff's claim that the Act was created by the defendant pursuant to the Act. However, it accepts the defendant's contention that he did not intend to compromise the Act by making an offer on the Subject quarters and that he was not prepared to accept the $625,000 bid. 3) The defendant's argument that there was no such agreement was made and that the plaintiff was not obligated to respond to the package offers. The fact that the defendant did not make any overtures to the plaintiff that he would not accept the sum bid on the subject Quarters is irrelevant. 4) The Court accepts the petitioner's claim to be entitled to the benefit of the contract. 5) It accepts the respondent’s claim that there were no contract negotiations between the parties. 6) The issues before the court are whether the plaintiff has a duty to act in accordance with the Act and whether the defendant is entitled to make an informed decision regarding the sale and purchase of the land. 7) The issue before the Court is whether the Act has been breached. 8) It is not only the words that the parties might have exchanged that will decide the legal characterization of these telephone conversations question of law. 9) There is a presumption that there is an Agreement Respecting the Sale and Purchase of Land. 10) The Act is not a subjective test. It is an objective test.","[34] The court must determine whether a contract was created between Mr. Petrie and Mr. Ziola respecting the Subject Quarters. Looking to the words exchanged and the context of the bidding process following Mr. Petrie’s conversation with Jennifer Petrie, the court finds that a misunderstanding could readily and objectively characterize the nature of the telephone conversations so that no consensus ad idem was ever reached between Mr. Petrie and Mr. Ziola. Conclusion [58] Mr. Ziola has not established on a balance of probabilities that he and Mr. Petrie were parties to a valid and enforceable agreement of sale respecting the Subject Quarters. His action is dismissed.",0.25321100917431194,0.47908745247148293,"Contract Law – Sale of Land – FormationReal Property – Sale of Land – Oral Contract The plaintiff brought an action against the defendant for specific performance and damages. The plaintiff claimed that the defendant agreed to sell him three quarters of land. The defendant’s position was that there was no agreement and if there was, it was not in writing as required by The Statute of Frauds. The plaintiff made this application for a resolution of the initial question of liability as to whether an agreement was created and if it was, then proof of damages would follow. The plaintiff argued that a contract was created and that it complied with the statute because he made his offer in writing, via an internet-based land auction program, and the acceptance was orally communicated by a telephone conversation. Therefore, all the requisite elements of a valid land sale were present. The defendant had used a website to list 17 quarters of land for sale, including six quarters of relevance to the action. The website was intended to connect sellers of farmland with interested buyers in a type of “non-binding auction” to permit sellers to gauge interest in their land, find the best possible price and avoid realtor’s commissions if a sale were completed. The listing showed three groups of the farmland for sale, described as 1) three adjoining quarters (the subject quarters); 2) two quarters (the adjacent quarters) and 3) one quarter (unsold quarter). In his online comments to the defendant during the auction, the plaintiff said that he wanted all five quarters (the subject and adjacent quarters). The plaintiff bid on each of the above parcels and had the highest bid on the subject quarters, but that in itself did not guarantee the purchase under the terms of the online auction program. He stopped bidding on the adjacent quarters because he thought they were becoming overpriced. After the auction, the plaintiff consulted with family members regarding whether to pursue negotiations with any of the bidders. They discussed the problems that would occur if the subject quarters were separated from the adjacent quarters because the two blocks were owned by different individuals. The defendant then telephoned the plaintiff and gave him two package options for the sale, both of which resolved the identified problem by including the purchase of the adjacent quarters. The package options were to purchase the subject and the adjacent quarters for $1,050,000 (which was 5 percent more than the $625,000 the plaintiff offered for the subject quarters and his last bid of $375,000 on the adjacent quarters) or the subject quarters and one of the adjacent quarters for $840,000. At the end of the conversation, the plaintiff testified that he wanted to be sure that regardless of his response to the package option offers, he would be able to buy the subject quarters for $625,000. The plaintiff did not have concerns about the purchase because he said that the defendant told him that “we had them”. He believed that this indicated the defendant’s willingness to accept his bid on the subject quarters and that if he accepted either of the two options, then either of the newly accepted offers would replace the agreement respecting the subject quarters. The defendant’s interpretation of the conversation was that he declined to accept the offer on the subject quarters until he heard back from the plaintiff respecting the package options and then he would decide whether or not he would sell the subject quarters. He either misheard or misunderstood the plaintiff’s question about the subject quarters and denied that he gave any assurance that he would sell them to him regardless of his response to the package offers. The plaintiff called the defendant shortly after the first conversation and advised that he would not accept either of the package option offers but would immediately bring the deposit for the purchase of the subject quarters. The defendant told him to “hold off”. The plaintiff interpreted that to mean that there was no urgency regarding the deposit rather than that no agreement existed respecting the subject quarters. The defendant testified that he said he was not prepared to accept the deposit at this time, which meant that he was not prepared to accept the plaintiff’s bid on the subject quarters. Three days later, the defendant emailed the plaintiff and said that he would not be accepting the bid. The issues were: 1) whether a contract was formed; 2) if so, did the Statute of Frauds apply.  HELD: The plaintiff’s action was dismissed. He had not established on a balance of probabilities that he and the defendant were parties to a valid and enforceable agreement of sale regarding the subject quarters. The court found with respect to each issue that: 1) there was no contract. In interpreting the words of the first telephone conversation and the context of the bidding process, using the standard of the reasonable bystander, there was no consensus ad idem between the parties. The second telephone conversation had done nothing to alter that finding.

The respondent argued that although the variation application was filed May 30, 2008, his counsel did not receive the relevant documents until October 2008 and the retroactive recalculation should be limited to three years prior to October 2008. The petitioner argued that the respondent gave formal notice of the respondent's claim to vary in 2004 and that even if that was not formal notice, the respondent counsel raised the issue with the respondent directly by letter dated July 20, 2004. HELD: The court did not have jurisdiction to consider the application of the petitioner for retroactive variation of child support and s.7 expenses for the petitioner's older child. The court found that the appellant's blameworthy conduct warrants extending the period of retroactivity to more than three years. The Court did not consider the respondent’s claim for retroactivity of child and s7 expenses.

In July 1996, Maintenance Enforcement began to collect on her behalf, under the old Corollary Relief Judgment. She received $10,000 in November and December 2005. She claimed she owed $52,000. She also claimed she received $69,500 in matrimonial debt. HELD: The application was dismissed. The court found that the parties entered into the agreement and advised Maintenance Enforcement of their agreement. The agreement was recognized by Maintenance Enforcement and the parties' conduct was evidenced by their conduct, their reliance on the terms of the agreement, and the return of the original cheques. The Court found that there had been no variation in the order by court order since 1996.","[1] This application to terminate spousal support was commenced on the 22nd day of September, 2005.

The applicant requested that a judge perform her role as visitor in this matter. The parties agreed general visitatorial jurisdiction extends to judging that the university satisfy standards which are fundamental to the administration of justice in every sphere. The University takes the position that in order for a student to return to the university, he must acquire third party funding for the two years remaining in the program.

d_2013skca21.txt,"The appellant appealed the Queen's Bench decision that denied him damages for defamation (see: 2010 SKQB 249). The trial judge held that the defence of qualified privilege protected the Union and its representatives (the defendants in the action) when the latter republished a grievance defaming the appellant by falsely accusing him of having participated in the harassment of an employee. The trial judge fixed a provisional award of $25,000. The appellant's grounds of appeal were that the trial judge erred in finding that the defence applied and by assessing damages at $25,000. The respondents cross-appealed on the ground that the trial judge had erred in denying them costs. HELD: The Court held that the trial judge had erred in finding that the defence of qualified privilege applied. Although she correctly identified the law, she had not correctly applied it because she had not given sufficient effect to 1) the wording of the defamatory expressions; 2) the circumstances in which they were published and, in particular, the chronology of events and the separate instances of publication; 3) the persons to whom the words were published; and 4) whether what was published on each occasion was germane and reasonably appropriate to the specific occasion. In general, the Court noted that the respondents could have fulfilled their duty to notify its membership of the grievance filed by the member who alleged the harassment and made its effort to find witnesses to support the member's grievance by sending out a general notice. It did not need to name the appellant and make the allegations it did to achieve its goal. The respondent overreached, thereby placing the statement that the appellant had participated in the harassment of the employee outside the ambit of the defence of qualified privilege. The Court awarded general damages in the amount of $100,000. It held that the trial judge's assessment of damages was erroneous and founded upon mistaken principles of law. The Court was not bound by the range of damages mentioned by the Supreme Court in the Church of Scientology decision but only to apply the principles established in it to the context of this case. The provisional award of $25,000 for general damages was erroneous because the respondents published the documents by mailing them and placing them on the Union's website, over the strong objections of the employer. The respondents left the documents on the website for 6 months after the employer demanded that they be removed. The respondents had never offered an apology and appeared not to have recognized the harm that had been caused to the appellant. An award of aggravated damages was subsumed in the general award and the Court agreed with the trial judge that punitive damages were not warranted because the respondent had not been motivated by malice. The respondent's cross-appeal was dismissed without costs. However, their position was clearly correct in the circumstances: it was not appropriate for the trial judge to decline to order costs in their favour on the basis of 'mixed results', because in defamation cases, the results are invariably mixed.","The trial judge held that the principle of qualified privilege protected the union and its representatives when the latter republished a grievance defaming a member of management by falsely accusing him of having participated in the harassment of an employee. He fixed a provisional award of damages of $25,000. The parties argued that the trial judge erred by finding the defamatory statements were protected by qualified privilege. The trial judge found that the defamed statements were not defamatories but of being an 'active part of the harassment himself'. The trial court also found that there was no evidence that the Union members had engaged in the harassing. The plaintiff's lawyer argued that she was being harassed by some members of the faculty and some fellow Union members and that the union was not doing enough to prevent the harassment. The court also held that there were no errors in law when it concluded that the words were capable of bearing defamative meaning notwithstanding the overarching labour relations context. The Court also held the trial court erred in finding the words protected by the qualified privilege and fixed general damages at $100,000 for the breach of the collective agreement. The respondent's lawyer also argued that there had been an error in law in finding that the plaintiff's and the Union's complaints were entirely 'unfounded and without substance'. The Court held that it was tending to extend the cloak of absolute privilege to what has been described as'steps preparatory to judicial proceedings' but the purpose in this case was an attempt to find corroborating witnesses. The Union's and plaintiff's statements were entirely unfounded and without the substance. The judge correctly concluded that there is no merit to the plaintiff’s and the union’ s complaints. The words expressed by the Union would tend to lower the plaintiff in the eyes of a reasonable person. The jury found that they were not in the context of the labour relations and the context was the push and pull of labour relations. The test of correctness is to apply to the trial decision. The standard of review to apply is correctness with respect to whether an impugned communication is capable of being defamated but whether the expression is in fact defamator is a palpable and overriding error. The defendant’ll be awarded damages of up to $100k. The award of general damages is fixed at $25k.","Disposition: Appeal allowed Cross-appeal dismissed [1] This appeal concerns the extent to which the principle of qualified privilege applies to defamatory statements made by a union regarding a member of the employer’s management. The trial judge held that the principle of qualified privilege protected the union and its representatives when the latter republished a grievance defaming a member of management by falsely accusing him of having participated in the harassment of an employee. He fixed a provisional award of damages of $25,000 (see: 2010 SKQB 249 (CanLII), [2010] 12 W.W.R. 271). [2] I have concluded that the trial judge erred by finding the defamatory statements are protected by qualified privilege. I would allow the appeal and fix general damages at $100,000. [48] Based on my review of the authorities, I conclude that the trial judge did not give sufficient effect to: (i) the wording of the defamatory expressions; (ii) the circumstances under which they were published and, in particular, the chronology of events and the separate instances of publication; (iii) the persons to whom the words were published; and (iv) whether what was published on each occasion was germane and reasonably appropriate to that specific occasion.  In any event, I am satisfied that in the whole of the circumstances, which I have reviewed extensively in connection with the Respondents’ claim for qualified privilege, $25,000 is a wholly erroneous assessment of the damages in this case. [82] Having regard for the same factors that caused me to conclude that $25,000 is a wholly erroneous assessment of general damages, including what was said, how it was published and the effect on Dr. Rubin, I conclude that general damages should be fixed in this case at $100,000. In fixing this amount, I have considered that: (i) the Respondents published the two documents by mailing them and placing them on the website—over the strong objections of the University; (ii) the documents remained on the website some six months after the University demanded that they be removed; (iii) no apology or retraction has ever been made; and (iv) the Union appears to have had no conception of the harm caused to Dr. Rubin. [85] Having regard for all of the above facts and factors, I have concluded that an award of $100,000 provides sufficient compensation and appropriately balances the positions of the parties. That does not mean that a trial judge in such circumstances could not decline to order costs to a successful defendant, but it is not appropriate to decline to do so on the basis of “mixed results.” [93] The appeal is allowed with costs to Dr. Rubin in this Court and in the Court of Queen’s Bench. Dr. Rubin shall have general damages against the Respondents in the amount of $100,000.

The building was assessed in each of the years 2003 and 2004 on the basis of its 'fair value' as determined by the City Assessor. The owner of the building, the corporate appellant, was dissatisfied with the Assessor's determination of fair value and appealed the assessment to the local Board of Revision, then to the Assessment Appeals Committee of the Saskatchewan Municipal board. The appeals were allowed in part, but the corporate appellant remained dissatisfied. It applied for leave to appeal to this Court pursuant to s. 33.1 of The Municipal Board Act. The issues on appeal all relate to the determination of the fair value of the building and, more particularly, to the market adjustment factor used in that determination.

They had not shown any equality in their bargaining positions. 3)There was not equality in any bargaining positions with respect to the petitioner's right to spousal support though she earned only $15,000 per year while Mr.Stopanski earned $48,000.00 year. 4)The proposed judgment was unconscionsable in the opinion of the Court. There was no equality between bargaining positions and the bargaining position of the parties. 5)When the parties were presented with the proposed form of judgment, they did not attend nor did she file any material on her own behalf from which might gauge the level of her knowledge of the law and the rights that she has thereunder. No reasonable person would conclude that the proposal was anything but unconscducable and would speculate that at some point in the future, Ms. Perra will come to realize how patently unfair she was to her.","[2] The Court has been presented with a form of judgment bearing the consents of Mr. Stopanski and Ms. Perra.

The union argued that the arbitrators had not acted in good faith and that the grievance was not in the category of irreparable harm.

The Union alleged that the employer had violated Article 23.01 of the collective agreement by the manner in which the employer conducted promotional routine for the position of lieutenant. The grievance arose and was brought forward through arbitration pursuant to collective agreement between the parties. The unions alleged that this was an attempt to use inexperienced personnel. The arbitrator awarded the contract to the lieutenant who had elected to return to the rank of fire fighter and continue as such. The lieutenancy award was set aside and the union appealed. The appeal court held that the union's position was that only the suitability aspect of the testing procedure was being challenged. The court held the following: 1) the arbitration award was not set aside; 2) the union was awarded the award for 'grossly prejudicial harm' to the plaintiff. The plaintiff was awarded $2,500.00.

The first ground pertained to the defence’s contention that the officer who stopped the accused and made the breath demand did not have sufficient evidence of impaired driving. The officer testified that he was patrolling for impaired drivers on the night in question and observed the accused make a very tight right-hand turn, entering the untraveled portion of the road where the snow was soft. He noticed that her eyes were glassy and she was slurring her speech. She had just lit a cigarette, which suspects often do to mask the smell of alcohol. When she did put the cigarette out, he smelled alcohol on her breath. He asked her to step out of the vehicle and noticed that she swayed while standing still. She walked with a wide stance to the police cruiser and had to lean against it to maintain her balance. When he first asked the appellant if she had had anything to drink, she said that she’d had three but later said that she’d had five. He arrested her and made the breath demand. The defence argued that the trial judge erred in failing to consider other evidence that other vehicles had made similar turns and that the appellant did not require any assistance in leaving her vehicle and walking to the police cruiser, among other things. With respect to the second ground, the appellant advised the officer that she wanted to speak to a specific lawyer after being arrested. At the detachment, the appellant located the lawyer’s number and the officer dialed it. A voice message was left on the lawyer’s telephone but no return call was received. The officer advised the appellant she could call another lawyer, and initially she responded that she did not want to but wished to provide a breath sample. The officer was about to read her a waiver of her right when the appellant indicated that she wanted to call another lawyer. The officer called the number but received an after-hours message. He asked the appellant if she wanted to try another lawyer and she declined, stating that she was satisfied with leaving a message. She then provided her first breath sample. The defence argued at trial that the officer failed to advise the appellant of the availability of Legal Aid and failed to provide the Prosper warning, thereby breaching s. 10(b) of the Charter.  HELD: The appeal was dismissed. The court found that the trial judge had not erred: 1) by finding there was no s. 8 breach. The judge had not made any findings of fact that were not supported by the evidence nor did he fail to consider relevant evidence when he found that the officer had sufficient evidence that objectively supported his belief that the appellant’s ability to drive was impaired; and 2) by finding that there had been no breach of s. 10(b). The appellant had failed to act diligently in pursuing her right to speak with a lawyer and provided a clear and unequivocal indication that she had abandoned her right to counsel when she said she was happy leaving a message.",The appellant appeals her conviction under s. 253(1)(b) of the Criminal Code for driving with a blood alcohol content over.08. The trial judge erred in finding there was no breach of s. 10(b) Charter rights. The appellant contends the officer failed to provide the appellant with a Prosper warning. The officer observed the appellant swaying in a tight turn as she proceeded from stop sign onto highway leading out of Tisdale. The police observed the vehicle leave the snow packed area where most vehicles travel when making the turn. The officers observed the accused swaying and then leaned on the police vehicle. The appeal court dismissed the appeal. The court found that the trial judge did not make any findings of fact that were unsupported by the evidence nor did he fail to consider relevant evidence when he held that the officer had sufficient evidence that objectively supported the officer's belief that the appellant's ability to drive a motor vehicle was impaired. The evidence as found by the trial was found to be reliable and capable of supporting the officer’s conclusion that the accused was impaired by drugs. The Court dismissed ground one of the appeal on the basis that the appeal court erred by failing to consider the factors articulated by the officer as forming the factual basis for making the breath demand. The factors articulated as forming a factual basis were reliable and able to support the officer. The test for deference is whether the trial court erodes the s. 8 Charter right to be secure against unreasonable search or seizure. The error of fact is not a factor in determining whether a person has a reasonable and probable grounds to make a demand for a breath sample. The respondent’ s. and s. 9 Charter rights are protected by s. 686(1) (miscarriage of justice) and s6(1(b)). The trial court found the respondent”s s. 7 Charter rights were breached.

The first ground pertained to the defence’s contention that the officer who stopped the accused and made the breath demand did not have sufficient evidence of impaired driving. The officer testified that he was patrolling for impaired drivers on the night in question and observed the accused make a very tight right-hand turn, entering the untraveled portion of the road where the snow was soft. He noticed that her eyes were glassy and she was slurring her speech. She had just lit a cigarette, which suspects often do to mask the smell of alcohol. When she did put the cigarette out, he smelled alcohol on her breath. He asked her to step out of the vehicle and noticed that she swayed while standing still. She walked with a wide stance to the police cruiser and had to lean against it to maintain her balance. When he first asked the appellant if she had had anything to drink, she said that she’d had three but later said that she’d had five. He arrested her and made the breath demand. The defence argued that the trial judge erred in failing to consider other evidence that other vehicles had made similar turns and that the appellant did not require any assistance in leaving her vehicle and walking to the police cruiser, among other things. With respect to the second ground, the appellant advised the officer that she wanted to speak to a specific lawyer after being arrested. At the detachment, the appellant located the lawyer’s number and the officer dialed it. A voice message was left on the lawyer’s telephone but no return call was received. The officer advised the appellant she could call another lawyer, and initially she responded that she did not want to but wished to provide a breath sample. The officer was about to read her a waiver of her right when the appellant indicated that she wanted to call another lawyer. The officer called the number but received an after-hours message. He asked the appellant if she wanted to try another lawyer and she declined, stating that she was satisfied with leaving a message. She then provided her first breath sample. The defence argued at trial that the officer failed to advise the appellant of the availability of Legal Aid and failed to provide the Prosper warning, thereby breaching s. 10(b) of the Charter.

HELD: The application was to have formal judgment issued and to vary that decision in favour of her having primary residence. In the absence of an order varying the shared parenting order, she seeks a Voice of the Child report be prepared. The variation application is based on an alleged change of circumstances which includes V. expressing desire to live full time with her and he does not want to continue the week on/week off shared parenting regime. If variation is not ordered at this time absent the report, it is to be borne through resources provided to the program aside from the parents.

If so, it ought to be undertaken prior to ruling on the variation application. 2) The variation is dependent on the report.",0.4806517311608961

The trial judge held the circumstances supported a special plea of autrefois acquit and that the manner of proceeding by the Crown was an abuse of process at common law. Alberta did not withdraw or abandon the charges and suspended his driving privileges for 3 months. Upon request, SGI also suspended his Saskatchewan driving privileges. At issue was whether the Alberta court lost jurisdiction; if so, whether that gave rise to a plea of autrefois acquit in Saskatchewan; apart from any loss of jurisdiction did the police procedure amount to an abuse of process at common law. HELD: The Informations were stayed. The trial judge erred in finding a plea of autrefois acquit was applicable but was correct in concluding Alberta lost jurisdiction. 1)The Information remained dismissed for want of prosecution. Jurisdiction over the respondent was lost when the information was not available in the Alberta Provincial Court, the appearance notice was not confirmed and the matter could not be dealt with (R. v. McGinnis). The Alberta court could have regained jurisdiction by issuing a summons or warrant within 3 months of February 6, 2001. A summons was not issued until August. The information was by then deemed to have been dismissed for want of prosecution pursuant to s.485(3). 'Deemed' in s.485(3) does not mean 'presumed until otherwise proven'.

The onus is on the Plaintiff to prove his claim on a balance of probabilities and this involves proving that the Statchuk was responsible for killing their lawn. For the reasons stated, he has not done so. 1) The Plaintiff has access to farm chemicals through his employment with Crop Production Services and formerly with Viterra. The town employee called by the Plaintiff testified that he last used Ally in his yard to control broad leaf plants in 2010. There were no similar issues anywhere else in town where gravel from the same source was used. However, Defence led evidence of the fact that house was demolished in the area and debris may have been removed through the back alley, suggesting that perhaps this was the cause of the damage. 2) There are valid reasons for the Plaintiff's suspicions. The plaintiff was called to testify that he had used Ally and may have mixed one little strong with one strong strong. The Town employee testified that the offending substance came from gravel used in graveling the alley. Defence also testified that it was likely that the substance got into the lawn and killed it.

c_1995canlii5987.txt,The accused was charged with sexual assault and was tried in the Court of Queen's Bench. The evidence at trial indicated that the alleged acts had occurred prior to the accused becoming an adult. He had not been ordered transferred into adult court under s.16 of The Young Offenders Act. HELD: Accused acquitted. 1)The Judge was satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused had sexually assaulted the complainant. 2)Because the complainant's evidence suggested that the assault occurred while the accused was a young offender the Judge concluded that the Court of Queen's Bench was without jurisdiction in the matter.,"The accused was charged with sexually assaulting the complainant between the dates of October 1986 and March 31, 1988 at Beardy's Indian Reserve. The Crown had exclusive jurisdiction over the matter pursuant to s.5 of the Young Offenders Act. The Court of Queen's Bench had jurisdiction only when a matter was transferred to it pursuant to the Act. A concurrent proceeding was pending in Youth Court. The facts were that the accused was born on October 22, 1968 so that he ceased to be a young person within the meaning of the Act on the first date specified in the indictment. Although the one or two incidents of improper touching took place after the sexual intercourse incident, she quite frankly admitted that the incident occurred long before he became an adult. The accused was acquitted of the charge. The only issue before the Court was whether it was proven beyond a reasonable doubt that the sexual assaults alleged occurred on or after October 22/1986. The complainant turned 10 on February 5, 1986 and was almost 11 on the date specified by the indictment in a concurrent proceeding. Although one or 2 incidents of inappropriate touching took take place after that sexual intercourse, she was satisfied that the offences had stopped sometime after that date. The evidence was that the complainant had moved to Prince Albert while he was still young and that he subsequently moved from the Beardy Indian Reserve to PrinceAlbert while he became a adult. Although there were one or a two incidents that could have been committed by the accused, the evidence was not satisfied that he had moved from Saskatchewan to Prince Alberta while he remained young and had no further contact with the complainant.

The officer stopped the vehicle and the accused was arrested. The RCMP had placed road signs warning and advising of weight restrictions on highway #332. The signs were located on several grid roads in the area. The municipality was given authority to issue permits to persons to permit overweight vehicle traffic on the highway. The Minister's department placed road sign warning and advised of an alternative truck route.

It was not established that the order was published for the purpose of this prosecution nor that the document filed in court is proof of the order itself.  1)It is well known that in a criminal case a provision that enables the Crown to expeditiously prove certain elements of an offence must be strictly satisfied. Since a violation of the HTA is prosecuted under s.4 of the Summary Offences Procedure Act, which in turn adopts the Criminal Code summary conviction procedure, the Crown must strictly comply with the provisions respecting proof.  2)It is mandatory for the Minister to give notice of the order and there was no evidence he exercised his discretion by determining the most advisable manner in which notice was to be given. The Minister failed to take appropriate steps to cause notice of the order to be given. The Department of Highways placed road signs warning and advising of weight restrictions on the highway and along grid roads accessing #332, but no notice was given to the general public. Notifying persons who reside or do business in the immediate area of the road is not sufficient to satisfy the requirement to publish. 3)Even if it could be said sufficient notice was given, it could not be concluded that the endorsement upon the order that the order 'conforms to the original' meets the statutory requirement that the copy must be a certified copy 'under the hand of an officer or person in whose custody the...public document is placed' (s.12 SEA) since it was not known if she had custody of the document or under the hand of any of the persons set out in s.7(c) of the SEA since her official capacity is not described. The order was not published in the Saskatchewan Gazette and so a copy of the order so published could not be produced (s.7(a) SEA). It was not proven that the copy of the order had been printed by the Queen's Printer (s.7(b) SEA).","The accused was charged with operating a motor vehicle that violated the Minister's weight order contrary to s38(1)(b) of the Highways and Transportation Act, 1997. HELD: The accused was found guilty of operating an overweight vehicle on a road to which the Minister had imposed a restriction. There was no other notice given to the municipal division in which the grid roads were located and to entities situated along highway #1 that were involved in the transport of goods. The Minister's department placed road signs warning and advising of weight restrictions on highway #332 as well as other signs describing an alternative truck route. No other notice was given.  1)It is mandatory for the minister to give notice of the order. There is no evidence before me to indicate that the minister exercised his discretion by determining the most 'advisable' manner in which notice was to be given. 2)There was no publication in any local newspaper or provincial daily. It is not the responsibility of the local municipality to satisfy the obligation imposed upon the Minister to provide notice of his order but, in this case, the municipality appears to have taken it upon itself to advise persons in municipal division affected by the weight restriction and to advise other persons in the immediate area that were in the business of hauling.","1 The accused is charged that he did, on February 26, 2001 in Swift Current district, Saskatchewan, operate a motor vehicle that violated the Minister\'s weight order contrary to section 38(1)(b) of The Highways and Transportation Act, 1997. In essence, it is alleged that the accused operated an overweight vehicle on a road to which the Minister\'s weight restriction applied. 6 The Crown tendered a copy of a document entitled ""Order for Road Restriction on Provincial Highway #332"" and the documents purports to be issued under section 35 of The Highway Traffic Act, 1997. 9 The defence argues the following:

a) the document is not proof of the Minister\'s order according to law, and
b) even if the document is proof, the order is a ""regulation"" under the provisions of The Interpretation Act and so the provisions of The Regulations Act applies to it. I can only conclude that the Minister failed to take appropriate steps to cause notice of the order to be given. Even if it could be said that the steps taken by the municipality satisfy the notice provisions for the purposes of this prosecution, I cannot conclude that notifying persons who reside or do business in the immediate area of the road affected by the order is sufficient notice to satisfy the requirement to publish. 24 Even if it could be said that sufficient notice was given, I cannot conclude that Ms. Melnychuk\'s endorsement upon the order that the order ""conforms to the original"" meets the statutory requirement that the copy must be a certified copy ""under the hand of an officer or person in whose custody the ... public document is placed"" (section 12 SEA) since I do not know if she had custody of the document or under the hand of any of the persons set out in section 7(c) of SEA since her official capacity is not described. The order was not published in the Saskatchewan Gazette and so a copy of the order so published could not be produced [section 7(a) SEA] and it was not proven that the copy of the order had been printed by the Queen\'s Printer [section 7(b) SEA]. Accordingly, it has not been proven, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the accused violated the provisions of section 38(1)(b) of HTA.",0.4444444444444444,0.4772727272727273,The accused was charged with operating an overweight vehicle on a highway to which the Minister's weight restriction applied. The accused was stopped by a police officer on patrol in the northwesterly direction and he was about to turn left when he noticed a tractor trailer travelling in an easterly direction. The officer stopped the vehicle and the accused was arrested. The RCMP had placed road signs warning and advising of weight restrictions on highway #332. The signs were located on several grid roads in the area. The municipality was given authority to issue permits to persons to permit overweight vehicle traffic on the highway. The Minister's department placed road sign warning and advised of an alternative truck route. The municipal administrator of the province had erected signs warning of weight restriction on highway number 32 and other grid roads. The Department of Highways had erected road signs advising of the weight restriction. The Municipality did not issue a copy of the order. The notice was not given to the general public. The police had not received any notice of the notice and the municipality did not have any publication in any other print media. The Crown had not established that an order had been made for the purpose of this case. HELD: The Court found that the Minister failed to take sufficient steps to ensure that the public knew the meaning of the word'regulation' and that notice was given to persons in the municipal division affected by the weight restrictions. There was no evidence before the court to indicate that the minister exercised his discretion by determining the most 'advisable' manner in which notice was to be given. The Ministry of Highway placed road signage warning and warning of the overweight vehicles. The signage were located at frequent locations along highway #32 and along the grid roads accessing #332 and were removed by the Department of Highway. The Municipal Administrator of the municipality was charged. The Court concluded that the municipality failed to follow the statutory requirement to provide notice of an order.,0.5443499392466586

HELD: The Court reserved its decision respecting this application and undertook to render decision on this issue at the time of its final judgment. 1) The Court does accept that there is less likelihood of moral prejudice, reasoning prejudice and propensity reasoning in a judge alone trial as opposed to jury trial. However, there is a risk that the degree of similarity in such cases must be higher or lower than in an identification case. 2) There are numerous photos of boys wearing their beaded jackets, moccasins and beaver mitts in spite of the accusations by some that these were taken away and never returned. The normal procedure upon arrival at school was for all of the boys to be locked out with winter clothing on, but having the door locked for 15 minutes while the older boys mopped the floor without the small boys running through and tracking up the hardwood floor. 3) The touching would escalate on subsequent occasions to the accused waking the complainant from sleep and telling him to come to his office/bedroom. The issues in question derive from the facts alleged in the charge and the defences advanced or reasonably anticipated. It is therefore incumbent on the Crown to identify the live issue in the trial to which the evidence of disposition is said to relate. If the issue has ceased to be in dispute, as for example when the fact is admitted by the accused, then the evidence is irrelevant and it must be excluded for reasons of overall prejudice. The relative importance of the issue in this case may also have bearing on the weighing up of factors for and against admissibility.","[1] The accused has been charged with 14 counts of indecent assault and three counts of gross indecency against 14 individuals, all of whom were boys who attended the Beauval Indian Residential School between January 1, 1959 and December 31, 1967.

In 2006, the plaintiff commenced an action against the defendant, alleging that the defendant was in breach of contract or negligent for failing to obtain full replacement value insurance coverage for the plaintiff. The defendant filed his defence in April 2007. Mediation took place in September 2010 and examinations for discovery were held in May 2011. At that time, the defendant asked the plaintiff to disclose the amount recovered in the Wawanesa lawsuit and the plaintiff refused. The defendant brought this application for relief that: 1) The plaintiff's action be dismissed for want of prosecution; or 2) The plaintiff be required to disclose the amount recovered in the other lawsuit. The defendant argued that the delays between the issuance of the statement of claim to the examination for discovery and then the delay between the time of mediation to May 2012 when the plaintiff's counsel filed the reply to undertakings were both inordinate.HELD: The Court applied the test established in International Capitol Corp. v.

The Court found that the first delay was inordinate but because the plaintiff and defendant both acknowledged that the action against the defendant would only proceed depending on the outcome of the claim against Wawanesa, the delay was excusable. The Court found that the second delay was excessive, but was not sufficient to strike the claim on that basis. Applying the factors provided in Capitol, the Court found:1.

Impact of delay: The delay was not causing any problems for the defendant. 3.

Reasons offered for delay: Counsel was busy and it had to determine which undertaking could or could not be answered. 5. The role of counsel in causing the delay: The Court held that the delay caused by the plaintiff's counsel should not be a reason to deprive the plaintiff of his claim for actions beyond his control. The Court denied the application to strike the plaintiff's claim but ordered that the plaintiff disclose the amount obtained in the Wawanesa action on the basis that this case fell into the exception to the policy which protects settlement communications.

The context in which the delay occurred is not such as to lead the Court on its own to strike the claim.","[1] The applicant, Ernest Hoeppner, brings an application for relief in the alternative as follows:

(a) that the plaintiff’s action be dismissed for want of prosecution; or
(b) that the plaintiff be required to disclose the amount recovered from its lawsuit with Wawanesa Insurance, Q.B. No. 1074 of 2001. On March 7, 2000, Mr. Kozak suffered a fire at his farm. On May 7, 2001, Mr. Kozak issued a statement of claim against one James Neigum, his tenant, and Wawanesa Mutual Insurance Company under Q.B. No. 1074 of 2001 in the Judicial Centre of Saskatoon. I find that the delay was inordinate. [8] As examinations for discovery are completed this matter is at a point where it could well go to pre-trial conference. [10] The delay from June 2010 to May 2012 really is a delay from May 2011 until May 2012 and solely on the head of counsel for the plaintiff for not responding in a timely fashion to the undertakings. [11] The only reason offered by counsel for the plaintiff for the delay in responding to the undertakings was a busy schedule and determination was to be made about which undertakings could be answered and which were not answerable pursuant to the Rules.

SUMMARY [20] Regarding the application to strike the plaintiff’s claim for want of prosecution, I find that for the initial period of May 2006 to May 2010 the delay was inordinate but excusable. With regard to the period of time June 2010 to May 2012 I find the period of delay not to be inordinate but even if inordinate and inexcusable, I would find that having regard to the principles set down by the Court of Appeal in International Capital Corp. v. Robinson Twigg & Ketilson that I would not strike the plaintiff’s claim. [21] With regard to the disclosure of settlement amounts I find that the defendant has made its case and order those specific amounts for each structure for which Wawanesa settled its claim to be disclosed.",0.46323529411764713,0.3918495297805643,"The plaintiff purchased insurance from the defendant. In 2000, the plaintiff's farm was damaged by a fire. He commenced an action against Wawanesa Insurance Company in 2001. In 2006, the plaintiff commenced an action against the defendant, alleging that the defendant was in breach of contract or negligent for failing to obtain full replacement value insurance coverage for the plaintiff. The defendant filed his defence in April 2007. Mediation took place in September 2010 and examinations for discovery were held in May 2011. At that time, the defendant asked the plaintiff to disclose the amount recovered in the Wawanesa lawsuit and the plaintiff refused. The defendant brought this application for relief that: 1) The plaintiff's action be dismissed for want of prosecution; or 2) The plaintiff be required to disclose the amount recovered in the other lawsuit. The defendant argued that the delays between the issuance of the statement of claim to the examination for discovery and then the delay between the time of mediation to May 2012 when the plaintiff's counsel filed the reply to undertakings were both inordinate.HELD: The Court applied the test established in International Capitol Corp. v. Robinson Twigg &amp; Ketilson to determine whether or not a matter should be struck for want of prosecution. The Court found that the first delay was inordinate but because the plaintiff and defendant both acknowledged that the action against the defendant would only proceed depending on the outcome of the claim against Wawanesa, the delay was excusable. The Court found that the second delay was excessive, but was not sufficient to strike the claim on that basis. Applying the factors provided in Capitol, the Court found:1. Stage of litigation: It did not occur at an early stage of the litigation as the matter could well go to pre-trial conference. 2. Impact of delay: The delay was not causing any problems for the defendant. 3. The context in which the delay occurred: the delay in question was actually only one year during which the plaintiff's counsel did not respond in a timely fashion to undertakings. 4. Reasons offered for delay: Counsel was busy and it had to determine which undertaking could or could not be answered. 5. The role of counsel in causing the delay: The Court held that the delay caused by the plaintiff's counsel should not be a reason to deprive the plaintiff of his claim for actions beyond his control. The Court denied the application to strike the plaintiff's claim but ordered that the plaintiff disclose the amount obtained in the Wawanesa action on the basis that this case fell into the exception to the policy which protects settlement communications. Here, the communications sought by the defendant were relevant and necessary to avoid double recovery.","FIAT: The applicant brings an application for relief in the alternative as follows:(a) that the plaintiff's action be dismissed for want of prosecution;(b) that it be required to disclose the amount recovered from its lawsuit with Wawanesa Insurance. The plaintiff issued a statement of claim against one of the defendants for failing to obtain full replacement value insurance for Mr. Kozak. The defendant insurer had contractual rights to know what recovery the plaintiff had received in earlier litigation, which affected the insurer's obligation to pay the plaintiff. To avoid double recovery, disclosure was ordered. The delay from June 2010 to May 2012 really is a delay from May 2011 until May 2012 and solely on the head of counsel for the plaintiff for not responding in a timely fashion to the undertakings. As examinations for discovery are completed this matter is at a point where it could lead the court on its own to strike. The impact of inexcusable delay on the defendant is not at such an early stage that it would lead the Court on its Own to strike the claim.","[1] The applicant, Ernest Hoeppner, brings an application for relief in the alternative as follows:

HELD: 1)The plaintiff's action against the defendant was dismissed for want of prosecution. 2)The delay was inordinate and inexcusable. Mediation was held in May 2011 and examinations for discovery were held May 9, 2011. 3)The defendant was advised not to repeat such conduct. 4)The applicant applies for an order to force the plaintiff to disclose the settlement amounts from its settlement in the Wawanesa claim. 5)The court found that for the initial period of May 2006 to May 2010 the delay was not inordinate but excusable. The plaintiff argued that it was understood between the parties that the action against Mr. Hoeppner would only proceed depending on the outcome of the claim against Wawana. 6)The context in which the delay occurred was not such as to lead the Court to strike the claim on that basis. 7)The Court found that the defendant had made its case and ordered the specific amounts for each structure for which Wawanasa settled its claim to be disclosed. 8)The public policy behind settlement privilege is compelling one. It is so compelling that even threats arising in the context of settlement negotiations may not justify an exception. 9)The time between the plaintiff's counsel to respond to the undertakings was an excessive period of time. While one year is an excessive amount of time it is not such a stretch to lead me to the position that this claim should be struck on a basis. The stage of litigation is at a point where it could well go to pre-trial conference. Therefore it is at such an early stage that it would lead the court on its own to strike.",0.5557011795543906

The applicant provides little explanation for his failure to pay child support. 2) The respondent has demonstrated the necessary change in circumstance in order to proceed with his variation regarding his ongoing maintenance payments. 3) The applicant appears to be suggesting that his payment of ongoing support, and any payment he must make towards arrears, leaves him in financial difficulties, given he has remarried and has two more children.

It appears that he did have the ability to pay in some of the years since the order was granted. The Income Tax Summary filed by Ms Braun show that he earned less income from 1998 to 1998 than in 2002 and in 2003. 6) The court reviewed the Income Tax summaries and income tax returns filed by Mrs. Braun. It is fair to adjust the appellant's ongoing child support payments as at November 1, 2006.

HELD: The accused was found guilty.  1)The case law from other jurisdictions was reviewed. Given the law as it presently stands in Saskatchewan the Crown does not have an obligation to prove that bodily harm caused by the assault was objectively foreseeable and that the assault would subject the victim to the risk of bodily harm. The Court of Appeal expressly stated that R. v. Nurse was incorrectly decided and prefers the approach in R. v. Brooks which held the elements of assault causing bodily harm consist of the mens rea to commit the assault and the intentional application of force which results in bodily harm. 2)The victim would not have suffered bodily harm if the accused had not assaulted him. The assault was more than an insignificant or trivial cause of the bodily harm. While the bodily harm resulted directly from third parties falling on top of the accused and the victim, the third parties involvement was due entirely and as a direct result of the actions of the accused. It was clearly the accused who initiated the pile up. The accused placed the victim in a dangerous position, similar to that in the Samuelson and Brooks decisions. A very short period of time elapsed between the assault and bodily harm.","The accused stands charged with assault causing bodily harm contrary to s. 267(b) of the Criminal Code. The accused was charged with the offence of attempting to kill a motor vehicle passenger. The Crown called the two disinterested witnesses to the event. The first was the 15-year-old mascot for the Raider Hockey Club, Timothy Sabo, another fan, Adam Balicki and another fan. The second was the accused's son, Richard Schmitt. The two disinterest witnesses testified that they saw the accused and the other fan engaging in a verbal altercation. The third was the complainant's son. The trial judge concluded that the second question was easily answered in the negative. The court concluded that there was a second question in the affirmative. While the bodily harm resulted directly from the effect of third parties falling on top of the accused, the third parties involved were due entirely and as direct result of the actions of the defendants. The Court found that the accused placed the victim in a dangerous position, similar to the accused in the Samuelson and Brooks decisions. The same short period of time elapsed between the assault and the bodily damage. The assault would subject the victim to the risk of bodily harm. The offence was committed because the accused was the one who initiated the pile-up from which the bodily injury resulted. The fact that the victim fell to the concrete floor was not a contributing cause of the bodily damages. The evidence was that the kick was a contributing factor. The only thing that could have been a contributing component was the fact that it was more than an insignificant or trivial cause of bodily damage and the assault was more likely to be an insignificant cause of death. The failure to prove objective foreseeability was the Crown's failure to establish the cause of this offence. The defendant's failure not to establish that the punch was a contributory cause of his death was the result of his failure to show objective foreseeibility. The defence did not have to prove that the mens rea to commit the assault, that is the intentional application of force to the person of the victim, was a factor in the assault. The offences were both unlawful and were both committed in the manner they were committed. The victim was also the victim of a serious bodily harm and the accused did not commit the act of committing the assault as a whole. The jury must conclude that the assault is a contributing contributing cause. The act of assault is not a crime.","The accused was convicted at trial of assault causing bodily harm.

c_2013skqb155.txt,"The Crown appealed a decision of the Provincial Court dismissing an application for a recognizance pursuant to s. 810.2 of the Criminal Code. The judge held that the usual rules of evidence pertaining to criminal trials apply to a s. 810.2 hearing and that records kept by the Correctional Services of Canada (CSC) were inadmissible as business records under s. 30 of the Canada Evidence Act. The respondent had been convicted in 2009 of robbery with violence, assault causing bodily harm, assault and three counts of violating bail. He was sentenced to three years' imprisonment. In May 2010, the CSC referred the respondent's case to the National Parole Board (NPB) with a recommendation that he be detained until warrant expiry, in accordance with s. 129(2) of the Corrections and Conditional Release Act (CCRA). The recommendation was based upon the character of the respondent's offences and where there are reasonable grounds to believe that the offender is likely to commit another offence causing death or serious harm if released on parole. The NPB ordered that the respondent be detained in custody until the expiry of the sentence. Reviewed annually under the CCRA, the CSC prepared another assessment in 2011 and the respondent was not released from custody until March 2012. At that point, a 'warrant expiry package' was prepared by a parole officer, comprised of CSC records relating to the respondent, including a criminal profile report, the assessment for decision reports and copies of the NPB's reasons for ordering detention. These records were sent to the RCMP in Saskatchewan. The officer concerned then swore the information under s. 810.2, stating that he believed that there were reasonable grounds to believe that the respondent would commit a serious personal offence as defined by s. 752 of the Code. The application for a hearing was commenced in August 2012. The parole officer and the RCMP officer were called to testify and the Crown applied to have the documents in the package admitted into evidence, and the respondent opposed the application. The judge refused to allow the admission of the report, the assessment and the NPB reasons for ordering detention based upon R. v. Fontaine and R. v. Toulejour. Based on the business rules exception, the judge held that the criminal report profile was inadmissible because it was a copy and not accompanied by supporting affidavits as required by s. 30(3) of the CEA. HELD: The Court held that the application was allowed. The Supreme Court had confirmed that s. 810 hearings are not criminal trials and that the rules of evidence in criminal trials do not apply. Hearsay evidence is admissible and the judge is to determine whether or not sufficient weight can be given to the hearsay evidence to establish reasonable and probable grounds required for the individual to swear the information to justify the fear of harm to others by the respondent.

HELD: The appeal is dismissed. 1)The normal criminal rules of law apply to s810 hearings. The judge refused to allow the admission and the assessment for decision reports and the NPB's reasons for ordering detention admitted into evidence. The Crown called two witnesses.

The court found the usual criminal rules were on balance of probabilities. The Court held that the Crown should be satisfied that hearsays evidence was admissible in a criminal proceeding. 4)The Court held the usual rule of admissibility applied to the s8100 hearings. 5)The judge held that hearsaying evidence was not admissible because it was copy and copy. 6)The courts held that s.810 was not a criminal offence. The normal criminal law rules of admissible were used to allow evidence that did not meet the admissibleness rules prescribed for criminal trials to be admitted and serve as the basis for decision. The courts held the following: 1)Hearsay evidence is admissible; 2)Criminal law is meant to be met when the burden is proof beyond reasonable doubt. The usual rules are met when a trial is conducted under the Criminal Procedure Code. 7)The usual rules in criminal trials are the standard to be set out in R. v. Bilida. 8)The trial judge held the Crown must establish (1) that the victim actually fears that the defendant will cause personal injury to him; and (2) reasonable grounds exist for the fear.

2_2008skca172.txt,"The appellant was tried by Queen's Bench judge sitting alone and found guilty of operating a motor vehicle while his ability to operate the vehicle was impaired by alcohol, thereby causing death contrary to s. 255(3) of the Criminal Code, and causing bodily harm contrary to s. 255(2) of the Code. He was sentenced to 5 years imprisonment after having been given credit of 1 year for the time served on remand. The appellant appeals both his conviction and sentence. On the conviction appeal the appellant raises a technical ground in relation to the manner in which the appellant was charged as well as issues of the propriety and fairness of the cross-examination of himself by Crown counsel, the admissibility of his criminal record at trial, and the admissibility of opinion evidence proved in the testimony of the Crown's expert witness on accident reconstruction. He also argues that the trial judge failed to find that the fact that the appellant was impaired at the time of the collision was the cause of the collision and that his conclusion was unreasonable and against the weight of the evidence. HELD: Appeal dismissed.  1) The trial judge has a discretion pursuant to R. v. Corbett, [1988] 1 S.C.R. 670, to exclude prejudicial evidence of prior convictions in an appropriate case. This discretion is exercised by the trial judge on the application of an accused at the close of the Crown's case. See R. v. Underwood, [1998] 1 S.C.R. 77. As such an application was not raised in this case, and the questioning about previous convictions by the Crown was not objected to when it occurred, and the issue of the appellant's previous alcohol related offences was raised in the appellant's own examination in chief, this court concludes that there is no basis for this Court to conclude that the cross-examination was inappropriate or that the evidence adduced was inadmissible.  2) It is not proper for Crown counsel to ask an accused on cross-examination to explain the testimony of a Crown witness, and that it is highly unfair and prejudicial to require an accused to agree with a Crown witness or stigmatize that witness as a 'liar'. Crown counsel should not have put these sorts of questions and the trial judge ought not to have permitted them. Defence counsel did not object to them.

HELD: The appeal was dismissed. The sentencing judge was not bound to accept the assessment of the experts. Both experts testified that the appellant's risk to reoffend sexually was moderate to high and was extremely high if he did not receive treatment. Both experts based their opinions, in part, on the idea that the appellant had been a model inmate. Both experts believed the appellant's self report about his behaviour in custody, despite having reached the conclusion that he was a pathological liar. Both experts appeared to take the accused at face value when he said he was motivated to change. In fact, the evidence from correctional officials suggested that the appellant was prone to violent, aggressive and irrational behaviour in custody. He had shown on numerous occasions that he would not follow the rules in the institution and had been involved in several attempts to smuggle drugs into the jail, including picking up a package in the washroom of the court house during his dangerous offender hearing and convincing his lawyer to bring his baby into the jail with drugs in his diaper. The accused had committed two sexual assaults within months of being released from a previous sexual assault sentence. The trial judge was correct to emphasize protection of the public and was entitled to discount the opinion of the experts because it was based on incorrect assumptions. In supporting the sentencing judge's opinion that the accused would not take treatment because he refused to accept responsibility for his offences, the Court of Appeal noted that the accused had stated in his Notice of Appeal that he was serving a life sentence for two sexual assaults that he did not commit and the fact that he sent a letter to the Court saying that he had been falsely accused and did not sexually assault anyone. In addition, the Court considered fresh evidence that the appellant had refused to transfer to another institution in order to participate in high-intensity sex offender treatment pending his appeal.","After the defendant pled guilty to two counts of sexual assault, the Court of Appeal declared him a dangerous offender and sentenced him to an indeterminate sentence. The defendant appealed. HELD: Appeal dismissed. 1) The judge failed to give adequate consideration to the experts' assessment of the defendant's risk. The judge was not bound to accept the assessment of two expert witnesses who both recommended that he be declared a long-term offender. The trial judge was also not bound by the experts’ findings of fact. 2) The defendant was not only in custody but had been in custody for four degrading sexual assaults upon vulnerable women and had yet to take the high intensity sexual offender treatment program. He followed this up with a letter dated August 28, 2010 to this Court where he said he did not sexually assault anyone and was falsely accused by the victims who were forced to lie by the police. 3) The Court of Queen’s Bench found that the defendant was in a state of disrepute and had not taken the high-intensity sexual offender program. The Court was not obliged to accept these experts‘ assessment. The Defendant was not free to accept their assessment. He was doing a life sentence for two sexual assaults that he did commit. He then followed this letter to this court where he claimed that he was not sexually assaulted anyone and that he had been falsely accused. 4) The court was not satisfied that the judge was overemphasizing the importance of protection and denunciation of the potential for eventual control of risk in the community. The court dismissed the appeal. 5) The trial court was unable to give sufficient consideration to expert opinion. The evidence was so new that it was impossible to reconcile the conclusions of the experts. The fact that the trial judge failed not to give proper consideration to these experts was a major reason why the appeal was dismissed. The decision was made in light of the evidence. The sentencing judge was unable or unwilling to accept expert opinion and the defendant’ s. 753.1(1) of the Criminal Code. The appeal was therefore dismissed. 6) The Defendant’S position that he would not take treatment because he refused to accept responsibility for the sexual assaults was prophetic. The appellant was doing his sentence for a life of imprisonment. He did not commit any crimes. The Appeal Court was unable and unwilling to conciliate the expert opinion with the defendant. The sentence was not indefinite.","Disposition: Appeal dismissed [1] After Orlando Jose Gonzales (“Mr. Gonzales”) pled guilty to two counts of sexual assault, Currie J. declared him to be a dangerous offender and sentenced him to an indeterminate sentence.

The police officer observed the vehicle accelerate over a period of two to three blocks and used radar to clock the vehicle's top speed at 140 km/hr. The posted speed limit is 60 km/hr. The intersection was near a church and school yard. There is a bend in the street near where this speeding occurred. HELD: The accused was convicted of dangerous driving. The accused was travelling well over twice the posted speed limit for that portion of roadway. The bend in the road adds to the danger. The accused was driving within the confines of a city and his actions were planned and deliberate. His conduct is a marked departure from the standard expected of a reasonably prudent driver.,"The accused was charged with operating a motor vehicle on a highway in a manner dangerous to the public contrary to s. 249(1)(a) of the Criminal Code. The accused was stopped at a red light at a busy intersection and the officer locked in the vehicle speed at one hundred and forty kilometres an hour. The officer observed the accused accelerate for two to three blocks and locked in at a greater speed than the posted speed limit. The vehicle was stopped when signalled to do so by the flashing lights of the police vehicle one block east of Thatcher. There was no abrupt stopping or slamming on the brakes. The driver was charged as charged. HELD: The accused is guilty as charged and the mens rea is inferred from the driving conduct. 1) While the speed of one hundred-and- forty kilometres per hour was for a short period of time, in my view such conduct is a marked departure from the standard expected for a reasonably prudent driver. The only conclusion that the Court can draw is that this driving action was planned and deliberate. 2) The accused voluntarily undertook to drive his vehicle and accelerate to this rate of speed on a road that was dangerous to public. While the driving was a marked de departure from that standard expected in a reasonably- prudent driver, such conduct was a'marked departure' from the Standard expected for reasonably prudent drivers. 3) The driving action is a 'de departure' form a'mark departure' of the standard expect for a reasonable prudent driver.' The mens ra is inferring from the menses rea inferred from driving conduct and the driving is a deliberate driving action. The mins rea was inferred from a driving conduct inferred from it. The driving conduct was clearly planned and intentional. The Court can only draw a marked difference from the standards expected for reasonable prudent drivers in the circumstances.","While the speed of one hundred and forty kilometres per hour was for a short period of time, in my view such conduct is a “marked departure” from the standard expected for a reasonably prudent driver.

The applicant disputes liability for the amount set out in the wage assessment and claim that he inadvertently and innocently missed the time within which to file an appeal. The issues are whether this Court has jurisdiction to set aside the Director's certificate filed with the Court of Queen's Bench, if so what criteria ought to be applied in determining whether the Court should exercise its discretion and whether the applicant has satisfied the criteria. HELD: 1) Even though an appeal from a wage assessment to the appeals board and an appeal from an adjudicator to the Court of Queen's Bench both require 'appeals' within '21 days', an appeal to the Court of Queen's Bench is a true appeal while an 'appeal' to the appeals board is essentially a request for a de novo hearing. Consequently, this Court concludes that the consequences of missing the time limitation are not necessarily the same. 2) This Court does have jurisdiction to deal with an applicant's request, on a director appeal, because it is not a 'true appeal' that questions a decision made by an independent adjudicator after a hearing. Accordingly, the reasoning of this Court in Farmers of North America Inc. v. Langridge, 2004 SKQB 375, is not applicable. A finding that this Court is without jurisdiction to set aside a judgment, obtained without any independent adjudicative process, regardless of the basis upon which that judgment was obtained, is inequitable and at odds with existing practices and procedures. Section 62.4(4) of The Labour Standards Act states that a certificate filed pursuant to s. 62.4(3) has the same force and effect as if it were a judgment obtained in the Court of Queen's Bench for the recovery of a debt. This Court certainly would have jurisdiction to determine whether or not the applicant's application to open up a noting for default should be granted pursuant to Rule 114(3), Rule 271 and Rule 346. It follows that this Court is able to look behind the filing and examine the circumstances under which that judgment was entered. The Court of Queen's Bench is a superior Court charged with the administration of justice and enjoys inherent as well as statutory jurisdiction.

(1) Does this Court have jurisdiction to set aside the Director’s certificate filed with the Court of Queen’s Bench?

(2) If so, what criteria ought to be applied in determining whether the Court should exercise its discretion in favour of setting aside the wage assessment certificate?

(3) Has the applicant satisfied the criteria? [34] Accordingly, even though an appeal from a wage assessment to the appeals board and an appeal from an adjudicator to the Court of Queen’s Bench both require “appeals” within “21 days” an appeal to the Court of Queen’s Bench is a true appeal while an “appeal” to the appeals board is essentially a request for a de novo hearing. Consequently, I conclude that the consequences of missing the time limitation are not necessarily the same. [37] I conclude that this Court does have jurisdiction to deal with an applicant’s request, on a director appeal, because it is not a “true appeal” that questions a decision made by an independent adjudicator after a hearing. A finding that this Court is without jurisdiction to set aside a judgment, obtained without any independent adjudicative process, regardless of the basis upon which that judgment was obtained, is inequitable and at odds with existing practices and procedures. If the employee had sued the employer for the wages, which it would be her right to do, and if a statement of claim had been served, but not defended, and the matter was noted for default, this Court certainly would have jurisdiction to determine whether or not the defendant/employer’s application to open up of a noting for default should be granted.

9_2008skca107.txt,"This appeal arises from a dispute between the appellant, Dr. Huerto and the respondent Government of Saskatchewan, over the payment for medical services provided by Dr. Huerto to his patients. Over a period of approximately 10 years, the Government withheld payment in relation to what eventually amounted to some 12,000 of the appellant's accounts. The Government indicated through the use of a billing code, that the accounts would not be paid until further information was provided. The appellant believed the use of the billing code was unlawful and chose not to provide additional information. He started an action in the Court of Queen's Bench to compel payment of his accounts. His claim was largely dismissed on the basis that the action was premature. The appellant appeals from the Queen's Bench ruling and the Government cross-appeal in relation to the limited aspect of the case in which Dr. Huerto enjoyed success. HELD: Appeal and Cross-appeal dismissed.  1) Section 17(1)(c) of The Saskatchewan Medical Care Insurance Act is to the effect that the intention and purpose of the Act is not to establish a medical care insurance plan under which 'the exercise of professional judgment by physicians is in any way diminished'. This broad statement of principle should not be read so aggressively as to mean the Government, as the payor in a publicly funded health care system, has no right to ask questions about the accounts presented for payment by physicians. The Government has not denied payment of the appellant's accounts. Nor has it received the requested information from the appellant. The actions (the Protocol) taken by the Government cannot be characterized as an amendment of the Payment Schedule. The Protocol is an administrative tool which sets out the situations in which the appellant will be asked for further information about the provision of specific services. This is fully in line with the terms of the Schedule. 2) Section 5(1) of the Regulations should not be read as meaning the Government is entitled to ask for additional information about a service if, and only if, the nature of the service is 'unusual'. Rather, it simply stipulates that additional remarks must be included in an account rendered with respect to an unusual service. This does not imply the government can request extra information only in relation to an unusual service. A physician's obligation to include certain material in an account and the Government's authority to ask for additional information are ultimately two quite different things. 3) The Court does not accept that the appellant's claims were barred by s. 16(1) of the Act. It would be perverse to read the Act as requiring that, in order for an account to be paid, every bit of information demanded by the Government through the use of a billing code, or otherwise, must be supplied before the expiration of the 6 month period established by the Regulations. An account submitted the day before the expiration of the 6 month deadline would be voided by the application of the billing code. An account submitted well in advance of the expiration of the 6 month period would also be effectively denied if a request for further information was not made until at or near the end of the six month time limit, with the result that there was insufficient time for a physician to respond before that limit was exceeded. These potential problems are especially troublesome because there is an element of subjectivity in the application of the Protocol and even the most diligent physician might not accurately anticipate when an account or accounts will attract a request for extra comment. 4) The Court cannot accept the Government's submission that the trial judge should have declined to deal with the appellant's claim because the appellant had not fully pursued possible appeals to the Medical assessment Board. The Legislature in s. 40(3) of the Act has expressly provided that the appeal procedure established pursuant to the Act does not prejudice a physician's right to pursue matters in the courts. It stands entirely at odds with the notion that the appeal procedures in the Act should be read as being comprehensive and exhaustive.",HELD: The appeal was dismissed and the cross-appeal dismissed.

HELD: Appeal and Cross-appeal dismissed.  1) Section 17(1)(c) of The Saskatchewan Medical Care Insurance Act is to the effect that the intention and purpose of the Act is not to establish a medical care insurance plan under which 'the exercise of professional judgment by physicians is in any way diminished'. This broad statement of principle should not be read so aggressively as to mean the Government, as the payor in a publicly funded health care system, has no right to ask questions about the accounts presented for payment by physicians. The Government has not denied payment of the appellant's accounts. Nor has it received the requested information from the appellant. The actions (the Protocol) taken by the Government cannot be characterized as an amendment of the Payment Schedule. The Protocol is an administrative tool which sets out the situations in which the appellant will be asked for further information about the provision of specific services. This is fully in line with the terms of the Schedule. 2) Section 5(1) of the Regulations should not be read as meaning the Government is entitled to ask for additional information about a service if, and only if, the nature of the service is 'unusual'. Rather, it simply stipulates that additional remarks must be included in an account rendered with respect to an unusual service. This does not imply the government can request extra information only in relation to an unusual service. A physician's obligation to include certain material in an account and the Government's authority to ask for additional information are ultimately two quite different things. 3) The Court does not accept that the appellant's claims were barred by s. 16(1) of the Act. It would be perverse to read the Act as requiring that, in order for an account to be paid, every bit of information demanded by the Government through the use of a billing code, or otherwise, must be supplied before the expiration of the 6 month period established by the Regulations. An account submitted the day before the expiration of the 6 month deadline would be voided by the application of the billing code. An account submitted well in advance of the expiration of the 6 month period would also be effectively denied if a request for further information was not made until at or near the end of the six month time limit, with the result that there was insufficient time for a physician to respond before that limit was exceeded. These potential problems are especially troublesome because there is an element of subjectivity in the application of the Protocol and even the most diligent physician might not accurately anticipate when an account or accounts will attract a request for extra comment. 4) The Court cannot accept the Government's submission that the trial judge should have declined to deal with the appellant's claim because the appellant had not fully pursued possible appeals to the Medical assessment Board. The Legislature in s. 40(3) of the Act has expressly provided that the appeal procedure established pursuant to the Act does not prejudice a physician's right to pursue matters in the courts. It stands entirely at odds with the notion that the appeal procedures in the Act should be read as being comprehensive and exhaustive.","Dr. Huerto commenced an action in the Court of Queen's Bench to compel payment of his patients' accounts. The claim was dismissed on the basis that the action was premature. The Government cross-appealed in relation to the limited aspect of the case in which the appellant had enjoyed success. HELD: Both the appeal and the cross appeal must be dismissed. The principles of the Protocol and the Government's use of the AU code are not inconsistent with s. 17(1)(j) of the MCIA. The Protocol is a broad outline of the scheme which governs payment for physician services in Saskatchewan. It does not accept the argument that it is a 'payment schedule' uniquely applicable to the physician. Rather, it contemplates that the Government has some authority to look behind the face of the accounts presented for payment. In this case, the evidence at trial indicated that the ECG and Holter monitor procedures which are at the root of this appeal are standard tests and not 'unusual' in and of themselves. However, the Protocol ties directly into the 'Assessment Rules' portion of the Schedule. It states that accounts may be adjusted with reference to the relationship between the service being billed and prior or subsequent services and, in addition, to the submission of claims for related services. The Act provides for the payment of physician's accounts in accordance with the payment schedule and the assessment rules. The payment schedule does not alter the physician's entitlement to be compensated for providing an ECG or Holter test at precisely the same rate as other physicians. The provisions do not amount to a payment schedule but rather to an attempt to regulate his pattern of practice. They are the central feature of the payment regime. The appeal arises from a dispute between the appellant and the respondent, Government of Saskatchewan, over the payment for medical services provided by the appellant. The appellant believes the Government engaged in an unlawful and unprofessional practice. He believes the trial judge misinterpreted the wording of the Payment Schedule to mean the Government had no authority to ask for additional information before agreeing to pay an account. The trial judge concluded that the appellant's appeal was premature because he was not paid at trial. The Court of Appeal concluded that it was appropriate to look more deeply at the Schedule and that the cross-examination must be allowed.","Disposition: Appeal dismissed/Cross-appeal dismissed [1] This appeal arises from a dispute between the appellant, Dr. Carlos Huerto and the respondent, Government of Saskatchewan, over the payment for medical services provided by Dr. Huerto to his patients.

Both children were heavily involved in sporting activities and the father felt that since he was retired, he would be better able to ensure their attendance at various games and practices. The mother, who had recently commenced employment as a social worker, felt that the current interim arrangement was difficult for the children in that they would forget their school books at the other parent's residence and were sometimes left alone for extended periods at the father's residence.

Although the father was retired and might have more time to spend with the children, this did not outweigh all of the other factors.","The parties were married for 17 years. They separated in 2004. They have four children. The parties live in a three bedroom apartment in Lower Sackville approximately ten minutes from the children's school. The petitioner has been employed with the federal government, first with the Department of Transport and later with the Fisheries and Oceans. She obtained her Bachelor of Social Work degree in 1999. The respondent is a taxi driver. He also maintained a taxi license. The children live with their mother when they are not attending university. The father is 65 years old and retired. He drives a taxi. The two older children live in their apartment when they're not attending college. The husband drives a cab. The wife works part-time. The court has jurisdiction to make final disposition. The best interests of the children are determined by the parents. The test is broad. The Court has recognized that the variety of circumstances which may arise in disputes over custody and access is so diverse that predetermined rules, designed to resolve certain types of disputes in advance, may not be useful. The courts have been required to determine the children’s wishes. The evidence would suggest otherwise. The parents have been unable to agree on the ongoing custodial arrangements. The child’ s best interests and welfare of the child are best served by the father. The mother’d role in the parenting of the four children is so varied that predetermined rule, designed for a certain type of dispute in advance may not work. The fact that the parties have four young children is a significant factor in determining the best interests. The only thing that could be done differently would be to have the parties’ children live together for longer periods of time. The oldest child is only three years old. The youngest child is four years old, but is active in sports and soccer. The eldest child is eight years old; the youngest child, aged four, is eight. The relationship is rocky at times. The family has been forced to move from one residence to another. The son is only four years of age. The party has been unable or unwilling to cooperate with the court in resolving the issues of custody. The issues are the best interest and welfare. The law requires that all children have the best chance of success. The burden of proof is on the mother. The extent of the evidence is too great to be considered in a closed-door courtroom.","[44] After having considered section 16 of the Divorce Act and all of the evidence I have come to the conclusion that it would be in the best interests of the children to be in the custody and primary care of their mother. 2.

The defendant was well aware prior to the commencement of the action that the process used by the plaintiff was clearly a technology licensed to it by Bigquill. 3) The defendant is attempting to assert that it somehow has a proprietary interest in the scientific principles known as ion exchange and crystallization. The fact that the defendant developed its own system from scratch with the assistance of third parties and not Big Quills demonstrates that it was not the only source for such technology. 4) The applicant is also seeking an interlocutory injunction to restrain and prohibit the defendant from producing or marketing any potassium-spiculate produced at its plant. 5) Costs of this application.  6) The court reviewed the Affidavit sworn June 29, 2000 in relation to the within application and make the following comments: 1. The applicant has been the President and Director and Shareholder of the defendant for the past 3 years. The plaintiff has not paid any funds whatsoever to the defendant under the terms of the Technology License Agreement and/or the exclusive marketing agreement and as result thereof, the within litigation was commenced in February, 1998. 7) In addition to the Confidentiality Agreement, the defendant has not been able to establish prima facie case that the ion-exchange technology licensed by BigQuill is the technology used to produce potassium- sulphate. The court is also required to pay the fee specified in the Act. 8) The Court is required to determine whether the plaintiff has a contractual or other relationship with the defendant and whether the parties involved in the action have a contractual relationship. 9) The facts of the matter are set out in Exhibit A of the affidavit.","[1] The applicant Big Quill Resources Inc., by way of notice of motion, seeks the following relief:

None support the proposition that proposed representative plaintiff is immune from cross-examination in respect of his or her individual claim.

The application for leave to cross-examine is granted.","The defendant applied for leave to cross-examine the plaintiff on his affidavit. The plaintiff claimed that Paxil was ineffective and harmful to persons under 18. The defendant argued that the common issues being considered for certification were irrelevant and inconsistent with the plaintiff's personal expectations and motivation. The cross-examination was permitted on the basis that the plaintiff had not paid for the Paxil and that there was no need for clarification through cross- examination. The application for leave was granted. The court reviewed the relevant factors and found that cross-and-examination would assist in applying the criterion set out in ss. 6 and 6.1 of the Class Actions Act. The Court reviewed the common issue of whether Paxil is harmful to children and adolescents under 18 and whether it increased their risks of suicide attempts or self-harm. The defendants' request to cross examine the plaintiff was granted on the grounds that the plaintiffs' affidavit contained the following statements concerning their proposed role as representative plaintiff: 1) the plaintiff claimed to be the only representative plaintiff for the class; 2) the defendant's application for cross--examination of the plaintiff asserted that the applicant had no wish to act as representative as he had no understanding of the requisite duties and responsibilities, or no knowledge and experience in the litigation process; and 3) the court reviewed whether cross-applications were permitted on affidavits filed in support of class action certification motions. The common issues were carefully confined to whether Paxul was an ineffective treatment for persons under the age of 18 and if the plaintiff is liable to account to any of the class members on restitutionary basis for any part of the proceeds of the sales of Paxil. The issues to be resolved on certification application are complex and trial of an issue is not practical alternative where there is conflict in the evidence. However, the desirability of providing, on the certification motion, as a complete picture as possible of the proposed action, including the scope of the issues, has generally been viewed by the courts as helpful in determining whether class action proceeding is the preferable procedure.

When there is a limitation on their duties it is clearly stated. The Police Act does not mention any exclusivity between one force and another.

There was no breach of the accused's rights under the Charter.","The accused was charged with operating a motor vehicle while impaired contrary to s. 255(1) and s. 253(a) of the Criminal Code and with failing to display on licence plates current and valid validation stickers issued to that person pursuant to the Vehicle Administration Act with respect to the registration of a marked police vehicle.

He asked the driver why he had not stopped and asked for the city police. When the officer asked him why he could not act because he was within the jurisdiction of city police, the accused answered that he was in the municipality.

The language used by parliament was clear, broad and unambiguous as it was their obvious intention to create a police force that operates without jurisdictional barriers throughout the entire country. There is no good public policy reason for the police to be excluded from operating in any specific geographic area.

The court found that the officer was acting within his jurisdiction and had jurisdiction to make the demand. However, given the ultra vires statute construction doctrine, it would not be appropriate for provincial legislation to take away powers given by Federal legislation. 3) In reviewing the scheme and object of the police force it was clear that section and section of the Act operate to render the police officers part of 'police force for Canada' and peace officers 'for every part of Canada' with 'all the powers, authority, protection and privileges that a peace officer has by law. There was nothing in the scheme or object of The RCMP Act that derogates from that basic presumption.

There is nothing in the scheme or object of The Royal Canadian RCMP Act that derogates that basic presumption. The words 'are assigned' refer to something specific, rather than the three objects and not to specific areas of jurisdiction where Royal Canadian police officers are employed within the province.

ABank asserted a debt claim against the defendants. The defendants applied pursuant to s. 8 of The Enforcement of Money Judgments Act (EMJA) to terminate the preservation order, which prohibited any dealings with 850,000 shares, or alternatively they sought an order reducing the number of shares subject to the order and requiring the plaintiff to post $3 million as security pursuant to s. 5(7) of the EMJA and $40,000 security for costs. Regarding ABank’s application, it argued that its claim in debt against the defendant arose out of the same transaction based on the allegation that Arslan transferred the shares to a trust (the other defendant was the trustee) in June 2013, the time at which he stopped paying his debts in full and thus denied it the opportunity to collect its debt. ABank sought the same relief as Sekerbank: judgment against both defendants under The Fraudulent Preferences Act and The Fraudulent Conveyances Act. The defendants argued that the limitation period that applied to ABank’s claim had expired and the application should be denied. Regarding the defendants’ application, they argued that the plaintiff’s strategy in the Saskatchewan action was to await the outcome of the proceedings they had initiated in Turkey against the plaintiff. The Saskatchewan action was independent from the Turkish action, and the plaintiff’s approach was unacceptable in the circumstances of the preservation order made against them in 2014. The plaintiff had not prosecuted its actions against them without delay as required by s. 5(c) of the EMJA. The defendants asserted that the share prices increased since 2014 and were now worth $18 million more than the plaintiff’s claim. If the preservation was not terminated, they requested that the number of shares be reduced to 100,000. HELD: The proposed plaintiff’s application was granted. The defendants’ application to terminate the preservation order or to reduce the number of shares subject to the order was dismissed. The court ordered the plaintiff to post $1 million as security under the EMJA and an additional $40,000 as security for costs. The court found that although the limitation period had expired, it would add ABank as a plaintiff and amend the statement of claim pursuant to s. 20 of The Limitations Act, because to do so would not create a wholly new proceeding and the defendants had not provided evidence that they would suffer prejudice. The preservation order was not terminated after the court reviewed the history of the proceedings in both Saskatchewan and Turkey and found that the plaintiff had not failed to prosecute its action without delay. The court found that there was insufficient evidence to justify the reduction in the number of shares subject to the order.  The information of the value of the security fell short of demonstrating a sufficient change in circumstances, especially in light of the addition of ABank’s claim. The court found that the order should be modified under s. 5(7) of the EMJA to have the plaintiff provide security because there was evidence that the trust may have suffered and could suffer losses in the future as a result of the order. The order for security for costs was justified based on the considerations specified in Queen’s Bench rule 4-24.","The defendants applied to terminate the preservation order pursuant to s. 5 of The Enforcement of Money Judgments Act. They sought an order reducing the number of shares subject to the order and requiring the plaintiff to post $3,081,463.14 as security pursuant to ss. 5(7) and s. 7(2) of the EMJA. The plaintiff had failed to prosecute the action. The defendants applied for an order to add the plaintiff as a plaintiff and to amend the Statement of Claim. HELD: 1)The preservation order was granted pursuant to the EMAA. The plaintiffs had applied to vary the number and amount of shares in the order. The application to add ABank was denied. 2)The court was satisfied that neither of the defendants would suffer actual prejudice as a result of the proposed amendments. The necessary prejudice has not been demonstrated. 3)The Court was also satisfied that the defendants had not engaged s. 20 of The Limitations Act.

For the reasons that follow, that application is denied. The application to add ABank as a plaintiff, and to amend the draft Amended Statement of Claim which has been filed, is granted. The plaintiff alleges that the defendant Hüseyin Arslan has defaulted on his obligation to pay the plaintiff $13,813,544.88 pursuant to certain guarantees.

Alternatifbank A.S. shall be added as a plaintiff, and the Statement of Claim may be amended in the manner specified in the draft filed.",0.4688524590163935,0.39348370927318294,"Civil Procedure – Queen’s Bench Rules, Rule 3-72, Rule 3-84Statutes – Interpretation – Enforcement of Money Judgments Act, Section 5, Section 8 The proposed plaintiff, Alternatifbank (Abank) applied pursuant to Queen’s Bench rules 3-72 and 3-84 to be added as a plaintiff to the action of the plaintiff, Sekerbank, against the defendants and to amend the statement of claim. ABank asserted a debt claim against the defendants. The defendants applied pursuant to s. 8 of The Enforcement of Money Judgments Act (EMJA) to terminate the preservation order, which prohibited any dealings with 850,000 shares, or alternatively they sought an order reducing the number of shares subject to the order and requiring the plaintiff to post $3 million as security pursuant to s. 5(7) of the EMJA and $40,000 security for costs. Regarding ABank’s application, it argued that its claim in debt against the defendant arose out of the same transaction based on the allegation that Arslan transferred the shares to a trust (the other defendant was the trustee) in June 2013, the time at which he stopped paying his debts in full and thus denied it the opportunity to collect its debt. ABank sought the same relief as Sekerbank: judgment against both defendants under The Fraudulent Preferences Act and The Fraudulent Conveyances Act. The defendants argued that the limitation period that applied to ABank’s claim had expired and the application should be denied. Regarding the defendants’ application, they argued that the plaintiff’s strategy in the Saskatchewan action was to await the outcome of the proceedings they had initiated in Turkey against the plaintiff. The Saskatchewan action was independent from the Turkish action, and the plaintiff’s approach was unacceptable in the circumstances of the preservation order made against them in 2014. The plaintiff had not prosecuted its actions against them without delay as required by s. 5(c) of the EMJA. The defendants asserted that the share prices increased since 2014 and were now worth $18 million more than the plaintiff’s claim. If the preservation was not terminated, they requested that the number of shares be reduced to 100,000. HELD: The proposed plaintiff’s application was granted. The defendants’ application to terminate the preservation order or to reduce the number of shares subject to the order was dismissed. The court ordered the plaintiff to post $1 million as security under the EMJA and an additional $40,000 as security for costs. The court found that although the limitation period had expired, it would add ABank as a plaintiff and amend the statement of claim pursuant to s. 20 of The Limitations Act, because to do so would not create a wholly new proceeding and the defendants had not provided evidence that they would suffer prejudice. The preservation order was not terminated after the court reviewed the history of the proceedings in both Saskatchewan and Turkey and found that the plaintiff had not failed to prosecute its action without delay. The court found that there was insufficient evidence to justify the reduction in the number of shares subject to the order.  The information of the value of the security fell short of demonstrating a sufficient change in circumstances, especially in light of the addition of ABank’s claim. The court found that the order should be modified under s. 5(7) of the EMJA to have the plaintiff provide security because there was evidence that the trust may have suffered and could suffer losses in the future as a result of the order. The order for security for costs was justified based on the considerations specified in Queen’s Bench rule 4-24.","The defendants applied to terminate the preservation order pursuant to s. 5 of The Enforcement of Money Judgments Act. They sought an order reducing the number of shares subject to the order and requiring the plaintiff to post $3,081,463.14 as security pursuant to ss. 5(7) and s. 7(2) of the EMJA and $40,000 security for costs. HELD: The application was denied. 1)Absent a delay of more than three years from the time the plaintiff knew it had cause of action, the necessary prejudice has not been demonstrated. 2)The addition of ABank as a plaintiff and amending the Statement of Claim in the manner proposed would not create a wholly new proceeding.  3)The plaintiff has chosen to await the outcome of the Turkish Proceedings before taking any steps to advance this action. It is their position that this action is 'totally independent' from the Turkish National Bank and that even if there is'some logic in securing the Turkish judgment before dealing with enforcement, that approach became unacceptable once preservation order with the impact of the Order was in place.","[1] On January 9, 2014, a preservation order was granted in this action [Order], pursuant to s. 5 of The Enforcement of Money Judgments Act, SS 2010, c E-9.22 [EMJA]. The Order prohibited any dealings with 850,000 shares of Alliance Green Traders Inc. [AGT], pending a final decision on the merits of the plaintiff’s claims against the defendant Hṻseyin Arslan in Turkey, and the conclusion of this action. The following applications are now before me: 2. On March 8, 2016, the plaintiff Ṣekerbank T.A.S. [Ṣekerbank] and Alternatifbank A.S. [ABank], a second Turkish bank which asserts a debt claim against Mr. Arslan, applied pursuant to Rules 3-72 and 3-84 of The Queen’s Bench Rules for an order that ABank be added as a plaintiff, and to amend the Statement of Claim. For the reasons that follow, that application is denied. The application to add ABank as a plaintiff, and to amend the draft Amended Statement of Claim which has been filed, is granted. The plaintiff alleges that the defendant Hüseyin Arslan has defaulted on his obligation to pay the plaintiff $13,813,544.88 pursuant to certain guarantees. The addition of ABank as a plaintiff, and amending the Statement of Claim in the manner proposed, would not create a wholly new proceeding. [27] In the result, the two conditions specified in ss. 20(a) and (b) exist. [46] For these reasons, the application to terminate the Order is dismissed. [52] The defendants’ evidence as to the value of the security also falls short of demonstrating a sufficient change in circumstances. There is accordingly insufficient evidence to conclude that the plaintiff’s claim, including interest and costs, would be secured for the necessary period and to the extent contemplated by this consent Order, by a lesser number of shares. CONCLUSION [65] For the foregoing reasons, it is ordered as follows: 1. The defendants’ application to terminate the preservation order dated January 9, 2014, as amended by the order dated October 30, 2014 [Order], is dismissed. 2. The Order shall be amended to provide that Ṣekerbank shall provide security in the amount of $1 million within 30 days of the date of this order, in a form to be agreed by the parties, and failing such agreement, in a form determined by this Court on further application by any party. 4. Alternatifbank A.S. shall be added as a plaintiff, and the Statement of Claim may be amended in the manner specified in the draft filed.",0.42088091353996737,0.3620474406991261,"The defendants applied to terminate the preservation order pursuant to s. 5 of The Enforcement of Money Judgments Act (EMJA).

d_2013skqb394.txt,"HELD: The Court held that the replacement of former Queen’s Bench rule 212 requiring the production of documents “relating” to any matter in question and rule 222 permitting examination for discovery “touching” the matter in issue in the action by new rules 5-6, 5-18 and 5-25, which use the phrase: “relevant to any matter in issue”, showed the intention that the broad relevance test was no longer applicable. The test under the new Rules was whether the matter qualifies as being material to the action based upon the matter as pled and whether the evidence tends to prove or disprove the matter in issue. This inquiry must be balanced against the notion of proportionality set out in the foundational rules. The Court dismissed the application, excepting the requested order under 3) wherein the defendant would fulfill its undertaking to have certain employees provide responses. With respect to the rest of the relief requested under 1), which involved the undertaking that the defendant would search its records regarding the loading of railcars, the Court held that the as matter was not an issue in the action, based upon a review of the claim as pled. Having regard to proportionality under the new rules, the defendant should not be required to answer the question in light of the effort and expense required versus the possible benefits. The Court held that the plaintiffs were not entitled to ask the defendants to review a binder containing hundreds of pages of invoices assembled by the plaintiff regarding its expenditures incurred as a result of the derailment in order for it to advise the plaintiff which invoices the defendant believed were not related to it. It was the plaintiff’s burden to prove its damages and the defendant was not required to assist the plaintiff to do so. The plaintiff’s requested undertaking for the defendant to provide any background documents and information that went into the preparation of sketch of the railcar in question by the defendant’s adjuster was also denied. The adjuster’s file was subject to litigation privilege and unless it was tendered as evidence at trial, there was no implied waiver of that privilege. Regarding the plaintiff’s request in 2), the Court agreed with the defendants that that plaintiff’s request that the defendant answer questions now, rather than after it had completed questioning of the plaintiff, was premature. The defendant had not yet taken a position on the cause of the derailment and they would advise the plaintiff when they had developed one. Rule 5-31 makes it an ongoing obligation to correct answers and there was no evidence in this application that the rules had not been complied with. The Court awarded costs in the amount of $1,500 to the defendants due to the complexity of the application, requiring the submission of briefs of law and the amount of time taken to argue them matters in Chambers.","FIAT: The plaintiff asks the defendants to answer certain questions. The plaintiff argues that the defendants failed to properly block, brace and/or secure the steel coils within the railcar, which permitted the coils to move and cause the derailment. The defendants say the plaintiff should not be required to provide answers to questions that the plaintiff has refused to answer. HELD: The court found that the questions were not within the proper scope of questioning. The court ordered the plaintiff to provide the necessary responses. The applicant's refusal to provide a response to a request for an undertaking was justified. The Court found that it was not required to assist the plaintiff in this application. The applicants' failure to provide proper responses was justified and the court ordered them to provide their responses. 1)The plaintiff's burden to prove its damages is ultimately a plaintiff's. 2)The court found the plaintiff's obligation to answer questions related to the plaintiff is not limited to the amount of time it has spent on the discovery of the plaintiff. 3)The applicant's failure to answer the undertakings was justified because it was a plaintiff’s burden to establish its damages and a defendant was not obliged to assist. 4)The Court found the applicant’ s position that matters relating to railcars previously loaded by the plaintiff were not an issue. The Crown’d request was dismissed. 5)The Crown”s position was that the applicant was acting in breach of its obligations under Queen’S Bench Rule 7. 6. The Queen”d rule was amended to provide that the production obligation is to “disclose all documents relevant to any matter in the action” and that the questioning obligation is about information or documents relevant thereto. The order was made in the context of the former Queen“s Bench Rules. 6)The application was dismissed on the basis that the Crown“determined that matters related to railcar previously loaded were not in the proper jurisdiction. The application was made within the scope of the Crown. The claim was dismissed based upon the Crown having made no proper representations to the court. The issue was whether production by the applicant of document in respect of which it could have claimed litigation privilege waives any claim of such privilege as regards background information to the document. The Act was amended in light of the Supreme Court” s decision in Blank v. Canada. 7)The Queen‘s Bench Rule was amended and the Crown was ordered to provide responses to questions. 8)The respondent’ll be ordered","[18] I am satisfied that when this Court moved from the words of touching and relating to any matter in issue, it intended to move away from the broad relevance test that existed under the former Queen’s Bench Rules. Based on a review of the claim as pled, matters relating to railcars previously loaded by Clarke are not an issue in the action. I am also of the opinion that for proportionality reasons Clarke should not be required to answer the question. [31] The requested undertakings 32 and 33 are to review a binder containing several hundred pages of invoices and other documents assembled by CN that it says are expenditures incurred as a result of the derailment, and to advise which invoices Clarke says are not related to the derailment or which Clarke is currently aware do not relate to the derailment. I find Clarke’s refusal to accept this requested undertaking to be appropriate. However, it is ultimately a plaintiff’s burden to prove its damages, and a defendant is not required to assist plaintiffs to do so. [36] It is clear that the insurance adjuster’s file would be subject to a litigation privilege. Unless and until the sketch is tendered as evidence at trial, I am of the opinion that there is no implied waiver of the litigation privilege that otherwise attaches to the foundational information leading to the preparation of this sketch. But, for the present and in the context of pre-trial questioning, I conclude that Clarke’s refusal to provide a response to requested undertaking 38 was appropriate. [45] Prior to undertaking 28 being taken under advisement, Clarke, through its counsel, advised in respect of undertaking 28 that they did not have a position on what caused the derailment and if they developed a position they would advise. [49] I agree with the position taken by counsel for CN that:

i. Undertaking 34 calls for Mr. Swainson himself to say what he meant or did, as opposed to Mr. Thompson saying what Mr. Swainson meant or did; and that

ii. Undertaking 35 calls for Clarke to make inquiries of Thompson and Swainson and to advise what their personal responses to the questions were. Accordingly, I order Clarke to provide proper responses to CN. [50] In light of the foregoing order that Clarke shall within 10 days of this order provide proper responses to undertakings 34 and 35.

The Court held that the plaintiffs were not entitled to ask the defendants to review a binder containing hundreds of pages of invoices assembled by the plaintiff regarding its expenditures incurred as a result of the derailment in order for it to advise the plaintiff which invoices the defendant believed were not related to it. It was the plaintiff’s burden to prove its damages and the defendant was not required to assist the plaintiff to do so. The plaintiff’s requested undertaking for the defendant to provide any background documents and information that went into the preparation of sketch of the railcar in question by the defendant’s adjuster was also denied. The adjuster’s file was subject to litigation privilege and unless it was tendered as evidence at trial, there was no implied waiver of that privilege. Regarding the plaintiff’s request in 2), the Court agreed with the defendants that that plaintiff’s request that the defendant answer questions now, rather than after it had completed questioning of the plaintiff, was premature. The defendant had not yet taken a position on the cause of the derailment and they would advise the plaintiff when they had developed one. Rule 5-31 makes it an ongoing obligation to correct answers and there was no evidence in this application that the rules had not been complied with. The Court awarded costs in the amount of $1,500 to the defendants due to the complexity of the application, requiring the submission of briefs of law and the amount of time taken to argue them matters in Chambers.","FIAT: The plaintiff asks the court to order the defendants to answer certain questions and provide answers to questions that the plaintiff says are best left to be answered on completion of their discovery of the plaintiff. The plaintiff argues that the defendants failed to properly block, brace and/or secure the steel coils within the railcar, which permitted the coils to move and cause the derailment. The defendants deny negligence or breach of contract, but say they are waiving any claim of privilege as regards background information to the document. HELD: 1) The court found that when the plaintiff moved from the words of touching and relating to any matter in issue, it intended to move away from the broad relevance test that existed under the former Queen's Bench Rules. 2) It is clear that the insurance adjuster's file would be subject to a litigation privilege. 3) The plaintiff is not obliged to answer questions that are relevant to the plaintiff's damages. 4) The Court found that the applicant's refusal to provide answers was justified. 5) It was ultimately a plaintiff's burden to prove its damages and a defendant is not required to assist the plaintiff to do so. 6) The applicant's failure to provide proper responses to questions related to its position on what caused the train derailment is justified. 7) The application raises interesting issues with respect to the proper scope of questioning or examination for discovery. It is entirely appropriate for the Court to decide whether to accommodate the applicant.  8) The issue is whether production by Clarke of document in respect of which it could have claimed litigation privilege waives any claim to such privilege. The Court is also of the opinion that for proportionality reasons Clarke should not be required to answer the questions. 9) The applicants' refusal to answer any of the undertakings raised issues relating to the Proper scope of production and questioning under the Queen's' Bench Rules, absent the emphasis now in the foundational rules on the quickest means of resolving claims at the least expense. 10) The applications raise questions regarding the scope of CN's claim and whether the company's counsel advised CN that they did not have a position on the cause of the derailments and if they developed a position they would advise. CN argues that this is irrelevant since it was waiving its claim of a privilege in respect to documents loaded by Clarke. The history of some 445 cars previously loaded by the applicant is not pled as an issue in the action.  11) The respondents' records show they were not balanced and thus the topic is irrelevant to the allegation of negligence.","[18] I am satisfied that when this Court moved from the words of touching and relating to any matter in issue, it intended to move away from the broad relevance test that existed under the former Queen’s Bench Rules.

The third meeting, held in late November, was to discuss two versions of the Collaborative Law process. The first version included paragraphs 13.1, 13.2 and all of paragraph 13.5. The final version included the withdrawal of counsel specifically. 6) At the January meeting, the lawyer who had been retained by the petitioner did not withdraw as counsel. At the second meeting in January 2006, the petitioner decided to sign the version that did not disqualify counsel from continuing to act if the matter went to court. The last meeting was in early December 2006. The meeting was adjourned to allow time for the parties to meet. 7) The second version included a provision that would allow the lawyers to withdraw if matters proceeded to court and the final version allowed the petitioner to keep her lawyers if she chose to. 8) The court reviewed the minutes of the meeting. The minutes were prepared by the parties and were not reviewed by the applicant. The court found that both lawyers would withdraw as set out in par. 13.","[1] Michael Therrien brings an application for a court order requiring Reginald Sauer to withdraw as solicitor for Nadine Therrien.

6_2011nssc48.txt,"The two plaintiffs were forced to jump from the window of their third-floor apartment after a fire erupted in the building. The fire alarm system was not functioning and, despite being aware of previous problems with the 25-year-old system, the defendant had never maintained or inspected it; the self-closing hallway fire doors were continually in an open position; the battery-operated fire alarm in the plaintiffs' apartment was not functioning; and the plaintiffs were unaware of whether their smoke detector was wired into the building or was their responsibility. The male plaintiff suffered serious fractures to both ankles and a fractured fibula. He underwent four surgeries, was non-weight bearing for three months and was unable to run or engage in various sports. Although he had returned to work as a production worker, his condition would continue to deteriorate due to post-traumatic arthritis, most likely resulting in a future ankle fusion. The female plaintiff suffered a pelvic ring injury with bilateral pelvic and sacral fractures, a fractured elbow and a broken rib. She underwent surgery on her pelvis, was unable to look after her own hygiene for five months and developed bursitis in the hip. She continued to experience pain in the tailbone with extensive sitting and in the elbow with extension of the arm, had a permanent loss of elbow extension and walked with a limp. The worsening of her pre-existing anxiety and depression led to the diagnosis of post-traumatic stress disorder. The landlord argued that the plaintiffs' injuries had not been caused by any of its actions. Male plaintiff awarded the sum of $75,000 for general damages, $15,000 for past and future loss of valuable services and $45,000 for loss of earning capacity; female plaintiff awarded the sum of $55,000 for general damages, $35,000 for past and future loss of valuable services and $75,000 for future loss of income. Although there was no evidence that the defendant was responsible for the fire, its conduct created an unreasonable risk of harm in the event of a fire. Without evidence as to how much time the plaintiffs would have had to escape down the stairwell or how long they would have had to wait for the fire department had the smoke or fire alarms activated, the 'material contribution' test was applied to the causation issue. When the plaintiffs first awoke, the fire had already worked its way up through the attic hatch to the roof, where the flames in the eaves were visible to the plaintiffs. Smoke and fire were able to flow freely through the adjacent stairwell as a result of the fire door being left open, and the failure of the smoke detectors and fire alarms allowed the smoke and fire to progress before being detected by the plaintiffs. The female plaintiff was found to have no meaningful residual earning capacity due to the combination of her physical and psychological injuries.",The plaintiff and her tenant escaped a three-storey apartment building fire by jumping from the top floor. The plaintiff's apartment was located on the third floor. It was a wooden structure with vinyl siding on the exterior and asphalt roof. The ceiling was blackened and the fire alarm system was not functioning at the time of the fire. The tenant was uninformed as to whether the smoke detector formed part of the Fire Department's fire alarm systems or was self-contained and the tenant was not advised by the fire superintendent that the doors on the three floors were continuously left in an open position. The battery operated smoke alarm in the plaintiff's building did not operate at the scene of the incident. The fire alarm was not working at the apartment building. The tenants were uninformed and unaware that the smoke detectors formed part the fire alarms system or was not contained and the tenants were not advised. The smoke detector was not functional at the incident and the plaintiff was uninjured.,"[37] Although there is no evidence the defendant was responsible for the fire, I find the defendant’s conduct created an unreasonable risk of harm in the event of a fire. There were problems with the fire alarm system not functioning prior to the fire which was known to the defendant’s supervisor; the defendant did not maintain, test, or inspect at all, its fire alarm system that was in excess of 25 years old at the time of the fire; the self-closing hallway “fire doors” on the third floor were continually in an open position and the north hallway door adjacent to the plaintiff’s apartment, which was open at the time of the fire, had a broken self-closing latch at the time of the fire; the battery operated smoke alarm in the plaintiff’s apartment did not function at the time of the fire. Smoke and fire were able to freely flow to the north stairwell as a result of the fire door being open at the time. [63] Under the circumstances of this case, I award general damages in the amount of $75,000.00. [72] Recognizing that in cases of this nature valuation of impairment of earning capacity is somewhat speculative, I award the sum of $45,000.00. Recognizing that his capacity to perform pre-accident duties at home will be impaired to a limited extent, I will allow the sum of $15,000.00 for past and future loss of valuable services. [96] I assess Ms. Leslie’s general damages in the amount of $55,000.00. [103] Based on the evidence I find Ms. Leslie has no meaningful residual earning capacity.

The court found that the officer did not have reasonable and probable grounds for making the breathalyzer demand and the evidence did not support a subjective honest belief on the part of the police officer that the ability of the accused to operate a motor vehicle was impaired by alcohol. The breath sample evidence was obtained as a consequence of the breach of s. 8 and 9 Charter Rights of the complainant. The officers' evidence was insufficient not to support impairment as a prerequisite to the breath request. The Court concluded that the evidence does not support an honest honest belief that the accused was impaired. The Evidence of the Officer was excluded under s. 24(2) of the Criminal Code. The Crown did not establish that the breath sample was obtained in a consequence the breach and the officer's failure to have reasonable, probable grounds to justify a breath request could not alone prove impaired driving beyond a reasonable doubt. The trial process was unfair and bring the administration of justice into disrepute. The defence argued that the certificate of analyses should not be admissible because the breathalyszer demand was not made forthwith or as soon as practicable. The offence was unlawfully detained and the accused's rights under s9 of the Charter were breached. The police did not provide expert evidence to support the officer’s reasonable and likely grounds for the breath-demand. The issue was whether the officer had reasonable and reasonable grounds to make the breath offer. The respondent was found to be in breach of the s.8 and s.9 Charter rights. The failure of the RCMP to provide breath samples for analysis could not be excluded under ss.8, 9 and s8. The appellant’ s.7 and s9 Charter Rights were breached and her rights under the Charter of Rights were violated. The Certificate of Analysis was excluded as there was insufficient evidence before the Court of the undertaking alleged in Counts 1 and 2.","Count #3 and further that on or about the 21st day of July, A.D. 2004 at North Battleford, in the Province of Saskatchewan did while her ability to operate a motor vehicle was impaired by alcohol or a drug, operate a motor vehicle contrary to Section 255(1) and Section 253(a) of the Criminal Code.

He then testified that he told one of the officers that he intended to continue his search for Mr. Black. The Appeal Court held: The Crown must be satisfied on the evidence that do accept the guilt of the accused beyond reasonable doubt in order to convict. The accused was convicted of both counts. The Criminal Code speaks to the monetary penalty for contraventions of the act or Regulations. The offence of trafficking in wildlife is a serious one. The defendant was convicted on both counts and the court was not satisfied on either count. The sentence of forfeiture was reduced to a fine of $22,000. The conviction was not subject to forfeiture.","[1] Mr. Kenny is charged under The Wildlife Act Regulations, 1981 with use of a searchlight when hunting.

The court was satisfied that the Crown must be satisfied on the evidence that do accept the guilt of the accused. The defendant was found not guilty of the following offences: 1)Having gone through that analysis and for the reasons that follow, the evidence does not support the evidence. The accused was not found guilty of any of the offences listed in the Act or Regulations. The offence was committed under section 79(1)(a) of the Wildlife Act. 2) The Court was not convinced that the evidence was the only one that was made up after the fact to fit what is a very suspicious set of circumstances. The trial proceeded on the basis of an Agreed Statement of Facts filed as Exhibit P-1 and the production of five other exhibits. The evidence was found to be consistent only with an inescapable inference that Mr. Kenny was employing the search for wildlife for purposes that were not covered by the Act. 3) On all the evidence it is not reasonable to believe the defendant, having gone through the stages of searching for wildlife, that he happened to run into the wife in Prince Albert (Mr. Kenny also being resident of English River First Nation, as is Mr. Loewen), that he would mention to her that he was going into the forest to pick up his son and nephew, and that this woman would then ask him to look for her husband, who happened to also be in the same forest hunting. 4) The evidence is consistent with the Crown's conclusion that the search was carried out in the direction of hunting at night with the aid of a flashlight. 5) The court found that the only thing that could reasonably be considered a 'hunting' offence was the presence of two loaded firearms in the vehicle.","[1] Mr. Kenny is charged under The Wildlife Act Regulations, 1981 with use of a searchlight when hunting.

It was at the time that he was apprehended in the 'peak of the moose rut' and he was driving slowly on roads that were in prime hunting area when he was stopped by the SERM officers. The defendant had a million candle spotlight in his vehicle and he admitted to using it. The vehicle was under surveillance for approximately 30 minutes. The court was satisfied that the evidence was not supported by the Crown's argument that the driver was looking for a moose and that the vehicle was being used to search for the same person. On the evidence that the Crown did not accept the guilt of the accused beyond reasonable doubt, the court held that the Court believed the evidence.

Following the purchase of the property, the claimant had commenced renovations and discovered extensive mould or rot throughout the basement, to such an extent that the entire basement had to be gutted, disinfected and rebuilt. She also claimed that a buried cistern was discovered in the backyard, which had been partly filled with earth but still filled up with rainwater and melted snow, and that the water had nowhere else to go but against the foundation. When the defendants brought a motion for non-suit at the conclusion of her case, the unrepresented claimant expressed surprise and dismay that her case could be dismissed before both sides had testified as she expected her remaining evidence to come out through the defendants' testimony.

The claimant alleged the disclosure statement disclosed a history of repeated flooding. The defendant argued that the plaintiff had not disclosed that the property had flooded on at least one occasion. HELD: The motion for non-suit was dismissed. The court found that the claimant's evidence was not sufficiently advanced to support its conclusion that the respondent had breached his contract. The Court found that there was insufficient evidence to establish that the defendant had breached its obligation to disclose the history of the property. The plaintiffs' evidence was insufficient to establish a prima facie case for the claim. The test for nonsuit was set out in the Small Claims Court. The judge found that he could not find any evidence that the parties had breached their contract by misrepresenting the property's condition. The only evidence that could be drawn from the evidence was that the appellant had not been properly instructed to disclose her knowledge of the present state of the premises. The respondent's evidence did not show that the premises had flooded. The failure of the respondent to disclose this information was a serious issue. The trial judge must consider the sufficiency of evidence without weighing the evidence or evaluating its believability. The evidence is not sufficient to establish the respondent's primafacie case. The parties have a duty to protect their reputation and the reputation of the plaintiff. The public disclosure of the facts is not a defence. The facts are not the same as the law.

The Crown sought to admit into evidence a number of statements that were made by the deceased to several crown witnesses concerning two previous incidents she had with the accused in the weeks prior to her death. In the first incident, the accused is alleged to have choked the victim after he confronted her about where she had been. In the second incident the accused confronted the victim and beat and choked her and then sexually assaulted and threatened to kill her. The Crown seeks to admit this similar fact evidence and several hearsay statements to prove the issues of motive, intent and modus operandi. HELD: The statements by the deceased are not admissible. The prejudicial nature of the similar fact evidence has not been overcome by its probative value. It is well established law that similar acts and other discreditable conduct evidence is presumptively inadmissible and that similar fact evidence is the exception to this. To determine its admissibility, three things need examination, 1) the probative weight of the evidence, 2) the assessment of the prejudice and 3) the weighing of the probative value versus prejudicial value. In examining the probative weight of the evidence, factors to be considered include the issues in question, the presence or absence of collusion, similarities and dissimilarities between the facts charged and the similar fact evidence and the strength of the evidence that the events occurred. The two previous incidents are extremely prejudicial in nature leading to potential moral prejudice. That is, reprehensible nature of the assaults could lead the jury to rely on the prohibited inference that the accused is the type of person who could have committed the crime. There is also a great risk of reasoning prejudice. That is, admitting the similar fact evidence may distract the jury from their proper focus which is the second degree murder charge. There is a possibility that the jury will equate the intention to harm with the mens rea required for a murder conviction. With respect to the hearsay evidence, the Court held that statements made by the deceased to her friends, family and colleagues concerning the threats and assaults will not be admitted. The test of necessity is clearly met by the fact that the person making the statements in now deceased and not able to testify. However, the Court was concerned about the reliability of the statements since there is nothing that would serve as convincing indicia of reliability adequate to offset the absence of an oath.","The Crown sought to admit the two previous incidents of choking as similar fact evidence to prove issues of motive, intent and modus operandi. The accused was found guilty of both charges. The Crown sought the admission of the two prior incidents of choked as similar facts evidence to show issues of intent and a modus Operandi. HELD: The Crown was to admit both the first and the second incidents of the choking as identical fact evidence. The prejudicial nature of the similar fact information was not overcome by its probative value and it should not be admitted in order to ensure the possibility of a fair trial. The reprehensible nature of these brutal assaults, even in the absence of the sexual assault, could lead the jury to rely on the prohibited inference that the accused is the type of person who could have committed the crime.

The Crown tendered a number of statements that were made by the deceased to several Crown witnesses concerning two previous incidents. It is a well established principle in Canadian law that similar acts and other discreditable conduct evidence is presumptively inadmissible. There is a serious potential for moral prejudice.

The prejudicial nature of the similar fact evidence has not been overcome by its probative value and it should not be admitted in order to ensure the possibility of a fair trial. CONCLUSION [52] I am cognizant of the fact that the general exclusionary rule that similar fact evidence is presumptively inadmissible has been affirmed repeatedly and recognizes that the potential for prejudice distraction and time consumption associated with the evidence generally outweighs its probative value. Although a convincing argument may be made with respect to the reliability of the statements, I do have some concerns about this issue in all of the circumstances.

In the ordinary case of contributory negligence there is a logical division of costs that matches the allocation of fault. In each of those cases the offsetting negligence was negligence that contributed directly to the accident. The plaintiff has only served to limit the extent to which their losses due to injuries are compensable. The situation is not unlike the common case in which plaintiff succeeds on an issue of fault but fails to prove part of his claim.

In this case, the offsetting negligence was negligence that contributed directly to the accident.

The plaintiff brought an action under the Mechanics' Lien Act for unpaid monies, claiming damages not recovered in the first action and significant additional damages against the defendant. The defendant brought an application to strike the plaintiff's statement of claim and dismiss the action.

The issue before the court is whether the defendant is liable to pay Mr. Lawson's claim. 1) The defendant has not paid Mr. McKay's account for the work done. 2) There is enough evidence of significant problems for the court to conclude that the central purpose of the contract for installation was not achieved and that, therefore, there has been a breach. The central purpose is not achieved. The contract was not performed in a workmanlike manner. The contractor's failure to install drip capping, mitred corners, properly caulk, and lock in the soffitting, appears to be critical for proper drainage of water away from the garage. 3) The plaintiff's claim is dismissed. The cost of repair is reasonable. The Court ordered that Mr. Lawson be entitled to damages.","[1] The defendant, Vincent McKay, contracted with the plaintiff, George Lawson, for the supply and installation of eavestroughing, soffit and facia together with two downspouts, capping of three garage doors and capping of wooden trim, all to be installed on a new garage building located on Mr. McKay’s land.

It is sufficient for our purposes to note that the respondents depose that the intensive hog operation will contain 8,000 hogs in each barn at any one time, and that the operation will turn over hogs three times year (a total of approximately 56,000 hogs) and will produce up to 14.7 million gallons of liquid manure per year. It is noteworthy that the Department of Agriculture and Saskatchewan Environment and Resource Management were both of the opinion the KSS project was not a development as defined in s. 2(d) by reason that it did not come within any of the criteria listed in s. 2(d) of the Act. The Environmental Assessment Branch of the Department of the Environment examined each of the criteria set forth in s. 2(d) and was satisfied that the project was not a development. [16] Therefore, in our opinion, this proposal is not a development as defined in s. 2(d) of The Environmental Assessment Act.

The respondents also requested an order for mandamus compelling KSS to conduct an environmental assessment of the development as required by s. 9 of the Act. KSS applied for intervenor status. The chambers judge granted the application without costs. The court reviewed the affidavits filed by the respondents and found that the proposal was not a development as defined in s2(d). HELD: The appeal was granted and the order of the court set aside without costs without regard to the facts. 1)The court found that KSS was not developing as defined by s2.d of the environmental assessment act. 2)It was noteworthy that the Department of Agriculture and Saskatchewan Environment and Resource Management were both of the opinion that the KSS project did not come within any of the criteria listed in the act. 3)The Environmental Assessment Branch examined each of the three criteria set forth in the Act and was satisfied that the project was not development. The environmental assessment was conducted after it had conducted a review of environmental concerns specific to the project and matters which are valid public concerns about potential livestock operation projects. The decision of the chambers judge that the proposed development is not development is therefore set aside.  4)The Court of Appeal held that the applicant was not acting in breach of Rule 319 of the Rules of Court.,0.6666666666666667

HELD: The documents were to be produced as part of the Minister's protection proceeding.  1)The Minister was to provide the respondent with access to all police investigations, probation, and correctional services records involving the parents in a situation where domestic abuse was an issue. 2)The documents sought were relevant because the Minister must review its case plan on a regular basis. Information from third parties may give the Minister an opportunity to reconsider its position and alter its expectations and plan. 3)The court was not asked to balance right claimed by parent but was adjudicating claim put forward by the State. The documents sought are relevant because they are confidential. The Minister has an obligation to investigate any and all information regarding child protection concerns. The court cannot describe any other fact or condition that places this child at risk other than those to which have already referred. The requests for production in this case would amount to a fishing expedition. The records are not relevant for this purpose. 4)The respondent considers these records irrelevant to the proceedings.","This information may be obtained by other means, by way of interrogatories or medical reports and therefore the Orders of Production in respect to these physicians are not granted.

The mother argued that the records sought were irrelevant and that if there was any relevance, they were privileged, were unnecessary to the fair disposition of the proceeding, and their production would not save costs and would be injurious to the public interest. The addiction prevention and treatment service, Nova Scotia Hospital and mental health clinic records and files are ordered to be produced; the medical records of the family physician, the hospital and the woman's shelter are not ordered to be produced as these files would contain some irrelevant information and the relevant information could be obtained by other means. In a child protection proceeding, documents may be relevant to prove a protection finding, to monitor compliance with existing orders, or to develop and evaluate a plan of care. Records held by individuals or organizations to whom an individual has been referred as a result of a child protection proceeding are not privileged as no confidentiality could be expected in those circumstances. Records held by individuals or organizations whose services were accessed independent of a court order or the Minister's involvement that would ordinarily attract privilege may be ordered to be produced in child protection proceedings. However, if the information contained in the records can be obtained by a means targeted specifically to produce the relevant information, then orders for production for all of the records will not be necessary to the fair disposition of the proceeding. Also, since such records contain irrelevant, as well as relevant material, such an order would violate the privacy protections found in the Charter and be injurious to the public interest.","The Minister sought 13 Orders of Production for records prepared by and in the possession of persons and organizations who had provided services to the Respondent. The Respondent consented to the grant of an order for the file and records of her treatment with E.F. her former counsellor.

They were irrelevant because they were confidential and did not support a particular fact or proposition.

The documents sought were relevant because the Minister must review its case plan on a regular basis.

She also asks that the Court determine the ongoing child support amount to be paid by the petitioner father. The Court questioned whether this application was more in the nature of a variation of the Gunn, J. order. It is clear that there has been a change since September 2008 with respect to the residency of one of the children.HELD: 1) The father's unusual 2008 taxation year has led to the parties taking very different positions as to how the father's income should be calculated. The father argues that it would be appropriate to average the father's income for 2006 to 2008. The mother argues that his income is the sum set out on line 150 of his tax return. She argues that his total income is the sum of $302,196 for the 2008 year. The father's argument is that the severance he received in 2008 should not be included in his income. It is well established that severance pay represents an acceleration of income that would have been paid over a period of months. It is also well established that income for the basis of calculating child support should be determined on the basis of severance pay plus whatever other earnings the payor may have. The severance is included as part of the father's income. 2) The capital gain which shows on the father's 2008 income tax return shall not be included in his 2008 income.

The gain does not reflect income actually received by the father and there will be no 'year to year' capital gains. See Andersen v. Andersen (1997), 32 R.F.L.

However, the mother would then be forced to pay back to the father the overpayment.

HELD: The appeal was dismissed with the exception of the payments under s.7(1)(f) which were set aside. 1)The applicant was not denied the right to lead evidence on any relevant issue. Although the judge made no reversible error the procedure followed was not approved of. The principles stated in Zaba v. Bradley were reaffirmed. 2)No reversible error was found in the finding the appellant did not have custody of or access to the children for enough time to bring him within s.9; that the appellant's income for purposes of the Guidelines should include the bonuses received from his employer; and that he did not have a business based in his home. 3)The judge erred in not addressing the question as to whether the expenses were extraordinary within the meaning of s.7(1)(f). The activities were ordinary given the income of the parents and fell within the table amount fixed under s.3(1)(a).  4)Each party was to bear his/her own costs.,"The appeal was from an order which varied a child maintenance order. The original order had been based on a written agreement between the parties entered into about a week before the Federal Child Support Guidelines came into effect. The judge thereupon decided not to allow evidence on all issues in dispute. She thought that evidence was required on only three issues. This decision gave rise to the first ground of appeal. The appellant argued that he was denied the right to lead evidence on any relevant issue. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. There was no reversible error in the judge's decision, supported by written reasons, that the appellant did not have custody of or access to the children for enough time to bring him within s. 9 of the Guidelines; the appellant's income, for the purposes of the guidelines, should include the bonuses he received from his employer in 1996 and 1997, and (c) Mr. Elliott had no business based in the home.

[2] The appeal was from an order which varied a child maintenance order. The original order had been based on a written agreement between the parties entered into about a week before the Federal Child Support Guidelines, SOR/97-175, came into effect. We can find no reversible error in the judge’s decision, explained in the reasons for judgment, to reject the appellant’s arguments respecting that issue. [5] Similarly, we can find no error in the judge’s decisions, supported by written reasons, that (a) the appellant did not have custody of or access to the children for enough time to bring him within s. 9 of the Guidelines; (b) the appellant’s income, for the purposes of the Guidelines, should include the bonuses he received from his employer in 1996 and 1997, and (c) Mr. Elliott did not have a business based in the home. Accordingly, the judge erred in requiring the appellant to pay a portion of them under s. 7(1)(f) in addition to the table amount fixed under s. 3(1)(a). [8] That portion of the judgment relating to payments under s. 7(1)(f) of the Guidelines is set aside.

5_2008nssc77.txt,"The claimant brought an action in the Small Claims Court to enforce a default judgment it had been granted against the defendant in Alberta for breach of contract. The claimant attempted to proceed in Nova Scotia on the basis of reciprocal enforcement under the common law or enforcement of the debt as a contract. The adjudicator dismissed the action, finding that the Small Claims Court did not have the authority to enforce an order arising from a foreign jurisdiction and that it could not proceed with the claim for breach of the agreement under the contract as there was no evidence that the Alberta action had been withdrawn, struck or transferred out. The adjudicator also found that the defendant had not attorned to the jurisdiction of the Alberta court. The claimant appealed. Appeal dismissed; although the adjudicator's interpretation of sec. 15 of the Act and his finding that the defendant had not attorned to the jurisdiction of the Alberta court when there was no evidence before him on that issue constituted errors in law, the present claim was beyond the scope of the Small Claims Court Act, given that the adjudicator would first be called upon to settle a dispute regarding the original court's jurisdiction, the locus of the original contract and a factual dispute concerning attornment.","This was an appeal from the Small Claims Court's decision to determine whether the Small Court had jurisdiction to hear the claim filed by the Claimants. The claim was reduced from the amount of its judgment to fall within the monetary limits established by the Small claims Court Act and in the alternative, enforcement of the Alberta judgment under the common law, and a factual dispute concerning attornment. The applicant appealed. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. 1)The Small Claims adjudicator erred in finding that Section 9 of the Act did not provide the Court with authority to enforce an Order arising from foreign jurisdiction. 2)The Adjudicator errated in finding the Alberta action was withdrawn, abandoned, struck out or transferred pursuant to Section 15 of the Small Claim Act. 3)The applicant did not attorn to the jurisdiction of the Saskatchewan Court. 4)The appellant did not have jurisdiction to settle a dispute regarding the original Court's jurisdiction, the locus of the original contract, and attornement. The appellant appealed. 5)The trial judge erred by finding that the Alberta Court did not possess jurisdiction to render the judgment. The Adjudicators interpretation of Section 15 represents an error in law. The court has concurrent jurisdiction with Small Claims Courts. The issue is whether Section 9 can be interpreted to include claims arising out of foreign judgments. 6)The court found the Adjudicicator errored in finding Section 9 did not grant the Court jurisdiction to enforce the Alberta order arising from Foreign jurisdiction. The Court does not have the jurisdiction in respect of claim where the issues in dispute are already before another court unless that proceeding is withdrawn, abandon, struck or transferred in accordance with the Small Act. The fact that default judgment may be set aside at some time in the future, as argued by the Respondent, does not make it any less final or conclusive. The Act does not provide a Court with the authority to enquire into an order arising out from foreign jurisdictions. The only evidence that the action was abandoned, abandoned or transferred is that there was no evidence 'that the Alberta Action was withdrawn or abandoned, quashed or transferred' pursuant to the Act. Rather than determine a claim based on a fixed amount, it is apparent an Adjudication, in a case of this nature, would be called upon first to settle the dispute regarding both the original court's jurisdiction and the locum of the Original contract and a serious dispute concerning the attornments.","[1] This is an appeal from the decision of the Small Claims Court Adjudicator wherein he determined that he lacked jurisdiction to hear the action filed by the Claimants.

The Young Person was unrepresented and he had no prior notice of the application. HELD: The application was allowed to continue pending a full hearing. The Provincial Director had yet to consider conditions of supervision in light of the latest decision to make a continuation of custody application. The Court was instructed to consider the following factors: 1) whether the young person is likely to commit a serious violent offence before the expiry of the youth sentence he is serving; 2) whether there are compelling reasons for keeping him in custody pending the hearing. There was no evidence in this regard.,0.6190476190476191

Although the DNA evidence established he had sexual intercourse with the complainant, neither had any memory of it due to their self-induced states of intoxication. Defences raised were consent, an honest but mistaken belief that she gave her consent, and extreme drunkenness such that he was so intoxicated that he was not in a conscious state and was incapable of forming any intent to have sexual intercourse without consent. HELD: The accused was found guilty.  1)Although the defence of 'extreme intoxication' is successful in the rarest of cases, the accused established the Daviault 'extreme intoxication' on a balance of probabilities. He would have been acquitted had it not been for s.33.1 which does away with this defence in sexual assault cases.  2)The court was satisfied on a balance of probabilities that his extreme level of self-induced intoxication rendered him incapable of making a conscious decision to have sexual intercourse with the complainant with or without her consent. The court was satisfied that the complainant had not done anything to suggest that she would consent. The accused was incapable of considering the issue of consent and accordingly did not have a mistaken belief or reasonable grounds for such a belief. It was clear from the testimony of an 11 year old that the intercourse took place long after the complainant passed out. She was incapable of giving consent after that time. Her assertion of lack of consent was inherently unreliable due to her lack of any memory of events that occurred before, during and after the alleged assault and would have been more in the nature of an assumption than a fact, but was found to be consistent with all the other evidence. It was not relevant that she may have withdrawn consent. 3)There was no evidence to give his second defence (that he honestly believed he had her consent) an air of reality. His assertion that she must have consented or he would not have done it was speculative assumption, not evidence. 4)Section 33.1 provides that the act of becoming voluntarily intoxicated to the extent of being incapable of controlling one's behaviour constitutes criminal culpability sufficient to found criminal liability for offences committed against the bodily integrity of others. The public outcry and Parliamentary response to Daviault strongly indicate that s.33.1 is not only consistent with the objectives of the Charter but is justifiable and essential in a free and democratic society. Of four recent cases that held Criminal Code s.33.1 violates the Charter, two held it was saved by s.1 while two held it was not saved by s.1 of the Charter. 5)Section 33.1(1) provides the lack of general intent or voluntariness is not a defence to an assault charge described in ss.(3)if it resulted from self-induced intoxication or the accused departed markedly from the standard of reasonable care generally recognized in Canadian society. The three sub-conditions described in ss.(2) concerning marked departure constitute criminal culpability similar to recklessness. Criminal culpability is not dependent on wilful intention to cause harm but on the wilful intention to engage in conduct that incurs the risk of harm without caring whether or not harm ensues. 6)The strong dissent in Daviault indicated those who render themselves incapable of knowing what they are doing through voluntary consumption of alcohol or drugs possess a sufficiently blameworthy state of mind that their imprisonment does not offend the principle of fundamental justice which prohibits the imprisonment of the innocent.

It is only by ending the custody of the accused by releasing him that the arrest is ended and the accused is 'un-arrested'. It was agreed that the officer had sufficient grounds to arrest the accused. The arrest being legally made, it follows that the arrest continued until it was legally ended by his release. The arrest continued throughout the search and seizure at the police station. The Court finds that his continued detention after the purported 'un-arrest' constituted a de facto arrest. 3) There is no evidence that the accused misunderstood his actual status or that he was prejudiced by the 'un-arrest'. The accused has not established that he was the subject of 'unreasonable search or seizure' resulting in the violation of his rights under the Charter.","The accused, through his counsel, gave notice that he would be making an application to the Court for a ruling that the accused's rights under the Charter had been infringed and seeking remedy for that infringement. At the trial, Crown counsel called six witnesses to testify and during the course of the evidence of the sixth witness, the accused requested that the Court enter into a voir dire. HELD: 1) There was no evidence to establish the accused did not speak to the complainant or that he was prejudiced by the 'un-arrest'. The accused was not only put in direct contact with Legal Aid duty counsel after having said that legal aid was fine, but he was also put in contact with police officer guarding the open door and keeping him under observation. The Court held that even though the police had made a conscious decision not to arrest the accused, their treatment of him amounted to 'de facto' arrest and not an arbitrary detention. The accused had not established he was the subject of 'unreasonable search or seizure' resulting in a violation of his right under s. 24(2) of the Charter. 2) The Court found that the initial arrest was lawful, was not terminated by the purported 'unarrest', and continued throughout the search and seizure at the police station. Even if the accused were in error in that finding, his continued detention after the purported “de facto” arrest constituted a de facto arrest as described in Latimer.","2. The purpose of the voir dire was to hear and determine an application by counsel for the accused, for a ruling finding that the rights of the accused under sections 8, 9, and 10 (a) and (b) of the Charter had been infringed. [23] In the present case, the accused was not only put in direct contact with Legal Aid duty counsel after having said that legal aid was fine, but he had the immediate and reasonable opportunity to contact a particular Legal Aid lawyer by requesting her by name from another legal aid lawyer. [37] In summary, I find that the initial arrest by Constable Epp was lawful, was not terminated by the purported “un-arrest” of the accused, and continued throughout the search and seizure at the police station. Even if I were in error in that finding, his continued detention after the purported “un-arrest” constituted a “de facto” arrest as described in Latimer. The accused has not established that he was the subject of “unreasonable search or seizure” resulting in a violation of his rights under the Charter.",0.663594470046083,0.6054054054054054,"The accused, through his counsel, gave notice that he would be making an application to the Court for a ruling that the accused's rights under the Charter had been infringed and seeking remedy for that infringement.

7_2006nspc61.txt,"A young person who suffered from considerable mental health issues and was in the permanent care of the Minister of Community Services applied to have the court exclude the public and the media from her court convened pre- sentencing conference. The purpose of the conference was to assemble various professionals from diverse fields to discuss the complex issues surrounding the young person and to provide recommendations to the court as to an appropriate sentence. Various of the professionals had expressed their concern as to their ability to participate in the conference if the media was present. Application for access by the media denied; order granted excluding the public and the media from the pre-sentencing conference; the benefits of an exclusion order outweigh the deleterious effect of restricting the public's right to freedom of expression and the freedom of the press. Although the court convened hearing is a public proceeding to which, prima facie, the open court principle applies, the attendance, cooperation and participation of the invitees to the conference (all professionals who were bound by laws, policies and agreements of confidentiality) was strictly voluntary and many, if not all, would be unable and unwilling to participate in a conference that was open to the public and the media. The administration of justice was furthered by the court obtaining the best possible information from those identified as best able to provide it so that recommendations flowing from the conference would lead to the best sentence for the youth. There were no alternative measures which would prevent or reduce the risk of non-participation by the professionals.","Counsel for the young person sought a ruling from the Court as to whether the public, including the media, will be permitted to attend the pre-sentencing conference scheduled for December 11, 2006. The Crown, the young individual and the legal parent/guardian of the young defendant sought a court order to exclude the public and the media from the conference. The crown, the youth person and the parent argued that the conference should not be open to the public. Counsel for the Crown and the youth referred to the 'open court principle' and the 'determining the best course of action for the youth' as well as the 'deciding the best remedy for the problems the youth face' in the criminal justice system. The court found that the public's interest was a broad concept and included the impact of the criminal system on the youth and the resulting interface between the family and all members of the public; the open court principle is not absolute. The public and media are not to be excluded from the proceedings. The Court found that it was appropriate to exclude members of public and/or the media. The issue was whether the media should be permitted in the presentencing meeting. The question was whether it was in the public interest to exclude them. The answer was yes. The open court principles apply to all discretionary court orders that limit freedom of expression and freedom of the press in relation to legal proceedings. Discretion must be exercised in accordance with the Charter, whether it arises under the common law, under statute (as is the case here) or under rules of court. The 'open-court principle' applies to all judicial orders that restrict freedom of speech, that is, freedom of information and other important right and interests. The only issue here is whether the court should exclude the media and the public from the pre sentencing conference. This is an important issue because it is a public proceeding to which they should have access. The issues here are the adequacy of government programs and support for the troubled young person who apparently suffers from mental health issues and the best measure available to reduce offending behaviour and rehabilitate young people. The benefits of the open-court order outweigh the deleterious effects on the rights and interests of the parties and the general public. The principles of the 'Open Court principle' apply to this case. The parties are entitled to express their views and opinions in a variety of ways. The evidence is compelling and the court is of the opinion that there is a serious danger to be avoided.","[1] Counsel on behalf of the media, the crown, the young person, T.C., and the legal parent/guardian of T.C., The Minister of Community Services seek a ruling from this Court as to whether the public, including the media, will be permitted to attend the court convened pre-sentencing conference, scheduled to take place on December 11, 2006.

Application for access by the media denied; order granted excluding the public and the media from the pre-sentencing conference; the benefits of an exclusion order outweigh the deleterious effect of restricting the public's right to freedom of expression and the freedom of the press. Although the court convened hearing is a public proceeding to which, prima facie, the open court principle applies, the attendance, cooperation and participation of the invitees to the conference (all professionals who were bound by laws, policies and agreements of confidentiality) was strictly voluntary and many, if not all, would be unable and unwilling to participate in a conference that was open to the public and the media. The administration of justice was furthered by the court obtaining the best possible information from those identified as best able to provide it so that recommendations flowing from the conference would lead to the best sentence for the youth. There were no alternative measures which would prevent or reduce the risk of non-participation by the professionals.","Counsel for the young person, who appeared before the Youth Court and entered or confirmed guilty pleas to 31 offences involving assaultive behaviour, threats, property damage and breach of court orders in relation to group home placements, sought a ruling from the Court as to whether the public, including the media, will be permitted to attend the court's pre-sentencing conference scheduled for December 11, 2006. HELD: The application was granted. The court ordered the exclusion of the public and media from the conference. This was an extraordinary remedy and great care must be exercised in deciding whether to use this discretion. The open court principle is inextricably linked to the freedom of expression protected by s. 2(b) of the Charter and advances the core values therein. The 'open court principle' it is hallmark of democratic society and applies to all judicial orders that limit freedom of speech and freedom of media. Discretion is exercised in accordance with the Charter, whether it arises under the common law, under statute (as is the case here) or under rules of court.","[1] Counsel on behalf of the media, the crown, the young person, T.C., and the legal parent/guardian of T.C., The Minister of Community Services seek a ruling from this Court as to whether the public, including the media, will be permitted to attend the court convened pre-sentencing conference, scheduled to take place on December 11, 2006. [4] This case has attracted considerable media attention, at least in part, because of a concern, raised by some, as to the adequacy of government programs and support for the young person who apparently suffers from mental health issues and who is in the permanent care of the Minister of Community Services. It seems to me however, that when a judge attends a court convened conference, receives input and recommendations from various parties, and is mandated to consider them during the course of deliberations in arriving at an appropriate youth sentence, it is, prima facie, a public proceeding. [74] The benefits of an exclusion order, obtaining vital information and recommendations needed to assist the court in arriving at a determination on sentencing, outweighs the deleterious effect of restricting the public’s right to freedom of expression and freedom of the press.

It would be unjust to make any further order under the Act in these circumstances and in the absence of an evidentiary basis, for example, of the fair market value of a sprayer at the time of the seizure as required for an order under s. 55(c) of the Act. The construction and interpretation of the nature of the Agreement is a question of law. The Agreement has many of the attributes of ownership and collectively show that Mr. Poirier acquired a substantial interest in the sprayers. The primary incidents of ownership are use of the spray for all of its useful life with the obligation to pay the capital cost plus the cost of investment, acquisition of substantial interest, acquisition and loss or gain from unusual depreciation or appreciation of the same substance. Ergo, the transaction falls within the ambit of the Saskatchewan Farm Security Act, and Case Credit is restricted by s. 46(2) to repossession and sale by s.(2) of The Saskatchewan Farm. The issues were not plead to the plaintiff in defence, although the Parties did canvassed the circumstances in the framework. The parties did refer to the Agreement as a lease, but the Agreement itself uses notions such as retail financing and secured party. The Construction and Interpretation of the Part IV Agreement is A Question of Law.  1) Only if the Agreement was lease and is covered by the Saskatchewan farm security Act, would the Court be able to ascertain the value of Mr. Pirier's property and the value in the contract. 2) Only in the event that the Agreement's lease is covered, the Court must follow the principles enunciated in Société Generale (Canada) v.

The officer, who observed symptoms of impairment, asked the accused how much he had had to drink and was told he had consumed about 15 beers. The officer placed the accused under arrest for impaired operation of a motor vehicle, and read him his Charter rights, the Police Warning and a Demand for Blood Sample. The officer then detained the accused by remaining with him while awaiting the Blood Kit to arrive and for a blood technician to take the blood. During this time, the officer interrogated the accused about the accident and the accused provided additional information. The Crown contended that if he was given the police warning then it would be clear to the accused that he did not have to continue to answer questions the officer's questions. The Defence argued that since the arrest and the blood demand were based upon self-incriminating evidence obtained by breach of the accused's s. 7 rights, the arrest was illegal and all evidence obtained thereafter should be excluded; or, at least, that the information obtained was illegally obtained and the police could not rely on that information to make the demand. The accused testified that he talked to the police officer only because he believed he had a legal obligation to do so, based on advice he had received from others that there was a legal obligation to report the accident promptly to the police. The Crown conceded that the accused did have a legal obligation to report the accident promptly, and that if the accused believed he was reporting the accident when he gave self-incriminating statements to the police officer as a result of that belief, those statements must be excluded according to law.

He appealed on the ground that the trial judge had failed to give the jury a Vetrovec warning regarding the testimony of his former common law spouse (S.S.) and a witness who had been his friend (W.D.) who was the source of the gun used in the shooting of the victim. The appellant’s trial counsel had initially identified the need for the judge to issue the warning because W.D. had an interest in the outcome because there were outstanding charges against him and because there was the potential that S.S.would be charged too, she would also have an interest in the case as well. During the pre-charge conference with defence counsel and the Crown, the trial judge noted that in giving the warning to the jury he would also have to convey a summary of the Crown’s confirmatory evidence. The defence counsel then withdrew his application. The victim had been a friend of the appellant. According to S.S.’s testimony, the appellant and the victim had pre-arranged a meeting in an abandoned farmyard. The victim worked as an automated teller machine (ATM) technician and as part of his job, he travelled between ATMs carrying cash. S.S. did not see what happened between the two men but heard two gunshots and then saw the appellant and the victim point guns at each other. She saw the victim on his knees pleading with the appellant and offering money in exchange for his life. The appellant instructed her to collect the money and the victim’s cellphone and place them in his truck and while she was doing so, she heard another gunshot and saw the victim lying face down and the appellant standing over him holding a gun. As she and the appellant left the scene, the appellant gave her the victim’s gun. The appellant hid the other guns and the money at another farm site and then dumped the victim’s cellphone and ammunition in a farm field. Apart from the handguns, none of the other items were ever recovered. The witness remained in a relationship with the appellant for another four years following the crime until November 2013. She was contacted by the police in February 2013 and denied any knowledge of the incident. At trial, S.S. testified that she was afraid of the appellant and he had warned her that as an accomplice, she was as involved as he was. When the RCMP contacted her again in May 2014, she again denied any knowledge but then told the officer what she knew because she felt safer and would receive protection from the appellant. S.S. did not have a criminal record, nor was she charged with any offence arising from this incident. The appellant testified that during the meeting in the farmyard, the victim produced two handguns and they began to test fire the weapons. The victim suggested that they stage a fake robbery. The appellant would rough up his friend and then take the cash from his truck. The victim became quite aggressive after the appellant hit him too hard and began chasing him with one of his guns. S.S. then took one of the guns and shot the victim three times. She took $23,000 in cash from his truck because she had financial problems. The testimony of W.D. was that the appellant had acquired two handguns, a Glock and a .22 calibre handgun, from him, ostensibly on behalf of another friend. Several days later, the appellant returned both handguns and reported that after his friend began to shoot at him with the .22 calibre, he had returned fired and shot him three times. On the appellant’s insistence, the witness changed the barrel of the Glock handgun several months later. The police arrested W.D. and charged him with unspecified offences arising from the incident. In the appellant’s version, he testified that the victim brought the guns to the meeting and assumed that he acquired them from W.D.

HELD: The appeal was dismissed. 1) The trial court found that the trial judge did not give a warning in relation the testimony of either witness as it did not take into account the fact that the witness had been previously convicted of the murder and that the evidence raised by the defence was not corroborated by the evidence at trial. The Court found that there was no evidence that the testimony was changed because the trial court had not properly considered the evidence. The evidence raised was not supported by the expert's evidence. 2) The Court dismissed the appellant's appeal. The appellant's evidence was not found to be unreliable. The jury was not properly informed of the dangers inherent in the testimony. The testimony of the witness was not confirmed by the legal evidence. 3) The court found the trial Judge did not have sufficient discretion to give the defence a warning.

She was contacted by the police in February 2013 and denied any knowledge of the incident. At trial, S.S. testified that she was afraid of the appellant and he had warned her that as an accomplice, she was as involved as he was. When the RCMP contacted her again in May 2014, she again denied any knowledge but then told the officer what she knew because she felt safer and would receive protection from the appellant. S.S. did not have a criminal record, nor was she charged with any offence arising from this incident. The appellant testified that during the meeting in the farmyard, the victim produced two handguns and they began to test fire the weapons. The victim suggested that they stage a fake robbery. The appellant would rough up his friend and then take the cash from his truck. The victim became quite aggressive after the appellant hit him too hard and began chasing him with one of his guns. S.S. then took one of the guns and shot the victim three times. She took $23,000 in cash from his truck because she had financial problems. The testimony of W.D. was that the appellant had acquired two handguns, a Glock and a .22 calibre handgun, from him, ostensibly on behalf of another friend. Several days later, the appellant returned both handguns and reported that after his friend began to shoot at him with the .22 calibre, he had returned fired and shot him three times. On the appellant’s insistence, the witness changed the barrel of the Glock handgun several months later. The police arrested W.D. and charged him with unspecified offences arising from the incident. In the appellant’s version, he testified that the victim brought the guns to the meeting and assumed that he acquired them from W.D. He therefore returned them to W.D. after the incident and requested that he change the barrel on the Glock to protect W.D. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. The court found that the trial judge had not erred by not giving the Vetrovec warning. It was not mandatory for him to do so regardless of the position of the defence counsel. The judge was aware of the need for such a warning in the circumstances and after consulting with the Crown and the defence, he exercised his discretion to decide that he would not instruct the jury. The judge was aware that the defence counsel withdrew his application as a tactical decision to avoid having the judge repeat the Crown’s confirmatory evidence to the jury.

The pivotal evidence implicating the appellant in the murder of his common law spouse and friend came from the testimony of the appellant's former common lawyer spouse and his friend. The appellant appealed. Appeal dismissed. 1) The appellant's evidence was not corroborated by the evidence at trial. It was found that the appellant had asked the appellant to change the barrel of the handgun and that he should have given the appellant a warning. 2) There was a fundamental misunderstanding of the strength of the ballistic and scientific evidence and the importance of the witness's evidence to the Crown's case. There was no evidence to support the appellant’s conclusion that the handgun was not the original factory barrel and that, contrary to the submissions of Mr. Healey, there was ballistic/forensic pathology evidence which could support his account of the account of Susan Saxon. 3) Appeal dismissed on the basis that the trial judge failed to give a proper warning in respect to the appellant. 4) The evidence was found to be unreliable. 5) The court found that there was no error in law in failing to give the appellant proper warning. 6) The Court found that it was an error of law to give an opinion on the credibility of a witness who sought to avoid prosecution or incarceration by testifying for the Crown.","Appeal dismissed [1] Daniel Smith was found guilty of the second degree murder of Roger Byer following a trial before a judge and jury.

He appealed on the ground that the trial judge had failed to give the jury a Vetrovec warning regarding the testimony of his former common law spouse (S.S.) and a witness who had been his friend (W.D.) who was the source of the gun used in the shooting of the victim. The appellant’s trial counsel had initially identified the need for the judge to issue the warning because W.D. had an interest in the outcome because there were outstanding charges against him and because there was the potential that S.S.would be charged too, she would also have an interest in the case as well. During the pre-charge conference with defence counsel and the Crown, the trial judge noted that in giving the warning to the jury he would also have to convey a summary of the Crown’s confirmatory evidence. The defence counsel then withdrew his application. The victim had been a friend of the appellant. According to S.S.’s testimony, the appellant and the victim had pre-arranged a meeting in an abandoned farmyard. The victim worked as an automated teller machine (ATM) technician and as part of his job, he travelled between ATMs carrying cash. S.S. did not see what happened between the two men but heard two gunshots and then saw the appellant and the victim point guns at each other. She saw the victim on his knees pleading with the appellant and offering money in exchange for his life. The appellant instructed her to collect the money and the victim’s cellphone and place them in his truck and while she was doing so, she heard another gunshot and saw the victim lying face down and the appellant standing over him holding a gun.

The appellant's appellate counsel abandoned the ineffective counsel ground and proceeded solely with the argument that it was an error of law on the part of the trial judge not to give a warning. In his appeal to the Court of Appeal, the appellant argued that the trial court erred in law in failing to give the appellant a warning when the circumstances required one to be given. The appeal court also dismissed the appellant’s appeal. HELD: Appeal dismissed. 1) The appellant was found guilty of the second degree murder of respondent respondent. He was sentenced to life imprisonment with no eligibility for parole for 12 years.  2) There was a fundamental misunderstanding of the strength of the ballistic and scientific evidence. The scientific evidence did not, contrary to the submissions of the Crown and the Crown, support the version of events given by the appellant. In the end, the court found that the appellant gave the appellant the benefit of the doubt as to the dangers inherent in his testimony.

There was insufficient evidence to establish that he was acting in the best interests of the respondent and that he should have given a warning to the appellant prior to the trial. 3) The evidence from the appellant and the appellant was not corroborated by the evidence at trial.","Appeal dismissed [1] Daniel Smith was found guilty of the second degree murder of Roger Byer following a trial before a judge and jury.

In carrying out that contract the plaintiff engaged the defendant as a sub-contractor to construct a directionally drilled crossing under the South Saskatchewan River. The defendants embarked upon the project but after time ceased the work. The plaintiffs counterclaim alleged negligence by the defendant. The respondent counterclaim claimed for $2,150,495.65 as compensation for services and materials provided to the plaintiff pursuant to the contract. The court awarded $12,000 to the counterclaim. The counterclaim was dismissed. The Court found that the respondent had not shown sufficient assets in Canada to pay costs. The judge ordered security for the costs of the counter claim. The application was granted but the plaintiff was required to post security for cost in the sum of $18,000 (max. $50k). The court found that there was no absolute rule that a counterclaim precludes the court from ordering security for a cost. The fact that the counterclaimed was a separate action and included a claim for expert costs was not an absolute prohibition. The only rule that could be used to remedy the situation was Rule 539(c).

After the plaintiff ceased the work, the defendant abandoned the project and the plaintiff applied ex parte under s. 56(1) of the Builders' Lien Act to have the defendant's lien vacated. The application was granted but the plaintiff was required to post security for the costs of the defendant. HELD: The court found that the presence of the counterclaim precluded it from obtaining an order for security. 1) Rule 539(c) should be invoked. 2) The Court found that there was no absolute prohibition on the issuance of security for any reason. 3) The defendant had commenced another separate and distinct action, which is the other action, long before filing a defence and counterclaim within this action. 4) The plaintiff is called upon to defend the within action brought by the plaintiff. This is case where the plaintiff not only is a non-resident party but there is a real likelihood that it will be unable to pay costs if it is unsuccessful. 539 In exercising its discretion under rule 537, the court may consider any relevant matter other than to say that no such declaration will be made. It is important to note that in all of the cases the order was being sought against defendant (plaintiff by counterclaim) was moved over from the Alberta action. 538 In the case of Specialty Steels, (supra), the court reviewed the pleadings and position of the parties involved in the proceeding. The pleadings were preceded by these comments which suggest discretion rather than an absolute rule. The judge concluded that discretion should be exercised.","[1] This is an application wherein the defendant, The Crossing Company Inc., seeks an order requiring the plaintiff, Banister Pipelines Inc., to provide security for costs in the amount of $50,000.00. I have decided that an order should be made, but in the lesser amount of $18,000.00. Accordingly, I conclude that the Act does not impede the jurisdiction of this court to deal with the application of the defendant. Accordingly, I conclude that the security which should be posted is $18,000.00 for fees and disbursements. CONCLUSION [41] In the result, it is ordered as follows:

(1) that the plaintiff, Banister Pipelines Inc., on or before April 30, 2004, shall deposit with this court to the credit of this action as security for costs the sum of $18,000.00;",0.3747276688453159,0.5664335664335663,"FIAT: The defendant applied for security for costs in the amount of $50,000. HELD: The plaintiff was required to supply security for costs in the amount of $18,000. 1) The defendant proved facts, which demonstrated the existence of several of the criteria listed in Rule 538 of the Queen's Bench Rules of Court. The plaintiff failed to establish any of the situations listed in Rule 539.  2) The presence of a counterclaim does not necessarily or automatically prohibit the granting of an order for security for costs. Rather, it is a factor to be considered. In this case, the counterclaim was not a wholly distinct claim. It arises in respect of the same matter and transaction as the claim proper. 3) The defendant commenced the builders' lien action, long before filing a defence and counterclaim within this action. Had the counterclaim not been filed, an order for security for costs as requested would have been appropriate. It is somewhat artificial to now deny that relief because of the counterclaim, which has the effect of facilitating a disposition of all matters within one proceeding. 4) The plaintiff applied ex parte under s. 56(1) of The Builders' Lien Act to have the defendant's lien vacated. The application was granted, but the plaintiff was required to post security for costs in the amount of $50,000. The Builders' Lien Act does not impede the jurisdiction of this Court to deal with the application of the defendant.","FIAT.

In carrying out that contract the plaintiff engaged the defendant as a sub-contractor to construct a directionally drilled crossing under the South Saskatchewan River.

HELD: The plaintiff applied ex parte under s. 56(1) of The Builders' Lien Act to have the defendant's lien vacated. It is now argued that this court has no jurisdiction to do anything more. 1) The presence of a counterclaim precludes the plaintiff from obtaining an order for security. 2) There is a general rule that 'no security will be awarded where the claim and counterclaim are related is not an absolute bar'. 3) In this case, the defendant commenced another separate and distinct action, which is the other action. At least insofar as Saskatchewan Power Corporation is concerned, the matter is raised by the respondent in many respects as defence. However, if the respondent is successful in full or in part in its claim against the applicant as defendant, it would be entitled to set this off against anything the applicant recovered from it in his claim as plaintiff. 4) In the case of Speciality Steels, (supra), reference was made to the decisions in Athabasca Realty Co. Ltd. v. Lafontaine et al. (1981), 30 A.R. 581 (M) and Junction Engineering Ltd., v. Gunner Industries Ltd. (1993), 143 A.L. 316 (M). In the first there is an extensive review of decisions which discuss the issue of ordering security. There is good reason to believe that the pleadings or position of the plaintiff in the proceedings are without merit, but it is unlikely anything more would be ordered as it may adversely effect the plaintiff's opportunity to defend the action. 539 In exercising its discretion under rule 537, the court may consider any relevant matter, including the following factors that may support the denial of an order: 1) An order requiring security for cost will not have an adverse effect on the plaintiff if the security is restricted to the costs for the defence of the claim proper.

It would require the plaintiff as plaintiff to give security as condition of it being allowed to defend the action by the plaintiff by counterclaim (defendant) and of having all the issues between those parties arising from the same transaction dealt with together.

The maximum sentence imposed was 18 months in a correctional centre as the accused was a model citizen.

5_2006skca7.txt,"This is an appeal brought by the R.M. from a judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench determining that a mortgage held by the R.M. was subordinate to a mortgage held by the respondent Farm Credit Canada (FCC), even though the R.M. mortgage was registered before the mortgage of FCC. The R.M. had agreed with the mortgagor that its mortgage would be subordinate to that of FCC. The appeal raises the application of the priority provisions of The Land Titles Act, 2000 and in particular the application of s. 54 of the Act. HELD: The mortgage of the respondent has priority over the mortgage of the appellant. The appeal is dismissed with costs.  1) It is not necessary in this case to consider whether the priority provisions of the Land Titles Act are overridden by commercial postponement agreements in mortgages, or whether reliance by the competing security holder is necessary in order to displace the doctrine of privity of contract in relation to a covenant to postpone, for the court consider the matter to be governed by a consideration of the nature of the interest created by the R.M. mortgage in light of s. 54(3) of the Act. 2) Registration does not and cannot alter the nature of the legal interest granted by the instrument registered. In the present case the mortgage instrument states that it is pursuant to the prior Grant Agreement executed by the parties. This agreement, in turn, clearly provides that any security granted by Mainline to the R.M. is subject to the prior security interest of the respondent to the extent of $3,125,000. In effect, Mainline granted to the R.M. a mortgage of a limited interest, being Mainline's equity of redemption after any mortgage held by the respondent, to the extent of $3,125,000. The appellant admits that it was never intended, as between itself and Mainline, that it would obtain a security interest in priority to that of the respondent. Mainline granted a mortgage to the appellant subject to the prior interests, as defined, of the respondent and of CIBC. The appellant is therefore, seeking to increase the interest actually accorded to it by the debtor by relying on its prior registration and the priority provision of the Act.","This was an appeal from a judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench determining that a mortgage held by the respondent was subordinate to a mortgage made by the R.M. even though the mortgage was registered before the mortgage of the respondent. The appeal was dismissed with costs to the respondent as the mortgage had not been registered before a prior registration. The trial judge held that the fee simple mortgage of a respondent was not a security interest but rather a security against the respondent's fee simple interest. The appellant was seeking to increase the interest actually accorded to it by the debtor by relying on its prior registration and priority provisions of the LTA.

The respondent is seeking to increased the interest actual accorded by the creditor by relying upon its prior registered and priority provision of the lTA. The R-mortgage was not properly registered. 4) The Court of Appeal held that, in the instant case, the respondent did not even know about, and certainly did not rely upon, the covenant to postpone. 5) The appeal of the RMA was dismissed. 6) The court held the respondent had priority over its mortgage.","[1] This is an appeal brought by the R.

On September 18, the tenant had given six weeks' notice of her intention to terminate the tenancy. The term of the lease stated that it was for a term of 12 months (April 2012 to March 2013) and continuing thereafter from month to month until one of the parties gave one month's notice. The appellant did not try to rent the premises following receipt of the notice because he had decided to furnish the unit prior to re-renting. He spent $15,000 doing so and advertised the unit in mid-January, increasing the rent by $400 and obtained a new tenant as at February 1. Although it is not stated what relief the landlord sought from the Office of Residential Tenancies, the hearing officer stated in the decision that the lease was a month-to-month tenancy. The appellant argued that the hearing officer made errors in law in that he 1) misinterpreted s. 19(1)(g)(iii) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 in making that finding, as the lease was for a fixed term; and 2) misinterpreted s. 8(2) of the Act in finding that the landlord's efforts at mitigation were not reasonable within the meaning of the section and the landlord was legally disentitled by s. 8(1) of the Act.

The appellant did not attempt to rent the premises following his receipt of the notice, because he spent approximately $15,000 on furnishing the unit prior to re-renting it. He spent approximately US$400 on the unit and obtained a new tenant effective February 1, 2013 at $2500 per month. The one-month notice provision was applicable only if the tenancy was extended to a month-to-month tenancy following the end of the fixed term.  2) The hearing officer erred in holding that a month to month tenancy would follow the primary fixed term negated a fixed term and that the one-time notice provision could be attributed to the respondent. The respondent had given written notice of termination of the tenancy to the appellant in September 2012. She advised she would terminate the lease on October 31, 2012 and gave the tenant a notice to vacate the premises.

The accused, a status Indian with Aboriginal and Treaty 10 rights, was fishing for food. He had used a net in the restricted area and had caught eight suckers, two walleye and one northern pike. The Bay was very close to the residence of the accused on the Canoe Lake First Nation and was his preferred area to fish.

The Bay was very close to the residence of the accused on the Canoe Lake First Nation and was his preferred area to fish. The remainder of Canoe Lake was subject to restrictions governing all fishing but open to unlimited Treaty sustenance fishing all year round. The accused admitted to the actus reus of the offence. Under the Constitutional Questions Act, 2012 the accused gave notice that he would argue that s. 7(2)(b) of the regulations was invalid because it restricted his Treaty and Aboriginal right to fish food in the restricted area as defined by the Regulations; infringed his Treaty and Aboriginal right to fish for food as protected by s. 35(1) of the Constitution Act, 1982; and infringed his Treaty and Aboriginal right to fish for food as protected by s. 25 of the Charter of Rights. The agreed Statement of Facts confirmed the accused’s Aboriginal Treaty status and right to sustenance fishing. The Crown’s major witness was an expert in fish biology and he testified that the restricted area had been closed to protect it for walleye spawning. He stated that the closed area could not be opened for sustenance fishing. The conservation effort had been supported by the Canoe Lake Band Council./n HELD: The accused was found guilty. The court found that the accused had failed to show a breach of his Treaty fishing right that would raise a defence or a Charter remedy to the charge against him: 1) the challenged regulations were within the implied common law limitations on Aboriginal fishing rights; 2) alternatively, the regulations fell within the provisions that permitted such regulations in Treaty 10; 3) alternatively, if they were not within the implied limitations of the right, the evidence had not established a prima facie infringement of the right; 4) alternatively, if there was a breach, it met the justification principles set out in Sparrow and Pierone.","The accused was charged with unlawfully fish for or catch and retain fish in waters of Jans Bay and the Narrows contrary to s. 7(2)(b) of the Saskatchewan Fishery Regulations, 1995, made pursuant to The Fisheries Act, 1995. HELD: The accused was granted a stay of the charge. The Court found that the accused was not guilty of the actus reus of the substantial charge but put forth as defence his Treaty rights to fish for food in any water and at any time he so wished.","[1] The accused stands charged as follows:

that on or about the 15 of May, A.D. 2015 at Jans Bay, in the Province of Saskatchewan did unlawfully fish for or catch and retain any species of fish in the waters of Jans Bay at approximately 55°10' N 108°08' W, Wepooskow Bay at approximately 55°12' N 108°07' W, and Wepooskow Narrows of Canoe Lake at approximately 55°10' N 108°09' W, all lying within Townships 71 and 72, Range 14, all West of the Third Meridian, and including all waters of Canoe Lake lying within a radius of 2.4 km from the intersection of the centre-line of Wepooskow Narrows with the easterly bank of Canoe Lake at approximately 55°10'30"" N 108°08'50"" W, contrary to: section 7(2)(b) of the Saskatchewan Fishery Regulations, 1995, made pursuant to The Fisheries Act, RSC 1985, c F-14. [72] In conclusion, the accused has failed to show a breach of his Treaty fishing right that would raise a defence or a Charter remedy to the charge against him:

1) The challenged regulations are within the implied common law limitations on Aboriginal fishing rights;

2) Alternatively the regulations are within the proviso of Treaty No. 10 and constitutional legislative enactments for “regulations to be made” by government;

3) Alternatively, if the regulations are not within the implied or express limitations of the right, evidence does not establish a prima facie infringement of the right;

4) Alternatively, if there was a breach, said breach meets the justification principles set out in Sparrow and Pierone.

The accused had been fishing for food in Jans Bay and other waters of Canoe Lake since 1991. He had caught eight white sucker fish, two walleye and one northern pike. He put forth as defence his Treaty rights to fish in any water and at any time he so wished. HELD: The accused was found guilty of the actus reus and the charge was stayed. The Court found that the accused was guilty of breaching his Treaty right to sustenance fishing. The court also found that there was no evidence that the respondent had breached his treaty right to fish. The issue was whether the respondent was bound by s.7(2(b)(b)(c)(d)) of the Fisheries Regulations. It was not clear that the Crown had asked the Court to lift the ban. The evidence presented was that there had been a meeting between the respondent and the respondent regarding the issue of the closure of the Jans bay area. The respondent admitted that he had spoken to the respondent's brother and sister and that they had discussed the possibility of a commercial fishing licence in the area.",0.5335463258785942

The letter was direct evidence that he wasn't at the Club at that time. The evidence related in court by each witness was that the accused had been there for several months prior to the robbery and that he had been in contact with the victim's girlfriend. The accused admitted to the letter that he did not remember the date of the robberies and that his attempt to induce a potential witness to fabricate an alibi by perjury was a serious and just allegation. The only other evidence that could be drawn from the letter was that of a witness who had been at the robbery but had not been called to testify. The defence argued that the letter admitted to being in the Club but that it was an attempt to deceive the potential witness. The Crown argued that it could not prove that the witness had lied to the Crown. The court concluded that the admission was not an alibis but was an admission of fact which was contrary to the accused and exculpatory. The Court held that the evidence of the accused being in Eurek was not a 'blatant lie' but rather a 'facilitative lie' and that the Crown could not find the person who committed the robbery because the accused was not armed and the evidence would not support the Crown's allegation.,"He is charged with armed robbery.

This is the standard of review prescribed in the parties' interspousal contract of September 14, 1999. Under that agreement the husband pays $3,000 per month. Under the agreement the wife is residing with a new partner. The arrangement essentially allows him to reside in her home at no cost in exchange for his performing yard work and house maintenance. The wife suffers from MS and is unable to work and the income tax is paid on the monies and loaned back to the company to keep our cash flow up as per bank. HELD: An increase is warranted, but not to the extent claimed by the wife. The only material change is the fact she is residing in her new partner's home. They have agreed to a monthly rent increase and rental income is now paid by the company. The husband's income consists of base salary, management bonus and shareholder bonus. The bonuses are based on the previous year's profits and the corporation's prior year's income (the husband's argument). There is also the fact the husband has a rental income in the amount of $400 per month and that certain of his expenses for travel and auto expenses are now paid.","[1] In this application to vary spousal support, the issue is whether there has been a material change in circumstances by virtue of a change in either the husband’s or wife’s employment status, or financial means or needs, warranting an increase in spousal support.

The definition of a common law spouse is a presumption only, in that the Act also allows judges to make an unequal division in some cases. The right to spousal support arises only at the end of marriage. Before and after the adoption of the Married Women's Property Act (MWPA), the individual exercises limited but not exclusive control over the designation. The only exceptions to this are the right to equal possession of the matrimonial home and to veto any sale or mortgage of it. 3) The concept of separate property, which assumed each spouse to be equally positioned to earn an income and acquire property, had been revealed as inadequate at both practical and psychological level. The reality may be otherwise. The sanction of the union by the state through civil marriage cannot always be obtained. The law; the reluctance of one's partner to marry; financial, religious or social constraints; these factors and others commonly function to prevent partners who otherwise operate as family unit from formally marrying. The dramatic increase in the divorce rate after 1968 was undoubtedly the principal factor motivating the need to find 'orderly and equitable' ways to settle ex-spouses' financial affairs. 4) In addition to that, legislation which effects differential treatment between individuals or groups will violate this fundamental purpose where those who are subject to differential treatment fall within one or more enumerated or analogous grounds, to the extent that it finds its roots","nan THE COURT: Appeal allowed; s. 2(g) of the Matrimonial Property Act, R.S.N.S. 1989, c. 275 declared to be unconstitutional and of no force or effect — declaration suspended for twelve (12) months per reasons for judgment of Flinn, J.A.; Glube, C.J.N.S. and Roscoe, J.A. concurring.

HELD: The boys are in need of protection and there is an order placing the boys in the permanent care of the Minister. As long as the boys are in foster care, the Ministry will make arrangements for the boys to have regular access to their mother and to Art and Laura.  1) There is no doubt but that Art and Laura love and wish the best for the boys. However, there are real concerns about Art and Laura' familial context. There is the fact that Art and Laura's own children were apprehended in 1989 and committed to the Minister. It is pertinent to note Art and Laura are estranged from four of their six children.  Two of Art's children claim he sexually assaulted them. When Melody testified she said her first preference was that the boys be placed with Mary Stevens, their foster parent, but did acknowledge that the boys would be in good hands with Art and Laura. 2) While the Court accepts that the Stevens home is a positive and nurturing one, there is no question it is not an ideal physical place for 9 people.

It is pertinent to note Art and Laura are estranged from four of their six children.  Two of Art's children claim he sexually assaulted them. When Melody testified she said her first preference was that the boys be placed with Mary Stevens, their foster parent, but did acknowledge that the boys would be in good hands with Art and Laura. 2) While the Court accepts that the Stevens home is a positive and nurturing one, there is no question it is not an ideal physical place for 9 people. With organization, routine and discipline however, it can function at a satisfactory level. Further, if an order is made under s. 37(2), the boys have the opportunity to be adopted.

The father had been convicted of fraud over $5,000 (s. 380(1)(a)) and given a 12 month conditional sentence order and restitution. 3) The children were placed with their grandparents. They did not have any problems with the mother. The mother was the primary caregiver. She was the one who supervised the children. The children's relationship with their parents was tumultuous and difficult. The parents opposed the adoption and the application. 4) The court found that the best interests standard mandated by the Child and Family Services Act was necessarily an individualistic approach. The court was required to choose the course which will best provide for the healthy growth, development and education of the child so that he will be equipped to face the problems of life as a mature adult.","1) This action deals with the placement of two brothers, M.S.S.

It was concluded that the children did not pose a risk to the children. 3) There were two other convictions on the record. The first was for fraud over $5,000 (s. 380(1)(a)) and the second was for welfare fraud. The third conviction was for child pornography. The court was of a view that the adoption plan was unlikely due in part to reasons other than the age at which the children were born. 4) The court reviewed the evidence concerning the boys' continued placement with the Ministry of Social Services (MSS).

The defendant was found to be a 'good person' and had a history of drug trafficking and was convicted of trafficking offences. 3) The defendant's pre-trial detention was in part the product of a failed preliminary hearing date which, because of severe weather conditions, and minor accident, saw the prosecutor unable to reach Estevan. The pre-rial was re-scheduled with the resulting delays. 4) The aggravating circumstances in this case include the fact that the amount of marijuana and cocaine found in the accused’s possession was admittedly for the purpose of trafficking and the defendant was previously convicted of a designated substance offence. There is no evidence or suggestion that the drugs were received from the defendant. The appellant was a young man and appeared to have made very little productive contributions to society or to his own advancement. He did not have a criminal record and had no criminal record.

Count 3: That he, on or about the 25th day of August, 2010, at or near Estevan Saskatchewan, did unlawfully have in his possession property (or proceeds of property), to wit: cash of a value exceeding $5,000.00 knowing that all (or part) of the property was obtained (or derived directly or indirectly) as a result of the commission in Canada of an offence punishable by indictment contrary to section 354 and 355 (a) of the Criminal Code.

Nothing has changed to warrant a variation. 3) There was no evidence to support the respondent's statement that the child is living with him half the time. There was no evidence or explanation as to why he has failed to pay child support, which creates the present arrears.

The appellant argued that the 1995 judgment was no longer appropriate. The court dismissed the respondent's application and directed trial on the issue of whether there should be variation of the custody provisions. The issues were the matters of custody, child support and cancellation of the arrears of child support. The parties agreed that the respondent should share custody of the child. The Court dismissed the appellant's application to vary child support, finding that the parties were not candidates for joint custody and shared parenting.

The evidence was that the respondent could choose to help himself by eliminating alcohol and marijuana use.

Anthony Merchant (as well as a related corporate defendant). The defendants were engaged and retained to represent the plaintiff. The plaintiff was given every opportunity, if not encouragement, to call required experts and to do so. She chose not to do it. HELD: The plaintiff presented no evidence upon which a jury could decide whether negligence caused her to be convicted. The court granted the non-suit application. The Court noted that the trial judge had not shown that standard practice was the only basis for the plaintiff's negligence claim. The trial judge did not seem disposed to grant the non application. There was no expert evidence presented by the plaintiff to the jury. The jury could not decide whether the defendant breached the standard of care imposed upon lawyers undertaking the task of representing a client in her circumstances nor with respect to the application and alleged breach of that duty of care by the defendants. The defendant lawyer was given the opportunity to call the required experts. The only thing that was presented was that the plaintiff chose not. The evidence was that she had not been properly instructed to call witnesses. The test for negligence is whether there is any evidence beyond the ordinary common sense of a jury. It is not clear that the defendant's failure to personally conduct the plaintiff constituted negligence. The fact that the respondent was not properly instructed in the proper manner to call a witness is irrelevant. The standard of conduct is not one which a trial judge could decide without the aid of expert evidence. The question of whether the standard and duty of conduct in professional negligence is applicable in the circumstances is a question of law. The issue of whether a trial lawyer could determine the standard without the assistance of expert opinion is a matter of law to be determined by the trial court. The issues are the same as the one presently before the Court. The first threshold issue to be considered and answered by the jury will be whether or not any of the defendants breached their professional duty of service to the plaintiff, which is to say, that negligence caused the plaintiff not to succeed at his original trial. The second threshold issue is whether the plaintiff has met the standard established by the evidence. If not, the results of the original trial would have been different. The judge's failure not to appoint an expert witness to testify at the original case was the first step in determining whether there was any evidence, if left uncontradicted, to satisfy a reasonable person.

b_2017skqb308.txt,"The Minister of Social Services applied for an order committing a two-year-old child to the care of his maternal grandparents for an indefinite period of time. The grandparents were previously designated as persons of sufficient interest. The child had lived with them since birth. The mother and father both suffered from addictions and had stopped living together by the time the child was born. The father had multiple criminal convictions, including drinking and driving offences and weapons offences. The mother’s relationship with her parents, family support worker and child protection worker during the course of the child’s life had been marked by volatility, argumentative behaviour and threats, one of which resulted in criminal harassment charges. The child was the subject of a protection order, which imposed conditions upon his parents. Neither meaningfully complied with the conditions set out in the protection order. Both parents testified at trial that their present circumstances were not suitable to raise a child. Each expressed intention to take steps necessary to provide a home for the child. Each parent asserted that a temporary order was appropriate. | HELD: The child was placed in the custody of his grandparents on an indefinite basis, which, while not temporary, was not as potentially immutable as a permanent order. That the child was in need of protection was not seriously challenged by either his mother or father. The prospect for change at the time of trial was limited to statements of good intentions. On their own, such statements were insufficient. There were opportunities for the parents to demonstrate a reasonable prospect for change. These opportunities were squandered and, in some cases abusively rejected by the mother.","HELD: The Court found that the Minister of Social Services sought an order pursuant to s. 37(1)(b) of the CFSA that the child be committed to the care of the parents for an indefinite period of time. The Ministry's position was that the children had been in need of protection for some time and that a temporary order would be appropriate. The Court also found that there was insufficient stability in the children's lives to justify an indefinite order for the child to be placed with the parents. The Minister also suggested that a permanent order for custody be ordered. The court reviewed the evidence and found that although the children were in need, they were not receiving the level of parenting that was appropriate under s.37.","In this proceeding, the Minister of Social Services [Ministry] seeks an order, pursuant to s. 37(1)(b) of the CFSA, that C.T. be committed to the care of A.R.’s parents for an indefinite period of time. In its place, A.T. suggests a temporary
order, of up to one year, under s. 37(7) of the CFSA. A.T. contends that,
with this additional time, he will be able to demonstrate sufficient stability, both in his lifestyle and behaviour, that he would be able to resume parenting C.T. Accordingly, A.R. also suggests that a temporary order would be appropriate. In other words, while the proposed order would not be a temporary order, it would not be as potentially immutable as a s. 37(2) order. These were opportunities for the parents to demonstrate a reasonable prospect for change – something more palpable and more meaningful than any statements of good intentions could ever be. It necessarily follows that an indefinite order under s. 37(1)(b), as requested by the Ministry, should issue. CONCLUSION [56] In the result, there will be an order placing C.T. in

The accused applied for an order pursuant to s. 581(1) of the Criminal Code quashing Count #1 of the indictment on the ground that it applies to more than one single transaction. The Crown had previously applied to quash Count #2 on the basis that it was not bound by the findings of Klebuc J. in the Schafer case but rather by the Crown's decision to proceed with the new indictment against the accused. The applicant argued that the Crown had not shown it would be bound by any of the findings in the original indictment but rather preferred to wait until the outcome of the trial before proceeding with the Leibel trial. HELD: The application was dismissed. The Court found that the application raised a question substantively different from that already determined by the applicant but ordered the Crown to provide particulars (as it now has done in the amended indictment). The Crown sought to proceed by order of s. 690 if the accused could show that it would prejudicial to put the complex indictment to a jury. The application to quashed Count #3 raised substantively the same question as that considered and determined by Klebucc J. with respect to the Crown. The argument in support of the application to dismiss was based on the requirement that s.581 be used to describe transactions within a transaction. It was also found that there was no promise by the Court that it could be bound in its proceedings against the applicant by the conclusions of Klebumuc J., but ordered that the Court should consider an application to order the indictment separated pursuant to ss. 590 if it could show the accused committed an indictable offence therein specified.

The argument in support of the application to dismiss was based on the requirement that s.581 be used to describe transactions within a transaction. It was also found that there was no promise by the Court that it could be bound in its proceedings against the applicant by the conclusions of Klebumuc J., but ordered that the Court should consider an application to order the indictment separated pursuant to ss. 590 if it could show the accused committed an indictable offence therein specified.

The wife argued the agreement was not applicable to the present situation where they have separated and was only in effect during the time of the marriage or upon their deaths.

This is an appropriate situation to apply s.40 of the Family Property Act. The fact they each executed a will to give effect to that intention and the husband paid practically all of the day-to-day expenses led to the conclusion their verbal agreement should be considered binding, notwithstanding their marriage ended by separation rather than death. 2)The condominium purchased by the husband was the 'family home' as provided for in s.2(1)(a).

The accused worked for the penitentiary as a doorman and relief bartender. He was employed by Uncle Charlie's as a bartender and dance instructor. The Crown witnesses testified that the accused was more aggressive than the Crown witnesses and that he took advantage of the situation to administer a 'clear shot' to the victim. The defence argued that the offence was committed because the accused had been involved in an altercation with the penitence employee and that the Crown had set out to get revenge on him for his handling of the incident. The court found that the defence did not accept the accused's argument that he was trying to 'get at' the accused, and that his defence had failed to accept the evidence of the fact that he had been knocked unconscious several times. The Court found that he did not act in self-defence and that neither the accused nor the accused himself committed any assault. The evidence of self-inflicted blows was not accepted by the defence. The only defence argument was that the defendant threw a punch but did not say that he threw it. The offence was made out of an altercation between the peninsular employee and the accused. The defendant did not attempt to 'throw a punch' or to 'clear shoot' the victim, but he did attempt to do so. The Criminal Code does not allow self-incrimination. Neither did the defence accept the Crown's argument of 'clear shots' or that the Court had set up a 'briefcase' to prevent the accused from committing any assault on the penultimate day of his life. The Defendant did not commit any assault, but the evidence was consistent with the accused being more aggressive and that it was necessary to prevent him from falling unconscious. The Code does accept the fact the accused threw a blow to the complainant but it does not accept that he set out several blows to the self-accused. The argument that the Criminal Code is more likely to set out a clear shot than to prevent self-injury is accepted. The fact that the Defendant did act in this fashion justifies the charge. The offences were committed in the context of an assault committed by the accused and the Criminal Law Section. The Act does not permit self-insurance. The Section is not used to prevent acts of self assault.","dancing. The accused was employed by Uncle Charlie's as a

The hearing officer directed that the order of possession would be deferred if the tenant paid the rent that was owing and future rent.

They sought to adduce new evidence by affidavit on this point at the appeal. HELD: The Court declined to admit the affidavit evidence about bed bugs. However, the matter was remitted to the hearing officer for rehearing because the reasons provided by the hearing officer were deficient. The Court held that it was impossible to tell whether the hearing officer considered the tenants' evidence at the hearing, made findings of fact in that regard or whether equitable jurisdiction should be invoked in this situation.

A sentencing hearing was held because there was significant disagreement on the facts. The Crown alleged three aggravating factors: 1) that the sexual assaults were numerous, 2) that the accused touched the victims directly on their skin and not just on their clothing and 3) that there was digital penetration by the accused on both victims. HELD: At a sentencing hearing, the Crown must prove aggravating factors beyond a reasonable doubt. The Court held that the two victims were sexually assaulted by the accused on numerous occasions over a period of a number of years. The Court was satisfied these sexual assaults were a common occurrence on every occasion that the accused was in the company of his granddaughters. The Court found that the accused touched the victims under their clothing on numerous occasions and that there were a couple of occasions that the accused digitally penetrated each victim. Finally, the Court concluded that the accused got bolder over time and took more liberties and chances with his victims.",The accused was charged with committing sexual assaults on both the complainant and the complainant. The complainant had been sexually assaulted by the accused for several years. The accused had been in the complainant's company for several months. The Crown requested a sentencing hearing.

The first aggravating factor was that the accused had touched the complainant directly on their skin and not just over their clothing. The second aggravating issue was that he touched the victims' bottom once her vagina. The evidence of the victims was sufficiently credible to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that digital penetration occurred. The Court was satisfied that the sexual assaults were frequent occurrences and that the complainant had no doubt recalled the incidents of digital penetration as this more severe abuse would stand out from the other occasions. The court was satisfied the accused got bolder as time passed and took more liberties and chances. The third aggravating element was that both the victims were sexually assaulted on numerous occasions. HELD: The Crown had proved beyond a doubt that the offences were repeated sexual abuse by the defendant. The trial judge found that the defendant got bold as time went on and took on more liberties. The defendant's credibility was sufficiently damaged that the Court could not accept the evidence of both the victim's children as credible. The victim's credibility as a result of the sexual assault was sufficiently compromised to prove that the alleged offences occurred on numerous occasion. The Defendant's credibility with the victims is sufficiently credible.,"[1] Leopold Therrien is charged as follows: that between January 1, 1983 and December 31, 1991, at Willow Bunch, Saskatchewan, and Regina, Saskatchewan, and Winnipeg, Manitoba, did commit sexual assaults on Leanne Eger contrary to provisions of the Criminal Code.

The plaintiffs, creditors of the defendant's client, sued the defendant for negligent misrepresentation, breach of trust and breach of undertaking. The defendant initially received three irrevocable letters of direction for payment of amounts owing on a construction project. When the project got into financial difficulty the defendant advised his client to seek separate counsel to deal with the creditors - suppliers. At a creditors meeting the defendant advised the creditors' counsel of the initial three letters of direction. The project was considered viable by the creditors and continued, with the defendant obtaining postponements of the three letters of direction. Further creditors' meetings were held, a Creditors' Committee struck, and subsequent letters of direction sent to the defendant by the client and certain creditors. The defendant, in acknowledging a subsequent letter of direction, made no mention of the earlier three letters, nor any explanation of 'all of the proceeds'. One member of the Committee was aware of the initial irrevocable letters of direction. On what was to be the final mortgage draw, the defendant requested and was refused a postponement of the initial three letters. With his client's consent, the defendant disbursed the funds, to pay off the initial three creditors, a mechanics' lien referred in one of the subsequent letters of direction, his legal fees and the balance as per a letter of direction received from two of three members of the Creditors' Committee.

Further, certain other plaintiffs were not aware of the letter, and could not have relied on it. Other plaintiffs did not supply after the letter and therefore did not rely on it. The Court noted that on a balance of probabilities, the defendant's disbursement did not cause the demise of the project. At the time of the disbursement the project was still viable and the plaintiffs made their own decision to cease supplying and to lien the project;  (2) there was no breach of trust as the defendant had no fiduciary duty and had at no time acted for the plaintiffs;  and  (3) there was no breach of undertaking as the undertaking must be considered in all the circumstances, including knowledge of the plaintiffs, the other letters and meetings. The Court concluded that the member of the Creditors' Committee who was aware of the initial irrevocable letters had a duty to advise the other members. The documentation was clear that legal fees would be deducted and the Committee was also aware of the direction to pay the mechanics' lien.","The plaintiff sought to have the defendant's counsel disburse $78,400.00 from the project to the creditors.

In my respectful opinion, in the case at bar, one cannot interpret Mr. Brookes\' letter of March 11, 1987 in the abstract or in a vacuum and one must consider all of the surrounding circumstances, including the knowledge of the plaintiffs, through the Creditors\'Committee and their representatives, the letters of March 12, March 13 and March 16, 1987 and the various meetings resulting in those letters. Decision On the basis of the findings and conclusion reached, I therefore dismiss all the claims of the plaintiffs against the defendant, with costs.",0.58348623853211,0.4222539229671898,"The defendant lawyer was retained for the purpose of obtaining and disbursing mortgage funds. The plaintiffs, creditors of the defendant's client, sued the defendant for negligent misrepresentation, breach of trust and breach of undertaking. The defendant initially received three irrevocable letters of direction for payment of amounts owing on a construction project. When the project got into financial difficulty the defendant advised his client to seek separate counsel to deal with the creditors - suppliers. At a creditors meeting the defendant advised the creditors' counsel of the initial three letters of direction. The project was considered viable by the creditors and continued, with the defendant obtaining postponements of the three letters of direction. Further creditors' meetings were held, a Creditors' Committee struck, and subsequent letters of direction sent to the defendant by the client and certain creditors. The defendant, in acknowledging a subsequent letter of direction, made no mention of the earlier three letters, nor any explanation of 'all of the proceeds'. One member of the Committee was aware of the initial irrevocable letters of direction. On what was to be the final mortgage draw, the defendant requested and was refused a postponement of the initial three letters. With his client's consent, the defendant disbursed the funds, to pay off the initial three creditors, a mechanics' lien referred in one of the subsequent letters of direction, his legal fees and the balance as per a letter of direction received from two of three members of the Creditors' Committee. Dismissing the action, that (1) there was no negligent misrepresentation as the creditors had continued to advance supplies, not on the basis of the defendant's letter of acknowledgement, but because they considered the project viable. Further, certain other plaintiffs were not aware of the letter, and could not have relied on it. Other plaintiffs did not supply after the letter and therefore did not rely on it. The Court noted that on a balance of probabilities, the defendant's disbursement did not cause the demise of the project. At the time of the disbursement the project was still viable and the plaintiffs made their own decision to cease supplying and to lien the project;  (2) there was no breach of trust as the defendant had no fiduciary duty and had at no time acted for the plaintiffs;  and  (3) there was no breach of undertaking as the undertaking must be considered in all the circumstances, including knowledge of the plaintiffs, the other letters and meetings. The Court concluded that the member of the Creditors' Committee who was aware of the initial irrevocable letters had a duty to advise the other members. The documentation was clear that legal fees would be deducted and the Committee was also aware of the direction to pay the mechanics' lien.","The court dismissed the plaintiff's claim for negligent misrepresentation and breach of trust. The plaintiff had received a number of irrevocable letters of direction from two mortgage brokers, which he acknowledged, requiring him to pay the mortgage brokerage and architectural fees from the next forthcoming mortgage advance from the mortgagees of the project. In early 1987, the first mortgagee to the project had become dissatisfied with the handling of its project funds by one of the principals of and was withdrawing its support. The project was financially tight from the very beginning and cash flow was continuously problem. The plaintiffs had obtained postponements of the mortgage advances in order to allow sufficient funds to be disbursed to other creditors. HELD: Any claim under this ground was dismissed. 1)The plaintiff had not established the basis for a claim under breach of trusts and could not succeed on this ground. 2)The plaintiffs had raised an allegation of breach in trust on the part of the defendant. However, there is no evidence that the defendant was ever in a fiduciary relationship with the plaintiffs nor was he ever retained by the plaintiffs or purporting to act for them or on their behalf. In the respectful opinion the plaintiffs have not established a basis for an allegation under breach. Any claim is therefore dismissed.  3)The court found that the plaintiffs did not establish a foundation on which to base their claim.","The plaintiffs, who were suppliers and creditors to the project, have now sued Mr. Brookes claiming that, in early April of 1987, he disbursed funds contrary to the irrevocable letter of direction dated March 9, 1987.

The court gave him credit at the rate of 1:1.5 for his time on remand, resulting in a net global sentence of six years, five months to be served in a federal penitentiary. The Gladue report was considered and the background of the accused was assessed as an enormous mitigating factor. The court found that this was not an appropriate case to make an order pursuant to s. 743.6 of the Code both because of the multiple Gladue factors and because it had addressed the principles of denunciation and deterrence in the global sentence.","HELD: The Court found that a global sentence of 10 years was appropriate in this case to be served in a federal institution on the manslaughter conviction. The Court reviewed all of the cases provided to it by counsel including the totality principle and the Gladue factors and determined that a total of 6 years, 5 months and 10 years were appropriate in the case of the manslaughter. The court reviewed the three cases provided by counsel and found that the Crown had changed its approach to sentencing. The Crown argued that the Gladues factors were not considered in support of the global sentence as the accused had a lengthy record and was not aboriginal. The evidence showed that the accused was intoxicated by alcohol and/or drugs and had temporarily overcome his demons with the help of his cousin. The accused was convicted of manslaughter and sentenced to a concurrent sentence of 6-and-5 years to be paid in federal prison. The sentencing judge concluded that a world sentence of 11 years was warranted in this context to be serving in a Federal institution on a manslaughter conviction and that the evidence showed the accused's remorse. The trial judge concluded the court could not rely solely on the totality principles and the evidence presented by the Crown. The sentence for the manslaughter was increased to that of a concurrent term of 5 years due to the fact that the trial judge had not considered the Gladuing factors. The sentences for the two manslaughter convictions were reduced to a global term of 10. The maximum sentence for each count was increased from 5 years to 10 years. The average sentence for a murder is between 4 years and 12 years. There are isolated instances of sentences less than 4 years, and sentences greater than 12 years, however they are indeed exceptional.

However, griping is not exactly unusual in a work place, and the type of conduct alleged against the plaintiff would not justify dismissal the first time it came to the employer's attention, if he had been guilty of such conduct while performing only his own job function. Taking all factors into account, the Court considers this is an appropriate notice period to which the plaintiff was entitled. The Court concludes that one or more warnings to an employee must be given before it can be said such activity 'fractures' the employment relationship. In the case of a person in the plaintiff's position, who occupied a junior managerial position in a very specific industry, the notice period should reflect that management positions are fewer in number than non-management positions, and that there is a considerable wage difference between a management position and one that is normally assigned to two persons. The accused was not terminated because of poor job performance in performing his contractual duties as a bodyshop foreman and assistant manager but because of his alleged poor performance in doing the job normally assigned. The employer has the right to expect that employees will not disparage their immediate supervisors or other employees in the course of their employment, and certainly not to clients or customers of the employer. The evidence establishes the plaintiff applied to numerous autobody businesses prior to accepting the employment he did and was not successful in obtaining an equivalent position at an equivalent salary, and there is no suggestion in the material that he was asked if he was prepared to assume both jobs, or if he felt qualified to do so.","[1] The plaintiff applies for summary judgment in his claim for dismissal without just cause brought pursuant to the simplified procedure outlined in Part Forty of the Rules of Court.

The plaintiff is entitled to enter judgment for the damages which flow from this dismissal without just cause as set out hereafter. In this fiat I intend to set only the amount of notice the plaintiff was entitled to, and leave it to the parties to work out the damages the plaintiff is entitled to for the notice period based on his income and value of benefits for the previous 12-month period, less the six weeks’ pay he received, and less the wages and the value of the benefits he has received in his new employment during the notice period.

The accused had been on duty in a marked police car when the accused's vehicle rolled forward and struck the complainant. The complainant was crossing a street outside of a crosswalk when the Crown called three witnesses. The Crown called four witnesses, including the complainant, who was standing with their infant daughter. The defence called the complainant's husband, who had just come out of Super Store, to assist the officer. The officer asked the complainant if he could assist the complainant and the complainant backed up to speak with the officer, who then backed up and struck him. The police officer testified that he did not raise his hands or raise his hand. The defendant's vehicle did not move very short distance forward before striking the complainant; the Crown's evidence that neither seat belt, belonging to the officer or the Crown, locked upon striking the officer; the officer did exercise due diligence both before and after striking the victim. The court found that the accused drove careless. The Court found that both the complainant’s and the Crown’ s witnesses’ statements to the effect that the complainant was not shouting at the officer were not inconsistent. The issue was whether the Crown had proved that the defendant drove without due attention and care. The trial judge found that his vehicle rolled over only a short distance of not more than one foot and not at a fast or accelerating speed. The vehicle rolled into the complainant directly in front of the police vehicle. The pedestrian crossing road adjacent to a parking lot was a pedestrian crossing. The intersection was directly in the complainant area. The collision occurred within a short time.

The accused had been on duty in a marked police car when he was struck by a vehicle. The Crown called three witnesses and the accused backed up to speak with the defence. The defence then called four witnesses. HELD: The accused was found not guilty of the charge. 1) The accused's vehicle rolled forward only a short distance, and not at a fast or accelerating speed, which was in effect careless driving, as distinguished from dangerous driving under the Criminal Code. The actions of the accused which could be considered careless are, firstly, the speed at which he drove past the stopped vehicle, and secondly, his driving forward into the accused. The evidence of the Crown witnesses was that the accused had an oblique motive for doing so, perhaps thinking that the police officer was being insolent and returning to set him straight. 2) The Court of Queen's Bench held that, given the situation, he could not have reasonably anticipated that a person would have been so close in front of him and the fact that the officer did exercise due diligence both before and after striking the accused, the Court of Appeal held that this driving was careless. 3) On a balance of probabilities, the Crown has proved that the driving by the accused was careless, as the Crown failed to prove state of mind, but the accused exercised due diligence and took reasonable care. The court found that the Crown had not proved that Mr. Tyndall's vehicle was moving too fast, as it did not accelerate and did not move forward quickly before striking the officer. The Court also held that the defendant did not have a due diligence defence including 'taking all reasonable steps to avoid the particular event'.

Royal was the primary insurer as holder of Kellogg's blanket fleet coverage. Kellogg's employee was involved in a motor vehicle accident while on company business but was driving his wife's vehicle at the time of the accident. Royal denied coverage and refused to defend on the basis of an exclusionary provision regarding the use of substitute automobiles. It was held at trial that Royal was not obligated to participate. HELD: 1)The case law reveals some inconsistencies with respect to the relationship between the duty to defend and the coverage provided by the policy. Where the policy clearly does not provide coverage, the insurer had no duty to defend. Where a policy only provides coverage for some allegations the insurer is only obligated to defend those allegations which may trigger the obligation to indemnify. When a policy is ambiguous some courts have adopted Thames and have stated the mere possibility that the policy may provide coverage is sufficient to oblige the insurer to defend. 2)Section 209 provides no guidelines as to the scope of the inquiry the judge may engage in. The chamber judge did not define the scope of his inquiry and stated that the standard suggestion that Guardian must raise an arguable point was 'off target'. To determine whether an insurer has the obligation to defend a chamber judge must examine the coverage provided by the policy. The judge made no finding of ambiguity in the exclusionary provision. He simply determined the Honda was not covered by the Royal policy and did not decide the issue of indemnity. 3)The affidavit evidence indicated that the parties lived in the same premises thus that argument was without merit. CONCURRING JUDGMENT: The appeal was dismissed for different reasons.  1)There has been an acceptance of the general concept that the duty to defend is broader than the duty to indemnify. To order an insurer to defend a chamber judge need be less sure the policy provides coverage than would be the case for an actual determination of liability under the policy. 2)There was a factual element which could not be determined on this application such as whether a partially deflated tire constitutes a breakdown within the meaning of the policy and whether the automobile the employee was driving was owned by someone living in the same dwelling. 3)The question centered around the words used in clause 5 of the policy and who it referred to.

The chambers judge erred in his application of the principles of contract interpretation when he decided the Honda was not a 'temporary substitute automobile' within the terms of the Royal policy. 4)Where there is a material difference between the insurers, the chambers judge must determine whether this vehicle was insured under the policy before it can determine whether the insurer is under duty to defending. 5)The court is in a good position as any court will ever be to interpret the meaning of 'insured' in clause 5(c). The fact that the question is arguable should not be conclusive. It would be rare application for a directions which contain no arguable point. 6)The difficulty with chambers judge engaging in an extensive inquiry into policy coverage in an application is the same as the Ontario High Court decision in Re Thames Steel Construction Ltd. and Northern Assurance Co.

He then followed the reasoning of Mahoney J. in the unreported case of Hermanson v. Phoenix Assurance Co. Ltd.

The complainant was prepared to initiate a telephone call to the accused and engage him in a conversation which would likely cause the accused to make admissions or statements which could be confirmatory of her allegations. 3) The authorization clearly permits the police to intercept private communications in relation to an offence under s. 271(1) of the Code.

The law in this country is that evidence of other crimes revealed during the course of a lawful intercept process does not render the evidence obtained inadmissible in relation to an offence not named in the authorization. The focus is on whether the interception was lawfully obtained and executed, not on what is discovered.

During the investigation of that charge, they obtained evidence which is relevant to an offence under s. 153(1)(a) of the Code.

The accused argued that the evidence was inadmissible because it was not contained in the original statement. HELD: The evidence was admissible because there was no Charter breach. The authorization clearly permits the police to intercept telephone communications between the complainant and the accused wherein the complainant would attempt to engage the accused in conversation concerning the alleged improper activity. There was no evidence of bad faith. The Crown agreed that the transcript was an accurate transcription of the telephone conversation and that the Crown agreed the transcript could be made on the basis of the transcription without the necessity of playing the actual recording in court. The Court held that the accused's argument was that the police deliberately navigated around the fact that offences under s. 153(1) were not eligible for intercept authorizations and that they had obtained sufficient evidence to admit the evidence. The evidence is not admissible in relation to an offence not specified in the Charter. The court concluded that there was a Charter breach and that it did not violate the accuseds s. 8 rights. The respondent's applications were dismissed. The trial judge did admit that the conversation was relevant and admissible but the evidence did not constitute conscriptive evidence. There is no evidence that the respondent deliberately navigates around the issue of whether the Crown should be able to ascertain the relationship between the accused and the complainant. The conversation was not relevant to the investigation and was not considered to be relevant. The appellant's argument that the RCMP purposely navigated the issue around the Charter and did not have sufficient evidence before him to issue the telephone intercept authorization was not supported by the evidence before the trial judge. The issue was whether the conversation could be considered relevant to an investigation under s153(1)(a) of the Charter or not. The only conclusion was that there had been a Charter violation. The RCMP had reasonable and probable grounds to intercept private communications between both the complainant's and the respondent's. The police believed that the complainant or alternatively had sexual contact with her while in position of trust and that this would be advantageous to their investigation to intercept a telephone communication between the respondent and the defendant wherein the the complainant consented to the procedure and did in fact contact the accused. The complainant consents to have her private communications recorded in anticipation of receiving responses from the accused that would provide evidence concerning the offences.

In this case if there is a breach, it was not serious and was inadvertent, the result of unmindful draftsmanship. There is no evidence of bad faith. There is no evidence of manipulation. The seriousness of the breach, if there was one, was minimal, and to admit the evidence would not bring the administration of justice into disrepute.","The accused applied for an order that evidence obtained by way of a telephone interception be ruled inadmissible because it is irrelevant.

HELD: 1)Annette Cook's prior statement may be introduced in evidence for the substantive truth of its witnesses. It will be for the jury to decide after receiving appropriate instructions with respect to the evidence of an informant and evidence of a person who has provided evidence different from her statement. 2)The credibility of the witness is determined by the test of reliability set out in R. v. K.G.B. (1993), 79 C.C.R. (3d) 145. 3)The reliability threshold can be met in the absence of an oath where appropriate substitutes for the oath exist. 4)The evidence of the informant was found to be unreliable. 5)The witness was not adverse, but was now telling the truth after lying about certain matters. 6)There was insufficient solemnity attached to the occasion of her swearing the affidavit. The oath was not administered prior to the taking of the statement. 7)The respondent's statements were not demonstrably false. The respondent's statement did not implicate any one but rather attempts to exonerate someone. It was a business decision regularly made by accused persons who are asked to cooperate. 8)It was not possible for the Crown to decide what portions of her statement it wished to accept. 9)The court reviewed the criteria for establishing the threshold of reliability and found that her statement met it on the balance of probabilities. 10)The Crown was satisfied that it had satisfied the requirements for substantive use. The reliability threshold was not met, even if the witness was sworn and warned prior to giving the statement, when it was subsequently known that at least a portion of her statements was false.",0.6189683860232945
