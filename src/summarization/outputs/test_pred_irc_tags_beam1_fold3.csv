Allowing the application, that although the wife upgraded her education during the marriage with encouragement and financial support from the husband, she was entitled to maintenance for an indefinite period. The court reviewed the means and needs of the parties and awarded spousal in addition to child maintenance. The court recognized the indirect financial consequences to a custodial parent in raising children.","The petitioner sought a divorce from the respondent and maintenance for herself and the five-year-old daughter of the marriage. The parties had been married 10 years and had two children. The petitioner sought separation from the husband, who worked in the oil drilling business, for the time he was working in the industry. The husband had worked in various positions for the past 10 years, including as superintendent of an oil rig in Nigeria. The wife was a single economic unit. The respondent was working as a bar manager at minimum wage plus tips. She was interested in pursuing a career in real estate. The Husband was working long hours daily for 28 straight days during which he was confined to the oil rig and then had 28 days off. The Wife was determined to be the single economic units. The Court awarded $266,000 to the husband for the child's care. The court awarded $1,500 to the petitioner for the costs of the separation. The child was to be entitled to maintenance at the rate she was receiving. The mother was to bear the costs associated with the child. The father was to pay $1 million in spousal support. The children were to be divided equally. The marriage was to continue for a period of time. The parents were to have joint custody of the child and the child would bear the cost of the mother's care and maintenance. The agreement between the parties was not to be amended."
1994canlii4796.txt,"The Applicant participated in a group retirement savings plan ('GRSP') created by Crown Life for its employees. The GRSP provided for an annuity income on retirement for each participating employee. To finance her contribution to the GRSP, she secured an interest-free loan from Crown Life and pledged her interest in the GRSP as security for the loan. Subsequent to leaving her employment with Crown Life, she refused to repay her loan and requested that her contributions to the GRSP be transferred to another carrier. When Crown Life refused, she applied under s.63 of the PPSA for an order declaring that Crown Life's security interest in the GRSP offended s. 146(2)(c.3) of the Income Tax Act which prohibits the taking of security in an RRSP in certain circumstances. She also sought orders requiring Crown Life to comply with her request to transfer her contributions and restraining Crown Life from realizing on its security. HELD: Application dismissed. 1)The terms of the GRSP and the security agreement in this case did not offend s.146(2)(c.3) of the Income Tax Act. 2)If the terms of the GRSP were breached by Crown Life, damages would be an adequate remedy. The Applicant's request for a restraining order was therefore refused. 3)Under the terms of the GRSP contract, Crown Life was not entitled to collapse the Plan. 4)No amount was due out of the Plan to the Applicant until she retired or made a proper request for a transfer. In this case her request for a transfer did not comply with the terms of the Plan. There was therefore nothing to which the security interest of Crown Life could attach until a proper request for a transfer was made or until the Applicant commenced her pension.","The applicant sought a declaration under s63 of the Personal Property Security Act that her interest in a group registered retirement savings plan (later defined as the 'Group Plan') was not subject to a security interest she granted to Crown Life. The provisions of s146(2)(c.3) of the Income Tax Act apply to her interest. The applicant sought an order restraining Crown Life from arbitrarily cancelling her participation in the Group Plan. HELD: The application was granted. 1)The provisions of the personal property security act do not apply to the applicant. 2)The loan agreement contains no provision enabling Crown Life to collapse the applicant's account in the group plan and thereby create an attachable pension refund. 3)The applicant has not retired and there appears to be no monetary sum current for Crown Life which could be set off unless a proper request for a transfer has been made by her. 4)The application for a restraining order was denied. 5)The provision of s 146(2) and s58 of the PPSSA does not apply. The loan agreement does not provide for the taking of security interest by way of the loan agreement contravenes s146. The provision of the Plan Contract does not prohibit Crown Life of setting off the applicant against any monetary sum due from it. Since the applicant has retired, there appears no monetary obligation current for the Crown Life until a pro-proper request is made by the applicant by her for a change in her interest to the Group plan."

The City applied for a review. HELD: The City's application was allowed. Under the terms of the collective agreement in force, the employee was actually paid 4 hours pay in excess of the Act's requirements for each of the weeks in question. Pursuant to section 72 of the Act, therefore, these particular terms of the collective agreement applied since they were, when considered in light of the balance of the agreement, more favorable to the employee than the requirements of the Act.","The City applied to review a certificate issued pursuant to s. 60 of the Labour Standards Act declaring that the City of Regina (the ""City"") owed its transit employee $511.08 in wages.

HELD: 1)The certificate was issued pursuant pursuant to ss. 60 and 6(2) of the Act. The City argued that the collective bargaining agreement was more favourable to the employees than the terms of the act. 2)The provisions of the agreement should govern, and not those of the legislation. The provisions of s. 72 of the Code of Conduct should govern. The city's application was allowed and the certificate was amended to show that there were no wages due or owing to Albert Morgan. 3)The City filed various documents including copies of the collective agreement agreement it has with the Amalgamated Transit Union. 4)The agreement's provisions governing pay for holidays were more favourable than those in the Act and the Director's 4 hours pay in excess of the ACT'srequirements."

1996canlii6881.txt,"FIAT. The parties were divorced in 1995 and all issues including spousal maintenance were left in abeyance. The petitioner had agreed to pay $3,000 per month which included child support but the support was reduced to $1,000 and was irregular and late. The two children were living with the petitioner and although old enough to hold jobs, had been unable to find employment. The petitioner's income exceeded $80,000 annually but he had been suspended with pay and the status of his employment was uncertain. HELD: 1)It was premature to fix the amount of spousal maintenance as asked for by the applicant. There were too many unknowns including the future of the petitioner's future job and income and how much the applicant would require should she go to university in the fall and what the children would do about future education. 2)The petitioner was not entitled to unilaterally reduce the maintenance. 3)The petitioner was directed to pay $1,500 plus $200.00 per month until the shortfall was paid in full.  4)The applicant was awarded costs of the application.","FIAT.

Had these payments continued the applicant would have recovered $6,000 and recovered $8,000 at the rate suggested by the Department of Justice. 3)The court found that the petitioner was not in any way entitled to unilateral reduction of the $1 million he consistently gave up to 1995 to less than $1 per month without at all consulting with him."
1997canlii787.txt,"After a sub-contractor failed to complete its contract work, the plaintiff, a supplier of materials to the sub-contractor sued the general contractor and the surety under the terms of a labour and Material Payment Bond for payment of a balance owing to it by the sub-contractor. The Bond contained a provision limiting the liability of the surety and the principal to make payment to any claimant not having a contract directly with the principal. Dismissing the action with costs, that there was no evidence of intention to contract, valuable consideration, or binding promise to pay between the general contractor and the supplier. With respect to the principal, as the Bond limits the liability of the surety and principal to make payment to a claimant such as the plaintiff not having a contract directly with the principal, liability is limited by the Bond to the amount which the principal would have been obliged to pay to the plaintiff if the provisions of the Mechanics' Lien Act applied to the work. As the contract was with the Crown, and the Act is not binding on the Crown, the general contractor was not obliged to pay anything to the plaintiff.

The alleged offences occurred in the complainant's home when she was between the ages of 13 and 15. HELD: The accused was found not guilty on both counts. 1)There was insufficient confirmatory evidence for proof of guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. The evidence showed an escalating pattern of intrusive behaviour by the accused who admitted to touching her on two occasions and to have been on top of her once.

The gym bag constituted non-conscriptive evidence. 3)If there were any violations of the accused's Charter rights (and it was concluded there were not) they were of a minor nature and not sufficient to engage the provisions of s.24(2) of the Charter.

Ace was also a client of defence counsel and so defence counsel would not be able to cross-examine Ace.

The accused's right to full answer and defence had been prejudiced only by not being told that the accused's name was mentioned as a co-defendant in the disclosure given to defence.

2006nssc139.txt,"The wife sought to have the terms of the parties' separation agreement incorporated into the corollary relief judgment following a four year marriage. The husband sought to vary the provisions of the agreement regarding spousal and child support on the basis that the particulars of the agreement did not reflect his net business income derived from self-employment. The husband argued that he had entered into the separation agreement (which provided for joint custody of their young child, gave the wife all of the matrimonial assets with the exception of the husband's vehicle, and provided for spousal support in the amount of $600 per month for 15 years) only as an attempt to have the wife stay in the local area with the child. The wife had since moved with the child to New Brunswick where she was living with her parents and attending university; she was renting out the matrimonial home. Pursuant to the current court order, she was contributing the sum of $140 per month to the husband's access costs. Husband's current income set and child support awarded; the husband shall be responsible for 50 percent of the after tax child care costs; an additional $300 of spousal support ordered per month while the child remains in New Brunswick to address the access costs in the mother's budget; spousal support is reviewable in the event that these circumstances change, and at any rate, upon the completion of the mother's current degree; the mother shall not remove the child from the Province of New Brunswick to live in any other province without the father's consent. Although the court could not interfere with the agreement under s. 29 of the Matrimonial Property Act, the spousal and child support geared at keeping the wife in the local area and ensuring that her needs were addressed had all changed and a new arrangement was necessary to reflect the access costs among other issues. The wife had chosen to move away from child care services provided by the family that were practically free, as well as significant financial support and the ability to work in the furniture business with her father-in-law; she was not now pursuing a line of education which would build on her previous skills. Her educational expenses ought not be the basis for assessing spousal support and the duration of support set out in the separation agreement far exceeded what might be imposed by a court given the years they were together and their income disparity. The court reviewed the husband's history of income and expenses in setting his income for child support purposes.","The petitioner sought a variation of the provisions regarding child support and spousal support in accordance with the Separation Agreement entered into between the parties in 2004. The parties were married for six years and had lived together for six months. The petitioner had commenced divorce proceedings in 2004 and had commenced living with her parents. The husband had commenced a new business and had made significant improvements to the home. The wife had recently commenced a degree in Business Administration and was seeking a variation in the provisions concerning child support. The respondent sought a reduction in the amount of child support, spousa and costs with a division of property. The mother had been working part-time as a social worker for the past six years. She had recently completed a degree and was pursuing a career in Business Management. The father had commenced work as a truck driver. The two parties had been married for four years and the parties had lived in separate and apart for six of that time. The marriage had been going on for some time. It was clear that the parties were in a relationship and that mobility would eventually become an issue. The court found that the respondent had not made an effort to negotiate a mobility restriction clause. The agreement was not a complete and complete agreement. The applicant had not been able to obtain employment insurance and was not able to pay child support on the basis of her income. The Court found that there was no evidence that the petitioner had suffered from any obstacle or impairment."

With respect to spousal support the agreement provides that it is the intention of the parties that spousal support will be based on a division of income until July 1, 2011.HELD: 1) The petitioner seeks a spousal support order in which the court is asked to impute income and then apply the provisions of their interspousal contract to determine quantum. The interspousal contract does not contemplate variation of the spousal support obligation in the event of a material change of circumstance. It will be for the trial judge to determine the intention of the parties when the agreement makes reference to the adjustments which 'will consider Technologies likely future earnings based upon whether Paul's contract is renewed with the Provincial Government'. This is not an appropriate case in which to make an order for interim spousal support. The petitioner is entitled to support under the agreement and in the circumstances as they presently exist. 2) With regard to child support, there is no question that Melanie remains a child of the marriage while she is attending her educational program. Insofar at the respondent's income is concerned, the gross income to the corporation is $65,000 per year. The respondent provided a pay stub for May 2006. It is not really a pay stub, but extrapolating from that statement the court concluded that the respondent's gross taxable income from the corporation as a result of the $65,000 contract is approximately $53,000.

The petitioner was to work part-time and the respondent was to pay $65 per month in the amount of $741 per month for the support of their two children. The respondent was not to pay any spousousal assistance. The court noted that the agreement did not contemplate a variation of spouse support obligation in the event of a material change in circumstances.
2007skqb376.txt,"The respondent applies for an order varying the custody order by changing the primary residence from the petitioner to the respondent. HELD: 1) The present circumstances are remarkably similar to the circumstances in Bzowey v. Bzowey, 2005 SKQB 12. In both cases, the Court is asked to make the change based solely on the wishes of the child. There is even evidence from the custody and access report from 2005 that the children, or at least the older child, Jill, expressed similar sentiments about living with her mother. It cannot even be strenuously argued that the wishes of the child, Jill, have in fact changed. Those considerations were before the Court in the form of the custody and access report when the decision was made in 2005. 2) The Court should be loathe to make a variation order solely on the expressed wishes of a child of 11 or 12 years of age without some evidence as to why that current expression of interest has been stated. It may well be that the child truly does wish a change. It may also be that the child, as was referred to in the custody and access report, may be simply reflecting the views and therefore the pressures placed on the child by the non-custodial parent. 3) No evidence has been put forward about the negative impact of the continuation of the current order. There is no information before the Court to suggest that the current situation is no longer in the best interests of the children. No material change has been demonstrated. The application is dismissed.","The father brought an application for an order varying the child support order granted by the court. The father argued that there had been a clear declaration in two separate writings of the oldest child's desire to have primary residence change from her father to her mother. Further, there was some evidence that the younger child wishes to live with her mother or live with a similar residence as her older sister. HELD: The application was dismissed. 1)As no material change has been demonstrated, the court found that the application must be dismissed. 2)The court found no material difference in the circumstances of the child. The court found as no material changes had been demonstrated that this application must not be dismissed as it was not in the child's best interests."

There is conflicting information about the nature and extent of the petitioner father's parenting duties. The respondent has chosen to move to Victoria to attend school. She applies as the primary parent to have the child go with her. The petitioner would like Kaira to remain in Saskatchewan and have regular contact with each parent on alternating weeks. HELD: 1) The residence status quo in this case is Regina and Kaira shall, pending trial, reside in Regina. The Court cannot determine on conflicting affidavits what the primary parent status quo is. 2) It is in the best interest that the child see both parents. There was a similar course in Saskatoon that the respondent could have taken which would have made more frequent changes possible, but her affidavit indicates she thinks the Saskatoon course is inferior to the one she is taking in Victoria. 3) Pending trial the child shall be parented by the petitioner for 28 days, and thereafter by the respondent for 28 days and such parenting shall continue to alternate for each 28 day period thereafter until further order.

2009skqb445.txt,"The accused is faced with a 24 count indictment associated with allegations of involvement in the sale of controlled substances. The motion, made pursuant to s. 7, 11 and 24 of the Charter of Rights is for an order that the accused 'be provided with full disclosure in a useable format'. The motion has two components. The first relates to the method in which disclosure has been provided, the 'useable format'. The second is whether full disclosure that would allow the accused to provide a full answer and defence has been provided.  The second issue is to be dealt with by a 'Laporte inventory', name for the procedure in R. v. Laporte (1993), 113 Sask. R. 34 (C.A.).HELD: 1) There are some 30,000 to 40,000 pages of disclosure made to the defence. In addition, there are 275 audio file, 50 video files and a large series of photos. The defence seeks photocopies of all officers' notebooks organized by date and officer. The basis of the defence's argument is firstly, equality of use or a level playing field should be created with respect to the provision of documents used by the Crown and, secondly, trial fairness requires the particulars of the police officers' notes be provided in the format requested. The defence argues that if the Crown is going to be using paper copies of some documentation because it finds that use more convenient and effective, then the defence should be provide with the same paper copies to level the playing field. 2) The defence has candidly advised that the issue surrounding the defence of a serious drug charge usually starts with the validity of the search warrant, and the information used by the police in obtaining the search is crucial, not just the information that was provided to the official issuing the warrant but any information that may have been withheld. The affidavits in support of the search warrants in this case are easily found in the database, and cross- referencing to the police officers' notes in support of that information is available. What is not easily available and, for the purposes of the Crown, not relatively important is the balance of the information that may have been obtained by the officer not disclosed by affidavit. This information is often crucial for the defence. 3) In this case, given the nature of the charges, the number of police officers involved in the investigation leading up to the issuance of the warrants and cost of obtaining hard copies, the Crown should provide hard copies of the notes made by police officers in the notebooks. It is ordered that the notebooks of those officers who will be testifying at trial are to be provided to the defence in hard copy in chronological order. In all other respects, the nature and format of the disclosure provided to date is appropriate in that it has been provided in a reasonably accessible manner which does not detract from the right of the accused to make full answer and defence.  4) A useful discussion of electronic disclosure and the issues involved is found in R. v. Piaskowski, 2007 MBQB 68, in which the Court reviews extensively the use of electronic disclosure as opposed to paper disclosure.",HELD: The motion was granted and the matter was set aside. The court ordered that the accused be provided with full disclosure in usable format. The issue was whether full disclosure that would allow the accused to provide a full answer and defence had been provided. The notebook of those officers who will be testifying at trial were to be provided to the defence in hard copy in chronological order. The Court ordered that notebooks of those officer who will testify at trial be provided in hard copies in chronological fashion.

2009skqb506.txt,"The appellant landlord and mother appeals from a decision of the Hearing Officer of the Office of the Residential Tenancies dismissing her claim for possession. The landlords are mother and son. The mother lives out of province for a number of years. She returns in summers to reside in the premises. This year she wanted to return to her premises on a full time basis. She found that her son had rented out a portion of the house to a Tenant and had signed a 3 year lease. She sought an order that the Tenant vacate the premises. The Hearing Officer found he had no jurisdiction to deal with the dispute between the two landlords. He found he could only deal with the situation between the landlords and the tenant and found that the tenant had signed a lease in good faith and is entitled to the rights the lease affords and is entitled to remain in the premises. HELD: There was no valid tenancy agreement. The Act only applies to tenancy agreements and to circumstances where rental units or residential property is validly rented by a landlord to a tenant. In the circumstances, the Hearing Officer did not have jurisdiction to deal with this dispute. However, the Hearing Officer did err in law in determining that the tenant was entitled to the rights that the lease affords. 1) A room in a house is a rental unit capable of being the subject of a tenancy. 2) Clearly there was no participation by both owners in entering into this lease agreement. Mr. Koch's evidence would lead to the opposite conclusion. There was no express consent of principal and agent.  3) The facts as described by the Hearing Officer do not support an agency by estoppel. This can arise where one person has acted so as to lead another to believe that he or she has authorized a third person, without any actual authority, to act on his behalf and that other person, in such belief, enters into a transaction with that third person. The tenant here was not aware that the mother was an owner and the mother did not lead the tenant to believe that her son was authorized to act on her behalf.","The appellant appeals from a decision of the Office of Residential Tenancies, dated August 27, 2009. The appellant claims that the Landlord has breached the rights of the tenant by serving notice to vacate and seeks an order that the landlord withdraw the notice to leave.

The hearing officer did not err in law in finding that there was no valid tenancy agreement between the appellant and the landlord. 2) The Court found that there were no valid leases. The Act does not apply to tenancy agreement and to circumstances where rental units or residential property is validly rented by a landlord to a tenant. 3) The appeal was dismissed. 4) The appellant was estopped from denying the fact of the third person's agency by serving a notice to the tenant.

2010skqb145.txt,"The parties were in a relationship for over 5 years though they never married. The petitioner now seeks access to the respondent's daughter from an earlier relationship. The parties' relationship was tumultuous and included some incidents of domestic violence, which the child may have been exposed to. There are concerns regarding the interactions between the respondent's daughter and the petitioner's own children. The petitioner must establish, firstly, that he has 'sufficient interest' to bring this application, per s. 6(1) of The Children's Law Act, 1997. HELD: The application for access is dismissed. In determining whether a non-family applicant is a person with a sufficient interest, the Court must consider a variety of factors including: the extent or degree of the applicant's involvement in the child's life, the duration of that involvement, the level of intimacy and the quality of the relationship between the applicant and the child, how the relationship between the applicant and the child was represented to the world, and whether the applicant provided financially for the child. The petitioner has demonstrated that he is a person of sufficient interest; the relationship between the parties was not short and, during its lifespan, the petitioner formed a close bond with the child and was involved with her life. The community viewed them generally as father and daughter. However, the Court cannot conclude that requiring the child to visit the petitioner would be of any benefit to her. This child has already had to contend with multiple 'fathers' and multiple 'siblings', many of whom have been only temporary or fleeting personalities in her life. The confusion that this has no doubt caused her should not be further compounded by requiring her to make even more adjustments in her understanding of what 'family' means. Access to the petitioner is not in the best interests of this child.","HELD: The Court found that the petitioner was a person with a sufficient interest. The Court held that because the petitioner is a step-parent, he does not need to establish that he falls within the category of persons having a'sufficient interest' to bring this application."
2011nssc455.txt,"The accused, who was charged with 21 counts under one indictment relating to events on two separate dates, applied to have the counts severed. First, on the basis of the dates of the occurrences and, secondly, to separate the so-called 'status offences' based on a pre-existing firearm prohibition order. It was argued the Crown had combined all the counts into one indictment to improve its evidentiary position with regard to the unproven connection of possession of the gun on the two separate dates and to be able to cross-examine the accused on the events of both days should he choose to only testify on the events of one day. The Crown argued that expert evidence showing a match between the gun used in the shooting on the first date and that found by the arresting officers on the second date showed a temporal and continuity nexus between the two events. The accused's  videotaped statement to the police was also a common piece of evidence to both dates. Application for severance dismissed. The most significant issue was the possibility of the accused being subject to cross-examination for events of both days if he chose to testify only concerning the events of one day but his position that he had no association with the gun and that it was not in his possession on either day indicated that his decision on whether to testify would most likely be the same in relation to both sets of counts and, given that there was no jury involved, there was no risk of improper inferences being drawn. The Crown should not be limited in the presentation of its evidence through a severance of counts because of the tenuous nexus between the two events.","The accused is charged with 21 counts under an indictment dated September 1, 2010 consisting of one count of attempted murder, several charges pertaining to the unlawful possession and use of a firearm, and a number of status offences based on a pre-existing firearm prohibition order. The accused seeks severance of the 21 counts in the indictment on two bases which, if granted, would require three separate trials in all. HELD: The application for severance was dismissed on both the bases proposed. 1)The accused's statement was crafted broadly enough to serve as factual summary for this application as well as other circumstances that the judge found may prevent the accused from testifying. It is therefore incorporated by reference in this decision. 2)The interests of justice encompass the accused's right to be tried on the evidence admissible against him, as well a society's interest in seeing that justice is done in reasonably efficient and cost-effective manner. The interests of the accused encompass the same factors as those of the general public. The common thread between the 21 count and the other two is that the accused might want to testify with respect to the events of April 8th but not in respect of the events April 14th. The court may, where it is satisfied that the interests of a justice so require, order the accused or defendant be tried separately on one or more of the counts."

In the past, he has been diagnosed as paranoid schizophrenic and suffering from a personality disorder but is currently, according to his physician, of sound mind. He qualifies since 1987 for a disability pension under CPP by reason of his mental disability which provides for a basic income of $580 plus GTS rebate for a total of $630 per month. The petitioner lives on a section of farm land which was brought into the marriage by the respondent, of which one quarter contains the matrimonial home. The petitioner and children live in that home. The petitioner is 39 years old and is also unemployed because she is an incomplete quadriplegic. The farm land is rented out from which the petitioner receives rental income. The petitioner enjoys an income of $3,400 per month while the respondent receives $630 per month. HELD: The petitioner is ordered to pay the respondent the annual sum of $6,000 paid in monthly installments of $500. There is no juridical reason why the petitioner should obtain the total revenue owned by the respondent particularly when he brought the land into the marriage. In fact, fairness and equity would suggest just the opposite, at least in respect to one half of the revenue.

The husband had been diagnosed as paranoid schizophrenic and suffering from a personality disorder. In the past he had been able to live with a friend and pay no rent.

The complainant admitted that he threw the first punch but said that he did so because the male accused had already broken the windows in his car and punched his passenger and was not 'coming to apologize.' HELD: The accused were convicted of assault. Whether the physical altercation was precipitated by jealousy or a drug deal, there is no doubt that the accused was the aggressor throughout. He smashed one, if not two, car windows. The accused's behaviour was threatening and the Court accepted that the accused had not attended the house to apologize. The complainant took necessary and lawful action to protect himself and his family under s. 37 of the Criminal Code.  While the Court did not believe that either complainant used a weapon, if it did occur it would have been justified in the context of the assault. The accused was acquitted of mischief because the Crown failed to prove the value of the broken windows.","The accused were charged with assaulting the complainant. The accused were both in the early hours of November 8, 2010. The complainant had purchased some cocaine from a friend of the friend. The two accused were driving around the strip mall when the altercation occurred. The victim was injured in the right eyebrow and left eye. The second accused, who was driving his mother's car at the time, was also injured. The third accused, the accused's girlfriend, who testified that she was drinking, was the main aggressor. The physical altercation in this case was precipitated by jealousy or by a drug deal gone bad. The actions of the accused were aggressive. The assault was threatening behaviour and the accused said that he felt threatened. The Crown and defence both testified that they were drinking and that they had been drinking. The court found the accused not guilty of the first count on information 24414281. The Court found the second count on Information 24414282. The first count was dismissed on information 24314281 because the accused had not been drinking at the accused’s house. The evidence was that the accused both had been in the middle of a fight and that the complainant was trying to break the back passenger window of the car. The altercation was violent and threatening. The three photographs of the injured parties showed the accused in the street fighting. The defendant was driving the car at a high rate of speed and was yelling at the victim to get out of the way. The driver was driving slowly by the trailer when the assault occurred. He was on top of the victim when the two accused got in the car and punched the victim in the face. The vehicle was then driven away from the trailer. The police were unable to prove that the damage was done to the car or that the driver was injured. HELD: Whether the physical altercation was precipitating by jealousy, by a drugs deal gone good, there was no doubt that the two men were the aggressors throughout. This was threatening and the defendant when he said that the person he felt threatening was the complainant when he told the accused he felt attacked. The injuries were not severe. The other accused was not there to apologize. The defence did not cross-examine on this point. The injured parties were both wearing protective clothing and wearing protective equipment. The alleged altercation was not justified. The assaults were violent and the complainant admitted that she had been involved in the altercation.

In the intervening years, the Chief of the defendant Indian Band died as did the person who had been appointed the proper person to be examined on behalf of the defendant.HELD: The decision to dismiss an application for want of prosecution is discretionary. A three step process was set out in International Capital Corporation v. Robinson Twigg &amp; Ketilson et al., 2010 SKCA 48. In this case, a delay of in excess of 5 years does not constitute inordinate delay when compared to the progress in comparable cases. The amount claimed is significant and there is no suggestion in the amended defence that the goods, products and related services were not provided. Subject to compliance with undertakings, the matter is ready to be referred to pre-trial settlement conference. There is no legal excuse offered on the part of the plaintiff for the inordinate delay in this case. The plaintiff bears the onus of convincing the Court on a balance of probabilities that the delay was excusable and its materials fall short. While there may be some prejudice to the defendant in mounting a defence because of the death of some of the people who were intimately involved in the dealings between the parties, there is an individual available who is intimately familiar with the dealings between the parties and there are discovery transcripts that might be of assistance. Both parties have records and documentation that can be tendered at a trial. The Court concluded that the interest of justice favored continuing with the action. The application to dismiss the action for want of prosecution was denied.","The defendant applied for the dismissal of the plaintiff's claim for want of prosecution pursuant to the inherent powers of the court. The defendant applied based in debt for goods and services provided to Ochapowace in relation to the construction of portable classrooms, 10 housing units and the purchase of mobile homes. The indebtedness claimed owing was $521,283.89. The plaintiff had been responsible for an inordinate and legally inexcusable delay in pursuing its claim. The defendants had agreed to the appointment of a person sufficiently knowledgeable about the defendant's dealings and appropriately representative of Ochapeowace to be examined for discovery on behalf of the defendant. The applicant had been advised that the defendant would suffer serious prejudice if the matter proceeds to trial. The court found that a delay of that length of time in advancing the plaintiff’s want of a prosecution of it did constitute inordinate delay when compared to comparable cases. The Court of Appeal reviewed the Carey case approach and found that although the delay in this case was inordinate, it did not constitute inordinately and legally indefcusable, nevertheless the prejudice suffered by the defendant did not reach the level of serious prejudice as listed in the ICC case."
2_2011nssc486.txt,"The parties were married almost nine years and have two children, ages eight and 10.  The mother was highly critical of the father's ability to parent, and opposed his application for shared custody. She accused him of abusive behavior, using drugs/abusing alcohol, and claimed he did not help parent when they lived together. The level of conflict between the two was high. Each lived with new partners. They both filed expense statements showing significant monthly deficits but, since they had declared bankruptcy, there was no evidence of how they were meeting the shortfall. The mother sought a share of the father's pension, including his pre-marriage contributions, spousal support and child support. She worked through most of the marriage, but earned a lot less than the father did. Interim shared parenting, with a review in eight months. This is not an ideal arrangement, but the alternatives will leave the children worse off. The father was more credible; the mother's allegations are unsubstantiated. While he's contributed to the conflict in the past, he is making an effort while the mother and her partner are not. The mother will have the final say on health related matters, and the father will have the final say on the choice of childcare and helping with homework (because he is francophone and better able to help). If the mother is unable to learn how to work with the father, the court will consider awarding him custody. On review, the court will consider the parties' ability to communicate and cooperate, including whether or not they are able to agree about extracurricular activities for the children. The father will pay child support in the set-off amount. While he has twice her income, the mother hasn't proven the set-off amount is insufficient to enable her to meet the children's needs while they're with her. It's impossible to have a deficit without disclosing the debt instruments used to support debt accumulation. Her partner is either meeting her shortfall or her expenses are overstated. It would be unfair and unconscionable to award her half of the pre-marriage pension contributions based on the length of the marriage and the fact she wasn't economically dependant on the father. She's not entitled to spousal support. Even if she was, the father has no ability to pay given his obligations to the children.","Family Law – Shared parenting, Shared Parenting, Federal child support, Spousal Support, Divorce Legislation – Section of the Federal Child Support Guidelines – Section 7 The parties were in a shared parenting arrangement and the respondent was the primary care parent. The respondent had been paying a proportionally greater share of the child support than the mother and had not considered the economics of the choice of after school care. The evidence provided by the respondent and his witnesses was credible. The court found that the respondent's evidence concerning the respondent’s involvement in parenting was credible and that the information provided by his witnesses in respect to the respondent had not been proven to be unreliable. The Court held that the evidence did not support the respondent having a significant financial or emotional problem with his or her parenting arrangement. The parties had a common interest in living together and the relationship was sustainable. The father’d been paying the proportionally larger share of child support and the evidence showed that the relationship had not deteriorated. The mother’ll be entitled to counselling from the respondent. The child support table was to come into effect January 1, 2012. The parents were to obtain a date on the docket for a return to this court eight months from the date of this decision for a review to determine whether the conflict between the parties has ceased or at least been substantially reduced. The children were to be in the joint custody of the respondent with the mother. The information provided was credible as well. The applicant’ s income for 2010 was $73,698. The Father’ed income for 2011 was $70,698 and the child was entitled to a monthly credit card payment of $100. The debt payment to the Trustee in Bankruptcy was $100 and the monthly credit-card payment of a $100 was $1,256. The relationship was characterized as a “friction” between the respondent, the respondent father and the mother, and the parties’ relationship was one of mutual respect and respect. The petitioner’S income was not considered. The agreement between the petitioner and the father was that the parties would jointly pay the proportional share of this child support. The fact that the father had been paid the proportionate share of that child support was not a factor in the decision to grant the respondent joint custody. The decision to allow the respondent to continue the children in the care of the mother was not made lightly. The joint custody arrangement was not appropriate."
2_2011skpc80.txt,"The accused was found guilty on a charge of assaulting a police officer contrary to s. 270.01(1) of the Criminal Code. The Crown applied under s. 752.1(1) for an order remanding the accused for an assessment by an expert for use as evidence in an application to have the accused declared a dangerous offender. The defence opposed the application on the basis that the predicate offence was not a serious personal injury offence and it was not within the realm of possibility that the accused could be found to be a dangerous offender. The accused was 50 years old. He had a criminal record commencing in 1976 which included 58 Criminal Code convictions. Fifteen of his prior convictions were for violent offences and six related to police officers. He had violated mandatory supervision orders on three separate occasions and had breached a conditional sentence order. The crimes of violence on his record involved the use of a weapon on more then one occasion. The facts of the predicate offence involved swinging a branch at a police officer. The officer had tasered the accused, but it had no effect. The accused grabbed a branch and swung it in sufficient proximity to cause the officer to back up, drop his taser and draw his sidearm. The officer provided a victim impact statement outlining the fear he experienced and the psychological impact the offence had on himself and his family. HELD: The offence is a serious personal injury offence as defined in s. 752. The accused picked up the branch with the intention of using it against the officer and it was of sufficient size that if the accused had struck the officer it would have caused serious damage. The accused's actions were found to have endangered or been likely to endanger the officer's life or safety and to have inflicted or been likely to inflict severe psychological damage. Given the number and nature of violent offences on the accused's record, the fact that many of the offences involve violence against police officers and the accused's prolonged issues with alcohol, a pattern of behaviour has been established. The best predictor of future behaviour is past behaviour and there is likelihood that the accused will cause injury in the future. The accused has demonstrated indifference to the reasonably foreseeable consequences to other persons of his behaviour. Given the serious nature of the offence and the accused's prior record for similar offences, a sentence of two years or more is possible.  It is not beyond the realm of possibility that the accused could be found to be a dangerous offender. The assessment under s. 752.1 was ordered.","The Crown applied pursuant to s. 752.1(1) of the Code for an order remanding the accused for an assessment performed by an expert for use as evidence in an application to have him declared a dangerous offender. Defence counsel submitted the offence was a serious personal injury offence and the accused did not use violence. The accused had a lengthy criminal record and had 67 prior convictions, four of which were for violent offences. The Crown had alleged that the accused had used violence against the police officer. The court found that the offence is a serious injury offence as defined by s.752. The offence is classified as a serious'serious personal injury' offence as determined by s752(1)(a)(ii) and jurisprudence that has interpreted this section states that a person with a long history of violent or dangerous behaviour is a person who is at a high risk of injury. The offender has a long record of violent and dangerous behaviour and the Crown must prove a substantial degree of indifference on the part of the offender respecting the reasonably foreseeable consequences to other persons of his behaviour. The Court found that given the accused's lengthy criminal history, the Crown's application to remand him for an assessed assessment was not unreasonable. The fact that the Crown had relied on s.713(1(a)(i) and s.705(1)) in its approach to the sentencing of the accused, which was based on the conclusion that the offences were violent and that the offender had a history of violence, the accused was likely to cause serious injury, and the court found the accused to be a dangerous person. The sentence imposed was a'serious injury offence' as defined in s.725(1). The accused was convicted of assaulting the police constable and was sentenced to two years in prison. The officer was injured when the accused swung the weapon at him. The weapon was of a size that, as the court noted when giving the decision after trial, there was no doubt that if struck in the head with this object, it could cause serious damage."

The appellants appealed the decision of the Taxing Master to reduce the solicitor's account to $4,000 from $20.00. HELD: The appeal was dismissed and the taxation of costs confirmed. 1)The appellant's argument that the taxing master erred in principle was not supported by the evidence. 2)The taxing Master was not in error in stating that as a generalization, legal charges must bear some reasonable relationship to the value of the matter at issue. Once such error is shown the judge hearing the appeal may exercise all the powers set out in Rule 63.40. 3)The court found that the appellant's appeal was not of a sufficient proportionate proportionate to the amount taxed. The taxing officer was not acting in error."
3_1995canlii6053.txt,"The accused was charged with failing to appear at his trial on a charge of impaired driving. The impaired driving charge was subsequently stayed. When the charge of failing to appear came on for trial the accused claimed a 'lawful excuse' for his failure to appear on the impaired driving charge. His excuse was that the next shift at work had failed to arrive on time and that this had made it impossible for him to get to court on time. This excuse was rejected and he was convicted. He appealed. HELD: Appeal dismissed.  1)Whether an accused has a lawful excuse is determined with reference to common law principles. It normally includes all of the defences which the common law considers sufficient reason to excuse a person from criminal liability. 2)The Court was unable to say that the finding by the trial judge that the accused had no lawful excuse for failing to attend court, was not supported by the evidence; nor could it say her conclusions were clearly wrong so as to make the decision unreasonable.","The accused was charged with an impaired driving offence. He attended court and indicated he would be retaining a lawyer. The Crown stayed the original impaired driving charge. The trial judge rejected the accused's submission that he had a 'lawful excuse' for not attending court. HELD: The appeal was allowed on appeal. 1)The trial judge accepted the accused\'s submission that the trial judge ought to have accepted his excuse for not appearing. 2)The accused's feelings were further bruised by the fact that the original charge was eventually stayed by the Crown. In her reasoned decision, the trial court rejected the appellant's submission he had had a lawful excuse for failing to attend court. The appeal is challenged on appeal on appeal to determine whether the accused advanced a 'legal excuse' or by narrowing it to include only certain excuses."
3_1997canlii11217.txt,"Three brothers who carried on a family farm operation and family farm implement dealership applied for a receiving order against the respondent who had been in two real estate partnerships with them. The Partnerships sustained heavy operating losses since 1989 and the petitioners had made large capital contributions on behalf of the defaulting partners in order to prevent the Partnerships from defaulting on the mortgages. The defaulting partners obtained the benefits of business losses which they used to offset their other sources of income and to decrease their personal income tax liability by significant amounts, obtaining benefits without paying for them. The petitioners alleged that Ashton had committed three acts of bankruptcy within the six months prior to filing the petition including ceasing to pay liabilities as they became due in failing to make payments to the petitioners, making a fraudulent conveyance to his wife and disposing of his property with intent to defraud or defeat his creditors by permitting his interest in the Securities to be purportedly seized by his wife. HELD: A receiving order was granted. 1)No adequate explanation was offered by Ashton who was a wealthy individual for his failure to pay his partnership obligations. It was common ground that Ashton had paid nothing toward his partnership obligations since 1993. The defendant admitted that he was indebted to the petitioners in the amount of approximately $278,758 and that he had received substantial tax advantages as a result of his involvement in the two partnerships.  2)The majority of the respondent's wealth consisted of the Securities purportedly seized by his wife in 1996. The preservation order was continued for 30 days to permit the Trustee in Bankruptcy to determine whether the bankruptcy estate wished to challenge these transactions.","The Petitioners were three brothers from the District of Perdue, Saskatchewan who carried on a family farm operation and operated a farm implement dealership.

The petitioner had refused to pay the petitioner in the amount claimed. The Petitioners applied for a receiving order against the respondent. HELD: The petitioner was found to be indebted to the petitioner. 1)The petitioner had ceased to meet his liabilities generally as they become due. 2)The respondent had ceased his obligations generally as he became indebted. 3)The Petitioner had received substantial tax advantages as a result of his involvement in the two real estate ventures. 4)The Court was not satisfied that the receiving order should be granted."

The father would have access on alternating weekends and for a three hour period one weekday provided the child was returned by the bedtime set by the mother. Although both parents genuinely love the child and were equally competent caregivers, neither demonstrated that sole parenting offered an advantage to him.

3_2002skca56.txt,"A complaint was made in 1991 to the Human Rights Commission that the Gallery could only be entered by stairs and was inaccessible to wheelchair users. A Board of Inquiry appointed under the Saskatchewan Human Rights Code concluded in 1993 that the appellant's complex impeded physical access to the premises, facilities and services and lacked proper amenities for persons who are wheelchair-reliant. The Board specifically ordered it remained seized of the matter and the hearing would be reconvened to hear further evidence. The Court of Queen's Bench confirmed the Gallery continued to discriminate against disabled members of the public by failing to provide access and accessible services and ordered the appellant to construct or renovate washrooms to meet requirements of the National Building Code of Canada. The Court of Appeal set aside the Queen's Bench decision and restored the Board's decision. During those proceedings, the property was transferred to HKR, which undertook further renovations. In 1997 upon request by the Commission, the Board reconvened and concluded there had not been compliance, which was confirmed by the Court of Queen's Bench. This was not appealed. An appeal of the Board's 1998 order to construct or renovate the bathrooms was dismissed and it was found the Board did not err in adding HKR as a party nor exceeded its jurisdiction in finding the appellant had not complied with the original order. The appellant appealed that judgment principally on the ground of error in not finding the Board exceeded its jurisdiction in making the order as the original order did not include a requirement that it construct wheelchair accessible washrooms. HELD: The appeal was dismissed with costs on double Column V. The Queen's Bench judge did not err in finding the appellant could not, at that stage of proceedings, question the original order made by the Board in 1993 (ordering the appellant to cease impeding physical access to the premises, facilities and services). The issue had been previously determined and the order was reinstated by the Court of Appeal. The Board acted entirely within the terms of its original order. It retained jurisdiction to confirm compliance. The original order cannot be challenged at this late date.","The appellant appeals a decision of the Saskatchewan Human Rights Commission confirming the second decision of Board of Inquiry appointed by the Minister of Justice under The Saskatchewan Human rights Code. The appellant contended that the original order did not include a requirement that it construct washrooms which were accessible to wheelchair reliant members of the public. HELD: The appeal is dismissed with cost on double Column V. The Board acted entirely within the terms of its original order, an order in which it had retained jurisdiction, to confirm compliance with the order and which had been confirmed by this Court. The extent of the order, that is whether it was confined to the external access of the premises, facilities and services and whether it had been complied with, was the very question the Board reserved jurisdiction to determine. The original order cannot be challenged at this late date. The appeal was dismissed with costs on double column V."
3_2003canlii64101.txt,"The mother moved for the dismissal of the pending permanent care trial, arguing that, applying the reasoning in a recent Court of Appeal decision, the court had lost jurisdiction. No trial had been held on any issue as all matters had proceeded to this point with the consent of the parties. The time for trial had been extended to allow the mother to retain counsel. Application dismissed; the court had not lost jurisdiction; trial to proceed. The Court of Appeal decision stands for the proposition that, once a trial at any stage of the Act is held, no order can have effect beyond the next statutory deadline; however, this is so only when the extensions are included in an order which follows trial. When the best interests of the child require it, an extension of a statutory deadline can be made in order to have a trial completed in respect of any stage of the Act. When the plan of care changes from reunification to permanent care close to the particular deadline, it is not in a child's best interest for the court to order a rushed trial date.","The mother sought a dismissal of the matter on the basis that the trial date was after the outside disposition date provided in the Act. The Court of Appeal had issued a decision in October 2003 referred to as Nova Scotia Minister of Community Service v. B.F. that confirmed that the judge had not lost jurisdiction despite the fact that the agency had not yet made an order for permanent care. The mother also sought a stay of proceedings pending the outcome of a protection finding and disposition hearing. HELD: The Court held that it had not been lost jurisdiction to dismiss the matter. The court had not considered the issue of jurisdiction in the B.W. case. The trial date is after the date set out in the H.W.' decision. When the plan of care changes from reunification to permanent care close to the particular deadline, it is not in a child's best interest for a rushed trial date."
3_2003skpc14.txt,"The accused was charged with operating a motor vehicle while impaired by alcohol or drug (Code ss.253(a) and 255(1)). The accused admitted to consuming one vodka cooler before driving but argued the signs of impairment were manifestations of his panic attack. No .08 charge was laid, as his readings were .07 and .06. HELD: The accused was found guilty of impaired driving. The evidence did not support the argument that he was in the throws of a panic attack. The blood-alcohol readings show he was below the legal limit but the signs and symptoms of impairment by alcohol proved beyond a reasonable doubt his ability to operate a motor vehicle was impaired by alcohol. As stated in McCallum, the fact that the effects of alcohol may have been exacerbated by the accused suffering from fatigue does not provide a defence to the charge.","The accused was charged with having the care or control of a motor vehicle while his ability to operate a motor car was impaired by alcohol or drugs. The accused was found guilty of driving while having the ability to drive while his blood alcohol content was over the legal limit. The Court found that the accused's evidence raised a reasonable doubt as to his guilt. HELD: The Court held that the evidence was not supported by the evidence. The blood alcohol level was below the legal threshold and the evidence together with the other evidence did not support the accused’s diagnosis of a panic attack. The court found that evidence togetherwith the other factors involving consumption of alcohol and the signs and symptoms of impairment by alcohol did not prove beyond a reasonable limit that the officer’d ability to operating a motor vehicles was impaired. The defence position was that the signs, symptoms of impaired displayed by the accused were the result of a Panic Attack. The evidence did support the officer who testified that he was in the throws of a “panic attack”. The officer who was driving the police vehicle testified that the symptoms of a possible panic attack were the symptoms consistent with a panic assault. The police officer testified that they were focused on impairment by the presence of alcohol because they had been told by their dispatcher that the operator of the two-toned brown Ford pick-up might be drunk. The officers testified that this focus blinded the police from seeing any other possibilities. The test results did not provide a reasonable suspicion as to the accused being in the 'palladium court' as the accused was driving a truck that swerved into the left-hand side of the road more than four times. The breath test was performed to determine whether the accused had a panic disorder. The results of the breath test were negative. The alcohol was not involved in the test results. The tests were negative and the blood alcohol was found to be within the legal definition of a 'possible' panic attack, which is a severe form of alcohol intoxication. The symptoms of the accused when he testified that his panic attack was consistent with one were: a panic, a generalized anxiety disorder (G.A.D.), severe fatigue, shortness of breath, short shortness in breath, and shortnessness of air. The medical evidence did raise a reasonable question as to whether the officer was impaired in any way. The trial judge also found that there was no evidence of impairment in the accused."

His students helped him to the faculty lounge. He was found in the faculty washroom unconscious and not breathing approximately 30 minutes later. Emergency medical technicians were not able to resuscitate him and he was pronounced dead at the Royal University Hospital. An application for dependants' benefits was submitted over 3 years later. The Workers' Compensation Board denied the claim finding that the deceased was not found dead at work and because of the delay in bringing the claim. The applicant brought an application for an order of certiorari pursuant to Queen's Bench Rule 664 and mandamus pursuant to Queen's Bench Rule 674. HELD: 1) The Board acted outside of its jurisdiction in denying dependant benefits to the applicant based upon a determination that the deceased was not found dead within the meaning of s. 30 of The Workers' Compensation Act, 1979. The case law clearly precludes an analysis of s. 30 of the Act as in any way representing a rebuttable presumption. 2) The Board acted outside its jurisdiction in not applying the presumption in s. 30 of the Act in favour of the applicant. 3) The Board waived the right to rely upon the delay in bringing the claim after the Board participated in a variety of levels of proceeding, including two hearings, and only raised the issue of delay at the final hearing. 4) The application was allowed with costs to the applicant on a party and party basis.",The respondent Board refused to grant the applicant dependants' benefits on the basis that it had not received notice of the applicant's death and that the applicant had not applied for benefits within the six month period contemplated in the Workers' Compensation Act. The respondent Board applied for the application under s. 45 of the Act and found that the deceased spouse was not found dead within the meaning of s. 30 of the act. The applicant applied for dependants’ benefits under s45 of the legislation. Application denied; the respondent Board did not act within its jurisdiction to deny the applicant’s claim.

He was sentenced to 6 months imprisonment, 18 months probation and a 10 year fire arm prohibition was imposed. He appealed his sentence. HELD: Appeal allowed. 1)Because the accused had no related record and given the circumstances of the assault, the sentence of imprisonment was reduced to time already served (15 days). 2)The trial judge erred in imposing the 10 year fire arm prohibition under S.100 of the Code. S.100 requires a conviction on an indictable offence involving violence against a person where the maximum sentence available is 10 years imprisonment or more. 3)The maximum sentence for assault under S.266 is 5 years if the Crown proceeds by indictment and 6 months if, as here, the Crown proceeds summarily.","The accused was convicted of an assault contrary to s. 266 of the Criminal Code.

The accused appealed the sentence and reduced the term of imprisonment imposed at trial from 6 months to ""time served"" and maintained the 18 month probation order subject only to amending the time within which the appellant was to report to the chief probation officer as therein provided. HELD: The appeal was allowed and it was set aside. 1)The sentencing principles of protection of society, deterrence, general and specific deterrence, reformation and rehabilitation and the need to maintain the public's confidence in the administration of justice were applied. 2)The sentence imposed was too severe. The appellant had now served 15 days of the sentence. He had now completed 15 days already served.

HELD: Appeal dismissed and conviction accordingly affirmed.  1)Great deference to findings of credibility made at trial should be shown. 2)The trial judge did not say that he found the accused guilty only upon the credibility of the complainant and the accused. He said that he found the Crown's evidence to be credible, and the accused's evidence not to be credible. The Crown's evidence was comprised of both the complainant and the witness. 3)The trial judge's findings are supported by the evidence and his conclusions are not clearly wrong so as to make the conviction unreasonable.","The appellant was convicted of assault contrary to s. 266 of the Criminal Code.

4_2007skqb438.txt,"The parties have two children, a son born March 1990 and a daughter December 1991. A trial on the issues of the son's residence in 2006, the parties' income for the purposes of child support and any s. 7 expenses was held. HELD: 1) From September 2006 to February 2007 the parties shared custody of the son. This is a period of no more than 5 months. Thereafter he resumed living with his grandmother and was supported by his mother. The father does not meet the threshold provided for in s. 9 of the Guidelines.  2) The father's income from employment shows earning of $108,629. The mother's income consisted only of investment income of $1,672.37 and allowance of $2,000. 3) The parties have been divorced since 1998. The son has played baseball since 2004. The daughter has speed skated since 2001. The mother has paid the extraordinary expenses of both children, without reimbursement from the father. It was only in 2006 that the father paid any of the son's expenses. Accordingly, 2006 is not the appropriate year to begin reimbursing the father for expenses he may have paid for him. To do so would be exceedingly unfair to the mother who has borne the expenses of both children on her own for many years.  4) The children's expenses related to fees, registration and equipment for baseball and speed skating are extraordinary expenses within the meaning of s. 7 of the Guidelines. The expenses may be estimated at $2,000 for baseball and $1,000 for speed skating, annually. The orthodontic work, which is estimated at $2,522 should be amortized over two years. The alternative acne treatment, proposed by the mother for the daughter is not an appropriate health related expense in the absence of a medical referral or prescription. The father's proportionate share is 80% and the mother's is 20%. Paid monthly the father's payment is $284. 5) Although the mother did not bring an application to vary child support upward, the filing of the application to vary by the father is sufficient to re-determine the issue of child support based on current incomes. The current support order is based on the father's income of $87,794. His income is considerably higher now. His child support payments are adjusted accordingly.","The respondent father applied to vary an order made May 14, 2002. The order provided for child support payable to the petitioner mother on behalf of the two youngest children, Michael, born March 15, 1990, and Jessica, born December 30, 1991. The parties had been divorced for over a year. The father had the use of his mother's vehicle because she was in Viet Nam visiting her husband. This ended in January or February 2007, which is a period of no more than 5 months. The mother did not bring an application to vary child support upward. HELD: The court found that from September 4, 2006 until approximately February 22, 2007, the parties shared custody of the children. The respondent father's proportionate share of child support was 80% and the mother's was 20%. The father's share of the expenses were to be amortized over two years. The court ordered that the parties determine the appropriate amount to be paid by the father each month to cover s. 7 expenses."
4_2007skqb51.txt,"FIAT: The respondent applies for an interim order granting her sole custody of the parties' two children and child support retroactive to the date of separation being October 2005. The petitioner seeks joint custody with specified access. The petitioner acknowledges an obligation to pay child support but there is an issue with respect to his income and whether the interim order should be retroactive. The children are ages 3 and 2.HELD: 1) Section 3 of The Children's Law Act 1997 provides for a presumption of joint custody where parents of a child have cohabitated after the birth of the child. That is the situation here. There is nothing in the evidence to rebut that presumption on an interim basis. In making interim orders, the Court tries to disrupt the lives of the children as little as possible. The status quo in this case is represented by the verbal agreement between the parties entered into after their separation. That is the petitioner would have the children every third week during his week off from Saturday to Tuesday. This seems reasonable on an interim basis. This agreement did not address the fact that the petitioner shall be laid off for two months in the spring. It is reasonable that during this period his contact with the children should be increased. The petitioner has not seen the children for 10 months. He will have to be re-introduced to them. A phase in period is required. 2) The petitioner has worked for the same drilling company for about 6 years. His gross income in 2006 was $112,064. This is verified by his year to date income statement from his employer. The petitioner attests that $9,600 of his income is a 'living allowance' paid to cover expenses for his truck, fuel, vehicle maintenance and meals and should be deducted from his Line 150 income to arrive at his current income for child support purposes. This is a matter for the trial judge who will have the benefit of the 2006 tax return and notice of assessment and better evidence of the expenses and their purpose and make any retroactive adjustment deemed necessary. The petitioner's income for child support purposes is $112,064. 3) The claim for retroactive child support is a claim for child support payments which pre-date service of the notice of this application. The petitioner was served with the application in September 2006. The petitioner lived up to the parties' verbal agreement to pay child support of $1,200 per month starting October 2005. He unilaterally stopped paying child support in January 2006. He attests that his reason for doing so was because he was not having access to the children. The obligation to pay child support is not contingent on a payor's ability to see their children.  The respondent's income is substantially less then that of the petitioner's. The child support was necessary to meet the children's basis ongoing needs. The petitioner knew he had an obligation to provide child support and there is no evidence that a retroactive order would cause him undue hardship. There is evidence that a request for change in child support preceded the commencement of this application. A retroactive adjustment of child support to January 2006 is warranted.","FIAT: The respondent applied for an interim order granting sole custody of the parties' two children and child support, including s.7(a) child care expenses retroactive to the date of separation, being October 2005. The petitioner, Evan Gavelin, requested joint custody with specified access. HELD: 1) Retroactive child support was granted. The court found that retroactive child care was warranted. 2) The petitioner knew he had an obligation to provide child support and there was no evidence a retroactive order would cause him undue hardship. 3) The parties' verbal agreement at the time of separation that Mr. Gavelins would have parenting time with the children every third weekend during his week off from Tuesday to Tuesday was not accepted. 4) The respondent had not received any income from the company prior to the separation. 5) The court ordered that retroactivity of child support be made retroactive. 6) The Court found that the parties had verbal agreement following their separation that the respondent would pay one-half of the child care costs retroactive the date the parties separated. The parties had discussed the issue of child care expenditures prior to March 2006. The respondent was to pay $185 per month directly to the child support provider. The order should be based on the petitioner's 2004 income."
4_2008skqb174.txt,"Accused pleaded guilty at opening of trial to one count of distributing child pornography in the form of written works. The accused was active on a pedophile website and posted 11 stories describing sexual activity between men and infants and pre-teen girls. HELD: Accused received 15 months imprisonment followed by 3 years of probation with addition orders including providing DNA samples and being added to the Sex Offender Registry. The Court accepted that the internet has led to the accelerated proliferation of child pornography, making it an increasing social problem. The social harm of such material is borne almost exclusively by infants and children, the most defenceless members of society. For this reason, denunciation and deterrence are the dominant sentencing principles. The defence submitted that the writings do not actually harm children in their making and, therefore, should not be subject to the same denunciation as pornographic images. The Court rejected this argument because it cannot be assumed that the writings do not stimulate the demand for images and since not all pedophiles are voyeurs only some will act on their desires and anything that stimulates this desire places children at risk in the real world. Aggravating factors in this case were 1) the fact that the accused extolled pedophilia and wrote hard core child pornography and encouraged others to the same. 2) The accused was a high profile contributor to the web site and he remains unrepentant Ã» he does not believe there is anything wrong with writing these stories and only stopped because the law requires it. A conditional sentence would not represent sufficient denunciation or deterrence. Mitigating factors in this case included a lack of criminal record, the guilty plea and the fact that the accused is looking after his elderly mother.","The defendant pled guilty at the opening of trial to distributing child pornography contrary to s. 163.1(3) of the Criminal Code. The defendant had been active on a pedophile website for a while and had written 11 stories. The court found that the defendant had no criminal record and was now serving a social purpose of looking after his ailing mother and ailing father. HELD: The defendant was sentenced to 15 months imprisonment to be followed by a term of probation of 3 years, as well as the additional orders made for his release. The Court found that a conditional sentence would not deter others who might be inclined to engage in the activity of distributing child porn. The sentence was appropriate for a young offender with a relatively high profile. The mitigating factors referred to by the defence were that the accused had no previous criminal record, had no prior criminal record or plea agreement, had been convicted of distributing the material, had a low profile and was not a person who would endanger the community if one were imposed. The sentencing guidelines were met. The accused was sentenced for possession of child pornography and was to spend 15 months in custody. The sentences were set out in the Criminal Law Review. The judge found that there was no evidence that the offences were committed by the defendant. The fact that the probation officer verified his short participation in the program and that he did not plead guilty, along with other material referred to in the Review, did not deter the offender. The probation officer found that he was not an appropriate candidate for programming. The Crown found that it was appropriate to make an order pursuant to s.(1) of s. 490.012(1) requiring the accused to comply with the Sex Offender Information Registration Act, 2004, for a period of 20 years, which is the mandatory time specified in s.(2) for a person convicted of distribution of childpornography. The order was made to allow the accused's submission of a 'haunting story' to be heard by others. The offence was committed against the accused and the accused was convicted of possession of the material. The offences were both serious and were of significant nature. The Criminal Code requires a high profile and a significant risk profile."
4_2009skca102.txt,"The respondent pled guilty to a charge of manslaughter arising out of fatal injuries she inflicted on her 7 month old daughter. The sentencing judge awarded the respondent 26 months credit for 13 months in pre-trial custody and then imposed a sentence of 2 years less 1 day to be followed by 2 years probation. The Crown seeks leave to appeal the sentence imposed as demonstrably unfit. HELD: Appeal allowed. 1) Taking into account the mitigating factors and in particular the respondent's post-sentence rehabilitative potential and the absence of evidence of prior acts of violence, a sentence slightly below the range as the one imposed in R. v. Bighead, 2003 SKCA 44 leads the Court to conclude a sentence of 6 years is appropriate, with 26 months credit for remand as imposed below.  2) The sentencing judge was directed to a very narrow range of authorities. In these circumstances this Court cannot find that the judge failed to give proper weight to the gravity of the offence and the degree of the respondent's responsibility. It would be helpful if a more detailed analysis along the lines suggested in R. v. Laberge (1995), 165 A.R. 375 had been given in order to enhance meaningful appellate review. However, this Court is not satisfied the judge failed to properly consider this factor. The Court is satisfied that the limited framework presented by counsel led the judge to err by failing to observe the need for parity in sentence and as a result, the sentence imposed was not similar to sentences imposed on other offenders for similar offences committed in similar circumstances.","The Crown appealed a sentence of 26 months in pre-trial custody and 2 years probation imposed on the respondent for manslaughter. The Crown argued the sentencing judge erred in his assessment of the gravity of the offence and the respondent's moral culpability in it and failed to address the principles of denunciation and deterrence. HELD: The appeal was allowed on the basis of this latter ground. The sentencing judge failed to give proper weight to the gravity and the gravity the offence, the respondent’s remorse, her abusive background, her mental health problems, her social and economic situation and the fact that she had never properly bonded with the child. The court found that the respondent had a high level of mental health issues and had a history of substance abuse, which led her to commit these offences. The respondent”s past criminal record and her current situation all led her not to seek help when it was apparent the child was injured. The Court found that a sentence for manslaughter with a factor of four years less a day was appropriate given the respondent was a high risk to re-offend and her past criminal history did not warrant a sentence higher than that imposed."
4_2011nssc71.txt,"The judge declared the defendants could pay legal fees from third party loans without offending two prior execution orders that prevented them from disposing of any property. The declaration was explicitly made on the assumption that the loans would not be secured against the defendants' existing assets. Later, the defendants' counsel wrote to the court essentially indicating he could not confirm the loans would not be secured against any assets. The court issued this supplemental decision. In the absence of any evidence the loans will not be secured against assets already subject to the execution order, or will not otherwise reduce those assets, the order and declaration sought can no longer be granted.","The defendants sought an order confirming their ability to pay certain amounts for billed and unbilled time without the defendants' consent. The defendants sought the order violating the terms of two execution orders previously issued February 18, 2010, as Hfx No. 190408 against the defendants judgment debtors to the plaintiff, who were successful litigants in this action. HELD: The Court was unable to grant the proposed order. The Court could only rely upon the affidavit evidence of Ms. Cochrane relating to the third party loans. The affidavit evidence did not reveal where the loans came from or if they will reduce the exigencies of the defendants, available for execution."
4_2015skca111.txt,"Family – Child Support – Arrears – Appeal The appellant appealed from the decision of a Queen’s Bench judge ordering him to pay retroactive child support to the respondent in the amount of $21,645. The order indicated that the period in question would include support from January 2009 to August 2012 (see: 2014 SKQB 334). An original support order was issued by consent in 2006. It required that the appellant pay the respondent $1,220 per month in child support and that the parties would exchange their financial information yearly in order to adjust the amount of child support payable. In 2008, the appellant applied to vary the order because he had lost his position and his income was reduced to $1,500 per month. In his affidavit, he swore that his annual income would be $18,000. The application was allowed and the amount of support reduced to $769 per month based upon the judge setting the appellant’s income at $55,000 and directing him to provide his financial information to the respondent each year. One month later in 2009, the appellant regained his former employment position and began earning as much as he had in 2008 but he continued to pay $769 per month without informing the respondent of the change in his circumstances. In February 2011, the respondent served a notice to disclose. The parties met and made an oral agreement that the appellant would pay $950 per month based upon the appellant’s claim that he was still financially strapped and the respondent acquiesced because she was unwilling to engage in further court battles with him. The appellant’s lawyer provided the respondent’s lawyer with financial information that showed that the former was earning a substantially higher income. The respondent also indicated to the appellant that she would forgo about $7,200 in arrears. The terms of the agreement were submitted to the court, without the financial information or the respondent’s forbearance to sue, and a variation order was issued based upon them. In July 2012, the respondent applied to vary the 2008 order and the 2011 variation order claiming arrears from January 2009. Eventually the issue of retroactive child support went to trial. The trial judge found that the appellant had not given the respondent financial information as was required and his failure to inform her of the material change in his circumstances in 2009 constituted blameworthy conduct. The appellant’s income for the years 2009 through 2012 was assessed by the court and the amount of arrears established. The appellant argued that: 1) the trial judge did not have the jurisdiction to vary the 2011 variation order. He maintained that the 2011 order was final and could not be varied on an interim basis; 2) it was necessary to find a material change in circumstances before it could be varied; 3) the respondent had been advised of the change in circumstances; and 4) the trial judge had erred in failing to find unreasonable delay on the part of the respondent.  HELD: The appeal was dismissed. The court held with respect to each issue that: 1) a court can vary an interim or a final order on an interim basis for child support under the authority of ss. 15 and 17 of the Divorce Act. Although it might be necessary in some cases to determine whether an order is final or interim, it was not necessary to do so here because the nature of the terms of the orders in question and the circumstances surrounding the granting of the 2011 variation order. The trial judge had not erred in concluding that he had authority to vary it and to order the appellant to pay arrears before the agreement and compelling him to pay the Guideline amount for the period following it; 2) the terms of the 2011 order left it to a future court to finalize the amount of child support based upon the appellant’s income. Therefore the court retained the power to vary or rescind the order without searching for a change in circumstances; 3) the trial judge’s findings of fact on this point were supported by the evidence; and 4) the trial judge found that the respondent had not received disclosure and thus there had been no unreasonable delay.","The parties agreed to vary the 2011 Variation Order in the amount of $21,645 and costs in the amounts of $1,500. The parties had agreed to fix the 2011 order by varying it in 2012. The respondent applied to the Court of Queen's Bench in May 2011 to vary it by varying the 2011 Order. The court found that the subsequent orders were all variations of the 2006 Consent Child Support Order and each order was made subject to further variation from the court. The Court of Appeal held that the Court could not overturn a decision of a different court dealing with the same lis. Appeal dismissed. The issue on appeal was whether the Court had the jurisdiction to vary a final order on an interim basis for child support. The evidence on appeal suggested that the court drew a clear distinction between interim orders, which can be varied on an ongoing basis as a matter of jurisdiction, and final orders. The courts draw a clear difference between interim and final order. In the case of the respondent, the Court found that he had not been advised of changes to his circumstances. The appellant argued that the respondent erred by misapprehending the facts and failing to find unreasonable delay. The applicant argued that in the area of family support orders, the courts draw the clear distinction from interim orders which can only be varied as a subject matter and final Orders. The appeal court held that in this case the Court was entitled to make a determination on the basis of affidavit evidence. The decision of the Court in May 2012 was also appealed. Appeal denied. The issues on appeal are whether the court has the jurisdiction or not to vary this order. The trial judge drew a distinction between the interim and a final orders and the Court's decision in the case in question was not binding. The order in question is not binding on the respondent."

The Plaintiff called several expert witnesses who testified that, in their opinion, the leaking fuel line was the cause of the fire. Ford called one witness who was the designer of of the truck's fuel system and a Ford employee. He testified that the defective fuel line could not have leaked sufficient fuel to cause the fire. He also admitted, however, that his prior written report contained errors. Rebuttal evidence called by the Plaintiff indicated that the check valve in the fuel pump designed to prevent siphoning from the fuel tank in the event of a leaking fuel line did not operate as the Ford witness had testified.

HELD: The plaintiffs' claim is dismissed. 1)The plaintiffs have proven beyond a reasonable doubt that the fire was caused caused by an electricstatic discharge through a faulty Fuel Tube in the Ford truck. 2)The plaintiff plaintiffs have established beyond a balance of probabilities that the cause of the fire is an electric current current current. 3)The evidence from the field review committee of Ford which reviewed the circumstances surrounding the recall notice and found that the fuel line may develop pin holes which would result in fuel leakage that could cause fire. 4)The expert testimony of the plaintiffs and the defendant in particular in preference to the plaintiff in preference was accepted.
5_1995canlii4187.txt,"This was an appeal from the conviction of the appellant that he broke and entered a used car dealership and stole a vehicle, contrary to s. 348(1)(b) of the Criminal Code. The theft was reported to police by a passing motorist who saw the vehicle being driven off the car lot early in the morning. The vehicle was spotted on the highway, and when stopped, was exited by two individuals. Two officers followed tracks through a wooded area, and noted that in two areas the tracks broke through ice on a brook. Shortly thereafter the appellant came out of the woods on a nearby road; his lower body was wet and chunks of ice and snow clung to his clothing. The imprint of his footwear resembled that of the tracks in the snow. The appellant was convicted, based on the doctrine of recent possession. He argued there was no evidence he was in recent possession of the stolen vehicle. Dismissing the appeal, that there was sufficient evidence to support the findings of fact made by the trial judge. The judgment of the trial judge was consistent with R. v. Kowlyk (1988), 43 C.C.C. (3d) 1 (S.C.C.).","The appellant was convicted of break, enter and theft. He had stolen a used car dealership truck from the lot at 12:15 o'clock in the morning. The police were called to the scene and the accused ran from the vehicle and made tracks in the snow.

5_1998canlii13955.txt,"An application pursuant to s197 of the Automobile Accident Insurance Act for an order setting aside SGI's termination of the applicant's income replacement benefits. The applicant suffered soft tissue injuries to his cervical spine when his vehicle was struck from behind by an uninsured driver. He received a partial income replacement benefit from SGI on the basis he was not able to perform some but not all of his farm duties. HELD: 1)SGI was not entitled to terminate Sawkiw's benefits pursuant to s185(d), (e), (f) or (g). SGI's failure to make a suitable rehabilitation program available to Sawkiw prior to October 1/97 and its failure to reassess his level of income replacement benefits as at September 14 where significant factors contributing to his desperate circumstances. SGI was requiring Sawkiw to attend daily physiotherapy of 3 to 4 hours duration with approximately 2-1/2 hours of additional travel time. It is common knowledge that pain can be exhausting; that daily physiotherapy can be exhausting; that daily travel of 2-1/2 hours can be exhausting; that the physical demands of farming can be exhausting; and, that the mental demands of managing a farm and coordinating and organizing the work of others on a farm can be exhausting. It was far from clear how SGI expected Sawkiw to devote approximately 6 to7 hours per day to his treatment program and still have the mental and physical reserves to devote any time or energy to his farming oprations. He could only reasonably be expected to participate in daily physiotherapy if he was receiving a full, rather than a partial income replacement benefit. 2)The benefits were properly terminated pursuant to s129(1)(e) the first day of his full time employment in Alberta. However, from September 14/97 to the date of termination Sawkiw was entitled to be paid full income replacement benefit without adjustment for a partial return to work. Sawkiw was entitled to the difference and interest from the date such additional benefits should have been paid until the date of this judgment. 3)SGI was to arrange for an assessment by the rehabilitation centre forthwith. If it is found that as a result of the accident Sawkiw is not able to hold the employment he held at the time of the accident, SGI is encouraged to consider his condition as a relapse under s142(1)(a). Under the terms of this judgment the final income replacement benefit will be other than one made pursuant to s139 or 140. 4)Sawkiw was entitled to his solicitor and client costs respecting services rendered and disbursements incurred from the date of filing his notice of motion to the date this judgment is received. He was also entitled to his costs associated with preparing and filing his notice of motion set at $600 being the maximum amount payable under the Personal Injury Benefits Regulations.","The respondent Saskatchewan Government Insurance applied to the court pursuant to s. 197 of the Act for an order setting aside the termination of benefits. The respondent Saskatchewan GIS claimed that the benefits were terminated because the respondent was not able to perform some of his farm duties. The applicant argued that the termination was appropriate because the deceased was not receiving a full income replacement benefit and was now unable to perform his farm work. HELD: The application was set aside. The court found that SGI was not entitled to terminate the benefits pursuant to ss. 185(d), (e), (f) or (g) of the Personal Injury Benefits Regulations. The termination was made pursuant to the provisions of s. 185 of the act. The deceased was a farmer and received a partial income replacement benefits on the basis that he was not being able to do some farm duties and was currently unable to hold employment in Alberta. The Court found that the deceased's injuries were a contributing factor to his continued disability. The defendant was not required under s. 175 of theAct to keep SGI informed of his employment status prior to October 1 and his failure to reassess his level of income replacement assistance benefits as at September 24 were significant factors that contributed to the deceased`s desperate circumstances in October 1997 and resulting conduct in October and thereafter."
5_2000canlii3680.txt,"After being sexually assaulted, applicant was voluntarily released from Canadian Armed Forces. She applied for and was denied a pension. Civil proceedings were commenced and the Crown defended on the basis that before initiating civil proceedings, applicant was obliged to appeal denial of pension or seek review by Minister of pension rejection. Applicant applied to strike out that portion of defence application allowed. The applicant applied for and was denied a pension. Therefore no pension was at this time payable to her. A review by the Minister would require new information and the appeal period had expired. The applicant should not be denied her right to proceed against the Crown in such circumstances.","The plaintiff was a member of the Canadian Armed Forces. She was voluntarily released from the military and applied for a pension. The Minister of Defence re-assessed her release from the Military and ruled that she should have been released on medical grounds, being disabled and not being able to perform the duties of her trade or employment. The plaintiff sued the Minister of Defense and the Minister for Defence. The Crown brought an application to strike the statement of claim on the basis it disclosed no reasonable cause of action. The defence was dismissed. The Court held that the Crown could not meet the onus of proving a pension was payable. The court also held that a defence of a right to sue the government for wrongful dismissal was not a defence under s.111 of the Pension Act. The Queen's Bench Rule applies to cases where the plaintiff ignored the administrative process in favor of civil action and the Court held they had to pursue the administrative proceedings. The limitation period for appealing the Minister's decision expired under the Pension act. The accused was not entitled to a pension under s111. The only defence the Crown had was that the claim disclosed no such cause of claim. The claim was barred because the Crown did not have the proper means to bring it forward.

5_2001skqb463.txt,"This judgment applies to both QBG No. 1040/98 and QBG No. 1041/98 respecting the contract between the city and Triple P Holdings and the January 21, 1997 contract between the plaintiffs and the defendants. The first breach of contract concerned a failure to apply the rotation of truckers described in the arrangement between the city and Truckers Association. The second breach alleged the defendants took too many hours on the total contract. Both matters were tried together. The defendants pleaded there was no privity of contract between the city and plaintiffs, therefore the plaintiffs could not enforce terms agreed to by the city and Triple P. HELD: Both actions were dismissed. 1)The case did not turn on the issue of privity. While the plaintiffs were not actual parties to the contract with the city, certain benefits were intended to pass through the general contract to members of the Truckers Association. 2)There was no contractual obligation in the 1997 agreement which required the defendant to adhere to any particular arrangement on the rotation of work. The contract between the defendants and city was not incorporated by specific or general reference. The first sentence of s.9 of the 1997 tender for rental of truck specifications was more consistent with what was actually done by the defendants than with the interpretation put on it by the plaintiffs. They failed to make out a case that the contract term was as alleged or that any breach occurred.  3)Had a case been made out, further evidence of damages would be required. The damages claimed were excessive and did not properly take into account actual operating expenses, the net affect of mitigating factors, and reliable calculation of the administration of the rotation of work.",The plaintiffs were not parties to the contract and the plaintiffs were prevented from enforcing it. The issue of privity of contract could have been a critical issue in different circumstances but ultimately this case will not turn on the question of priviability. The plaintiffs constructed their cases in reliance upon the overall affect of both contracts with specific emphasis on the contract of January 1997. The plaintiff had failed to make out a case that the contract term was as alleged on that breach and that any breach occurred. The court found that the plaintiffs had failed in making out a proper case that there was no privity to the breach and therefore the plaintiffs are prevented from enforcement of the terms as agreed by the City of Regina and Triple P Holdings. HELD: Each case was dismissed. 1)The issue of entitlement could have had a critical impact in different situations but in the end this case would not turn the question on the privity issue. 2)The plaintiffs failed to establish a case the contract terms were as alleged and that there had been any breach. 3)The Court found that there is no privitous contract between the plaintiffs and the City and that the plaintiff are prevented in the event that the breach occurred from the date the contract was signed.

HELD: The plaintiff has not strictly complied with the provisions of s. 3(2) of the Act, and the garnishee summons are a nullity.  1) In an application to set aside a pre-judgment garnishee, the court is not to consider potential defences to the action or the existence of triable issues as grounds for setting aside a garnishee summons. 2) The court examined whether or not the affidavit showed, with the required precision, the amount of the debt or liquidated demand. Although there is reference in the statement of claim to an agreement that interest would be paid at 2.0 % per month, compounded monthly, there is no mention of interest in the Operating Agreement. 3) Of more concern is the four-page invoice attached to the affidavit supposedly attached to confirm the amount of the debt owed by the defendant.

5_2006nsca41.txt,"The plaintiff company commenced an action against a former employee/shareholder for breach of fiduciary and employee duty. The shareholder defended and claimed that one of the directors had misappropriated funds from the company. The shareholder later retained a new solicitor, who successfully applied to amend the defence to withdraw certain admissions and amend the counterclaim to add a shareholder oppression remedy and for leave to bring a derivative action. The court found that, in the circumstances, the new counsel's assessment of his client's case was sufficient to allow the admissions in the defence to be withdrawn, the implied undertaking against the collateral use of discovery evidence did not apply because the pleaded material facts were the same facts material to the shareholder oppression action and the applicant bore an ordinary onus to establish the three statutory prerequisites. The court also directed the employee to retain an expert and for the company to pay that expert and make all reasonable disclosure that the expert reasonably required. The plaintiff company appealed. Appeal dismissed; there was evidence before the trial judge on which he could conclude that it was just that the admissions be withdrawn; with respect to the oppression remedies and the employee's status as a complainant, the wording of the earlier consent order could be interpreted as not suspending his rights as a former shareholder; there was a temporal connection between the impugned acts and his ownership of the shares and he had a sufficient interest in the oppression remedies. The terms the judge imposed were within the broad discretion conferred by the Third Schedule of the Companies Act and there was no breach of natural justice by the imposition of them.",The appellants sought an order permitting the respondent to withdraw the admissions and to add a claim for an 'oppression remedy' to the respondent's counterclaim for alleged misdeeds of the appellant. The respondent appealed the order permitting these admissions. The appellants argued that the judge erred in permitting the appellant to amend his defence to withdraw certain admissions he made in his defence. The judge allowed the appellant's application to withdraw his admissions and added a claim to an 'acquisition remedy' for alleged breaches of fiduciary duties. The appellant appealed. HELD: Leave to appeal was granted. The court found that the respondent’s need to defend according to counsel’ s assessment of the facts was a strong reason for allowing the application. The Court found that new counsel”s need was a stronger reason for holding the defendants to the admissions in the defence drawn by former counsel.
5_2006nssc43.txt,"The plaintiff alleged that a small piece of metal seen dangling from beneath the defendant's tractor trailer flew out from under the trailer as it passed the plaintiff's vehicle and hit her engine hood, bounced in the open window and caused her to lose control of her vehicle. She suffered injuries to her hands, arm and shoulder as she brought her vehicle under control. The defendant applied for summary judgment, presenting expert's reports to show that the metal did not come from his vehicle, nor upon inspection was there any location from which it might have dangled. Application for summary judgment granted; the defendant met the threshold test and the plaintiff failed to adduce any evidence beyond a bare allegation that this claim had a chance of success. The plaintiff cannot resist a summary judgment application by simply asserting that there are matters of the plaintiff's credibility that can only be decided by a trial judge.","The plaintiff was driving from Halifax to Seabright when a tractor-trailer passed her vehicle. She claimed that a piece of metal fell off of his vehicle, bounced on to the engine bonnet of her vehicle and hit her vehicle, hitting her windshield. The plaintiff claimed damages for injuries to her arms, shoulders and neck. The experts testified that the piece of piece of debris did not belong to the tractor- trailer and that upon inspection there was no place for such a piece to dangle. The expert reports filed by the defendant also supported the claim. The defendant argued that the experts' reports did not establish the piece was from the tractor trailer and therefore there was a material issue to be tried. The court found that the defendant had not seen the piece fall from the trailer and thus there was not a material fact to support the claim made. The plaintiffs claim damages for damage to their eyes, shoulders, neck and hearing loss. The Court found that although the defendant's claim was not bare, it was a very serious allegation and the evidence presented supported the bare allegation. The defendants were found to have acted reasonably and had no liability for the unforeseeable event. The evidence from the experts was not the only issue to test. The fact that the plaintiff was injured by the piece and that the evidence from her witnesses was not sufficient to establish that the claim was a serious one."
5_2006skpc2.txt,"The accused is charged with care or control of a motor vehicle while impaired contrary to s. 255(1) and s. 253(a) of the Criminal Code and care or control while over .08 contrary to s. 253(b) of the Code. HELD: There is no remedy of exclusion of the Certificate of Analysis. Accordingly, the accused is guilty of care or control while over .08. The evidence does not prove impairment beyond a reasonable doubt.  1) It is clear from the evidence that the accused's vehicle was inoperable and immovable due to the damage from the accident and its location in the ditch. The defence raised the issue of whether a person can be 'in care or control of a motor vehicle' when there is no risk that the vehicle in question can be put in motion so that it can become dangerous to the public. The Court reviewed the cases. The first person to come upon the accident scene found the accused alone in the vehicle seated in the driver's seat. He saw no visible signs of anyone else at the scene. Upon approaching the vehicle, he observed the accused turn the ignition key to try and start the vehicle. There was no other evidence which established that the 'accused did not occupy that seat for the purpose of setting the vehicle in motion'. The accused has failed to rebut the presumption of care or control under s. 258(1)(a) of the Code and the Court finds that the accused was in 'care or control' of the motor vehicle. 2) Considering the case law and after objectively considering all the indicial of impairment known to the officer, together with the circumstances of the accident itself (which indicate driving error) there can be no doubt the officer had more than reasonable and probable grounds to form the requisite opinion pursuant to s. 254(2) of the Code to make a demand for samples of analysis.  3) The officer was sensitive to the immediate concern of the physical well-being of the accused. Though he may have formed his opinion in the ambulance, he wisely waited until medical personnel had made an initial assessment at the hospital before making any kind of demand. In the circumstances, the Court finds the officer made the demand at the first practical opportunity in relation to the entire investigation. 3) The officer, in coming to his conclusion to make a blood sample demand, considered a number of relevant factors, including time limits to obtain a breath sample, the severity and magnitude of the accident, the potential seriousness of the accused's head and neck injuries, the need for immediate emergency assessment and length of time it would take to treat the accused and keep him under observation. He believed the accused's condition was potentially serious and was completely justified in holding that belief. The evidence has proven the accused required immediate and emergent medical attention which made it obviously impractical to put the accused before a breathalyzer instrument within the time limit fixed by the Code. The officer had reasonable and probable grounds to believe that by reason of his physical condition, the accused may be incapable of providing a sample of his breath, or it would be impracticable to obtain a sample of his breath. All the requirements of s. 254(3) of the Code have been proven beyond a reasonable doubt. 4) The evidence discloses that the police officer made numerous efforts to ensure the accused actually spoke to a lawyer in private. After that, the accused made no further requests whatsoever to further speak to a lawyer. Following the principles set forth by the Saskatchewan Court of Appeal in R. v. Leedahl, 2002 SKCA 5, the evidence clearly establishes the accused was coherent and understood the right to counsel enunciated to him by the police officer. He in fact spoke to a lawyer and made no other requests. Further, there was no suggestion that the accused was incapable of understanding his right to counsel or that he was incapable or prevented from acting on his right. To the contrary, the evidence proves the exact opposite. The Court finds the accused has failed to demonstrate his s. 10(b) right to counsel was denied or infringed in any way.","The accused was charged with impaired driving and driving while the accused was in the driver's seat of a motor vehicle. The accused was found to have consumed alcohol in a quantity that exceeded the legal limit of.08. The evidence established that the accused had reasonable and probable grounds to believe he was in care or control of the motor vehicle pursuant to s.253(3) of the Criminal Code. The Court found that the officer had reasonable, probable and probable ground to believe the accused's ability to operate the vehicle was impaired by alcohol. The officer made numerous efforts to ensure the accused actually spoke to a lawyer. The court found that he believed the accused did not have the means to rebut the presumption under s.258(1)(a). All of the requirements of s. 254(3)(a) had been proven beyond a reasonable doubt. The trial judge was sensitive to the immediate concern of the physical well-being of the accused. He wisely waited until medical personnel had made an initial assessment at the hospital before making any kind of demand."
5_2008nssc113.txt,"The mother of two boys, ages 12 and 13, applied to vary access to add a condition that the father only be allowed to drive with the boys in the HRM, on roads with a speed limit of 80km/hr and under. She asked the Court to continue conditions that prevented him from consuming marijuana less than 8 hours before driving, and required him to consider the boys' wishes regarding access and transportation. The father argued that all restrictions relating to the transport of the children should be removed. The father had MS, and a medical marijuana licence. His driving was evaluated yearly, and the report arising from the latest evaluation did not appear to address his marijuana use. An independent assessment of the children's wishes showed they enjoyed time with their father, but worried about his ability to drive under the influence of marijuana. The unrepresented mother sought costs. Conditions continued; variation granted. If he leaves the HRM, the father is to arrange for public or other transportation. Costs awarded to the mother in the amount of $800. In terms of the driving issue, it was not fair to place the entire burden of the transport issue on the children. The Court was not satisfied from the evidence that the father's marijuana use was benign, and there was also a concern about the symptoms of his MS, especially on long trips. While in the HRM, if the boys became concerned about driving with their father, they could take a bus home or call their mother. If outside of the HRM, it would be more difficult for them to get home. In terms of costs issue, the mother was the successful party. Although she was unrepresented, she did have to take considerable time off work. She was also inconvenienced because the father was late in filing documents, despite having been given clear time-lines by the Court.","The parties were to meet in person on April 3, 2008 to discuss the issues of access and maintenance. The parties had previously signed a variation application in which the applicant sought to have access with his children. The applicant alleged that the applicant refused to provide access and communication with the children. Both parties sought an immediate change to the Corollary Relief Judgment dated April 3/2007. The application alleged that applicant had refused to allow access with the three children and requested that the remaining provisions of the Varied Corollaries Relief Judgment continue in effect and that she receive a cost award. The applicants had previously requested that access be restricted to those that permitted it. The court found that the application was not supported by the evidence and that the court was not satisfied that the appellant's use of marijuana was benign and without potential risk to his children, nor was it in the best interests of the children to ignore these risks or to place the entire responsibility for monitoring their safety on their shoulders."
5_2008skca56.txt,"The accused was convicted by a jury of sexual assault and assault with a weapon. He was sentenced to 2 years in a federal penitentiary plus 2 years probation. He appeals both conviction and sentence. The accused and complainant met in a bar for the first time and then went to the accused's apartment. The complainant is a sex trade worker and was of the view that the accused was prepared to pay for sex. The accused stated that he did not know the complainant was a prostitute and thought she had 'picked him up'. Upon arriving at the appellant's home, he refused to pay for sex and the complainant refused consensual sex, at which point the appellant forced himself upon her, forcibly restrained her, removed her clothing and touched her body in a sexual manner, choked her and struck her in the face. As she tried to escape, the appellant struck her three times in the back with a baseball bat. The appellant argues there were two problems with the jury charge: 1) that the trial judge should have addressed the jury further with respect to the various types of inconsistencies and contradictions in the complainant's testimony and explained their significance, and 2) the trial judge should have mentioned a number of additional inconsistencies. HELD: Appeal against conviction dismissed. The issues with the jury charge do not give rise to intervention by this Court. While there is a general obligation on the trial judge to instruct the jury by reviewing the evidence and addressing inconsistencies, how the obligation is fulfilled will vary from case to case. There is no absolute formula automatically giving rise to a new trial. Much depends on the context of the whole trial and such things as the nature of the inconsistency and whether it goes to the essence of an element of the offence. The trial judge's charge was entirely correct in the circumstances of this case. Appeal against sentence is allowed and a sentence of 2 years less 1 day is substituted. The sentence imposed by the trial judge was based on a consensus between the crown and defence counsels. Both were of the view that a sentence in the federal system was more appropriate since it would permit the appellant to access sex offender treatment. After sentencing, the appellant, who is an immigrant, was informed that with a sentence of 2 years, he would have no appeal against an order declaring him inadmissible to Canada. If a sentence of less than 2 years is imposed, he will be guaranteed the opportunity to appear personally or by counsel on his appeal of such an order. The jurisprudence supports the proposition that a sentence's unintended effect on immigration status can be a relevant factor on sentence appeal.","The accused was convicted of sexually assaulting the complainant contrary to s. 271 of the Criminal Code and using a weapon to wit a baseball bat contrary to ss. 267(a) of the Code. He was tried by a jury, which convicted him. He appealed both conviction and sentence. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. 1)The jurisprudence supports the proposition that a sentence's unintended effect on immigration status can be a relevant factor on a sentence appeal. The jurispicuity supports the idea that a penalty's unintended affect on immigration rights is disproportionately severe collateral sanction, which was unforeseen by the appellant and his counsel at the sentencing hearing and apparently unintended by the sentencing judge. 2)The accused will be guaranteed the opportunity of appearing personally or having legal counsel represent him on his appeal of an order."
5_2009nssc218.txt,"The defendant was found guilty of attempted murder after he used a handgun to shoot the complainant outside a bar. He had a previous record for non-violent offences., defendant sentenced to nine-and-a-half years imprisonment; aggravating factors included the defendant's possession and use of a handgun in an area where a number of people were close by and that a bullet had found its way into a nearby residence.","The accused was sentenced to a term of 9 years in pre-trial custody. He was to be given credit for time spent on remand on the basis of for which he had already spent 17 months on remanded custody. The court found that the accused had a high record of violent and threatening behaviour and that the shooting was a result of the presence of at least 2 handguns in an area where a number of people were close by at the after hours bar. The accused had been acquitted of the two counts of murder and he was not being sentenced for those offences. The sentencing guidelines set out in R. v. Downes (2006), 205 CCC (1) and Rule 718.2 of the Criminal Code provide for a maximum penalty of life imprisonment with a minimum punishment of 4 years where firearm is used in the commission of an attempted murder. The fatalities are mentioned simply to highlight what the result of indiscriminate gunfire can be."
5_2011nsca46.txt,"The defendant, who was found guilty of the careless use of a firearm, possession of a weapon for a purpose dangerous to the public peace and possession of a restricted or prohibited firearm applied for bail pending appeal. He had been found, in his residence, with a firearm licensed in Alberta but not licensed to be brought into this province or possessed here. The defendant had residences in both Alberta and Nova Scotia but his Halifax residence was now up for sale and he travelled extensively around the world for his work. Although he had no criminal record and had been on a recognizance for 16 months prior to sentencing, the Crown argued that he was a flight risk given that his convictions would result in a mandatory three-year prison term and he had only a tenuous connection to the jurisdiction. Application for bail pending appeal granted provided the defendant enter into a recognizance of $25,000 with conditions. The defendant's actions bore no resemblance to the known problem of indiscriminate firearm use locally as he was a middle-aged professional and gun hobbyist and the circumstances that purportedly made him a flight risk had nothing to do with these charges but rather with his professional obligations.","The appellant was convicted of seven offences, including careless use of a firearm, pointing a firearm and unlawful possession of a weapon. The police entered the appellant's condominium and found a loaded handgun. The appellant was charged with seven offences. He applied for interim release pending appeal of his conviction for the offences. The Crown opposed release. The appeal judge found that the appellant had not complied with the terms of his release pending trial and that the trial judge erred in failing to find a breach of the Charter when the police entered his condominium, his use of the Beretta, his possession of firearms at an unauthorized place and his belief that he had complied with a prohibited or restricted firearm prohibition. The trial judge also found that it was unreasonable for the appellant to take a loaded gun to the door in all circumstances. The court ordered the appellant released on a recognizance in the amount of $25,000 with written reasons to follow."
5_2011skca26.txt,"The appellant appealed his conviction for dangerous driving and alleged that his estranged wife and daughter lied. The appellant had been represented at trial by experienced counsel but undertook the appeals himself. HELD: Appeal dismissed. The appellant had not followed procedures that must be followed if one intends, on appeal, to challenge the competence of trial counsel or to adduce fresh evidence.","The appellant appealed his conviction for dangerous driving to the Court of Queen's Bench and, having failed, then appealed to the Crown. He contended that he was the victim of a miscarriage of justice inasmuch as he had evidence that his estranged wife, out of a desire for revenge, had lied about what occurred. The trial judge found both to be credible witnesses. He also rejected the appellant's account, finding that he wasn't credible. HELD: Appeal dismissed. 1)There are procedures that have to be followed if one intends on appeal to challenge the competence of trial counsel or to adduce fresh evidence. Otherwise, the courts are left with no basis upon which to act upon allegations of that nature. 2)There is no tenable basis for allowing his appeal, setting aside his conviction, and ordering a new trial. On the facts, the trial judge based on the judge's assessments of credibility, the conduct of the accused amounted to dangerous driving within the meaning of the Criminal Code."

The plaintiff asserts that the defendant breached the contract by failing to properly monitor the temperature in the freezer. HELD: The contract between the parties was solely for installation and monitoring. The contract did not include any obligation on the defendant to maintain or repair the equipment at the plaintiff's business. The Court was satisfied that the defendant was monitoring the signal from the plaintiff's business on the dates in question and no alarm was received. It is not possible to say with any certainty why the defendant did not receive an alarm, but the Court was not satisfied that the plaintiff was regularly having its monitoring equipment serviced or repaired.

The plaintiff had not proven that the defendant breached its contract by failing to monitor the temperature in the freezer and freezer of the business.

The court found that an employee of the defendant was monitoring the signal from the freezer on the dates in question and that no freezer alarm was received before the alarm of August 15, 2010 when the monitoring equipment was working properly. The defendants had not serviced the equipment for at least six months. The plaintiffs had not shown that the monitoring system was working correctly.

HELD: The appeal was of sufficient merit and it was not prima facie frivolous or vexatious. The appeal, however, was not found to be of sufficient importance to the practice of law or the Court of Queen’s Bench to warrant determination by the Court of Appeal.

Dismissing the application, that (1) pursuant to s. 32 of the Charter, the Charter did not apply to these employees since the university was not a subordinate body of government, and was not being controlled by government, but was an independent institution; the fact that the university's governing statute provided that teaching staff were 'deemed to be persons employed in the public service of the Province' for the purposes of their pension plan did not constitute governmental control such as to warrant the application of the Charter; and (2) the proper forum for this application was the Human Rights Commission. The court also considered the retroactive effect of the Nova Scotia decision in Sniders v. Nova Scotia (Attorney General), which struck down the provision in the Nova Scotia Human Rights Act precluding anyone 65 years or over from making an age discrimination complaint. The court concluded that the Sniders decision did have a retroactive effect to the date when s. 15 of the Charter came into force.","This was an application under s.15(1), 24(1) and 52(1)(b) of the Charter of Rights and Freedoms for an order declaring that the mandatory retirement of the applicants by the respondent was invalid and infringes, denies and is inconsistent with the rights of the applicant as guaranteed under s15(a) and (7) of The Charter of the Rights and the Freedoms and that the applicants be reinstated as full-time members of the Faculty immediately and that pay to the applicants as employees since the date of their mandatory retirement plus interest, and costs of the proceeding.

6_1994canlii3963.txt,"The respondents were charged with possession for the purposes of trafficking and cultivation of marijuana, contrary to s. 4(2) and 6(2) of the Narcotic Control Act. RCMP had investigated a tip that a large crop of marijuana plants was being grown on a private property located in a clearing off a woods road. They did not have a search warrant to enter the property, and arrested the respondents after observing them care for the plants.

6_1996canlii6791.txt,"Allegations by the former wife and a child and family counsellor that the father and his new wife had physically and sexually abused the two children were found by authorities to be baseless. The co-defendants, the mother and counsellor, protested that they were under a duty to report the disclosures of abuse. At issue was whether the publication of four reports was libellous thus causing damage to the plaintiffs' reputations, whether they conspired to libel them in order to obtain custody, and whether the counsellor was incompetent and unqualified to assess and counsel the children and negligent in the preparation of the reports. HELD: Judgment was awarded against the defendants jointly and severally in the amount of $27,000. Aggravated damages of $1,000 was awarded against the mother and $15,000 was awarded against the counsellor and her company.  1)To prove that each defendant published written defamatory statements likely to injure their reputations, three presumptions must be made: the statements were published maliciously (malice in law); the statements were false; and the plaintiffs suffered damages. 2)Every publication of a defamatory statement is a new publication. It is no defence that the mother merely distributed the counsellor's reports. 3)Counsel conceded that the allegations in three of the reports, on their face, were defamatory.  4)The mother enjoyed qualified privilege prima facie because parental duty is so compelling. Two reports containing untrue and degrading allegations were in themselves intrinsic evidence of malice. The long history of the mother's attempts to discredit the plaintiffs was extrinsic evidence of impure motive or malice. The taping of the phone calls was considered to be just another trick to try and advance her cause. 5)The counsellor's reports tendered in court enjoyed absolute privilege but that privilege was lost when she published them to various social workers, the police and the doctors. This is true whether the reports were of an ordinary or expert witness. 6)Both criteria, making a report maliciously and without reasonable grounds, must be satisfied before an action will lie pursuant to s.12 of the Child and Family Services Act. Three reports were slanderous. 7)The conspiracy claim was dismissed. 8)The counsellor had extensive educational background but no clinical training in counselling or interviewing children and 45 sessions were excessive. 9)The counsellor owed a fiduciary duty to the children as their counsellor but owed no corresponding duty to their parents. The negligence claim was dismissed. 10)The long-lasting mental distress of the plaintiffs was clear and they were entitled to aggravated damages. They were not awarded punitive damages as there was no need of further deterrence.","The parties were involved in a custody dispute.

The father and his present wife, both professionals, both sought and were granted joint custody of the boys. The children were to have their father's consent to home study. The co-defendants sued for defamation alleging that the children had been sexually abused and that the counsellors had been negligent in their preparation of the reports. The court dismissed the application and ordered that the trial be held in Family Court. The Court of Appeal held that the evidence of the allegations was not sufficient to justify the application. The evidence of defamation was not enough to justify a trial. The facts of the case were that the allegations were true and the counselling was incompetent and unqualified to assess and counsel the children and negligent in the preparation of reports."

The respondent took the position that this Court should not entertain the application as there is a convenient alternative remedy provided in the Act by way of appeal to the provincial Police Commission; that the Chief was entitled to amend the notice and would be entitled to grant leave if required; the hearing officer erred in holding that s.54(1) of the Act requires notice of an internal investigation to be provided to the subject member.

6_2000skqb355.txt,"FIAT. The applicants, charged separately, plead not guilty to cultivation and possession of marijuana and sought to have the evidence obtained pursuant to the authorizations for electronic surveillance and search warrant be excluded from trial and requested a stay of proceedings on all charges.  They argued the search warrant, which resulted in the seizure of 365 marijuana plants, should be set aside on the additional grounds police officers allowed two news media camera crews onto the premises to film during the course of the search thereby rendering the search unreasonable pursuant to s.8 of the Charter. The primary ground was that the police did not try any available investigative procedures before applying for a surveillance authorization. As the matter was not urgent s.186(1)(b) of the Criminal Code was not complied with. The Crown objected to the defences' reliance on portions of the preliminary inquiry. The Crown produced an edited copy of the affidavits in support of the electronic and video surveillance warrants wherein all dates and other information were deleted to protect the identity of a principal source of information. HELD: The application for a stay of proceedings was dismissed. The evidence obtained pursuant to the electronic surveillance and the video surveillance warrant were ruled inadmissible at trial. The search warrant respecting the residence was set aside. The seriousness of the charge combined with the real evidence of the 365 marijuana plants outweighed the breach of the Charter s.8 right to be secure from unreasonable search and seizure. The exclusion of the evidence obtained from the search of the premises would bring the administration of justice into disrepute. 1)The portions of the preliminary inquiry transcript were allowed by way of affidavit subject to the right of the Crown to call amplification evidence.  2)The affidavit in support of the authorizations were considered solely on the basis of the edited copies. 3)The affidavit did disclose a current offence. It was not obvious why the Crown edited out the dates. 4)The 1997 authorization was set aside. The search was unreasonable and in breach of s.8 of the Charter. The s.186(1)(b) pre-conditions for granting an authorization were not met. There was no information contained in the affidavit or the amplification evidence which could support an objective standard that other investigative procedures were unlikely to succeed. The impression given the issuing judge was false and misleading. The fact pattern was the reverse of that in Dosch. The information was limited to the existence of a marijuana grow operation on a rural acreage owned by Derksen with whom Begrand-Fast was alleged to be involved. Neither had a criminal record. The boilerplate paragraphs as to why other investigative procedures were unlikely to succeed had no factual basis.  5)The information submitted to establish reasonable and probable grounds was exclusively information obtained from the electronic surveillance authorization. A good faith argument was not available because the information submitted in support of the warrant was tainted by the conduct utilized to obtain the authorization. The evidence obtained was equally a product of a serious infringement of the applicant's s.8 Charter rights because once the tainted evidence was excised for the affidavit in support there was no evidence supporting the issuance of the warrant. The privacy interest was comparatively high. The nature of the constitutional breach was major. The means of obtaining the authorization was misleading because the reasons offered for not conducting a further investigation lacked a factual basis. 6)The residence search warrant was set aside. The affidavit provided no indication of the source of the informer's knowledge. The issuing justice was therefore unable to assess the reliability or the credibility of the information. The fact the source is credible does not mean the information provided is reliable. 7)The seriousness of the breach was not at the high end of the scale. There was an attempt to comply with the Criminal Code and two of the three requirements were met. While good faith was not found with respect to the information offered in support of the electronic authorization, there was nothing in the information presented with respect to the search warrant that lead to a conclusion of bad faith. On balance the administration of justice would not be brought into disrepute with the admissibility of this evidence.  8)The Criminal Code makes no provision to add the names of civilians to a search warrant. The reasoning in R. v. West applied and the search of the Derksen residence was conducted in an unreasonable manner contrary to s.8 of the Charter. A Collins analysis favoured the inclusion of the evidence including the plants. The police were attentive to privacy issues in supervising and restricting the television cameras. The officer set grounds rules that the residence could not be identified in any broadcast. The drug section was not the initiator of inviting the media along. It was coincidence that the corporal did so on a search where the warrant was subsequently held to be invalid. The two events did not amount to a course of conduct. 9)The improper seizure and retention of personal property of the accused was a collateral matter and did not affect the fairness of the trial.","FIAT: The applicants, who are charged with cultivating and possession of marihuana, were scheduled for separate trials this fall before a Judge and a Jury. The accused had brought a Charter motion in advance of jury selection to set aside two provisions of the authorization. The provisions of section 186 CCC 60 day authorization for electronic surveillance primarily directed at their residences and their cell phones. The Crown argued that the authorization for the electronic surveillance should be set aside and as information obtained from the electronic eavesdropping was utilized in obtaining the video surveillance warrant, both of these warrants should also be set off on the basis they are derivative of the electronic authorization which is alleged to be unlawful. HELD: The application for a stay of proceedings was granted. The court found that the provisions of s. 187 of the Code were not admissible. The application was dismissed. The Court held that the court was not obliged to grant leave to allow cross-examination of witnesses with respect to an authorization for surveillance. The order for the authorization to be set set aside was made in light of the fact that the applicant had a large marijuana grow operation and that the police had allowed two news media camera crews onto the premises to film during the search. The applicant sought to have the evidence obtained pursuant to the authorizations and warrant excluded from trial and that it was an appropriate case to direct a stay on all charges against both applicants. The applicants relied on the British Columbia Court of Appeal decision of R. v. West (1998), which held that there was a general rule that all evidence should not be admissible on an application to set-off the authorization, bearing in mind the Crown has the right to call evidence to expand, explain or add to the evidence elicited at the preliminary inquiry. The other objectives referred to in paras. 20 and 21 of the transcript were to have evidence obtained under the authorization and warrant exclude from trial. The applications for a stays of proceedings were to set off the search warrant on the grounds that the applicants had allowed the police to film at the applicant's residence. The last paragraph of the summary judgment judgment judgment was to set the search warrants aside on the ground that they are a derivative of an electronic authorization that is alleged be unlawful and the court found the accused had no criminal record. The paragraphs were to be left to the exercise of the trial judge. The following paragraphs were edited to make them more palatable to the applicant. The paragraph on the third paragraph was to be used as an example of how to use the third paragraphs."
6_2003skqb170.txt,"The appellant, who received a suspended sentence with a one year probation order, appealed his conviction of assault (Criminal Code s.266) on the grounds the trial judge erred in law in making findings of fact and credibility based on evidence that did not exist (photographs of injuries that were not introduced into evidence at trial); by misapplying the appropriate standard of proof; although correctly articulating the test in R. v. W(D), misapplying that test in determining credibility; by failing to apply the appropriate test for a defence of necessity. The complainant, frightened by the sudden verbal outburst of the appellant, fled into the bush and refused to return because his mood had not changed. The trial judge did not accept the appellant's testimony that he used force only to protect the complainant from natural hazards in that location at night. HELD: The appeal was allowed. The conviction was set aside and a new trial was ordered. 1)Finding that there were photographs to corroborate the testimony of the complainant relating to her injuries was an error of law. No miscarriage of justice resulted from that error, as it was immaterial.  2)The trial judge clearly preferred the testimony of the complainant to that of the appellant but did not state why. It could not be concluded that his belief in the existence of photographs influenced the findings of credibility. Even if it did, there was still ample evidence to support a prima facie case of assault. Again no miscarriage of justice resulted. 3)The trial judge erred in law by failing to properly consider the defence of necessity. The three elements that must be present for a defence of necessity, as determined by the SCC in Latimer, include imminent peril or danger; absence of reasonable alternatives; proportionality between the harm inflicted and the harm avoided. The defence of necessity is considered in cases where there is an air of reality. The only evidence relating to the defence of necessity came from the appellant. It would not be appropriate in the circumstances of this case to substitute an acquittal. Had the trial judge applied the appropriate test, he may have come to a different conclusion.","The appellant was convicted of assault contrary to s. 266 of the Criminal Code. He was sentenced to a 1 year probation order and placed on probation. During argument on behalf of the appellant, the trial judge suggested that the trial's decision to use photographs to corroborate the complainant's testimony of her injuries was an error of law. HELD: The appeal was allowed and a new trial ordered. 1)The trial judge correctly stated, considered and applied the test where credibility is in issue. He concluded that his belief in the existence of photographs influenced his finding of credibility. Even if it did, there was still ample evidence to support a prima facie case of assault. 2)The court found that there were photographs to confirm the complainant’s testimony relating to her injuries. No miscarriage of justice resulted from that error. It was immaterial whether there were injuries. The conviction cannot be set aside for that error of a law alone. 3)The Court of Appeal did not err in concluding that his evidence in the presence of photographs affected his finding that the accused’ s defence of necessity. Even though it did not appear that the appellant’d used force only to protect the complainant from natural hazards, the evidence was corroborated by the complainant. 4)The appellant”s evidence was not accepted by the trial court. 5)The evidence was found to be corroborated through photographs to support the appellant. 6)The Trial Judge failed to apply the test for a defence of need. The trial judge erred in law by making findings of fact based on evidence that did not exist; (i)The accused” s defence was not supported by the evidence. The court was left in a situation where on the basis of the evidence accept, am convinced beyond a reasonable doubt by that evidence of the guilt of the accused."
6_2004skca37.txt,"Fulltext of judgment follows:[1] We do not need to hear from counsel for the respondent. I mentioned during the opening of this appeal that members of the panel had followed the usual practice of carefully reviewing the trial record and written arguments before this hearing.[2] We are all of the view that there is no basis to interfere with the decision of Mr. Justice Smith. As his extensive reasons for decision disclose he addressed the matter thoroughly. [3] This was a difficult case in which the trial judge was required to carefully address the competing claims for custody, but mindful of the 'best interests of the child'. Throughout the trial and in his reasons the learned trial judge focussed on this predominant issue. And in our view he addressed it as required by law. [4] We cannot say that the learned trial judge erred in any material respect when weighing and considering the evidence. Since the parties were unable to resolve the issues to their mutual satisfaction, it fell to the trial judge to make a 'hard choice'. He had the distinct advantage, that we do not have, of seeing and hearing the parties and being able to form an impression of them. [5] We dismiss this appeal with costs on double Column 5. [6] We cannot part from this appeal without noting the acrimonious history of litigation concerning custody and access. The welfare of [B.E.] would be better served by a spirit of compromise. The time, energy and expenses incurred in protracted litigation could be put to better use in advancing the welfare of this young child.","The respondent appealed. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. The trial judge was required to carefully address the competing claims for custody, but mindful of the best interests of the child.

6_2004skpc25.txt,"The accused was charged with driving a motor vehicle with a blood alcohol level exceeding .08. The Crown filed a certificate of analysis pursuant to s. 258(1)(g) of the Criminal Code for the purpose of proving the accused's blood alcohol level. The word and symbol 'Breathalyzer' had a line drawn through them and above the same was written 'Intoxilyzer'. There was no symbol with it. In the blank that followed was written '5000C'. This change was not initialed. The issue was whether s. 258(1)(g) of the Code requires that the approved instrument be identified by way of make and model. HELD: The charge was dismissed. The Court found the Crown could not rely on s. 258(1)(g) of the Code and there was no evidence of the accused's blood level. 1) The Court found that in order for a certificate of analysis under s. 258(1)(g) of the Code to constitute evidence as set out in that subsection, the make and model of the approved instrument has to be set out in the certificate or be proven by other evidence.  2) It was not possible to know who made the alteration. The use of a certificate is a shortcut afforded to the Crown. If it is to be employed, it must be employed correctly. In the circumstances, the approved instrument was not adequately identified as to make and model.","The accused was charged with driving an automobile with a blood alcohol level exceeding eighty milligrams of alcohol in one hundred millilitres of blood.

HELD: The accused was found not guilty. 1)In order for a certificate to constitute evidence as set out in s258, to constitute an evidence as defined in s254(1) of the Criminal Code, the make and model of the approved instrument has to be set out either in the certificate or be proven by other evidence. 2)The accused did not make any unusual or unusual changes to the instrument. The technician did not advance any unusual model. The accused's model was not approved by the Crown. The court noted that the technician did make some very unusual and unusual changes. 3)The certificate was not properly designated. The evidence was not sufficiently advanced to establish that the accused was impaired. The model was of a very unusual type and the technician was not qualified to make such an instrument."
6_2005nsca65.txt,"Following the close of the Crown's case on a trial of several weapons related offences, the defence moved for a directed verdict on the basis that there was no evidence that the offences occurred on the date alleged in the Information. The Crown sought to amend the Information to change the date of the offences. Without ruling on the motion to amend, the trial judge granted the motion for a directed verdict. The Crown appealed. Appeal allowed; acquittals set aside; new trial ordered. The directed verdict should not have been granted as, in this case, the date of the offences was not an essential element of the offences. If the directed verdict was not based on the discrepancy with the date, than the appeal would have to be allowed on the basis that the trial judge gave insufficient reasons which prejudiced the Crown's right of appeal.","The Crown appeals from acquittals entered by Judge Sherar of the Provincial Court on five charges relating to the possession and storage of prohibited weapons. The Information alleged that the accused was a resident of the home where the firearms were found, that he was subject to an order prohibiting possession of firearms and that he had stolen two sawed off shotguns. The accused argued that the trial judge erred in allowing the motion for directed verdict even in absence of an amendment and that the date of the offence was not the only insufficiency. HELD: Appeal allowed. The appeal is allowed. 1)The trial judge did not err in granting the motion. The evidence presented by the Crown was not sufficient to meet the required test. 2)The reasons for granting the order were so inadequate that they do not meet the test for sufficiency of reasons because they do provide no indication of why there was insufficient evidence. The trial judge also erred by granting the a directed verdict based on the discrepancy between the date the offence is alleged to have been committed and the evidence presented at trial because the date was not an essential element of the offences. 3)The Court found that the reasons for denying the motion were so insufficient as to be reversible errors."
6_2005skqb211.txt,"The parties separated in October 2003. They have a child born May 27, 2002. The parties have agreed to an order of joint custody with the child residing primarily with the petitioner. The petitioner wishes to move from Saskatoon to Edmonton. HELD: Based on the loss of the respondent as an active co-parent and the petitioner's vague and uncertain plans for the child's care in Edmonton, it is not in the best interests of the child that he be allowed to relocate to Edmonton with the petitioner.","The petitioner and the respondent are the parents of a child. The petitioner and respondent have joint custody of the child. They agreed to an order of joint custody with the child primarily residing with the petitioner. The respondent opposes the move. HELD: The order is granted. The child is to have access with the respondent primarily residing in Edmonton. The court has declined to allow the relocation of the petitioner to Edmonton. Based on the loss of Harley as an active co-parent coupled with Charlene's vague and uncertain plans for the child's care in Edmonton, what is an appropriate access schedule for the respondent to have with the applicant. The Court has not decided on the best interests of the applicant or the child, but the court has determined that the best interest of the respondent is that the child be allowed to move to Edmonton with the assistance of the court. The applicant has no vehicle or driver's licence so relies on the Saskatoon Transit Service for her transportation. The application judge's misapprehension of the existing parenting arrangement has significant consequences for the applicant and the child in the circumstances. The issues are as follows: 1)Is it in the best Interest of the appellant to relocate from Saskatoon to Edmonton? 2)Is the child to move with the appellant? 3)Is there an appropriate relationship with the access parent? 4)The court has not determined the best relationship with respect to the child or the parenting arrangement. The best interests are the child and the parenting relationship is the best one. The relationship is only relevant in the exceptional case where it impacts on that parent's ability to meet the child’s needs. The most precise test would risk sacrificing the child if it was in the childs best interests to expediency and certainty. The more precise test is to find out what is in the interests of a parent when the child is moving to Edmonton, and what is the ideal access schedule. The evidence is that there is a significant bond between the respondent and the applicant that would be lost if the child were allowed to relocate to Edmonton and the court is concerned about the vagueness, uncertainty, and speculative nature of the proposed move. The fact that the respondent has a significant family in Saskatoon and has taken a year off from further studies and is working part-time, which would result in a significant distance from the applicant’ s parents. The parties have filed their respective income information and will make the requisite child support order based on the evidence."
6_2007nssc119.txt,"Two teenaged children were placed in the care of the father, who resided in Alberta, under the joint supervision of the Nova Scotia and Alberta agencies. Unknown to the court, the father's common law partner had an extensive child protection history. There were significant problems in the father's home, resulting in the older child removing herself from her father's care and going to live with an adult relative who also had a child protection history and the younger child disappearing for a time until the mother, who lived in Nova Scotia, finally tracked him down. The mother now sought the return of both children. The Nova Scotia agency sought to have its involvement terminated, arguing that both children were now old enough to self-protect. Although the younger child wished to return to the mother, the older child threatened to run away if removed from her current living situation. Children removed from the supervised care of the father and placed in the temporary care of the Nova Scotia agency with access to the mother and services to be provided to the mother and the children; the agency misled both the mother and the court by failing to disclose crucial information about the father's common law partner and the circumstances of the children once they were placed with the father and this failure was both inexplicable and inexcusable; costs are the appropriate remedy against the agency. Although the mother had completed some counseling, there was a substantial risk that both children would suffer physical harm if returned to her care due to her inability to supervise and protect them adequately. The mother continued to require professional intervention.","The court reviewed the files of the respondents' children. The court found that the Agency failed to disclose relevant information to the court and to the Court. The Court ordered an out of province courtesy Supervision Order from Cape Breton-Victoria. The children were placed in the supervised care of the Agency's parent, who was no longer in the Agency’s care. The Agency requested that the children be placed in a home with the partner, who had recently moved to Nova Scotia. The parties also requested that a supervised placement be made for the children, who were now in the adult care of their father, who now lived with his sister. The agency also requested an order dismissing the Nova Scotia proceedings. The child protection concerns were more of concern for small children, and the Agency did not approve of the children’ placement with the common law partner. The mother had been placed with the child’d sister, who lived with the father. The father had been in the agency’ s home for three years and had moved to Alberta. The sister had been living with the mother for three months. The parents had moved from Nova Scotia to Nova Scotia and the children had been separated from their father. When the father moved to the new home, the sister became increasingly frustrated and the father had made arrangements for her to live with him. The two children had moved in with the other sister. When they moved to Edmonton, the Agency had no contact with the sister and the sister had refused to allow the sister to live in the home with her. The siblings had been involved in a rocky common law relationship between 1985 and 1995. The relationship deteriorated over time and the mother became increasingly isolated from the children. She became increasingly concerned that the father was planning to enter residential treatment for substance abuse and the siblings were not accepting services. The Minister of Children and Family Services requested an investigation by the Agency. The Children’S Aid Society of Cape Bretea had been contacted by the Minister of Child and Family Affairs and the Minister had requested an inquiry by the RCMP. The RCMP had advised the Agency that the child had been moved to a new home and that the agency was working with the children to find a suitable home for the child. The applicant had also requested a home assessment. The information concerning the children was not disclosed to the Agency until May 2005. The Department of Children‘s Services had received a letter from the Agency in February 2006. The letter stated that the mother had moved into the new residence with the three children."

6_2008skca156.txt,"The Crown appeals an order from Provincial Court declaring that the accused is unfit to stand trial. The accused was charged with 29 offences arising out of failures to comply with multiple bail conditions. He was also charged with two indictable thefts. He is 22 years old and suffers from fetal alcohol spectrum disorder, attention deficit disorder and substance abuse. He was diagnosed as mildly mentally retarded and is considered incapable of handling the responsibilities that would enable him to live independently and will always need a protected living environment and sheltered employment. He was found unfit to stand trial on some previous property offences and is still under the supervision of the Provincial Review Board. The trial judge was satisfied that the accused met the first two criteria for fitness to stand trial Ã» he understood the nature of the charges against him and the possible consequences of being found guilty and he understood the difference between a guilty and not guilty plea. The focus of the decision was whether the accused had the capacity to communicate with counsel. The judge found that the accused would not be able to provide instruction to counsel during the trial process due in part to the fact that he is very distractable and could not sufficiently follow court proceedings to instruct counsel. HELD: Appeal allowed. The verdict of unfit to stand trial is set aside and a new trial ordered. The trial judge applied too stringent a test on concluding that the accused was unfit to stand trial and when the proper test is applied, it is apparent that the accused has the capacity to instruct counsel within the meaning of the Code. The trial judge's concern about the accused's distractable nature does not accord with the limited cognitive capacity test. The Courts have applied a test of 'limited cognitive capacity' for determining fitness. This test requires that, with respect to communicating to counsel, the accused is only required to be capable of recounting the fact of the alleged crimes. Limited cognitive capacity does not require analytic ability or the need for the accused to appreciate his own best interests. The authorities establish a very low threshold for fitness to stand trial in keeping with the policy objectives of the Criminal Code and the right of the accused to make full answer and defence.","HELD: The appeal was allowed. The court found that the trial judge misapprehended the evidence, misstated the evidence and applied the wrong legal test for fitness, applied the right to an unreasonable and not supported by the evidence. The Court found that, although the accused had been diagnosed with a mental disorder, the trial court erred in finding that the accused was unfit to stand trial. The accused was found fit to stand because he had shown that he was able to reason on higher cognitive levels, because of his lack of abstraction, and because of being 'locked in his delusional system'. The accused had shown signs of depression, anxiety and some form of paranoid schizophrenia. The trial judge concluded that the evidence did not support his conclusion that the defendant was unfit."

6_2009skqb394.txt,"The plaintiff bought a house. She used the services of Cecilia Mui, a realtor associated with the defendant 100% Realty Associates Ltd. operating as Re/max Saskatoon. The house was purchased from the defendants Edward and Verl Karpinski. The vendors' realtor was the defendant, Mario Jacobucci, owner of the defendant Trevi Holdings Ltd. The house did not meet the plaintiff's expectations. She now sues the defendants seeking recovery of damages for alleged latent defects. She claims Ms. Mui fell below the standard of care required of a realtor representing a purchaser. She claims Ms. Mui was negligent in misrepresenting certain facts and breached the fiduciary duty expected of her. The plaintiff claims the Karpinskis misrepresented facts to her, negligently and fraudulently. The plaintiff claims that Mr. Jacobucci and his company are liable to her in damages, both in negligence and as parties to the misrepresentations made by the vendors. Special and general damages are claimed as are aggravated damages and punitive damages. The trial took place over 22 days, spanning several years and included testimony from 14 witnesses. Two main issues are raised. The first is the liability of each of the defendants. The second issue is quantum of damages. The credibility of the parties is at the forefront of the determination of the issues. HELD: The vendors are liable to the plaintiff for breach of contract. Each of the defendants is a tortfeasor, each having breached an obligation or duty owed to the plaintiff, whether through negligence or misrepresentation. Their wrongful acts and omissions all contributed to the same damage. In that respect their liability is concurrent. The liability of the vendors and Mr. Jacobucci is joint, and that of Ms. Mui is several. As concurrent torfeasors, the fault for the damage shall be apportioned equally among the four of them.  1) Credibility is not a science, see R. v. Gagnon, 2006 SCC 17. It is not always possible to articulate with precision the complex intermingling of impressions that emerge after watching and listening to witnesses and attempting to reconcile the various versions of events. The principles and tools to be used in assessing credibility are summarized in Novak Estate (Re), 2008 NSSC 283. 2) Certain of the evidence of the Karpinskis and Ms. Mui is so unreliable that the whole of their evidence is cast with doubt. 3) The opinions and conclusions of Mr. Loraas and Mr. Epp are accepted by the court. They are professionals with no interest in the outcome of the action. Their evidence was largely unchallenged. The Court finds that the pine shakes were rotten, sealant had been applied to the shakes on at least two occasions and prior to the plaintiff offering to buy the property, the shakes were not properly installed allowing water to seep into the house, the skylight leaked and caulking had been applied to stop the leaking before the plaintiff offered to buy the house, there was improper and inadequate venting which resulted in moisture damage to the interior of the house and mold in the attic, the moisture damage in the house included damage to drywall and paint blisters. Nail pops throughout the house were largely the result of the house being moved. No inspection was done after the house was moved. 4) The Court finds the Karpinskis did not speak truthfully or completely when they answered the questions in the Property Condition Disclosure Statement (PCDS). The Court does not accept that the vendors were not aware of water and moisture damage arising from the improperly installed shingles, the missing ridge caps, the leaking skylight or the lack of venting. The sealant on the roof was sufficiently old to predate the plaintiff's purchase of the house. The vendors repaired the sink holes and moisture pockets and effectively concealed the problems. It should have been disclosed. Although the vendors denied knowing of the structural damage to their house, they knew the house had been cut in half and moved 300 kilometers and had sustained damage. The structural problems were concealed by the vendors through repairs to the dry wall, reinforcement at stress points, and repainting and patching of wall paper. The fact that the house had been cut in half and moved should have been disclosed on the PCDS. 5) It is not only current defects or ongoing problems that need to be disclosed on a PCDS. A prospective purchaser does not look to the PCDS only to ascertain that the roof is not leaking on the day it was signed, see Kaufmann v. Gibson, [2007] O.J. No. 2711 (Ont. S.C.) (QL). The Karpinskis are liable to the plaintiff for breach of contract for failing to disclose the existence of structural defects, damage due to water and roof leakage. The terms of the PCDS formed part of the agreement between the parties and the deliberate withholding of this information amounted to a false representation as to the condition of the home. With respect to damage arising from these defects, the doctrine of caveat emptor does not apply. 6) The requirements for negligent misrepresentation have been established by the plaintiff. The failure to disclose, or silence as to a known defect, amounts to an act of concealment of a material fact and has the same effect as an express misrepresentation and is sufficient to attract liability, Thomas v. Blackwell, 1999 SKQB 168. 7) The false representations knowingly made by the vendors and their silence as to material facts were fraudulent. 8) Ms. Mui was negligent and her conduct and advice to the plaintiff fell below the standard of care expected of a realtor acting for the purchaser of a rural property in 1999. She did not conduct any preliminary background checks with the Rural Municipality, which would include determining if proper permits had been obtained, prior to the plaintiff's offer to purchase. Ms. Mui did nothing more than merely mention a home inspection to the plaintiff on one occasion. At no time did she recommend a home inspection even after she knew the house had been moved and before the condition regarding a satisfactory PCDS was removed. Another reason to strongly recommend a home inspection would be in circumstances where the realtor knew that a rural municipality did not require building inspections and Ms. Mui knew this to be the case. The plaintiff relied on the representation of Ms. Mui to her detriment. Had Ms. Mui disclosed all material facts to the plaintiff and explained and recommended a home inspection, the Court is satisfied that the outcome for the plaintiff would have been different. Knowing the house had been moved and had not been inspected the plaintiff would have most likely reconsidered her decision to purchase. 9) The Court is satisfied that Mr. Jacabucci is liable to the plaintiff for negligent misrepresentation. He represented that the home was of 'quality construction'. This was incorrect. Mr. Jacobucci was also complicit in, and party to, the negligent misrepresentations made by the vendors in the PCDS. He knew the house had been moved and sustained damage. He also knew the skylight leaked. The plaintiff relied on these misrepresentations and damages resulted.  10) The costs incurred by the plaintiff to repair the house total $17,613.

She hired the services of a realtor associated with the defendant, 100% Realty Associates Ltd. After a lengthy search, the plaintiff purchased the home in 1999. She claimed that the defendants fell below the standard of care required of a professional realtor representing the purchaser of a residential property. She also claimed damages for alleged latent defects in the house. The realtor, Cecilia Mui, was hired to look at the property. The plaintiff was unable to obtain a building permit because of the extensive renovations. She sued the defendants for damages for latent defects. The court found that the realtor and her husband were negligent in misrepresenting certain facts and breached the fiduciary duty expected of the plaintiff. The Court found that both parties were liable to the plaintiff in damages for the alleged latent problems."

The latter was not opposed. There was also an issue regarding an affidavit filed by the respondent, which referenced but did not attach the applicant's defence. The respondent argued it was unnecessary to attach a document already filed with the court. Change of venue granted in part: the applications will continue to be heard in Halifax, but the trial will be held in Windsor as requested. Neither party has a connection to Halifax. The respondent operates from Stewiacke and the dispute arose in Hants County. The attachment order is terminated, with costs of $1,000 to the applicant. An attachment order is an intrusive pre-trial remedy and will hinder the corporate applicant's attempts to resume/expand operations. Here there is no conduct to justify maintaining the order. The mere allegation of a connection between the individual and corporate defendants is insufficient to cause the court to pierce the corporate veil. The respondent has failed to establish any of the relevant grounds governing attachment orders. The Rules require facts, not allegations or suspicions. The affidavit in question was flawed. It should have attached the defence in order to properly incorporate the references to it.","The plaintiff moved for an order terminating an attachment order against it pursuant to Rule 44.10. The plaintiff alleged that the defendant had interfered with the plaintiff's timber harvesting contract and sought a change of the place of proceeding. The defendant argued that the attachment order was an intrusive pre-trial remedy and that its existence would hinder any attempt by the plaintiff to resume or expand its operations. The applicant sought costs. The court found that the affidavit of the plaintiff did not properly incorporate the contents of the statement of claim. The mere allegation of a connection between the individual and corporate defendants was not sufficient reason to dispose of the corporate veil. The affidavit of a corporation that is not registered under the Corporations Registration Act did not establish any of the grounds for the attachment. The only grounds for termination were that the plaintiff had not established any of them under Rule 44 and that the plaintiffs had not shown any principled basis to do so. The fact that the defendants had not made sufficient efforts to bring the claim to final determination was not enough grounds to terminate the attachment and the plaintiff was not acting in any way that necessitated security for the plaintiff. The Court awarded costs to the applicant of $1,000 payable in any event in the cause."

7_2010nsca95.txt,"The first defendant was the lessee and driver of a motor vehicle that was involved in a motor vehicle accident with the plaintiff. The second defendant was the lessor of the vehicle. The plaintiff brought an action against both the lessor and lessee, arguing that the second defendant was liable, both as the owner of the vehicle under the Motor Vehicle Act and pursuant to common law vicarious liability, for the lessee's negligence. The second defendant successfully applied for summary judgment, with the court finding that the lessor was not liable under the Motor Vehicle Act as the lease was not a 'rental contract' as defined in s. 62 of the Act and the lessor was not an 'owner' as defined in s. 2(ak) and the current state of the law did not suggest that a claim of vicarious liability had a real chance of success between a lessor and lessee. Both the plaintiff and the first defendant appealed. Appeal dismissed; the reverse onus provision in s. 248 does not apply in this case; the argument that the lease was not a conditional sales agreement but rather a rental agreement had no real chance of success and the fact that a vehicle is subject to a lease does not change the fact that there is no vicarious liability at common law between the owner and the driver of a vehicle.","The appellants appealed a decision granting summary judgment to the respondent, Chrysler, granting summary judgement on the basis that it was not vicariously liable for the negligence of Giffin. The Chambers judge concluded that there was not a real chance of success on the arguments advanced by Giffin respecting Chrysler's alleged liability by operation of the Motor Vehicle Act. HELD: Appeal dismissed. 1)The issue is unambiguously determined by the precedents. The court found that s. 248 has no application on the facts of this case. 2)The reverse onus provision does not apply. The appellants were involved in a motor vehicle accident and Gilbert sued the respondent for compensation in respect of injuries sustained in the accident. The respondent appealed. The issue before the Chambers judge was whether the appellants established that their claim for vicarious liability against Chrysler had a real prospect of success. The lease clearly falls into the 'lease with right of purchase' exception to the definition of 'owner.' The lease contains the characteristics noted in s. 2(ak) and can realistically be depicted as a rental contract as defined in s62. The plaintiff had an option to purchase the vehicle at the expiry of the lease for the same amount. 3)The court found no real chance for success on either the argument that the lease between the respondent and Giffin was actually a rental deal pursuant to s. 62 of the Act, nor the claim that Chysler is an owner pursuant to the Motor Vehicles Act. 4)The Court found that there is no real prospect for success based on the argument made on the evidence. The argument that Giffin and Chrysler were in the business of renting motor vehicles without drivers, who rents vehicle without driver, otherwise than as a bona fide transaction involving the sale of the motor vehicle, permitting the renter to operate the vehicle upon the highways, had a very real chance to succeed. 5)The lease falls into a 'lease' with rightof purchase' exemption to the meaning of 'ownership'. The lease contained the characteristics identified in s2(ak); it cannot realistically be described as a'rental contract' as defined by s62; and in failing to do so committed an error of law. 6)The issues on appeal are whether the Chambers Judge properly applied the law in Bazley v. Curry, 1999 CanLII 692 (CanLII), [1999] S.C.R. 534 (Q.L.) and the law that has developed since that case was decided. The Court concluded"
7_2011nspc27.txt,"The female driver, the accused and two other men were in a vehicle that was stopped on suspicion of being involved in a robbery. A gun and many of the stolen items were found in the vehicle and all the occupants were charged with a number of offences, including robbery. The accused denied being in the area where the robbery occurred but alleged that they had stopped and picked up the two other men. While at the police station, he pulled a ring that had been reported stolen out of his pants and placed it on his finger. At his trial, one of the other men testified that he had pled guilty to the robbery; the driver testified that she had driven directly from her home to where the vehicle was stopped by the police, without stopping; and the complainant testified that he had been lured to the driver's house, where he was ambushed by her and three men, robbed and threatened. Although his descriptions matched the two other males in the vehicle, he positively stated that the accused was not the third person. Accused found not guilty on all charges; the Crown had not proven that he was involved in the robbery or that he should have known there was a gun or stolen property in the car. Although the circumstances in which the accused was taken into custody were more than suspicious, the fact that the complainant had clearly seen the robbers but had made a positive non-identification created an inconsistency that raised a reasonable doubt.","The accused was charged with robbery and possession of a stolen firearm. The accused was found in a car with three other people in it. The police stopped the accused and found the accused in the back seat of the car loaded. The court found that the accused had not been in Sackville at all. He had nothing to do with any robbery. The fact that the police had stopped the car when it was stopped by the police suggested that the person who had been picked up in the car was the person in the vehicle who had earlier admitted to the robbery. HELD: The accused is found in the accused's car with the gun and the stolen property in his possession. The description of the accused is consistent with the description of one of the three men in the Car. The Court found that, in the circumstances, the accused clearly saw the people who robbed him. The evidence from the Crown witness who testified at the police station that he was picked up by the accused when the others were picked up at some building, somewhere in Fairview, was not consistent with his description. The Crown witness was not asked to identify the accused. The defence lawyer was not called to testify. The only person who was able to identify him was the Crown's witness. The witness was also not called. The circumstantial evidence was not strong enough to resolve the narrative inconsistency. The victim clearly saw his assailants when the police stopped it in high risk take down and their identities would be pretty quickly determined. The descriptions of the other two men who were in the police car matched the description given to the accused by the Crown. The trial judge was not required to provide an identification to the court. The inconsistencies in the narrative were not resolved by assuming that the victim was either mistaken or not telling the whole truth. The judge was able, however, to reconcile the inconsistencies in his evidence with the circumstantials. The first inference was that the Crown was not able to establish that the defendant was involved in the robbery because he was not familiar with the area. The second inference was not supported by the circumstantsial evidence. The officer was not entitled to make an inference that the court was not aware of the circumstances surrounding the robbery and that the only person he could have identified was the accused himself. The third inference was also supported by circumstantially circumstantical evidence."

The defendant denied the claim and affidavits were exchanged before a simplified trial date was set for May 2012. The trial was rescheduled to June when counsel for the defence withdrew. Just before the trial, the president of the defendant corporation requested that he be allowed to represent his corporation pursuant to Rule 10(2) of the QBR and notified the Court and the plaintiffs that his corporation had just been dissolved. This development raised three issues to be decided before the simplified trial could proceed: 1) did the Court have jurisdiction to hear the simplified trial; 2) what is the status of the dissolved corporate defendant?; and 3) what is the appropriate process during the trial?

As far as the third issue was concerned, the Court held that simplified trial would proceed and that the president of the dissolved corporate defendant would be permitted to represent it.

The chambers of the defendants also gave notice that they wished to cross-examine the deponents of affidavits filed in each other's case. HELD: The simplified proceeding was allowed to proceed. The court found that based on the basic and fundamental principle of trial fairness, the trial should proceed against the dissolved defendant corporation but that the dissolved corporate defendant should be allowed to defend the action commenced before its dissolution. The Court ordered that the plaintiff be allowed in the simplified courtroom. The chambers were to produce the depositors of affidavit filed in the other case. The plaintiff was to be produced for cross-examination. The dissolved corporate was to produce a witness for the purpose of cross- examination. The Chamber of Commerce was to present its witness for cross examination.  1) The Court found that the Chamber of the Commerce requested that the affidavit of Orion Morgan be considered by the Court on its behalf.

7_2012skqb510.txt,"The defendant was charged with unlawfully harvesting forest products contrary to s. 79(1)(a) of The Forest Resources Management Act, unlawfully possessing forest products without a licence contrary to s. 79(1)(c) and unlawfully trafficking in forest products contrary to s. 79(1)(f) of the Act. He was acquitted of the first two charges and convicted of the third. He appealed his conviction. He was fined $1,000 with a 40% surcharge. The Crown appealed the sentence. The appellant argued that since he was acquitted of the related charges, it followed that he should not have been convicted of trafficking. The charges had arisen as a result of a lengthy undercover investigation into the activities of the appellant. He was known to be harvesting fire kill in the Nesbitt Forest, which was Crown land. He stored wood on his property and on that of a relative. If the appellant was using it himself, he did not require a permit. The undercover conservation officer purchased fire wood from the appellant, who told the officer that the wood was from Crown land in an answer to officer's question whether it was cut on private land. The appellant did not testify at his trial nor did his relative and so the evidence of the conservation officer was uncontradicted. The evidence presented on his behalf was from individuals who had purchased wood from the defendant. The trial judge held that the charges against the appellant were strict liability offences and once the Crown had demonstrated beyond a reasonable doubt that the prohibited acts had been committed, the appellant had to establish on the balance of probabilities that he had been duly diligent and took all reasonable care to avoid offending. With respect to the first two charges, the trial judge held that he was not satisfied that during the period described in the indictment that the Crown had proven the actus reus of the offences but that it had on the third count, based on the appellant's own words to the officer. The appellant argued on appeal that his words could have been taken to mean that he was describing where he harvested wood for his own use and therefore his statement was not an admission that he sold wood to the officer or anyone else from Crown lands. HELD: The Court held that the trial judge erred in his reasoning and conclusion that appellant was guilty of trafficking because he had not been duly diligent. It is only if the actus reus was proven beyond a reasonable doubt that the considerations of whether due diligence had been proven would arise. The conviction could not be maintained because the qualifying actus reus was not proven. However, the other aspect of the evidence, which was not expressly considered by the trial judge and which would sustain a conviction, was if evidence established trafficking via another modality. Since s. 2(dd) of the Act defines 'traffic' to mean 'to offer for sale, barter, deal, solicit or tradeÃ ' and s. 79(1) states that it is an offence to traffic in forest products from Crown land without a licence, then the offence is complete by offering the product for sale without a licence. The appellant led no evidence to establish he had either the required permit to harvest forest products from Crown lands or a licence or any other form of authorization to deal in forest products. Thus, the evidence established beyond a reasonable doubt that the appellant was guilty of trafficking in forest products contrary to s. 79(1)(f) of the Act. The conviction was upheld. Regarding sentencing, the Court held that it was important to deter other offenders. The trial judge's sentence of a fine equivalent to the levy avoided (the provincial charge per cord of wood) was inappropriately low. The Court set the appropriate fine at $5,000 plus a victim fund surcharge of 40% as required by s. 3 of The Victims of Crime Regulations. If the fine was not paid within 60 days, the appellant would serve a term of imprisonment of 90 days.","The defendant appealed his conviction on a charge of unlawfully harvesting forest products and unlawfully possessing forest products. He argued the Crown had proven beyond a reasonable doubt that the wood he sold to an undercover officer was wood harvested from Crown lands. The Crown appealed the sentence imposed on the conviction of unlawfully trafficking in forest products, arguing the fine was unreasonable or insufficiently low and that the evidence established that the accused had unlawfully harvested wood from Crown land. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. 1)The evidence of the conservation officers was uncontradicted. 2)The Crown appealed. 3)The Court of Queen's Bench found that a fine of $1,000 with a 40% surcharge was an unreasonably low penalty for the offence the evidence establishes. 4)The acquittals on the charges of unlawfully harvested and unlawfully possessed forest products have not been appealed. 5)The trial judge must show great deference in reviewing the decisions of trial judges, interfering to vary sentence only if the sentence is clearly unreasonable or demonstrably unfit."
7_2015skqb352.txt,"Family Law – Custody and Access – Best Interests of ChildFamily Law – Custody and Access – Interim – VariationFamily Law – DivorceFamily Law – Evidence – AffidavitThe parties were in a high-conflict situation and brought five interim applications with various requests. They had three children, the youngest being born five days before a previous application. At the initial application the respondent mother was living in the family home and the petitioner was living at the family cottage and expected to move into the new home when it was ready. The petitioner did move into the home, which was a few blocks from the family home. The youngest child was almost a year old and the petitioner was having increased parenting time with him. The parties agreed to have a custody and access report prepared. The issues were: 1) divorce; 2) registration of the middle child in Montessori school. The respondent opposed the child attending the school because he was not yet potty trained. The petitioner advised that the school was okay with the child not being potty trained; 3) to take the child to a speech therapist. The parties ended up resolving the issue before chambers; 4) varying the existing parenting arrangements.  There was an interim order from January 2015 made shortly after the third child was born. The respondent had since hired a full-time nanny. The respondent did not necessarily oppose the petitioner spending more time with the youngest child, but she wanted to be the one to control the developing of that time. The petitioner wanted the child Wednesday afternoon to evening and Sunday from 11:00 am to 4:00 pm. He also wanted increased time with the two older children so that he could get them to their necessary activities and so that they could continue to develop their bond with him; 5) arrears of child and spousal support; 6) the respondent’s request to return the 2005 vehicle. The vehicle had been at the parties’ farm and was damaged beyond repair without insurance. The petitioner then towed the vehicle to the respondent’s home; 7) objections to one of the petitioner’s affidavits; and 8) costs. HELD: The issues were decided as follows: 1) the divorce was granted because the parties had been separated in excess of a year and no satisfactory reasons were argued for not allowing it; 2) the court held that it would be appropriate for the child to be enrolled in the Montessori school. The cost of the program was ordered to be paid by the petitioner. The parties were to agree on the child’s transportation to the school and if they could not agree the petitioner would transport him; 3) the court kept the issue under its jurisdiction so that either party could bring the matter back upon two days’ notice; 4) the pre-trial conference was months away and the court did not find it appropriate to have the matter of increased parenting time proceed to a pre-trial conference, as a stand-alone issue. The court found that it was in the best interests of all the children to have further time with the petitioner as he requested. The court also dealt with transportation for the hockey and the middle child’s skating; 5) counsel agreed that the issue of arrears due under the support provisions would await further discussion at the pre-trial conference with either party having leave to bring the matter back on two days’ notice; 6) the matter was adjourned sine die on two days’ notice; 7) the complaints were not generally well-founded; and 8) the petitioner was entitled to costs of $1,000 in any event of the cause. The respondent was entitled to costs of $200 in any event of the cause. The court declined to send the matter to the high-conflict mediation program.",HELD: The Court granted the application. The Court held that it did not have a reason for the denial of the divorce. The court found no reason for it to vary the existing parenting arrangements. The child was now one year old and the respondent was the primary parent with the children. The parties had been separated for over a year. The respondent had made payments to the petitioner and the petitioner had been unable to transport the child. The issue was resolved prior to the matter coming to chambers. The fact it continued to be argued in chambers is perhaps more reflection of the lack of communication between the parties than any real issue surrounding this part of the child’s life. The order was made to allow the parties to proceed with the parenting arrangements and to allow them to decide on the parenting roles. The father was to pay for the child to attend the program. The mother was to advise the petitioner as to the child and the child was to be responsible for getting the child there. The petitioner was to have the child registered in the Montessori program.

7_2018skqb90.txt,"Civil Procedure – Queen’s Bench Rules, Rule 6-75 The applicant insurance company sought an order for interpleader pursuant to Queen’s Bench rule 6-75 regarding premium surpluses it held in the amount of $3,550,800 that were generated between 1990, when it issued a group life insurance policy to the respondent, Agricultural Credit Corporation (Ag Credit), and 2015, when Ag Credit terminated the policy. The applicant requested that the monies be paid into court and that directions be provided as to how the determination of ownership would be decided. Ag Credit took the position that the funds paid as premiums were Crown funds and thus any surpluses were the property of the Crown and properly payable to Ag Credit as its agent. It argued that the interpleader order was unnecessary. The purpose of the group life insurance was to ensure that outstanding loans made by Ag Credit to borrowers were paid in the event of the borrowers’ deaths. Individual borrowers paid the premiums applicable to them by paying those amounts to Ag Credit, who remitted the payments to the applicant. There was no clear direction regarding the surpluses in the policy or in the Superintendent of Insurance Guidelines or applicable legislation. HELD: The application was granted subject to the court hearing further submissions from both parties regarding such things as whether the surplus should be paid into court or left to be administered by the applicant during the proceedings. The court found that the insurance company was entitled to some form of interpleader relief and dismissed Ag Credit’s claim to the surplus. It ordered that a representative be appointed to represent the class of insured clients in the proceedings in order to determine who was entitled to the surplus.","The ultimate issue in these proceedings is who is entitled to certain insurance premium surpluses totalling $3,552,881.00. The ultimate issue is who has an arguable claim to the surplus totalling 3,552.881 plus interest accrued since. The policy stipulated that the funds paid as premiums were Crown funds and thus any surpluages were the property of the Crown and properly payable to it as the Crown's agent. Since no other person has a competing interest to the Crown’s right and title, the interpleader order sought by Empire Life is unnecessary. The surplutuses can and should be paid to it without the necessity of any interplead order or directions as to how to proceed."

The city appealed. Dismissing the appeal, that the trial judge did not commit an error in law. S.363(3) of the Halifax City Charter, under which the respondent was charged, refers to land as opposed to buildings, and cannot be interpreted to include the exterior finishes of buildings, a category already dealt with in s.363(6), which covers the unsightliness of buildings caused by neglect, not overt actions.","The respondent owned several buildings on Robie Street.

The information to obtain the warrant did not meet the test in R. v. Debot, 1989 CanLII 13 (SCC), [1989] 2 S.C.R. 1140, and therefore the warrant should not have been issued. The defendant argued that the information obtained by the information did not satisfy the test and therefore that the warrant was therefore warrantless, breached his Charter s. right to be free from unreasonable search and seizure, and that evidence obtained by it should be excluded under s. 24(2) of the Charter of Rights and Freedoms. HELD: The evidence found at the nature of the evidence was compelling. The evidence confirmed that the defendant was selling drugs or that drugs were being sold or used at his apartment, or both, and there was evidence on which the Justice could conclude that this was continuing activity and that it was on-going at the date of the warrant application.

They also agree that the subsection is a right of first refusal clause. It is clear that the subject matter of the clause is a 'Participating Interest in the Program Land or a Project Area'. HELD: Appeal dismissed orally. The appellant relies on the words in parenthesis 'the Parties being absolutely prohibited from selling, assigning, transferring, conveying or otherwise disposing of any interest other than all of part of its Participating Interest' to establish its case that the voting agreement contravenes the terms of the joint venture agreement. However, subsection 14.01, with the words in parenthesis deleted, creates a complete right of first refusal. In our view, the words in parenthesis, rather than being intended to create substantial new contractual obligations, were intended, as is buttressed by the parenthetical structure, merely to recall to the parties their dedication of assets to the joint venture, and their inability to dispose of them qua separate assets. Thus, the phrase in parenthesis is mere surplusage in that it does not add or subtract substantively to subsection 14.01 or the joint venture agreement as a whole.

These claims related to the actions of an investor formerly employed by the defendant. The matter had languished at a slow pace for many years. The evidence showed the plaintiffs had taken three years to reply to a demand for particulars. There was also delay when the defendant requested a change in the plaintiff's counsel (because of a conflict of interest). The defendant applied to dismiss the plaintiffs' action, claiming want of prosecution under the Rule 28.13 of the old Civil Procedure Rules (1972), and asserting it has suffered significant prejudice as a result of the delay such that it will be impossible to properly defend the claim. Application dismissed. While there has been inordinate delay (eight-and-a-half-years) attributable to the plaintiffs, the defendant is also responsible for some of the delay (another two-and-a-half-years). While the plaintiff's delay could be considered inexcusable if viewed in isolation, the defendant's contribution to the delay is not irrelevant. There were actions on the part of the defendant that could be interpreted as acquiescing to the delay. After considering the case law concerning the circumstances in which a presumption of prejudice will arise as a result of the passage of time, the court found no presumption of prejudice here. On the facts, there is not a sufficient causal connection between the delay/blameworthy conduct and the prejudice. There is a significant documentary record of the transactions. The defendant has been in contact with its former employee and could have taken the opportunity to discover him sooner. The defendant's failure to act to secure the evidence available to them at time mitigates the effects of the passage of time. While there is a possibility of some prejudice should the matter proceed, the defendant has not established it will suffer serious prejudice. Even if there was serious prejudice, the balance of convenience weighs in favour of the plaintiffs given that dismissing the action would leave them with no other recourse.","The plaintiffs sought to dismiss a proceeding for want of prosecution pursuant to Rule 28.13 of the Civil Procedure Rules. The application was made in accordance with Rule 28(13) because it was a matter of fact and not a political action.

The defendant had retained a solicitor of record and had advised the plaintiffs that they intended to move the matter forward. The plaintiff had not received the particulars until May 2006. The defendants had retained another solicitor of the record in Nova Scotia. The solicitor of general had retired in December 1997. The delay was caused by the death of the plaintiff's solicitor and the difficulty in locating competent counsel to advance the claim. The lawyer who represented the plaintiffs at the time of the action was not retained. Even allowing for two-and-a-half years of delay, this means the delay of attributable to the plaintiffs was of some eight years, which is inordinate."

By contrast, the respondent’s witnesses were friends seen from time to time, neighbours, and his mother. The court found the respondent’s mother to be evasive and guarded at times. To determine custody the court reviewed the factors set out in s. 8 of The Children’s Law Act, 1997. The petitioner was found to be the primary parent of the child since his birth. The court was left with a degree of uncertainty as to the day-to-day activities of the child when he was with the respondent. The quality of the child’s relationship with the petitioner was found to substantially exceed that of the respondent’s relationship with the child. The court accepted that the child said disturbing things upon his return to the petitioner from the respondent. The child’s need for a stable, reassuring, and positive home were found to be met in the petitioner’s home. The court indicated that decreasing the respondent’s time with the child may ameliorate the adverse effect on the child’s emotional needs. The child was also found to be afforded more social fulfillment in the petitioner’s care. The petitioner also had more constructive plans for the child’s future. The respondent’s negativity towards the petitioner was found to negatively impact his ability to parent. The court concluded that it was in the child’s best interests to primarily reside with the petitioner. The petitioner was granted sole custody of the child so as to minimize further conflict between the parties. The respondent was given unsupervised access every other weekend. The court added $5,000 to the petitioner’s line 150 income for the personal component of her vehicle expense deduction. After determining the respondent’s income the court found that the s. 3 Guideline child support due by the respondent to the petitioner was $676 per month and that he should be responsible for 37 percent of the s. 7 expenses. The petitioner did not request child support but instead asked the court to consider it in the distribution of property. The respondent discharged the onus of establishing a common-law relationship of two or more years. The respondent’s pension value available for division was found to be $11,663.97.  The court did not find an extraordinary circumstance to warrant an unequal division of the family home. The value of the home was $360,000. The court used the date of application to determine the amount owing on the home. The petitioner also had rental properties and was given an exemption of $90,641.43 for those properties. After taking into consideration all of the property and exemptions, the respondent failed to prove that he was entitled to any distribution under The Family Property Act. The petitioner did not claim an equalization payment. Costs were awarded to the petitioner and the respondent was restricted from bringing a further court application until those costs were paid.","HELD: The Court ordered interim shared custody of the parties. The parties had been together for four years. The petitioner had previously filed an Answer and Counter-Petition in 2012 contesting the respondent’s claims for sole custody, specified and supervised parenting time, and costs. The respondent had previously been granted interim shared parenting time. The Court found that the parties had not spoken since the parties separated. The court ordered the parties to proceed to an expedited pre-trial conference. The judge ordered the parents to have Z. on a shared week-on-week basis. The mother had moved out of the home and was now living with the petitioner. The father had been receiving Worker’S Compensation benefits and top-up from SaskTel. The wife had moved in with the husband. The husband had been living with his mother for several months. The two parties had reconciled in December 2012. The child had been in the mother’ s house for a few days. The relationship had been going on for some time. HELD: 1)The Court found the parties were not in a relationship. The children had been separated for four months. 2)The parties had a provisional agreement that the child would be in the interim care of the mother. The parents would have access to the mother when the trial could be held. 3)The court found that there was no evidence that the father had physically harmed the child. The evidence did not support the petitioner’d claim. The fact that the mother had physically restrained the child from the father was not sufficient evidence to justify the claim. 4)The evidence did support the parties’ contention that the respondent had physically assaulted the child and that the petitioner had been unable to contact the father. The agreement was not binding on the parties as the child was not a party animal. The only evidence that could be found was that the husband had physically abused the child for several days prior to the birth of the child, and that he had physically threatened the petitioner and her mother."

The contractual language used by the parties was clear that they intended to resolve disputes by final and binding arbitration. Even if it had found that the parties had not contracted out of s. 45(2) of the Act, the application for leave would have been dismissed because the proposed grounds of appeal did not raise a pure issue of law.","HAL applied for leave to appeal the decision of an arbitration panel. The arbitration panel was constituted to resolve a commercial contractual dispute between HAL and SecurTek. The parties entered into three separate contracts designed to accomplish the business goals of the parties. They were (i) the International Distribution and Software Licence Agreement (IDSL); (ii) the Software Customization Agreement (ESMA) and (iii) the Escrow and Software Modification Agreement (EMMA). HELD: The application was dismissed. A term permitting an appeal from the arbitrators' decision on an error of law simply does not fall into the category of the obvious, or something that goes without saying, in the factual matrix of this case. Such an implied term is not akin, for instance, to the implied term of good faith in contractual negotiation, or the implied terms of good workmanship in contracts for repair or renovation work, or to the term of reasonable notice of termination in contracts of employment. The terms of the agreements, which contain clauses relating to the minimum sales target that Securtek was required to meet in order to maintain its exclusive right to distribute its products, were clearly intended to be binding. The fact that the parties referred to one specific instance in which an appeal would be permissible was significant. The absence of reference to any other circumstances in which appeal would not be permitted was intentional. The decision of the arbitration panel constituted to determine the commercial contractual disputes between HAL, Secur Tek and SecuraTek was not inadvertent, but intentional. It reflects the role of courts of appeal in ensuring the consistency of the law rather than providing new forum for parties to continue their private litigation. The court must conclude that these matters are referred to as questions of mixed law and fact, rather than a question of law."

It found that the time between service of the statement of claim and the default judgment was not sufficiently long to prevent the defendant from defending the action. As well, the defendant had provided an arguable defence to the claim in that it pled in its proposed defence of non-compliance with s. 2(3)(b) of the Indian Act.

On appeal it was held to be entitled to a refund for each of the three years in the total amount of $420,000. The plaintiff, pursuant to s. 41(I) of the Judicature Act, sought payment of interest on this amount from the date of the payments. Awarding 5 months interest, that the date from which interest is calculated in this type of action is upon completion of the appeal process. An appropriate interest claim under s. 41(I) therefore only exists for the five month period between the Court of Appeal's assessment determination and the refund of the property tax five months later.","The plaintiff municipal tax payer paid its property taxes as assessed for the years 1994, 1995, 1996 and 1997 but on appeal was held entitled to a refund for each of the three years in the total amount of $420,177.13. The plaintiff sought interest on the refund from the date it made the overpayments in response to HRM's tax invoices requiring payment of those amounts on the due dates in 1994, 1996, 1995 and 1996. The court upheld the Utility and Review Board's assessment determination which translated into $420.13 overpayment of taxes. HRM paid interest on this amount for the five month period between the Nova Scotia Court of Appeal assessment determination in March 1997 and the payment of the property tax refund in September 1997. HRMs earned interest on that money from the time of receipt or had the use of these monies. HELD: 1)There was no right to a full refund of overpaid taxes until March 1997 when the Nova Nova Scotia court of appeal rendered its decision upholding the reduction in the assessment. An appropriate interest claim does exist under s. 41(i) of the Judicature Act, supra on the principal amount for five month periods between the the Nova SCC assessment determination and the November 1997 decision and the September 1997 payment of property tax refunds as well as on the unpaid interest until date of judgment. An interest rate of 8.75% being a rate equatable to the interest rate charged by HRM on overdue taxes (prime plus 4.75) is an appropriate rate on the balance of principal amount of the five year period between Nova Scotia Supreme Court of Appeals assessment determination of March 1997 to the date of the refund on September 1997 and on the outstanding unpaid interest from September 1997 to date of Judgment. 2)There is no right or entitlement to a return of overpaymentof taxes until the March 1997 date the Nova Scotian Court of appeal decision upholding a reduction in assessment. There was no entitlement to the refund of the overpaid tax until March 1998 when the Halifax Regional Municipality rendered its ruling upholding the assessment decision upholding it. 3)The Court of Queen's Bench awarded interest on an overpayment in the amount of approximately $420 to HRMs. HRH was under direct mandatory statutory obligation pursuant to s. 90 of the Assessment Act, s.41(i), supra to refund any amount overpaid as soon as the appeal process concluded."

In issue was whether the assessor erred in law by misconstruing or misapplying the provisions of the Assessment Manual in determining the MAF for the appellant's shopping centre properties by using a single sale to calculate the MAF; and by creating as a commercial building neighbourhood the grouping of fully enclosed shopping centres which encompassed the entire city. HELD: 1)The assessment was set aside and the matter was remitted to the assessor to be dealt with according to the manual. Both issues were dealt with in Cadillac Fairview v. Saskatoon (TWL CA00074) and the same reasoning applied. 2)The appellant conceded that the question of whether the various expansions of the shopping centre resulted in abnormal functional economic obsolescence was a question of mixed law and fact and was thus beyond the scope of this appeal. 3)The second branch of the appeal was dismissed. Whether the committee erred in law by saying the definition of functional obsolescence did not apply to an add-on type of construction was beside the point since that was not the ground for the decision. The decision was not the result of any wrong interpretation of the manual but was the result of the appellant's failure to establish to the committee's satisfaction the facts on which it based its case. The decision was therefore beyond the Court of Appeal's jurisdiction to review.  4)There was no order as to costs as success was divided.","This appeal was taken under s.33.1 of The Municipal Board Act, s.23.2. It was from a decision of the Assessment Appeals Committee of the Saskatchewan Municipal Board. The issues raised by the appellant in this case respecting the MAF to be used in calculating the assessed value were exactly the same as those raised in another judgment, issued concurrently with this one. The appeal was allowed on the same basis in respect of these grounds of appeal. HELD: The decision was arrived at not as a result of any wrong interpretation of the manual, but as a consequence of the appellant's failure to establish to the satisfaction of the committee the facts on which it based its case.  1)The decision was not a result to any wrong interpretations of the Manual but rather a result that the appellant failed to establish the facts of the Committee the facts upon which it relied.  2)The appeal was arrived too late in the process of reviewing the assessment of Midtown Plaza in Saskatoon. It is one of a series of appeals heard at the same time dealing with the application of a newly introduced market adjustment factor to assessments for municipal tax purposes.  3)The issues raised in this appeal were exactly those raised and dealt with in another decision issued concurrently. The Saskatchewan Assessment Manual summarizes and defines functional obsolescence in this way: formula, rules and principles for determining the amount of money spent on a project. The formula is specific that all normal functional obsolescentence is accounted for in the Maf. Abnormal functional obs obsolescences is accounted only for if there is an inability of an improvement to perform the function for which it is used. 4)The appellant only raised two issues: 1)Did the assessment adjust the MIFF by misconstruing or misapplying the provisions of the assessment manual or by creating a commercial building neighbourhood the grouping of fully enclosed shopping centres which encompassed the entire City of Saskatoon?  2.)Did the Assessor err in law by misapprehending or misunderstanding the provisions in the Assessment Manual in determining the market adjustment factors for the appellant properties by using a single sale to calculate the market adjust factor?  3.)Did he err in his interpretation of abnormal functional obsence as defined in the Manual? 4)Did he erred in law in concluding that the definition of functional obsolesence did not apply to an add-on type construction, or by finding that there must be an inability to an improvement of the function to perform for which the appellant is used? 5)The"

The trial judge had found that both parties had exhibited a lack of interest in their child and there was little to distinguish either of them as the better custodial parent. As the mother had facilitated the father's access to the child and he had not demonstrated the same willingness and that the most important relationship in the child's life was with his sister, who resides with the mother, the trial judge found that it was in the child's best interest to foster that relationship and grant custody to the mother.

HELD: Johnson Seeds was awarded judgment for $50,850.05 and pre-judgment interest together with costs of the action. 1)There was a valid contract between the parties. Damages were assessed as of January 1994 when Johnson Seeds knew that the defendant was in breach of the contract. 2)The issue was whether communication by delivery of the fully executed contract was necessary to complete the contract. The parties communicated by fax, mail and telephone. There was no doubt that the defendant verbally confirmed that a contract did exist. Discussions prior to May 1993 were pre-contractual negotiations. 3)Johnson Seed knew that it was prepared to pay 10 cents only if delivery occurred after January 1/94.

b_1999canlii13927.txt,"The issue was whether it was appropriate for the court to require the accused to commence the trial by calling evidence on a Charter voir dire, where the accused gave notice of a Charter application. This would differ from the usual procedure, wherein the Crown commences the trial by calling its witnesses in the trial proper, and thereafter the accused applies for leave to apply the Crown evidence to the Charter application, where it is appropriate, in addition to calling other defence evidence on the application.HELD: In R. v. Kutynec, the court made the following determinations: 1) whatever procedures are used should not unnecessarily interfere with the inherent jurisdiction of the trial judge to control the conduct of the trial; 2) instead of creating procedures for Charter applications in provincial court, it is better to leave judges the discretion to determine matters such as sufficiency of notice and the extent of the offer of proof; 3) counsel should give timely notice to the Crown of the Charter issue, and at trial, the accused should be able to state with reasonable particularity the grounds upon which the application is made; 4) objections to admissibility of evidence must be made before or when the evidence is proffered; 5) the onus is on the accused to demonstrate on a balance of probabilities that he or she is entitled to a Charter remedy; 6) the trial judge should insist defence counsel state his or her position on possible Charter issues, either before or at the outset of the trial; 7) failing timely notice, a trial judge is entitled to refuse an application to assert a Charter remedy; 8) fairness may require the accused be given some latitude to explore potential Charter issues which he or she had no opportunity to develop prior to trial; and 9) the trial judge must control the proceedings to ensure this legitimate exploration does not become a fishing expedition. In R. v. Loveman, the court said the trial judge must ensure fairness and preserve the integrity of the trial process. This may require a judge to refuse to hear a motion where insufficient notice has been given, even when the motion involves an application to exclude evidence under s. 24 of the Charter. In R. v. Habhab, the court was asked to consider a procedure which involved entering into voir dire at the start of the trial and the Crown proceeding to lead their evidence at the outset regarding the Charter application and substantive issue. The court dismissed this proposal and stated that the case law implies it is the accused's obligation to lead the evidence on the voir dire. The court was not able to justify the proposed procedure. If the authorities imply there is an obligation on the accused to call evidence first on the Charter voir dire, this can occur by the application of some or all the evidence which is already on the record on the substantive issues. The admissibility of evidence can be reserved by the court pending judgment on the Charter and any s. 24 remedy. An advantage of having the Crown evidence on record at the outset is it removes uncertainty as to the nature of the testimony as it relates to the Charter application. This is preferable to the accused calling the Crown witness at the outset on the voir dire, discovering aspects of the evidence are contrary or unfavourable, and then having to convince the court to grant leave to cross-examine. It avoids a scenario where the Crown witness evidence is led by the defence on the voir dire, and then the accused must impeach the creditability of this witness in cross-examination as it relates to the proof of the substantive issues. The court concluded the fairness of the proceedings and public confidence in the administration of justice, were best served by the Crown first leading its evidence on the charge alleged and the accused having leave to request the evidence be applied to the Charter issue, if appropriate.","The issue was whether it was appropriate for the court to require the accused to commence the trial by calling evidence on a Charter voir dire, where the accused has given notice of a Charter application. This would differ from the procedure which is usually utilized, wherein the Crown commences the trial in the trial proper and thereafter the accused applies to the court for leave to apply the Crown evidence to the Charter application, where it is appropriate to do so, and in addition to calling other defence evidence on the application. The issue was also raised in these proceedings whether it is proper for the Court to require a accused to begin the trial on a voir de dire, or where the defendant has given Notice of a charter application. HELD: The Court found that the procedure proposed by the Court was appropriate and reasonable. It would differ in that the Crown commenced the trial the same way as the accused commences a trial by call its witnesses in the Trial proper and then the accused applied to the Court for leave in the Court's jurisdiction to apply Crown evidence or to the application, and also in addition, calling other evidence on it. The Court reviewed the authorities which have been filed by the Crown. The court found that it was preferable to leave judges the discretion to determine matters such as sufficiency of notice and the extent of the offer of proof. It also found that there were instances where the defence could ask the court of leave to exclude evidence. The accused was not entitled to sit back and hope that something will emerge from the Crown's case to create a Charter argument or assist in one counsel is already prepared to make."

After being involved in an accident, the accused was taken to hospital where a blood demand was given and eventually acceded to. The accused challenged the validity of the blood demand and argued that his right to counsel was violated. Accused guilty of operating a vehicle when his blood alcohol level exceeded the prescribed limit; there was no violation of the accused's right to counsel. The officer had valid grounds to make the demand, having been advised that the accused was in an accident, that someone had said the accused was either high or intoxicated, having smelled a mild odour of alcohol on the accused and the accused having advised him that he only had three beer. Even if the accused's claim to amnesia for all the events around that time was believed, there was no medical evidence to suggest that he could not understand what the officer said to him at the hospital. Although his degree of alertness may have fluctuated, he displayed an understanding of the situation by showing appropriate concern for how much he had been drinking and asking questions which showed an understanding of his situation and what speaking to counsel would entail.","The accused was charged under s. 253(b) of the Criminal Code with operating a motor vehicle when his blood alcohol level exceeded the prescribed limit. The accused was found guilty of impaired driving. HELD: The accused is found guilty. 1)The accused displayed an understanding of his situation through words and actions spanning a significant period of time. 2)The Court found that the accused possessed sufficient understanding of the circumstances surrounding his offence to warrant a blood demand. 3)The officer focused on the accused's understanding of what took place in the hospital regarding his right to counsel. The Court found an error in law in his interpretation of s. 10(b). 4)The court found that while his degree of alertness may have been fluctuating and his emotions unstable, the accused nevertheless displayed an awareness of his situations through words, actions and statements spanning a considerable period of period."
b_2002skpc50.txt,"An application for a DNA warrant on the basis s.487.05 (the general warrant provision) of the Criminal Code with respect to DNA warrants does not refer to a form. The applicant suggested a tape recording would avoid the potential problems in bringing the application before a Provincial Court Judge. HELD: These concerns were raised in the January 21 decision concerning potential prejudicial or negative effects, which outweigh any requirement to swear the Information before a judge. An oath taken before a commissioner or notary is as valid as it is before a provincial court judge and avoids all the possible problems that relate to personal attendance. The intention is to make protocol work as flexible as possible, not impeding the police in their legitimate role, while making sure the court maintains its independence. Form 5.01 is specifically set out in the Code. Section 487.1 does not have a form, but even if it did and used the same words 'taken before me', that would elevate form over substance in a significant way.","The accused applied for a DNA warrant.

The applicant had raised concerns about potential prejudicial or negative effects of a personal attendance before the judge.

b_2006nssc221.txt,"Two years after the divorce, the wife applied to vary the spousal support provisions of the parties' Corollary Relief Judgment, which incorporated the terms of Minutes of Settlement. Pursuant to the Corollary Relief judgment, the husband was currently paying the wife $4,350 per month as spousal support. The wife now wished to increase the monthly support to a figure which would more closely resemble that assessed pursuant to the Spousal Support Advisory Guidelines, along with a substantial lump sum to compensate her for the underpayment of spousal support for the past two years. She also sought removal of a clause which provided for the discontinuation of support if the husband's professional income dropped below $80,000. The parties had been married for approximately thirty years and had one child, who was now independent. Application dismissed; the parties' current circumstances did not constitute a significant departure from the range of reasonable outcomes anticipated by the parties when the Agreement was signed. Both parties' income had increased since the divorce and the wife was not deeply in debt, as she alleged; there was no pressure exerted and no oppression during the course of negotiations; the Spousal Support Advisory Guidelines are not law and allow for exceptions to the general formulas provided, one such exception being the assumption of debt by one of the parties (the husband in this case); the spousal support figure recognized the husband's reasonable expectation of retirement and the fact that he was experiencing health problems; it was completely foreseeable at the time that the Agreement was signed that, given the wife's age, she might experience difficulty in finding employment in her narrow field; the subsequent increased value of one of the husband's properties was not a reason to vary the spousal support provisions of the Agreement.","The parties were married for over 29 years prior to their separation and had a daughter. The parties separated in May 2001 when the respondent moved from the matrimonial home and they were divorced in February 2003. At the time of their separation, the parties were granted a Corollary Relief Judgment. The applicant applied to vary the spousal support provisions of the Corollaries Relief Judgment, which incorporated the terms of an agreement signed by the parties. The respondent argued that the Agreement was sound when it was signed, that there have been no material changes in the circumstances of either of the parties since it was made and that the respondent did not take advantage of any vulnerability of the applicant. HELD: The agreement was valid and the applicant was bound by it. 1)The parties had been married for 29 years and had been engaged for 29 of those years. Although the parties had separated for over two years prior, the agreement was signed in good health and the parties' agreement with respect to spousals was not unconscionable. 2)The Agreement was signed with respect respect to the terms and conditions of the Agreement. The Agreement was not intended to be a complete and complete agreement. The agreement included the terms for spousa and the terms on which the parties agreed. 3)The agreement was not in substantial compliance with the objectives of the Divorce Act. The court found that there had been no change in the situation of either party since it signed. The husband had made modest mortgage payments and the wife was left essentially debt free while the respondent was assuming debts in excess of $300,000. The rental income more than covered the mortgage payment. 4)The respondent did nothing to take advantage or deference to the applicant's vulnerability. The amount of spousas payable by the respondent and the amount of the respondent were to be paid by the applicant in the amount set out in the Corolla Relief Judgment was $1,000,000 and the respondent had made no effort to reduce the amount owing to the wife. 5)The court found no evidence of coersion or coersion. The agreements were not intended for this Court to substitute what it might have ordered had the parties proceeded to trial. Although both parties were engaged in a long and successful marriage, the husband was in his late fifties when he received his doctorate and had spent time in the matriculation home. The wife was in the process of completing her university education. The mother was working part-time and the father was working full-time."
b_2007nsca75.txt,"A single vehicle accident occurred when the driver swerved to avoid hitting a dog that ran onto the highway. An action was brought against both the driver and the farmer who owned the land on both sides of the highway on the basis that the farmer owned the dog in question and was negligent in failing to keep it off the highway. The farmer contended that although he owned a dog, it was tied to a tree at the time and his was not the dog that had run onto the highway. When his application for summary judgment was dismissed, the farmer appealed. Appeal dismissed. At this stage of the proceedings, it was not necessary for the plaintiffs to prove that the defendant's dog contributed to the accident or the truth of the statements and evidence attached to the affidavit. It was only necessary to show that the facts were contested, there was some evidence to support their version of events and, if their evidence was accepted by the trier of fact, their action had some merit. Although the judge appeared to blur the two parts of the test on a summary judgment application, the Court found that the farmer failed to meet the first part of the test; namely, that there was no genuine issue of fact for trial as there was conflicting evidence as to the identity of the dog involved.","The defendant was charged with negligent driving and failing to stop his vehicle. The plaintiffs brought an action against the defendant and his sister, who were killed. The defendant claimed that he swerved to avoid hitting a dog that ran onto the highway in front of him. The defendants brought an application for summary judgment on the basis that the defendant had failed to establish that he owned the dog. The chambers judge admitted and relied on the affidavit of the defendant. The plaintiff appealed. Allowing the appeal and dismissing the appeal, that the chambers judge erred in applying the test for summary judgement. The application for dismissal was dismissed. The court found that the applicant met the burden placed upon him in step one of the two step test and that the plaintiffs met the onus on them in the second part of the test."
b_2010nssc125.txt,"The plaintiff bus driver was in a serious bus/motor vehicle accident that killed two people. He was charged with dangerous driving. His employer offered the services of its lawyer, who eventually transferred the file to the defendant who represented him at trial. At trial, the Crown introduced a video of a purported accident re-enactment. The defendant chose not to object to its admission, saying he felt it was a perfect example of the Crown's 'doomed to failure' theory. As for the problems (it was recorded in the daytime, while the accident happened at daybreak; it assumed the vehicle that was struck was stopped, although there was no proof it was; and it didn't show all of the vehicles at the original scene), he felt these could be addressed by cross-examination. The plaintiff was convicted. He retained a different lawyer to represent him on appeal, and won. Eventually, the charges were dropped. The lawyer's competence was not raised as an issue on appeal. In their decision, the Court of Appeal criticized him for not objecting to the admission of the video and other evidence. They found this evidence was inadmissible, highly prejudicial and should never have been put to the jury. The plaintiff sued in negligence and breach of contract. The parties introduced conflicting opinions from criminal law experts to support their respective positions. Action dismissed. The standard of care is that of a reasonably competent lawyer. Lawyers make strategic decisions and exercise judgment, but are not responsible to ensure a certain result. Sometimes the decisions are wrong: it is only negligence if it was outside the realm of acceptable possibilities in the circumstances of the case. The appeal panel had the benefit of hindsight - it is improper to judge the plaintiff's actions in light of their conclusions. While the experts were not helpful in establishing what a reasonably competent lawyer (as opposed to a specialist in the field) would do, their differing opinions illustrate how the admissibility of evidence can be the subject of much debate.","The plaintiff was charged with dangerous driving causing death. Following the laying of criminal charges, the plaintiff's employer suspended him from work without pay. The plaintiff offered to use his legal counsel to defend him in relation to the criminal charges. The defendant refused and the plaintiff brought an expert's report. The expert's evidence was so favourable that it was not necessary to object to the admission of the still photographs. The court found that the expert's opinion was so accurate as to be of no relevance to the plaintiff’s case that it should have been admitted into evidence. The Court found that while the video re-enactment was a very good example of how the accident could have gone, it was also not a very convincing example of the Crown’ s flawed theory. The video evidence was not admissible and the court found the expert’d opinion was not supported by the evidence."

b_2011skpc30.txt,"The accused was charged with impaired care and control of a motor vehicle and care and control of a motor vehicle while his blood alcohol level exceeded .08. The accused was found in the driver's side of a vehicle with his legs near the pedals. His body was slumped over into the passenger side. The vehicle had collided with a power pole and sustained significant damage. The engine was running when the police arrived. There was no one else in the vehicle. The accused was transported to hospital where the doctor suspected he had a brain bleed and recommended the police obtain a blood warrant. The officer who swore the Information to Obtain the warrant indicated that the interior of the vehicle smelled strongly of beverage alcohol and the accused smelled of beverage alcohol. The Justice of the Peace did not sign the Information to Obtain. The issues before the Court were whether there had been a breach of the accused's s. 8 right to be free from unreasonable search and seizure and whether the Crown had proven beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused was in care and control of the motor vehicle. HELD: The blood warrant was found to be invalid, meaning that the blood samples were obtained as part of a warrantless search in breach of s. 8. The Information to Obtain the blood warrant did not depose that the officer believed the accused was the driver of the vehicle which had crashed into the power pole or that the accused was in care and control of the motor vehicle. The officer should have included information about the accused's position in the vehicle and that the accused was unconscious. Without this information, the Information to Obtain did not contain reasonable grounds to believe that the accused had committed an offence under s. 253 of the Criminal Code. However, the blood sample evidence was admitted after a s. 24(2) analysis. The Court held that the officer was acting in good faith and that he honestly held the belief that the accused was drinking and driving when he swore the Information to Obtain. The impact on the accused was technical in nature and did not seriously undermine the accused's rights. The Court held that the truth seeking function of the trial process would be better served by admission of the Certificate of Analysis. The Court found that the accused was in care and control of the motor vehicle at the time of the collision. There was no evidence that anyone else was in the vehicle and the position of the accused when discovered suggested he had been driving the vehicle. The accused was found guilty of driving while his blood alcohol level exceeded .08. The Court held that his blood alcohol level was between 236 mgs% and 283 mgs%.","HELD: The Court held that the information to obtain blood samples was not sufficient grounds to warrant a search. The Court found that the warrant to search for blood was invalid and that the Certificate of Analyst and the report from the analyst were not sufficient reasons to warrant the warrant. The officer who swore the information was not fatal to the warrant and the warrant was invalid. The court held that it was a breach of the accused's s. 8 rights under s. 7 of the Charter respecting the violation of the officer's s8 rights. The Certificate of Analysis was not necessary to warrant an application to search the blood of an accused. The information was obtained by the officer who testified during the voir dire and was not part of the warrant application. The certificate of analyst was not required to provide his reasonable grounds for belief. The evidence was not obtained by mistake. The warrant to be searched was invalid because the information contained in the information did not constitute reasonable grounds to the belief that the accused had committed an offence under s253. The Warrant to Search for Blood was invalid as the Certificate was not provided by the police officer. The affidavit was not prepared by the accused to be amplified on the evidence. The accused did not depose that he believed that the driver of any motor vehicle, let alone the driver, was the sole occupant of the vehicle, was unconscious with his feet located in the driver's leg/foot area of the car and his body slumped across the passenger's seat. The Crown did not provide sufficient detail in the Information to Obtain to permit the Justice of the Peace to determine that reasonable grounds existed for the warrant issue. The Information to Otain was a technical error and was therefore not fatal. The Order to Search For Blood was issued pursuant to s. 24(2) of the charter respecting the breach of s.8 rights of the person. The order to search was made pursuant to R. v. Garofoli (1993). The Court reviewed the whole of the material presented and determined that the certificate of analysis and the analyst dated April 2010, should be admitted into evidence at trial. The application to be taken under s24(2 of the Code was dismissed. The Act to Obtained was amended to include the Certificate and the Report dated April 2011.

b_2016skqb297.txt,"HELD: The court found that both parties were significantly involved in the day-to-day parenting of the children such that a conclusion that one parent or the other was the primary caregiver could not be made. The court also found that the respondent responded positively and appropriately to the petitioner’s concerns regarding masturbation and pornography. The respondent indicated that he had not watched pornography since December 2014 and that software on his cell phone and computer provide assurances that he had not watched pornography to the petitioner. The petitioner did not dispute that evidence. The court could not reasonably give weight to the petitioner’s opinion evidence regarding the respondent’s alleged addictions. The court listed numerous problems with the petitioner’s evidence of addiction. The court was unable to conclude that there was a risk of harm to the children caused by the respondent. With respect to the petitioner’s allegation of the respondent’s anger management problem, most of the incidents were dated. The respondent had since taken anger management counselling, accepted that he suffers from ADD, and began taking medication for ADD. The court held that it was in the best interests of the children to continue to reside in the family home and that it would not be in their best interests for one parent to be classified as or be the primary parent. It was also in the children’s best interests that their parenting be shared on an equal basis. A nesting arrangement was found to be in the best interests of the children. The court ordered that the parties would have joint custody of the children and each party had exclusive possession of the family home when they were enjoying their assigned periods of parenting. The parents would alternate weeks living in the family home with the children.","FIAT: The applicant seeks orders granting her exclusive possession of the family home, primary residence of the children and supervised access only for the respondent father.

The evidence before the court is that the respondent has anger management problems that make him and his daughters fearful of him and addictions to pornography and masturbation that make it impossible for them to continue to reside in the same home. The respondent has in response filed a detailed affidavit in which he disputes the allegations of addictions, pornography and masturbation and asks the court to accept this as proven. The petitioner swears as fact that the father is addicted to pornography. It was his position that if a parenting plan and agreement were reached that this would protect the children from both his anger and the risks associated with his sexual abuse. The harm test is not accepted. The Court must consider all of the evidence before it can conclude that a risk exists."

The judge determined that since the respondent had paid the lump sum, his obligations were terminated; therefore, the Family Court did not have jurisdiction to hear the application. Allowing the appeal and returning the matter to the Family Court, that orders for child support made under the Family Maintenance Act do not have the finality which they did under other previous legislation. The order is always subject to variation in appropriate circumstances.

The order required the respondent to pay lying-in expenses in the amount of $209 and periodic payments for the support of the child in the alternative lump sum payment of $7,500. The respondent elected to make the lump sum payments on or about the 2nd of October 1985. The appellant made an application for variation of the order pursuant to s. 37 of the Family Maintenance Act. The court held a pre-trial conference at which the respondent raised a jurisdictional question, arguing that the payment of the lump sums in 1985 fully and finally discharged his responsibility for child support.

HELD: Application dismissed. 1)The Judge found that the move to Ontario was a sufficient change of circumstances to permit a variation application to proceed. She therefore proceeded to consider if the move was in the best interests of the children. 2)The Judge reviewed recent authorities from across Canada dealing with whether a custodial parent should be permitted to move with the children. 3)In the circumstances of this case the Judge was convinced that the move was reasonable and was not motivated by any desire on the part of the Father to thwart the Mother's access.","The parties separated in December 1988. They entered into a separation agreement in which they agreed to joint custody, residence with the father and generous access to the mother. The mother sought to have the custody of the children transferred to the father, who was no longer employed.

The parties moved from Ontario to Saskatchewan in 1990. The petitioner mother applied for change in the divorce judgment by giving the mother joint custody of all the boys with the access to her. The court granted the mother interim interim custody and granted joint custody to the parties. The respondent applied to have custody transferred to his daughter, who wished to move out of Saskatchewan and to the province. The applicant mother opposed the move.

The parties were married in 1985 and separated in 1995. The mother was on leave from her employment. When his federal government management position was declared redundant, the applicant received a retiring allowance of $75,646 in May 1997. The respondent opposed the application on the basis there had been no change in circumstances since the judgment was granted; she had no other income than the support payments and child tax credit; alternatively, there were special provisions in the parties' separation agreement which would permit the court to award an amount that differs from the amount prescribed by the Guidelines.HELD: 1)The judgment the applicant sought to vary was made after the coming into force of the Guidelines. It did not however include a determination of child support made in accordance with the Guidelines. There was no change in the childrens' or mother's circumstances. The applicant was unemployed but was still benefiting from his retiring allowance at the time of the order which he no longer enjoyed.

The father was ordered to pay child support of $405 per month but had made only one voluntary payment of $100. He agreed to abandon his appeal of the order for sale of the matrimonial home. He had been unable to obtain financing to buy out her share. The father, unrepresented by counsel, sought to have selected portions of 14 hours of taped telephone conversations with the children and wife admitted into evidence. He insisted the tapes were of central importance to his case; that they discredited the conclusions of the custody and access report and demonstrated abuse was occurring in the mother's home. HELD: 1)Sole custody was awarded to the mother. The father was to have access Friday from 5:00 p.m. until Tuesday at 9:00 every second weekend. 2)The tapes were admitted in their totality, unedited. The two lines of cases respecting the admission of audiotapes in a custody hearing were reviewed. The tapes had the opposite effect to the father's intent. The father 'alternatively interrogated the children about their mother; prompted them to make unfavourable comments about her; magnified every incident of childish squabbling into a crisis; magnified the children's distress over the marital breakdown, encouraged the children to run to his home at every opportunity; and generally undermined the mother's parental authority at every available turn.' The petitioner's depression had been ascribed to environmental stresses rather than innate. The father acknowledged that his drinking had lessened but not discontinued as he suggested in the custody and access report. 3)The property was to be sold. The father was responsible for mortgage payments from July 1998 until the date of sale as he had stopped making mortgage payments after the previous order while continuing to reside in the home. A corresponding adjustment in the net sale proceeds was to be made in the wife's favour. Child maintenance was to be satisfied from the father's share of the sale proceeds. 4)The mother's employment pension was to be divided equally and one half rolled into an RRSP designated by the father. RRSP's were to be divided equally. Furniture, furnishings and personal effects in their possession would be retained by each party. Hunting clothes or supplies and one half of the family photographs were to be returned to the father. The loan from the respondent's mother was statute-barred. No repayments had been made in 10 years. The debt for the half ton acquired after separation was the father's sole responsibility. 5)The prior order of $405 for child support remained in effect. The father made no income disclosure until trial and evidence of his 1991 income was unsatisfactory. Rental income was deemed to his 1998 income.

The father was the primary caregiver and the mother was the sole caretaker. The parties separated in October 1997 and the father remained in the matrimonial home while the petitioner and the children obtained rental accommodation close by. The mother was insistent that the father's videotaped conversations with the children were of central importance to her case and that they discredited the conclusions of the custody and access report and demonstrated the abuse that was occurring in the mother's home. The court allowed the tapes to be admitted in their entirety but on the condition they went in unedited. The Court was of the opinion that the tapes had the opposite effect. After listening to the tapes in their totality, the court was of a view they have the opposite affect. They speak volumes about the father’s character and motivations while shedding little light on the mother’ s.   The father, being without legal counsel, was inscribing that the videotaped conversation was of central interest to him. The evidence was discredited by the custody report and the evidence demonstrated the mother had been mentally ill and abusive to the children. HELD: The tapes were admitted. The children were to have access in their own homes. The parents were to be given joint custody of the children and the court would not be forced to deal with the mother. The tapes had no effect on the children’S.M.D. relationship.

The relationship between the mother and the father had been difficult and the child had some problems with his new father.

The court accepted the evidence of the accused where there was a discrepancy between the testimony of the officer and the accused. The mental element of the offence of refusal consists of intentional non-compliance. The officer in his conversation with another officer said he could not understand why he was not getting a proper sample. There was a reasonable doubt that the officer did understand why he was not getting a proper sample and could not provide the accused with adequate instructions.,The accused was charged with failing to comply with a demand made to him by a peace officer pursuant to s. 254(2)(a) of the Criminal Code to provide forthwith a sample of his breath as in the opinion of Cst.

The test for legal error in a judge alone case is not the same as would apply to a judge's charge to a jury on the issue of reasonable doubt. It was not an error for the judge to assess the credibility of the appellant in relation to that of the complainant as long as he went on to take the next step, as he did in his 'short-hand reference' to the evidence.","The appellant appealed his sexual assault conviction on the basis that it was unreasonable, was based on misapplication of the burden of proof and that the judge's reasons were so deficient as to constitute an error of law. The appellant argued that the trial judge's reasoning was so inadequate that it could not be reasonably concluded that the appellant had committed an error in law.

Appeal and cross-appeal dismissed with the exception that the wife is to be given immediate access to her personal belongings; both applications to introduce fresh evidence dismissed; on the sparse record before him, the trial judge did not err in his division of assets and did not offer the husband unwarranted assistance as a self- represented litigant.

The parties had purchased a home in Nova Scotia. The wife had been unable to access her personal belongings for several years.

The court dismissed both the appeal and the cross-appeal without costs. The Court held that the evidence was either readily available at trial, irrelevant or both.

c_2005nsca7.txt,"The defendant obtained a tender to bank, blend and load coal at the plaintiff's coal preparation plant. In performing the contract, the defendant experienced equipment problems resulting in the plaintiff having to rent other equipment. The plaintiff terminated the contract without any prior warning or notice to the defendant and brought an action for reimbursement of monies advanced under the contract and expenses incurred for the equipment rentals. The defendant counter-claimed for damages arising out of the termination of the contract, for services performed under the contract and for extras which had not been paid. The court found that the plaintiff was entitled to reimbursement for overpayments and equipment rentals and that the defendant was entitled to fair and reasonable compensation for extras for which the court awarded the sum of $10,000. Both parties were found to be in breach of the contract, the plaintiff's breach occurring because the volumes of coal supplied did not approximate the tonnages represented in the contractual documents. The clause excluding liability for errors in the forecast did not excuse the plaintiff because the actual volumes were not even approximate to the forecasted tonnages and the rates bid by the defendant were directly related to the anticipated tonnages. Absent evidence as to how the plaintiff arrived at the information used in the calculation of the forecasted tonnages, no negligent misrepresentation could be found, as there was no evidence that the information was negligently obtained. Both parties appealed. Appeal and cross-appeal dismissed; the trial judge's finding that the defendant had fundamentally breached its contractual obligations which entitled the plaintiff to terminate the contract without notice should not be disturbed; thus, the trial judge did not err in awarding the plaintiff damages for the defendant's breach of contract. The defendant did not establish that the plaintiff had been negligent in making the tonnage estimates and thus, the judge did not err in dismissing the defendant's claim for negligent misrepresentation. Although the trial judge found that the plaintiff had also committed a fundamental breach of the contract (in failing to provide the approximate tonnages referred to in the contract), the defendant had not chosen to terminate the contract and the plaintiff's breach did not undermine its right to terminate the contract as a result of the defendant's breach.","The appellant was awarded $270,307.05. The appellant had been awarded $10,000 for negligent misstatement and breach of contract.

At no time was she advised in any detail what was expected of her and that a failure to meet a particular standard could result in the termination of her employment. It would appear that the employer attributed the misfiling of a paper in an income tax return to the plaintiff and he decided to summarily dismiss her. In the circumstance, it can not be said that it is more probable than not that the plaintiff was guilty of serious misconduct or a breach of a fundamental nature respecting office policies, policies that may not have been made known to her, that there was just cause for her dismissal.

The defendant determined that the plaintiff was in a conflict of interest and asked the plaintiff to remove himself from the Chambers pursuant to s. 45(1) of The Rural Municipality Act. There was a further determination by the defendant that the plaintiff had misrepresented his situation to the council. The defendant then prepared a letter to the plaintiff in which she advised that until such time as he apologized to council and remedied the 'deficiencies' that created the conflict of interest he would not be recognized by the chair to speak or to move motions. HELD: The claim is dismissed. 1) Even if the defendant's decision did infringe on the plaintiff's Charter right to expression to some limited extent and could not be upheld pursuant to the section of The Rural Municipality Act (the Court made no conclusions as to which of the competing legal opinions is right) the Court was not prepared to award damages to the plaintiff pursuant to s. 24(1) of the Charter.

The Court was not prepared to award damages to the plaintiff so he could gain a personal benefit from a limitation which only had a small effect on his right to represent his constituents.

A court should be reluctant to get involved. 2) With regard to the tort of misfeance in public office, even if the defendant acted without lawful authority in imposing the sanctions in order to be actionable, the defendant had to be aware that her conduct was unlawful. This requirement has not been met. The defendant was acting on legal advice from legal counsel to the municipality. There is no evidence, nor even the suggestion, that legal counsel did not act in good faith in providing advice to the defendant. As a result, the plaintiff has failed to establish that the defendant acted with knowledge she had no legal authority to do what she did in imposing sanctions on the plaintiff. 3) With respect to the tort of negligence, the Court found that because the defendant was acting on the advice of legal counsel when imposing the sanctions upon the plaintiff, she has not breached the standard of care. Her actions were not negligent.","The plaintiff alleged the defendant has injured his reputation and caused him humiliation and distress through her actions as Reeve of the Rural Municipality of Sherwood.

The Union will have taxable costs, but only of the application by Wal-Mart and the Union's application to strike the material filed.  1) The affidavit filed by Wal-Mart swears that the affiant has 'personal knowledge of the facts and matters herein deposed to' and then he goes on to swear that various exhibits are attached to his affidavit. This achieves nothing more than compel the court to examine the exhibits to determine their admissibility. The affiant does nothing more than provide copies of 27 documents. 2) There is no necessity for the admission of the documents. There is no basis upon which to conclude that it is necessary to accept the proffered documents as evidence.  3) It is alleged there was interference with the Board and that it was required to read publications which were highly disparaging of Wal-Mart. Yet there is absolutely no evidence before the court to prove the allegations. Many newsletters contain negative comments about Wal-Mart. However, there is no admissible evidence to prove that these newsletters were provided to the Board, or that any member actually read them. Mr. Matkowski has not come forward to assert his allegations under oath. Without such evidence, it is impossible to conclude that bias exists within the Saskatchewan Labour Relations Board or that there is justification for a reasonable apprehension of bias. To conclude otherwise, this court would be acting on pure conjecture or fantasy. That is not good enough.","FIAT. The applicant Wal-Mart Canada Corp. brought three applications. The first motion was brought by the union representing the former vice-chairperson of the Saskatchewan Labour Relations Board. The union alleged that the Department of Labour interfered with the Board's operation by requiring members of the Board to read the newsletter of the Federation of Labour. Wal-mart argued that the actions of the Unions, the interference by the Government and the presence of certain publications demonstrate that the Saskatchewan labour Relations Board is biased or, at the very least, there is a reasonable apprehension of bias against Wal-Marts. HELD: The relief sought by the Union should be granted and the application brought by Wal- Mart Canada Corp.' should be dismissed. 1) The affidavits of the former members of board and union members are admissible. The transcript of the radio broadcast and the transcript of a meeting of the board were critical of Wal- mart. 2) Wal-marts' position that the action of the unions, the interfering by the Department and the existence of certain media publications demonstrate the Saskatchewan LRB is biased. 3) WalMart's position that actions of unions, interference by government and the Presence of certain articles demonstrate that SRL is biased and there is justification for a reasonable apprehensive of bias. 4) Wal Mart's position is that the Actions of the Union, the Interlocutory motions, the presence and statements of certain publication demonstrate that Saskatchewan Labour is biased, at least, a reasonable suspicion of bias, and the only way to rectify the situation is to prohibit the Board from holding hearings which involve Wal-Martin."

c_2012nspc18.txt,"The accused was charged with numerous weapons-related offences, including possession and trafficking. The police had intercepted numerous ambiguous calls between the accused and others and had interpreted the coded language used as involving discussions about firearms. The defence had been unsuccessful in arguing that the inferences drawn were mere hunches and the conversations could not support a reasonable inference that the subjects under discussion were firearms. A search at his parents' residence had resulted in the seizure of several firearms but none were found in the accused's actual possession. One of the issues was whether the accused had constructive or joint possession of the firearms seized from his parents. Accused found guilty on all the weapons' possession charges and some of the trafficking charges, but not guilty of careless storage of a firearm. It was clear that the accused had much more than a passive or quiescent knowledge of the guns seized from his parents' home and there were a number of indicators that he had a measure of control over them, such as his telling his father on occasion to get rid of them, his being notified immediately when one of the firearms went missing, the way he pressed his parents to explain how that could happen and his ability on other occasions to tell his father where in the home a particular firearm was located. However, despite his knowledge of the location of some of the firearms at certain times, the court was unable to find that the accused had stored the firearms in the manner they were found when the search warrant was executed. The evidence also established that he was stashing guns at locations other than his residence and he possessed those guns for the purpose of transferring them to others. The only reasonable inference to be drawn from the intercepts was that the speakers were talking about guns and the communications revealed the commercial nature of the accused's activities. Given that the accused had asserted a privacy interest with respect to an application to exclude the evidence arising from the police search of the cell phone seized from him, he could not now deny that the phone was his.",HELD: The Court found that the accused was guilty of possession of a prohibited firearm and that the evidence supporting the accused's claim was circumstantial. The Court held that the Crown had not proven the accused guilty of the firearms possession charges. The accused was charged with trafficking firearms. The evidence supporting his claim was that the firearms were not the accused’s. The court found that evidence supporting this claim was not available at the time of the trial. The Crown had provided notice of its intention to seek this amendment at the start of the defence’ s trial.

The court ordered the removal of the respondent as an executor in the grant of probate and ordered that the applicants remain as executors but that they should take no further steps to distribute the assets of the estate. It found that there were “special circumstances” within the meaning of s. 17 of The Administration of Estates Act. The respondent was entitled to challenge the validity of the will but not entitled to remain as an executor.,"The applicants sought to remove the respondent as executor of their estate. They argued that the respondent had brought an application that effectively challenged the validity of the Will he was presently an executor and that he was refusing to co-operate in taking the steps necessary to administer the estate and carry out the directions contained in the Will. HELD: The application was dismissed. 1)The respondent was removed as an executrator in the grant of probate ordered by Gabrielson J. on July 20, 2016 and Kent Jones and Rodney Argue shall take no steps to distribute assets of the estate to beneficiaries or otherwise finalize the administration of the Estate until after February 15, 2018. 2)The applicant had not proven his right to represent him on the applications. 3)The court found that the applicant had no status as a proper party to the proceedings and that since she was neither named beneficiary under the Will nor potential beneficiary in the event of an intestacy she had no right to remain as an agent of the will. The respondent was not entitled to represent himself on the application."
d_1990canlii4118.txt,"In a contract of employment, which involved an agreement changing the plaintiff from 'expatriate' to 'local' status, a termination clause providing that the agreement could be terminated upon 3 months' notice was held to be inadequate language to abrogate the implied term of reasonable notice. The plaintiff had correctly interpreted the clause as relating to the termination of the agreement, not of his employment. The agreement provided that it was governed by the laws of the province of Alberta. The plaintiff had been employed by the defendant for 12 years and was awarded compensation in an amount equivalent to 18 months notice less the three months pay he already received and any income from his new employment over the balance of the 15 months. He was also awarded the loss resulting from the difference in vacation and loss of an auto allowance for the 15 months. For emotional trauma, which lasted only briefly, he received $500.","The plaintiff was an expatriate employee for several years. He was assigned to Canada as an expat. He received a salary of $60,000. In 1986 he was offered a position with the defendant company as a regional manager. He refused the offer and was terminated without cause. The defendant then gave the plaintiff the option of going back to work in Montreal or to Halifax. He chose Halifax. The plaintiff considered that his employment by the defendant was being terminated without causing and left his employment. He signed an expats' agreement which provided him with a monthly allowance of $55,000 and a four-week vacation with a half-week paid vacation. He applied for and was awarded a position as regional manager of the company. He later became a permanent resident of Nova Scotia. He had been employed for several months by one company which was taken over by the other company. The company offered him monies that had been set out in the memorandum referred to, he was refused. He became depressed and went into deep depression. He sought employment with the other firm. He eventually left the company and moved to Halifax, Nova Scotia, where he became a District Manager. He remained there for four years. In 1985, the defendant took over the office of the regional manager in Nova Scotia and placed the respondent in charge of the new office. He then became a district manager in Halifax. In 1989, he joined the corporate office of another company which he later joined. He now worked for the defendant. He is a retired general and has a family of four. He has three children. He worked for several companies in Nova Scotia and is a member of the corporate social responsibility committee. He also has a daughter. She is a nurse. She was his assistant. She has two children. She now works for the corporate administration company. She also has an interest in the company's new office in Halifax, which is located in Nova Nova Scotia but is located outside Nova Scotia where the respondent is a permanent permanent resident. She currently resides in Nova Brunswick. She works for a public service company. When the respondent went to Argentina to establish an office for the company, he became an expate. He returned to work for several weeks in Nova Southeastern and was given a two-week written notice of termination without cause in the amount of $20,000 to be paid in full.

He had successively served three Crown Corporations over a period of ten years. On appeal held the award of damages was not inordinately high. The court however reduced the damages by $16,500 as it disagreed with the trial judge's determination regarding mitigation of damages. Appeal allowed to the extent of reducing the damages from $165,000 to $148,500.","This was an appeal from an assessment of damages in a wrongful dismissal action brought against Saskatchewan Transportation Company by Leo Larsen, its former President and Chief Executive Officer. For the most part we can find no tenable basis for concluding that the award of damages was inordinately high. The trial judge assessed the damages on the general principles, first, that the object of these awards is to compensate for the loss of income sustained in consequence of the wrongful dismissal; second, that their measure is prima facie the amount that would have been earned had the employment continued subject to deduction of such amounts as in the ensuing months are either earned or should have been. The salary was not included in the total amount awarded. The severance terms of the contract were arrived at with an eye to his earlier service. The judge found that the severance expenses were part of the plaintiff's year of employment and that they were not included on the total number of months of employment. The plaintiff appealed.

d_1995canlii4259.txt,"This was an appeal from a Supreme Court decision on an interpleader application by the respondent Shubenacadie Band to determine which of several parties was entitled to be paid a sum of money owed by the Band to the respondent Francis, an Indian residing on the Eskasoni Reserve in Cape Breton, for the construction of residential homes on the Shubenacadie Reserve. Francis had made a number of assignments of book debts, some general and some specific, to the various claimants. The trial judge concluded that he was bound by s.89(1) of the Indian Act, which holds that the real and personal property of an Indian or a band situated on a reserve is not subject to charge, pledge, mortgage, attachment, levy, seizure, distress or execution in favour of or at the instance of any person other than an Indian or a band. He concluded that the money owed Francis by the Shubenacadie band was the property of an Indian on a reserve, and that assignment of book debts, both general and specific, were included within the meaning of s.89(1). He found that the respondent Eskasoni Band was the only Indian entity among the several claimants and ordered the money paid to them. The appellants appealed. Allowing the appeal on the issue of the Indian Act, that s.89(1) does not prevent an Indian from assigning book debts of his construction business to secure business loans. When Indians are in business they hold and deal with their business property in the commercial mainstream on terms no different than those applicable to all Canadians. Nevertheless, the Eskasoni Band is still entitled to the money owed to Francis by reason of having obtained the first general assignment of book debts from him and having registered it prior to Francis making further assignments. The registration of a general assignment of book debts is constructive notice of the assignment to subsequent assignees falling within the provisions of s.3 of the Assignment of Book Debts Act.","The appellant Band Council applied to determine which of several parties was entitled to be paid a sum of money owing by the appellant Band under a construction contract entered into by the respondent Band with the respondent in 1990. The appellant Band applied to have the money paid to the respondent by a letter to his solicitor instructing him to pay the respondent funds which were due to the appellant to the maximum amount of $70,000. The respondent Band appealed the decision of the trial judge, holding that assignments of book debts, both general and specific, were included within the wording of the Indian Act. The appeal court held that s. 89(1) of the Act was applicable and the appellant was entitled $70k of this fund by reason of a letter of direction from Francis to his lawyer instructing his solicitor to pay to the applicant funds which had been due to him from the respondent band to the limit amount of the maximum sum. The court also held that the appellant had not shown that he had a choice in action. Appeal allowed."

The applicant sought an order pursuant to s.87 and s.251 of the Land Titles Act cancelling the existing certificate of Title in the names of the deceased and herself as tenants in common and directing the Land Titles Registrar to issue a new title in their joint names with right of survivorship. The deceased and applicant who had been living together purchased residential property in 1997. Their lawyer prepared a written agreement for the sellers and purchasers as well as the mortgage describing the purchasers as joint tenants. The sellers, unrepresented by legal counsel, prepared the transfer of the property and title issued without the words 'joint tenants'. The error describing the purchasers went unnoticed by their lawyer. The respondent had been married to the deceased when he died intestate in 1998. As the title stood an undivided one-half interest was owned by the estate and would devolve to the respondent pursuant to the Intestate Succession Act. HELD: The Land Titles Office Registrar was to amend the existing certificate of title by inserting 'joint tenants' after the names of the registered owners. 1)The requirements set out in Bank of Nova Scotia v. Rochon were satisfied. There was an obvious mistake which required rectification. The deceased and the applicant intended to purchase the property as joint tenants and instructed their lawyer accordingly. The lawyer acknowledged that it was a mistake that the title issued as it did. 2)Although the applicant had an alternate remedy of seeking damages for any loss from her conveyance lawyer, damages were not a reasonably convenient remedy in this case as title would remain registered in the names of strangers, neither of whom could be compelled to sell to the other.","FIAT.

A security agreement was registered at the Personal Property Security Registry in September 2000 and re-registered in November 2001. After McMillan died in June 2001, payments fell into arrears and a demand was made for possession of the Blazer. His widow, the respondent, was shown as co-buyer on the purchase agreement but was never the registered owner until she acquired it from her husband's estate. She sought to defeat the security interest on the grounds she was the real owner at all times, made the payments and was always in possession. At issue was whether the registered owner of a vehicle has the power to grant a security interest enforceable in priority to the interest of a person whose claim, though substantial, is not registered or otherwise of record in any place where the lender has or should have notice of it. HELD: The claim of the Credit Union was enforceable. Judicial notice was taken of the fact there is no title registry in Saskatchewan other than that maintained by Saskatchewan Government Insurance. The licensing function was assigned to SGI under the Vehicle Administration Act. That Act and the Highway Traffic Act are clear the person named in a registration certificate is regarded as the owner of the vehicle. Motor vehicles are unique in that their registration creates a presumption of ownership and follows a declaration of ownership by the registry. Reliance upon the registration system is an important facet of our commerce and would create chaos if reliance is taken away. Ownership does not depend upon registration. However, once a vehicle is registered following a declaration of ownership, a presumption arises in favour of the holder of the registration certificate and as a matter of commercial efficacy lenders, the police, insurers, repairmen, etc. are justified in relying upon the certificate as proof of ownership. A transfer of ownership would defeat the Credit Union's claim only if it were undertaken for value and with notice. No costs were awarded on either motion.","The applicant bank loaned the respondent $37,700 upon a security of a 1999 Chevrolet Blazer. The vehicle was not sold or charged in favour of a third party during the period of September 11, 2001 to November 14, 2001 when the security interest was unperfected. The wife of the lender had apparently been the person who used the vehicle under the security agreement but she was never the registered owner of the vehicle until she acquired it from her husband's estate. The applicant argued that the Credit Union's claim was based on his being one of the named purchasers in the original agreement and being the registered Owner of the Vehicle. All other indicia of ownership were in her favour. The issue was whether the registered owners of a vehicle have the power to grant a security interest enforceable in priority to the interest of a person whose claim, though substantial, is not registered or otherwise of record in any place where the lender has or should have notice of it. HELD: The claim of the Credit union was enforceable as against the conflicting claim of Ms. Clayton.  1)The claim of Credit Union was enforceABLE. 2)The applicant's claim of transfer of ownership was enforceably.

At the conclusion of the trial, the defence brought a motion to exclude the certificate of analysis as the demand flowed from an invalid approved screening device demand. HELD: The defence application to exclude the certificate of analysis based on a breach of s. 8 and s. 9 of the Charter was granted. There being no evidence upon which to convict in regard to the .08 charge, it was dismissed.  1) The Court found a distinction between 'had consumed alcohol' and 'has alcohol in the person's body'. The Court found the words 'had consumed alcohol' to be insufficient for the Court to conclude that the officer had a reasonable suspicion there was alcohol in the accused's body at the time of the demand. 2) There was no objective basis upon which a reasonable suspicion of alcohol in the body could be made. The evidence of alcohol on the breath was not reliable in the circumstances of this case. The admission of having had her last drink was possibly made after the demand and could not be relied on to formulate the required reasonable suspicion. The evidence of bloodshot eyes, empty beer bottles in a plastic bag with three persons in the car and the smell of alcohol coming from the vehicle could not alone support a reasonable conclusion of reasonable suspicion of alcohol in the body of the motorist.","The accused was charged with impaired driving and operating a motor vehicle contrary to s. 253(a) and s. 255(1) of the Criminal Code. The accused was also charged with operating a stolen vehicle contrary s. 254(2) of The Charter. HELD: The accused's application to exclude the Certificate of Analysis was dismissed. 1)The evidence of speeding, bloodshot eyes, empty beer bottles in a plastic bag with three persons in the car and smell of alcohol coming from the vehicle was insufficient to justify the demand. 2)The defence application to include the Certificate was granted pursuant to s24(2). 3)The words 'had consumed alcohol' were insufficient for the court to conclude that the officer had a reasonable suspicion that the accused had alcohol in his body. 4)The Court was persuaded that the words 'consumed alcohol' did not constitute insufficient evidence to conclude the officer's reasonable suspicion of alcohol in the body. 5)The court found that the defence application was not supported by the evidence of speed, blood, empty bottles in plastic bag, empty beers bottles in the plastic bag and smell alcohol coming out the vehicle. 6)The accused's admission that she had consumed alcohol was not sufficient to justify a demand for a breath sample which was not made pursuant to the Charter. 7)The issue of whether the words had consumed was not raised. 8)The Crown conceded that if such Charter breaches were found, the appropriate remedy would be to exclude a Certificate ofalyses based upon a breach of ss8 and 9 of the Charter pursuant to ss24(1). 8)On reflection, and having given careful consideration to the cases cited, I am persuaded the words ""had consumed"" are indeed insufficient for conviction to conclude. The words 'alcohol' are indeed sufficient for the Court to conclude on the evidence that the police officer had reasonable suspicion there was alcohol in her body at the time of the ASD demand."

He required extensive rehabilitation and would not regain his pre-accident physical and intellectual capacity. The mother successfully applied for a reinstatement of child support which had been discontinued by consent, pre-accident, when the son was residing with the father. The son, now 23 years old, was upgrading his high school marks at the time of the hearing and hoped to be admitted to a community college program. The father appealed. Appeal dismissed; the judge's decision to award support was not premised upon a finding that, pre-accident, the son had made a clear decision to pursue a further course of study but on the fact that the son intended to pursue his education and had not withdrawn from parental charge at the time of the accident. There was no evidence to support the allegation that the usual Guideline amount was 'inappropriate' in this case; the Act prohibited the consideration of public income assistance when fixing child support; given the uncertainty about the son's future, this was not an appropriate case for a time-limited order.",The appellant father appealed an order made pursuant to the Maintenance and Custody Act requiring him to pay maintenance for his son. The appellant had a brief relationship in 1981 when the child was 16 years old. He had recently completed grade 12 at Millwood High School. He was in receipt of income assistance. The parties had separated in early 2001. The father had been working full-time jobs and had made arrangements to move out of the mother's home. The child had been in receipt for support for four years. The court found that the appellant had not withdrawn and was unable to withdraw from his parent's charge at the time of the accident. The order for support was not premised on the appellant's continuing dependency as a result of his pursuit of post-secondary studies. The evidence supported the appellant father's finding that the child had not withdraw and was not unable to withdrawn from his charge at that time.

There was no evidence before the court as to the truth of these allegations and the appellant had stated in his evidence that everyone thought that he treated the children badly. The appellant appealed. Appeal allowed; conviction set aside; new trial ordered. The trial judge misapprehended the evidence because she attributed to it a relevance that it could not have in law or in logic. The appellants evidence about the involvement of Childrens Services did not permit the judge to draw any inference that the children had, in fact, been badly treated or that the appellant was responsible for such treatment. The misapprehension, examined in the context of the judges reasons as a whole and the entire record was substantial, material and played an essential part in the judges reasoning leading to the conviction; the misapprehension had given rise to a miscarriage of justice.","The appellant appeals his conviction by the Provincial Court on a charge of sexual assault. The appellant argued that the trial judge misapprehended the evidence and that the judge erred by characterizing the evidence as 'internally inconsistent'. The appellant also argued that there was a significant inconsistency between the appellant's evidence about his time in the children's home and his evidence about the involvement of Children's Services, which he alleged was material and not supported by the record. HELD: Conviction set aside and a new trial ordered. The conviction constitutes a miscarriage of justice and must be set aside. 1) The Court found that the appellant’s evidence about spending time with the children was substantial. The judge’d ascribed to the evidence about Children’S Services, relevance that it simply could not have. The inference which the judge drew from this evidence could not be more unjustified. 2) The court found that a trial judge”s misapprehension of the evidence was substantial”. The court concluded that the court misapplied the evidence by failing to give proper effect to it. The Court concluded that this misappreciation of the trial evidence was a miscarriage and must not be repeated.

The plaintiff was making a significant claim for damages but she suffered from numerous previous injuries and conditions relating to her health; any damage assessment would depend largely upon credibility and the medical evidence at trial; to assess interim damages in this case would be a most difficult task and would only be a haphazard guess.

The plaintiff also claimed damages for injuries suffered in a motor vehicle accident. HELD: The application was allowed. 1)The plaintiff was making a significant claim yet when one listens to defendant's counsel and reads the material attached to the defendant's affidavit, one concludes there is a significant number of other things relating to her health. 2)The defendant argued there was an 'air of realty' to the claim. 3)The evidence submitted by way of the plaintiff’s affidavits caused the court difficulty. 4)Costs were to be determined by the Court."

Although the Information to Obtain was based on information from an anonymous, unproven source, the source's information was corroborated by independent information as to the accused's employment and residence. The only corroboration of the presence of a crime (a suspected marijuana grow operation) was from a FLIR test. The court found that the evidence did not rise above the level of suspicion, albeit strong suspicion. Corroboration of the employment and residence of the accused did not provide particular support for the informant's credibility; neither were results of the FLIR test and the presence of covered windows sufficient corroboration. The Crown appealed. Appeal allowed; new trial ordered. Although the trial judge articulated the proper test and began by analyzing whether the warrant could have been issued, the issue was later mistakenly transformed into whether he, himself, would have issued it. By weighing the probative evidence, the trial judge effectively substituted his views for those of the issuing justice and wrongly required the issuing justice to draw proper inferences as opposed to reasonable inferences.","The Crown appealed the decision of the Provincial Court Judge quashing a search warrant issued by the RCMP. The judge found that the warrant could have been issued had it been properly quashed, that the evidence obtained by the search was wrongly excluded and that the judge applied the proper test. The appeal was allowed and a new trial ordered. HELD: The appeal is allowed and the trial ordered as well as the reasons for the decision. 1)The judge was to consider whether the warrant was valid, the search could have occurred, the evidence was properly excluded and the judge properly applied the test. 2)The court substituted his view of the evidence for that of the issuing JP. The court found that in a review of the warrant, the judge had properly considered whether he would have issued it. 3)The Court found that a reasonable and probable ground for issuing a search was found. The Court substituted its view of what the issuing judge could have done. 4)The evidence obtained as a result of the search did not prove that there was a violation of the accused's rights under s. 11 of the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act. The evidence obtained was wrongly included. 5)The judicial standard of review was an objective one. The warrant was issued and the search would have been lawful. The officer who reviewed the warrant had a duty to consider the evidence of the person who had provided the tipster with the relevant information. The judicial standard was not appropriate. The issue was whether reasonable and reasonable grounds could have issued a search based on the information obtained from the tip. The Judge substituted his opinion of the issue for that held by the issuing Judge. 6)The appeal was granted and a fresh trial ordered on the grounds that the Judge had applied the appropriate standard of reviewing. The Appeal Court found the following: 1)There was no evidence of a violation by the police of the right to search. The search was lawful and there was no allegation that it was otherwise unreasonable. The decision of a judge to quash a search is a matter of fact. The trial judge was required to consider all of the factors that could be considered in a decision such as the factors set out in R. v. Garofoli for the review of an information to obtain search. In this case, the officer who examined the respondent's house by police with the Forward Looking Infrared (FLIR) imaging device was not satisfied with the information provided by the respondent.

There is no reference to Richie whose name appears on the tenancy agreement. 2) Even though the decision states that the Notice of Hearing was properly served, that cannot be the end of the matter given that there is nothing in the file which would indicate any directions having been given to the landlord with respect to service other than personal service.

However, he believes that the Sylvan Learning Center is too expensive. The father did not present any evidence with regard to other possible educational programs for the summer. It is clear that he has not researched alternatives to the Sylvan program. On the evidence, the expense is necessary for Kody. The real issue is whether the father has the means to contribute given his child support payments. If the father pays $472 per month for the Sylvan program, in addition to his s. 3 child support payments, the father's total child support payable would be $1,315 per month. The father would have a net monthly cash flow in the sum of $1,066 while the mother with four children would have available cash flow in the sum of $2,700 per month.

Four months before it was set to automatically renew, he notified the landlord he wished to convert to a month-to-month tenancy. The landlord refused, saying vacancies were hard to fill at any time other than September 1st. The three bedroom rental was in an area with a large university student population and was targeted at individuals sharing not families. It was a high-end rental, and would not necessarily appeal to students. The landlord provided evidence that the last time it was on the market in winter, it was vacant for several months. After a Residential Tenancies Board hearing, an officer declared the tenant successful. The written decision did not mention the landlord's reasons for refusing consent, nor did it say they were arbitrary or unreasonable. The landlord appealed, but offered to compromise by allowing the tenant to terminate the lease any time between May 31 and August 31 without penalty. The officer erred in law. The Act allows the landlord some discretion to refuse a request to convert to month-to-month, providing the refusal is made reasonably. The landlord's reasons were neither unreasonable nor arbitrary, given the reality of the market and his past experiences with a winter vacancy. There may be other situations where consent could reasonably be withheld. The tenancy is declared to have been renewed for another year (with the understanding the landlord will allow the tenant to terminate at any point after May 31). Both parties acted in good faith and, while it might seem unfair to lock the tenant into a lease he believed had converted to month-to-month, the court must make the order the officer should have made in the first place.","This was an appeal by the Landlord from an order of the Director of Residential Tenancies.

HELD: The appeal was allowed and the tenancy had not been converted into a monthly to month. The Landlord refused to consent, giving his reasons why he believed it was not in his interest to have a month-to-month tenancy. He refused to grant an earlier date. The appeal allowed and declared the tenancy to have remained month to year. It was not unreasonable for the Landlords to refuse to grant the tenant's request that the lease be changed from a year-to‑year lease to a month."

The question was whether the Crown's evidence was sufficiently credible to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the only physical contact he had on the complainant was for the purpose of defending himself from the alleged aggression of the complainant and whether the Crown was able to prove non-consent beyond a reasonable doubt.

Both appeals are dismissed as a result of the appellant's failure to perfect, including her failure to file necessary materials or comply with the court's directions to do so. While a dismissal of the criminal appeal is a serious remedy, since it means it will never be heard on its merits, the appellant has made it clear that she cannot provide certified transcripts unless the court orders the respondents to pay. The court has already declined to do so. There is no suggestion a further extension of time will result in the appellant perfecting the appeal.","The appellant appealed the June 2011 decision of the Provincial Court which found that she had committed the act of public mischief under s. 140 of the Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1985, when she reported an offence of assault with weapon to an RCMP officer, causing him to enter an investigation, when the alleged offence had not been committed and she was not criminally responsible. The respondents were to pay the cost of certifying the 1,700 pages of transcript she had typed herself. The appellant applied for an extension of time to dismiss both appeals on the basis that she could not provide certified transcripts. The respondent motion was granted. The court dismissed the appellant's appeal of the June 2010 decision. The Court dismissed the respondent motion for a stay of time and ordered the respondents to pay to certify the transcript. The appeal of CAC 341990 was dismissed for failure to perfect. The motion to consolidate both appeals was granted for failure by the appellant to provide certified transcript. Allowing the appeal for failure and ordering the respondents pay to certify transcripts, that the appellant cannot provide certified copies, because she cannot provide them unless I order the respondents of pay.

The court found that the 51 months between the charges and the scheduled trial was sufficiently long to warrant an inquiry into the reasonableness of the delay. As the accused had specifically and voluntarily waived almost five months of the delay, the court deducted that amount, leaving 46 months to be considered. The various types of delay were considered by the court: 11.5 for inherent delay; 15.5 months to be attributed to the actions of the accused; 10 months to be attributed to the Crown; and 10 months to institutional delay. The court found that the accused had not suffered prejudice and as most of the delay was attributable to adjournments sought on his behalf, the court found that the overall delay in this case was not unreasonable.","The accused was charged with 56 offences set out in eight Informations.

The accused is paraplegic. He moved to British Columbia after his release. He did not appear for trial, and a Canada wide warrant was issued for his arrest. He was arrested and returned to stand trial. The Crown applied to have bail and the surety forfeited. It took the position that the accused had deliberately left the province to avoid trial, and therefore should be responsible for the full $1,000. It also contended that the sureties had a responsibility to ensure the accused's attendance at trial, and that they should also be responsible for the full $1,000. The surety testified that the conditions of the recognizance were not explained to him, and he did not understand the potential consequences of default. Dismissing the applications for forfeiture, that the surety had no concept of his obligations under the recognizance, and was not made aware of those obligations by the authorities. In these circumstances, it would not be just to order forfeiture. With respect to the accused, he is impecunious. His failure to pay any amount ordered against him could lead to imprisonment. As the accused already faces the prospect of imprisonment for failing to attend trial, this would create the potential of double liability for what is in essence the same offence.","The accused was charged with four offences with respect to a twelve year old girl. The accused had been released from prison on a promise to appear in court on a charge of sexual assault. He had been injured and was unable to walk. He was remanded in custody pending posting of bail. The surety visited the accused at the prison and agreed to be surety. The sentence for failure to appear was set aside. The court found that the accused had no concept of his obligations under the recognizance and mistakenly believed that his responsibilities or liability ended with his first appearance in Court following his release. The judge found that because the surety had no idea of his obligation under the condition that he continue to reside at his residence when required to do so, he should have had an opportunity to read the recognizer before signing it. The defendant had no interest in returning to Nova Scotia and had no intention of returning to the province.

The owner was passenger when 28.3 pounds of marijuana was discovered in the trunk of her Lincoln. She was found not guilty of trafficking and possession of marijuana for the purpose of trafficking. The driver was found guilty of possession for the purpose of trafficking. The trafficking charge against him was judicially stayed. HELD: An order of forfeiture issued pursuant to s.16(1). The application for relief was dismissed. 1)It was not necessary to address the Charter submissions with respect to s.19(3) because Crown counsel consented to the respondent's application being viewed as an application for relief from forfeiture under s.20. 2)It was impossible to conclude the respondent 'appeared innocent of any complicity' in the offence for which the driver was convicted and that she 'exercised all reasonable care to be satisfied' that the Lincoln was not likely to be used in the commission of the offence. 3)Section 11 of the Charter applies only when person has been charged with an offence. There was no charge against the respondent at this time. 4)The Act distinguishes between three types of persons who might own, or have an interest in, conveyance which is 'offence-related property': the interest of person convicted of the offence is forfeitable pursuant to s.16(1); if the person has been neither convicted nor charged and appears innocent of any complicity in the offence; someone charged with the offence which gave rise to the forfeiture application (as here). The forfeiture is not, except with respect to an offender, arbitrary. In view of the provisions available under the Act to obtain relief from forfeiture it cannot be concluded that empowering a court to grant an order of forfeiture constitutes cruel or unusual punishment.","The Crown applied pursuant to s.16(1) of the Controlled Drug and Substances Act for an order forfeiting the Lincoln to Her Majesty in Right of Canada.

The accused applied pursuant pursuant to ss.19(4) of s.C. 1996 for an ordered declaring her interest in the Lincoln not affected by any forfeiture order.

e_2001skqb466.txt,"The plaintiff sought damages for personal injuries to her lower back, right knee and left ankle sustained when she slipped and fell while grocery shopping in March 2000. The defendant acknowledged the plaintiff fell in its produce department, but did not concede the water on the floor caused her to slip; the cause was, in part, her worn running shoes without laces. Liability and degree of personal injury were in issue. The claim proceeded under the simplified procedure under Part Forty of the Queen's Bench Rules. HELD: The claim was dismissed with costs. 1)The defendant had a duty of care to the plaintiff as owner and occupier. The courts have most often based the duty of care on the invitor/invitee standard. Maxay v. Ramsay Drugs proposed four-part inquiry to determine whether or not an occupier has breached its duty of care. 2)The plaintiff established on a balance of probabilities that she slipped because of water on the floor. The evidence did not support an inference that her footwear caused the slip or was a contributing factor. 3)An adverse inference was not drawn from the defendant's failure to adduce evidence confirming its employee had in fact cleaned the floor. The employee was no longer employed by the defendant. Neither party was able to locate him. 4)Some of her injuries were, in part, the aggravation of pre-existing conditions. The most significant injury was sprain to her left ankle, which had not been resolved primarily because the plaintiff declined to accept available treatment and failed to follow medical advice. The inconsistencies in her affidavit and the physician notes or medical reports respecting her injuries and treatment were not relevant to this decision. 5)A 'sweep log' was kept for each department and employees made regular inspections of the sales floor area in every department. The plaintiff slipped and fell about an hour after the last sweeping. A regular program of maintenance was conducted in the area. The overall policies and practices of regular maintenance and responsibility of each employee were substantially the same if not identical to those considered in the Mollenhauer and Libel group of cases. The defendant met the legal standard of care imposed in the circumstances and was not liable for the plaintiff's injuries. To find otherwise would be to impose a standard that is inconsistent with that previously imposed by this court in almost identical circumstances.",The plaintiff sought damages for personal injuries sustained when she slipped and fell while grocery shopping in the defendant's Superstore. The defendant placed in issue whether it was liable to the plaintiff for the injuries she sustained in the slip and fall and whether it would be liable to its employees for the damage caused. The plaintiff was wearing running shoes without laces at the time of the incident. The defendants claimed that the plaintiff slipped on a puddle of water on the floor of the store and fell heavily to the ground. The plaintiffs claim dismissed with costs. The court reviewed the history of the Superstore and determined that the defendant met the legal standard of care imposed upon it in the circumstances and was not liable for the injury suffered. The evidence of the employees who had worked in the store prior to the accident was inconsistent with the standard set out in the Mollenhauer and Leibel cases. The Court also reviewed the defendant employees' affidavits and the sweep log. The affidavits of the two assistant managers employed at the store confirmed the cleaning regimen in place. The judge concluded that the defendants met the standard of caring imposed upon them in the situation and was therefore not liable. The claim was dismissed with the costs of the plaintiff's claim. The Defendant met the statutory standard of maintenance imposed upon the plaintiff and was held liable for injuries suffered by the plaintiff. The pre-existing conditions were aggravating factors. The Defendants did not contest the presence of water in the vicinity of where the plaintiff fell although it did not concede that it was the water which caused the plaintiff to slip. There have been many cases that have found slippery substance such as water on a floor of grocery store to constitute an unusual danger. The injuries were at least in part aggravation of pre- existing conditions.

HELD: Jasmine ceased to be a child of the marriage within the definition of the Act effective March 31, 2003. 1) The father's obligation to contribute was terminated effective March 30, 2003 and the child had not commenced any post partum activities within the Meaning of the Agreement. 2) The mother's obligation was terminated for the child to contribute for the parties oldest child's hockey, golf, baseball and hockey expenses were not met. 3) The court found that the mother's proportionate share of the father’s s.7 expenses (bingo, golf) was reduced to 55.57% from 55.56% as the father had not withdrawn from SGI. The child’d be able to commence post-primary education in September 2003. 4) Costs were warranted in this situation because of the unreasonableness of the mother’ s.8 activities.

At his first court appearance the defendant requested the first available trial date and there was no evidence to suggest that an institutional delay of 13 months was the norm in other metro provincial courts. Given the nature of the charges, the technical nature of breathalyzer law and the defendant's stated intention to raise ss. 8 and 9 of the Charter, prejudice could be inferred on the basis that the length of delay was likely to interfere with the quality of evidence tendered.","The accused was charged with impaired driving contrary to s. 253(b) and s.253(a) of the Criminal Code.

The issue was whether the evidence was sufficient to prove impairment beyond a reasonable doubt. HELD: The only reliable indicia of impairment were a very strong odour of alcohol and a flushed face. Beyond that, the indicators are either inconclusive, non-existent or the accused offered a reasonable explanation for them. The evidence is so frail as to leave a reasonable doubt as to impairment and the accused was acquitted. 1) The accused was exceeding the speed limit and failed to signal lane changes. His vehicle wandered somewhat in the lane, but did not stray into the other lane. The observations of his driving were made over 2-minute period. The aspects of the driving that were observed may have been the result of driver inattention. 2) The bloodshot eyes may have been the result of chain smoking. Further, the evidence of glazed eyes is inconclusive in the absence of reliable evidence of bloodshot eyes. 3) The evidence of flushed face was reliable evidence of impairment. 4) The evidence of strong odour of alcohol is reliable indicia of impairment, due to the consumption of alcohol by the accused. 5) The accused did not have any problem with balance, but was moving in slow and deliberate manner. If the accused was not displaying difficulty with balance and coordination, then the suggestion that he was moving slowly is not a credible indicator of impairment. The accused did not display slurred speech and appeared to comprehend his legal rights and obligations. He did not display any mental confusion or inappropriate behaviour.

The accused was police officer with the Regina Police Service for 25 years until he retired in 1999 with the rank of Deputy Chief of Police. In the fall of 2001, he was appointed Justice of the Peace. The Crown proceeded summarily. The first incident involved the accused bringing the complainant's hand to his crotch. The second incident involved the accused touching the complainant's breast and crotch and trying to kiss her. The issues are whether the Crown proved the actus reus and mens rea of the offence. HELD: The accused is guilty of sexually assaulting the complainant in both courtroom 10 and the Youth Court general office. 1) The alleged touching occurred and it was of a sexual nature. The complainant did not consent to the contact. 2) The parties, along with most of the employees in the building, were often subject to or the source of numerous crude jokes and comments of a sexual nature. The accused believed that his discussions with the complainant about such matters were serious. However, at no time did the accused express his desire to get to know her or to see her outside of the workplace. He did not raise the possibility of physical relationship nor did she express any interest in sexual liaison. When he suggested it, she was not enthusiastic. The interactions described by the accused are more consistent with normal interaction between persons in that particular workplace than with an indication of consent to sexual activity. Looking at all the evidence, there is nothing to support an honest belief on the part of the accused that the complainant consented to the sexual contact. The accused's suggestion that he had an honest but mistaken belief in consent cannot be considered because the Court could not cobble together from the totality of the evidence sufficient evidence from which it could be said that the accused could have drawn an honestly held belief or from which he could have honestly inferred that the complainant had consented to his touching her.","The accused was charged with sexual assault. The complainant testified that she was assaulted when she returned to work from a job that involved the defendant's employment. She alleged that the defendant had asked her to take a position in the Justice of the Peace's office and that she had been told that he could get into trouble if he did not return his call. The accused also claimed that he had been harassed by the complainant when she was working in the courtroom. The Crown alleged that he made comments to her that embarrassed her and that he wanted to kiss her. The RCMP alleged that they had received a telephone message from the accused that he was trying to contact the complainant. The police alleged that this was an attempt to contact her and the accused had made comments about her having sex with him. The Court of Appeal concluded that the accused was not the only person who had been assaulted and that the Crown had proven the elements of the offence beyond a reasonable doubt. The evidence also suggested that the complainant had been sexually assaulted by the defendant when she worked in the justice of the peace's office. The court found that the evidence suggested that, as long as the complainant was aware that the alleged assault was taking place, the accused continued to pursue it. The judge concluded that, on the evidence that accept, the Crown has proven the element of the accused's offence beyond reasonable doubt, the statement could be used in cross-examination for the purpose of attacking the credibility of the witness."
e_2006skqb231.txt,"The plaintiff applies for certification pursuant to The Class Actions Act on behalf of himself and the other passengers of an international flight from the Dominican Republic to Regina. The flight was delayed for about 1.5 hours at the Dominican Republic airport as result of several mechanical difficulties. The claim is with respect to alleged negligence, unlawful confinement and breach of contract. HELD: The applicant has failed to establish the first criteria as set out in s. 6(a) of the Act. The application for certification is dismissed on that basis. 1) The court accepts that all of the defendants are governed by the provisions of the Montreal Convention of 1999. The wording of Article 29 of that agreement is clear. Any claims for damages of passenger of an international flight can only be brought within the ambit of the Montreal Convention of 1999. The court reviewed the cases and found that the plaintiff's claims outside the ambit of the Montreal Convention of 1999 in negligence, breach of contract, unlawful confinement and punitive damages do not disclose a cause of action. 2) The sole exclusive remedy available to passengers is set out in Article 17(1) of the Montreal Convention of 1999. strict liability regime has been set up with cap of damages where passenger sustains 'bodily injury' as result of an injury that occurs in the course of embarking or disembarking. It is settled law that for a passenger to have access to Article 17(1), the individual must have suffered a bodily injury as opposed to mere mental anguish. It has not been established that any bodily injury has been sustained by any of the passengers on Flight 361. It is plain and obvious that the claim does not raise a reasonable cause of action.

The plaintiff alleged negligence on the part of the defendants, unlawful confinement on the defendant's part, breach of contract and breach of a contract. The plaintiff also alleged that the defendants conspired to breach the terms of their contract by failing to provide adequate security and protection to the passengers.

e_2006skqb508.txt,"The Crown appeals the decision of the Provincial Court judge that found the respondent's rights under s. 10(b) of the Charter has been violated and in excluding the certificate of analysis, acquitted the respondent. The Crown argues that the trial judge misapplied the reasoning of the Supreme Court in R. v. Prosper in his analysis of the circumstances surrounding the police officer's demand for the respondent to provide his breath sample. The issue on this appeal is whether Prosper requires the police in the Saskatchewan jurisdiction, where faced with a detainee that has changed his mind and declined legal advice, to inform that detainee that he has a right to a reasonable opportunity to contact a lawyer and that the police have an obligation not to require the detainee to participate in any incriminating process until the detainee has had a reasonable opportunity to contact a lawyer. HELD: 1) Prosper addresses the issue of the police's obligation in jurisdictions where free, preliminary legal advice is unavailable. Oppositely, Saskatchewan has Brydges duty counsel available to detainees and no such obligation exists. Having reviewed the law as stated in Prosper, the Court concluded that the trial judge erred in finding that this case was analogous to the facts in Prosper, and in finding that the police officer had an obligation to provide a 'Prosper warning' to the respondent once the respondent had changed his mind and declined legal advice. 2) The police in Saskatchewan are required to provide any detainee with information so that detainee may access that legal advice. Once the police are confronted with detainee who changes his mind and declines legal advice, this waiver must be clear and unequivocal. 3) The evidence falls far short of proving that the respondent was frustrated, impatient probably, but not frustrated. The exchange lasted about minutes. The evidence shows a detainee who chose to neither wait for the telephone line to be available nor to telephone a private lawyer.","The Crown appeals the decision of the learned Provincial Court judge that found the respondent's rights under s. 10(b) of the Charter of Rights and Freedoms had been violated and, in excluding the certificate of analyses, acquitted the respondent. HELD: The appeal is dismissed. The evidence shows a detainee who chose to neither wait for the telephone line to be available nor to telephone a private lawyer. The trial judge clearly failed to address the fact that the detainee had changed his mind about seeking legal advice. The fact that he chose to wait for it to be unavailable and to telephone the private lawyer is a factor to be considered. The respondent's right to freedom of counsel is not violated. The accused's right under s9(b)(ii) is not to be tried in a jurisdiction where free, preliminary legal advice is available only to those eligible for legal aid. The Court of Appeal has reviewed the evidence and found that the respondent had not shown that he had a clear and unequivocal waiver. The court also found that, in situations where a detainee has asserted his right to counsel and been duly diligent in exercising it, the judge could not have reasonably concluded that the accused was frustrated. The appellant chose to call a private attorney rather than wait for his telephone line and the telephone to be accessible. The appeal court found that this was a situation where the detainee could not afford to retain private counsel and that the burden of establishing that the appellant gave an unequivocal waver was on the Crown. The Crown appealed. The issue on appeal is whether governments must provide Brydges duty counsel. Hearsay: The trial court found the trial judge erred in his application of Prosper to the case before him, not only because of the conclusion he reached on the evidence but on the interpretation of Prosper with respect to the issue at hand. The holding-off requirement was found to be in breach of the respondent’s s. 9(b). The trial judges found a breach of s. 11(b), and the trial court concluded that a detainee’ s. 8(b)) rights under the Charter were not violated by the respondent because he chose not to call the private counsel. The failure to provide an unequiv unequivocal warning was a factor in the appellant’ll to not contact a private counsel until he had had a reasonable opportunity to contact. The error of judgment was not considered."
e_2006skqb534.txt,"The primary issue in this application is the respondent's claim to retroactive support. HELD: 1) The Court reviewed the cases from the Supreme Court of Canada regarding retroactive child support and in particular D.B.S. v. S.R.G. et al, 2006 SCC 37. 2) The respondent has been content to accept $380 per month as fair level of child support for both children. What precipitated the respondent's review in July 2006 was Meghan's departure from his home where she began to live independently with the prospect of attending college. What further propelled the continued action on the respondent's part was the publicity attendant with the Supreme Court of Canada's release of its judgment in July 2006. There is no reasonable excuse as to why the respondent did not seek a variation earlier, other than concluding that the respondent accepted $380 per month as reasonable in the circumstances that prevailed from July 2003 to July 2006. 3) There is no evidence of blameworthy conduct on the petitioner's part. There was no agreement or obligation to disclose tax returns. No written request was made pursuant to s. 25 of the Guidelines. No verbal request was made by the respondent which might fall within the definition of 'effective notice'. The increase in the petitioner's level of income over the years 2002 to 2005 is not so dramatic as to constitute blameworthy conduct that privileges the petitioner's own interests over her children's right to an appropriate amount of support. In 2002, the petitioner earned $32,800 and, by 2005, she earned $43,310. An increase of these proportions would not lead the Court to conclude that the petitioner was not contributing to her children's support in a satisfactory manner. The Court's view of the evidence is that the annual increases equivalent to roughly 10% per annum, when adjusted for the annual rate of inflation, are not so significant that the petitioner would have reasonably thought that she was feathering her own nest at the expense of her children. 4) There was no evidence that the children's standard of living was compromised as a direct consequence of the petitioner not taking the initiative to adjust her child support payments annually. Nor was there evidence of financial hardship experienced by the children. 5) To order retroactive support of $4,322, whether payable in a lump sum or by installments over time, would represent a hardship to a wage earner in the petitioner's category. The application for retroactive child support is dismissed.","The respondent applied to vary the child support orders of the Justice Kraus dated September 10, 1999 and December 7, 2003 and/or the alleged agreement struck by the petitioner and respondent in or about July 2003. The respondent sought to vary pursuant to s17(1) of the Divorce Act and also pursuant to the Family Maintenance Act. HELD: The application was dismissed. 1)The respondent did not seek a variation earlier than concluding that the petitioner's obligation to pay child support for the children commencing July 1, 2004 and continuing until July 2006 constituted a breach of their alleged 2003 agreement. 2)The petitioner did not engage in blameworthy conduct. The parties negotiated through their lawyers and the petitioner personally discussing the child care issue. 3)The court found that the respondent's delay between June 2004 and July 2006 was not so dramatic in the circumstances as to constitute blamness. To order retroactive support of $4,322.00, whether payable in a lump sum or by installments over time, would represent a hardship to a wage earner in the petitioner’s category. 4)The Court found that there was no agreement or obligation to disclose the income tax return. The petitioner”s conduct was not blamable."
e_2007skqb34.txt,"The accused brings an application pursuant to s. 520 of the Criminal Code for a review of the order denying him judicial interim release. HELD: The accused's continued detention is necessary for the protection of the public The Court puts significant weight on the accused's continued disregard of court orders and the fact that the number and severity of the assault incidents is increasing. The accused received the benefit of conditional sentence in April 2006 and in July was found to have breached the orders which formed part of the conditional sentence. He is now facing additional allegations of breach. Even though he was bound by conditional sentence and was charged with another violent offence, which is alleged to have occurred in September, he was once again released from custody in October. This was followed by the allegation of yet another and more serious assault which has lead to the accused remaining in custody for the last months.","The accused, who was previously released on conditional sentence on a charge of assault causing bodily harm, was charged with two new offences. He had previously entered guilty pleas to a number of charges including two counts of breach of undertaking. He was originally released on a conditional sentence but failed to appear in court as required to do on October 16, 2006. Pursuant to s. 742.6 of the Criminal Code, the accused brought an application pursuant to s 520(7)(d) for a review of the order denying him judicial interim release. HELD: The accused's continued detention at this time is necessary for the protection or safety of the public. The number and severity of the assault incidents is increasing. The accused has failed to meet the onus on him to justify that his detention in custody is not necessary and pursuant to ss. 520(8)(d), s. 520 of the Code his application is dismissed."
e_2008nssc216.txt,"The applicant school teacher asked to be discharged from $20k in student loan debts under s.178(1.1) of the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act. He had filed consumer proposal in 2001, which he completed successfully in 2006. He earned $50,874 (gross) per annum; was at the top of his pay scale; had two young children; and his wife worked half-time position at Aliant, earning $16,272 year. There were daycare costs when the wife worked, and the applicant's transportation costs were high (but reasonable). The wife had significant debts and no remaining credit; she paid around $1,000 month to service her cards. The applicant did not have any credit either. Their home had little, if any, equity. The AG agreed the applicant had acted in good faith, but contested whether he was (and would continue to be) unable to pay the debt. Application allowed. Permitting the applicant's family a reasonably frugal lifestyle, which the court found they had, would mean he could not pay off the loan. Using the Superintendent's standards, there might be a small surplus in the family budget, but it would take many years for the applicant to significantly reduce his liability. If the application were refused, he would have to consider bankruptcy.","The applicant sought an order under s. 178(1.1) of the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act that Subsection 178(2.1)(g) does not apply to his outstanding student loan debt. HELD: The application was denied. 1)The applicant had been in financial difficulty to such an extent that he would be unable to pay his liabilities under the loan. The Attorney General did not question his good faith in past dealings with his loans. 2)The respondent had a reasonably frugal family lifestyle which was what he had, but would not permit him to pay the liabilities for the loan, which was not his responsibility. 3)The Attorney General of Canada did not have the resources to discharge the liability now, nor in the next several years."
e_2009nssc204.txt,"An unrepresented university student appealed his conviction for uttering threats after he sent an email to his computer science professor requesting his assistance to de-bug a program contained in an attachment. The attachment was text file with lot of extra characters, including messages that read 'good job, but am going to kill you' and 'I am so horny.' Although the professor had not taken the content of the attachment as threat, he had sent it on to university officials as he had been requested to alert them to any odd or unusual behaviour by the student. The student later advised the professor that he had typed the messages because he thought someone was monitoring what he was typing and he was trying to get reaction out of them. He also testified that he had not intended to send that particular attachment to the professor. Appeal allowed; conviction quashed. The trial judge erred in permitting inadmissible evidence to be adduced from the university administration to the effect that the accused had a psychiatric illness and, in failing to intervene when the Crown assumed that the student had put his character in issue and cross-examined him as to alleged prior acts of misconduct and other extraneous matters, the cumulative effect of which was fatal to the trial judge's findings of credibility. The case against the student was entirely circumstantial and it was equally open to infer that the words had been typed in the file to get a reaction from people that the student, rationally or otherwise, believed to be monitoring his keystrokes and did not constitute a threat to cause death to the professor.","The appellant was a student at St. Francis Xavier University when he sent an email to his computer science professor with an attachment. Although the professor did not take the content of the attachment as a threat, he sent it to university officials as he had been requested to alert them to any odd or unusual behaviour by the appellant. The police were contacted and a charge was laid against the appellant of uttering a threat to the professor to cause his death contrary to s264.1(1)(a) of the Criminal Code. The appellant did not have a lawyer when he stood his trial on May 14, 2008 in Provincial Court. The trial judge rejected the appellant's testimony as not being credible, as not having an explanation by the accused, and that the evidence given by the Crown was rife with hearsay and very prejudicial to the appellant, who had been advised by the police that the accused intended to kill the professor. The Crown argued that the message was intended to intimidate and be taken seriously. The evidence was rife in hearsay, very prejudicicial to his credibility. The court found that the Crown had not erred in calling the appellant as a witness. The accused was found guilty of utterning a threat and was sentenced immediately following the conclusion of his trial to an 18 month suspended sentence and placed on probation with conditions. The defence argued that it was impossible to think that anyone threatening death or serious bodily harm in a manner that was meant to be taken serious would not intend to do so. The appeal court rejected the accused's testimony that he thought someone was monitoring what he was typing and that he did not run it as he did de-bugged it. The Court of Appeal held that the trial judge had not entered into a formal or informal voir dire to determine if the accused had any relevant evidence to give. The Appeal Court held that it would be inappropriate to call a witness who was not counsel at trial to specifically address the appellant’s argument that the verdict was unreasonable. The only reasonable inference that one can draw is that the appellant thought someone had monitored what he wrote and that it wasn’t his status as a student. The inference that the court drew from the evidence was that the words were meant to get reaction from the reader of the e-mail. The fact that the e.mail was sent to the accused was not a factor in the decision to call the witness."
e_2009skca40.txt,"This is an appeal from a judgment in which the trial judge held that the sale of farm land by the then 79 year old appellant was valid and that her solicitor in the transaction was not negligent. The appellant widow agreed to sell four quarters of farmland, including residence and some grain bins on the land, to the respondents by lease option agreement. The total price was $120,000. The terms were favourable to the purchasers, the monies being paid over years with most deferred until the final year. There was no interest. However, the appellant was permitted to reside in the house for her lifetime if she paid the utilities and the property taxes. The trial judge noted that the appellant resided on the land for years and there was no complaint made until the appellant's daughter, from whom the contract had been concealed by joint agreement between the appellant and the purchasers, found out what had happened. The sole issue on appeal was the applicable standard of review in H.L. v. Canada (Attorney General) [2005] 1 S.C.R. 401. HELD: Appeal dismissed. 1) There is no doubt that the central facts as found by the trial judge regarding the contract, the competence of the appellant and the relationship with and the conduct of the purchasers was supported by probative evidence. It is impossible for an appeal court to interfere with those findings, even if the Court had wished to. 2) With regard to the allegation of negligence against appellant's lawyer, contrary to what the appellant suggest, an independent meeting is not absolutely necessary for the solicitor to ensure comprehension of the contract. It is of course desirable, but the critical matter is for the solicitor to satisfy himself that the client comprehends the transaction. The trial judge found that the appellant understood all aspects of the contract. The matter of the timing of the private meeting between the appellant and her lawyer is not relevant, given that the appellant after the meeting continued to be prepared to enter into and perform the contract. If she had manifested some unease after she signed the agreement and then met with her lawyer but before the delivery of the contract to the purchasers, other issues and no doubt other evidence would have been considered in determining when the contract became effective in the circumstances. The claims against the appellant's solicitor are without a factual basis.","This was an appeal from a judgment in which the trial judge held that the sale of farm land by the then 79-year-old appellant was valid and that her solicitor in the transaction was not negligent. The appeals against both the Clements and the solicitors were dismissed. The appellant sought to set aside the transaction under various heads of contract law including duress, undue influence, unconscionability, equitable fraud and mistake. The trial judge made critical findings of fact, including comprehension and desire to provide benefit to the appellant, which were supported by probative evidence. The court was unable to interfere with the findings of facts."
e_2010skca79.txt,"The RCMP conducted search of farmland near Canora. They were also shown pictures of the accused who was likely driving white Tempo. The search revealed marijuana grow-op. The accused was later seen by officers driving. The officers chased the Tempo for 41 kms, but the vehicle was driven into the ditch, and the driver escaped on foot. Four years later the accused was arrested in British Columbia and brought to trial. The accused was convicted of three drug offences and two driving offences following a jury trial. He was sentenced to a total of 35 months in prison. The accused appeal both the convictions and the sentence. HELD: The accused argued the convictions were unreasonable and not supported by the evidence. The grounds were: (a) the officer's eye witness identification evidence cannot support a conviction; (b) the trial judge made inappropriate comments about whether the accused could have outrun the officer at the end of the car chase, if he was the driver; (c) an adverse inference should been drawn from the Crown's failure to call the second officer; (d) the trial judge's treatment of the photographs of the accused misled the jury about what had to be proven to establish the accused was driving the Tempo; (e) the jury was improperly lead to place reliance on an assessment of a witness's credibility made by an officer who questioned him about his possible involvement in the grow-op. The Court found: (a) the jury was alerted to the frailties of the officer's identification evidence, and the convictions were not unreasonable in light of the evidence as a whole; (b) it was open to the jury to consider whether the accused could have outrun the officer, and the judge's caution about changes in physical condition over time put the issue into a proper perspective; (c) the judge told the jury that it could draw an adverse inference from the Crown's failure to call the second officer, but the decision lies with the jury and the judge is not obliged to tell the jury that it must draw the inference; (d) when the charge is considered as a whole, the jury was not left with the impression that if it concluded the pictures were of the accused that it somehow followed that he was the driver of the Tempo; (e) the judge's remarks did not improperly influence the jury's assessment of the witness's credibility. The imposed sentences fall within the standard range for similar offences and were not demonstrably unfit.","Following a jury trial, a convicted drug user was convicted of three drug offences and two Criminal Code driving offences. He was sentenced to 35 months in prison. The appeal court dismissed the convictions and sentence appeals. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. 1)The jury was alerted to the accused's evidence and the trial judge made inappropriate comments about whether the accused was driving the Tempo. The jury was not led to place particular reliance on an assessment of the accused’s credibility made by an R.C.M.P. officer who questioned the accused about possible involvement in the grow-op. The trial judge reviewed the evidence and found that the accused had not shown that the evidence supported his conviction. The court did not conclude that the conviction appeal court’d erred in concluding that the trial court”s conclusion was unreasonable. 2)The Court was not persuaded that the Crown’ s argument that the judge had erred was unreasonable in light of the evidence as a whole. The Court was also not persuaded by the defence’S argument that, on the whole of the trial, the accused could have been found to be driving the vehicle. The evidence was not so compelling that the Court was unable to conclude that his convictions were unreasonable."
e_2011skqb134.txt,"The accused plead guilty to one count of using credit card data to fraudulently obtain services contrary to s. 342(3) of the Criminal Code, one count of fraud over $5,000 contrary to s. 380(1) of the Criminal Code for defrauding Sasktel of telephone services and one count of fraudulently personating various persons with intent to gain advantage for himself contrary to s. 403(a) of the Criminal Code. The accused was incarcerated at the time that he committed the offences. The accused opened 52 false accounts with Sasktel, at times using names he obtained from obituaries and at other times using fictious names. He then used the accounts to obtain telephone services. The total loss to Sasktel was $25,915.44. The second scheme involved obtaining credit card information from people outside the prison, ordering goods via telephone to be delivered to third party and using the fraudulent credit cards to pay for the items. The total loss to the credit card companies was $22,695.18. The accused was 47 years old and had spent much of the last 30 years in jail. He had 121 prior convictions on his record, mostly for fraud, property related offences and non-compliance with court orders. In addition to the financial losses, huge amount of resources were expended to investigate the accused's activities. He plead guilty. HELD: A fit sentence in global terms for these offences would be 8 years and 6 months. The accused was given credit for 4 years and 9 months for the time he spent in custody. The accused was sentenced to 2 years and 3 months for the s. 342(3) offence, 1 year and 6 months consecutive for the offence under s. 380(1) and 2 years concurrent for the personation offence under s. 403(a). The Court gave the accused double credit for remand time that was the result of system delays, but imposed 1:1 credit for the 393 days of remand time that were attributable to the accused. The Court held that the high dollar value involved, the pre-meditation and planning involved, the lengthy period of time over which the accused committed the offences, the number of transactions involved and the fact that the accused committed these offences from prison were aggravating factors. In mitigation, the accused offered a guilty plea. The primary factors to be emphasized were denunciation and deterrence.","The accused pled guilty to three counts. The Crown stayed counts and three were stayed. The accused was sentenced to two years and three months imprisonment. The sentences were increased to four years and six months and the global sentence was reduced to two year and six month imprisonment. HELD: The accused's sentence was increased to eight years and seven months. The court noted that the accused pleaded guilty to two counts and that he had no income. Payment of the surcharge was waived as the accused had no means to make any money for some time. The Court noted that there had been a period of time between the time the accused spent on remand and the time actually served on remands. The gravity of the offences was very high because of a number of aggravating circumstances. The offence was pursued over a lengthy period of period and involved scores of transactions. The two schemes were pursued over lengthy periods of time and involved a number a number. The credit should be one for one or put otherwise, the time served on a remand actually amounted to 1,336 days. The global sentence should be reduced accordingly."
e_2011skqb244.txt,"The appellant was convicted of impaired care and control and acquitted of a charge of care and control with a blood alcohol level exceeding .08 because of Charter violations. The appellant was senior member of the Saskatoon Police Force who was charged by members of his police force. The trial judge based his conviction on the evidence of two officers who testified that they observed signs of impairment including bloodshot, red eyes, flushed face, slurred speech, strong smell of alcohol on his breath and dry lips and mouth. In convicting the accused, the trial judge rejected the evidence of third officer who testified that the only sign of impairment he noted on scene was that the appellant had alcohol on his breath. The issues on appeal were whether the trial judge erred in his treatment of the evidence of the third officer, whether the trial judge erred in considering the observations of the other two officers as evidence to be admitted on the impaired driving count and whether the conviction for impaired driving was an unsafe verdict. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. The trial judge did not ignore or reject the evidence of the third officer. He provided extensive reasons why he preferred the evidence of the other two officers to the evidence of the third officer. The trial judge is in special position to assess the credibility of witnesses by being able to observe the witnesses as they testify and compare their observations to the testimony of the other witnesses. The findings of fact in regard to the testimony of the three police officers are supported by the transcript of their evidence and do not amount to conjecture of speculation. The trial judge made express findings of credibility with respect to the two officers and preferred their evidence to that of the third officer. There is no inherent improbability that would justify interference with the trial judge's findings on credibility. The appellant argued that the officer's evidence that the appellant had slurred speech should have been excluded because the trial judge excluded the actual statements made by the accused as violation of the accused's Charter rights under s. 10(b). Slurred speech is known physical indicator of impairment absent evidence of another cause. While statements made by an accused may not be introduced to prove impairment unless the accused has been advised of his Charter rights, physical manifestation such as slurred speech may be introduced to prove evidence of impairment. The appellant's argument that the verdict is unsafe or unreasonable was also rejected. The trial judge concluded that the Crown had proven beyond a reasonable doubt that there was evidence of impairment sufficient to meet the standard in R. v. Stellato. There was no palpable or overriding error in the verdict.","The appellant appeals his conviction for impaired care and control of a motor vehicle contrary to s.253(1)(a) of the Criminal Code, fined him $1,000 and prohibited him from driving for one year. HELD: The appeal is dismissed. 1)The learned trial judge concluded that the Crown had proven beyond a reasonable doubt sufficient evidence of impairment to meet the standard set out in the Stellato decision. 2)The trial judge did not err in his treatment of the evidence of the central Crown witness. The Crown had not been informed of the right to counsel when the tests were performed. The trial judge was in a special position on matters of credibility because he was able to observe the accused at the scene and was able, in cross-examination, to compare his observations to those of other witnesses. The appellant was not in a position to rely on conjecture or speculation as suggested by the appellant. 3)The appeal is allowed. The learned trial court concluded that it had proven that the accused had not met the standard of impairment as set out by the Stellerato decision and that the trial judge erred in considering evidence that was not admissible on the impaired count. The appeal was dismissed. 4)The Court of Appeal has concluded that, although the Crown has proven beyond reasonable doubt that it has sufficient evidence to meet its standard of proof, the conviction for impairment of a vehicle does not constitute an unsafe verdict. The Court of Appeals has concluded the Crown's evidence of Cst. Noesgaard and Cst.(Flogan) was not unreliable. The court reviewed the transcripts of their evidence and found that the appellant had not shown any inherent improbability or lack of motor skills. The judge concluded the evidence was not so unreliable as to justify interference by an appellate court with the findings of the trial court. 5)The appellant was in good standing to appeal.

e_2011skqb444.txt,"In the evening, the accused inmate and his two co-accused inmates placed themselves in close proximity to the complainant inmate at table at the Penitentiary. The co-accused threw hot liquid from the cup directly into the complainant's face and the three inmates commenced stabbing the complainant with weapon. second complainant inmate attempted to intervene to assist the first complainant and the accused and co-accused began to stab the second complainant. The first complainant suffered severe first and second degree burns to his face and to his shoulders as well as numerous puncture wounds and lacerations but was not critically injured. The accused was charged with aggravated assault on the first complainant and common assault on the second complainant. None of the inmates testified at trial other than the accused. The accused testified that he felt he was being shunned in the Block and had received threats from the first complainant and others in the complainant's group who were brandishing shanks earlier that day. The defence argued that the Crown failed to prove that the injuries caused to the first complainant fell within the definition of 'wound, maim, disfigure or endanger life'; and that the acts done to the first and second complainants were in self-defence as contemplated by s. 34 of the Criminal Code. HELD: The accused was convicted of both counts. 1) In relation to the accused's defence of self-defence pursuant to s. 34(2) pertaining to the first complainant, the Court found the accused did not believe that he was being assaulted within the meaning of the law and, even if he did hold this belief, such a belief was not reasonable in the circumstances. Further, the Court did not accept, on a subjective or objective basis, that the accused reasonably believed that the first complainant had the present ability to carry out the threat, notwithstanding that the physical aspect of the assault need not be imminent or immediate. Lastly, the Court found that the accused did not believe that he had no other option. The accused admitted that he had other options but chose not to avail himself of them. 2) The Court found it did not need to assess the application of s. 37 of the Code in relation to the common assault charge. Rather, the Court found s. 27 of the Code applicable and determined that the second complainant was legally justified to use as much force as was reasonably necessary to prevent the commission of an offence which would be arrestable without warrant. The Court found the second complainant was clothed in legal justification and the accused was not entitled to the protection of s. 34(1) because the accused provoked the assault, and the force he used was more than necessary to defend himself as the accused was armed with a shank and the second complainant was not.","The accused was charged with aggravated assault and one count of common assault relating to a violent incident that took place in the maximum security unit of the prison. The accused and the two alleged victims were inmates at the prison and were being held on 'B' Block. Given that the incident was captured by security videos, there is no doubt as to what happened. The issues raised by the accused pertain to how his actions ought to be characterized. HELD: The accused was found guilty of aggravated assault. The Court found that the accused's actions against the victims were done in self-defence as contemplated by s. 34(2) of the Criminal Code. The court found that, in all of the circumstances, the accused inflicted injuries to the victim that fit within the category of an aggravated assault, and also constitute grievous bodily harm. The Crown applied the test of'self-defences' under s. 21(1)(b) of s.22(1) of The Criminal Code, which established that the offences were committed in self defence. The test of identity was not the end of the analysis. The trial judge found that there was no issue as to identity. The only issue was how the accused would define self-defense under s34(2). The accused's action against the victim was done in a self- defence."
e_2012skpc161.txt,"The accused plead guilty to one count of aggravated assault, a breach of undertaking for failure to keep the peace and be of good behaviour and failing to comply with a condition of a youth sentence by failing to report to his youth worker. The victim came out of his house because he was concerned that someone was trying to damage his vehicle. The victim had baseball bat when he confronted the accused and group of young people. One of the accused's friends was pushed and fell backwards hitting his head. The accused said the victim hit him on the back with the bat. The accused got the bat and hit the victim five times in the head. The accused and another youth also kicked the victim while he was down. After the assault, the accused and his friends fled, leaving the victim in the alley. The victim suffered serious injuries including shattered jaw, every bone in his face was broken, his skull was fractured and he suffered brain bleed and lost teeth. He is also going to lose his eye, has memory loss and had to sell his business because he cannot work. The Crown applied to have the offence declared a serious violent offence and sought a sentence of 24 months, being 16 months secure custody followed by 8 months community supervision. At the time of the offence the accused was 17 years and months of age. He identified as Metis youth, but had no connection to cultural activities and claimed he had not been subjected to racism or poverty. His parents were separated. He was not attending school or working at the time of the offence.

He had served five open custody sentences. HELD: The offence was declared a serious violent offence. The victim will be significantly and permanently disabled as a result of the offence and there can be no doubt that the accused caused intentional and grievous bodily harm to the victim. The court held that the egregious nature of the assault, serious harm done to the victim and the fact that the youth was subject to release conditions with respect to a weapons offence at the time he committed the assault were aggravating factors. In mitigation, the accused had entered a guilty plea, was cooperative with the police investigation, had done well in pre-sentence detention and had expressed remorse for his actions by submitting an apology letter to the court. The accused was sentenced to 24 months secure custody followed by 18 months probation. He was given 2:1 credit for the time he was on remand, leaving 18 months custody of closed custody to serve of which 12 months would be actual custody and 6 months would be community supervision. The court held that a lengthy custodial sentence was necessary to provide meaningful consequences and to achieve meaningful progress for the accused. A period of secure custody and supervision would give the accused access to psychological counselling and programming, an opportunity to work on his education and a chance to engage with support services in the community prior to release from custody. Given the accused's violent response in this case, it was clear that intensive programming is required.","The accused was sentenced to 24 months custody, followed by a 6 month community supervision order. The accused had been subject to release conditions in relation to a weapons offence. The Crown applied under section 42(9) of the Youth Criminal Justice Act for a determination that the aggravated assault be designated as a serious violent offence.

The court found that a period of custody was necessary to provide meaningful consequences and to achieve meaningful progress for the accused. The young person had been previously convicted of a similar assault in 2010. The Court found that the young person was cooperative with police and provided a statement. The offence was intentional and foreseeable and the harm to the victim was intentional. The youth was cooperative and provided an apology. The sentence was increased to 18 months. The offender will be permanently disabled. The aggravating factors were the egregious nature of the assault, including repeated blows with a weapon and the resulting serious harm done to the complainant.

e_2013skca1.txt,"The proposed appellants are some of the defendants in an action commenced by Schneider against them on the grounds that he, as representative plaintiff, and others suffered financial losses due to negligence on the part of McMillan. The representative plaintiff and other investors purchased 'cells' in gold exploration prospect owned and promoted by Royal Crown Gold Reserve Inc. based on that defendant's representation that the purchase price was deductible from the purchaser's earned income for income tax purposes and the tax opinions provided by McMillan. McMillan's opinion letters were posted on Royal Crown's website. The representative plaintiff purchased the cells and then filed tax returns claiming deduction, which was disallowed by the Canada Revenue Agency. The representative plaintiff commenced this action claiming that he and others suffered financial losses due to McMillan's negligence. McMillan applied to strike the statement of claim on the grounds that it was devoid of merit pursuant to Queen's Bench Rule 173(c) and opposed the certification of the action on the basis that the relationship between them and the representative plaintiff was insufficient to found a recognized duty of care between a lawyer and a non-client. Their application was supported by affidavits indicating that their tax opinions were not to be given to prospective investors. The plaintiff filed an affidavit from another lawyer, who deposed that when he prepared such opinion letters regarding tax consequences he reviewed all the underlying documents and agreements beforehand to protect the reputation of his law firm, knowing that the opinions were often relied upon as marketing tool to potential investors. The Chambers judge dismissed McMillan's application and it brought this application for leave to appeal under s. 8 of The Court of Appeal Act except as provided by s. 39(3) of The Class Actions Act. HELD: The Court dismissed the applications. It held that the Chambers judge was correct in holding that the action was not devoid of merit or vexatious. The judge had reviewed the affidavits and concluded that a lawyer may owe a duty of care to a non-client in specific circumstances, including those of this case. McMillan should have been aware of the use made by the mining industry of opinion letters and taken steps to prevent their opinion being used inappropriately for the purpose of inducing potential investors to invest with their client. The Court also found that the Chambers judge did not err in certifying the claim of negligence as a common issue that predominated over other issues affecting individual members of a class. McMillan's argument that the factual base pled by the representative plaintiff did not establish a common issue to meet the requirements of s. 6(1)(c) of The Class Actions Act failed because, in this case, the class members suffered real losses allegedly as a result of McMillan's negligence. These facts coupled with the case law stating that a lawyer may owe a duty of care to a non-client and the plaintiff's affiant's evidence, established a common issue that met the requirements of the Act.","The proposed appellants applied to strike the Chambers judge's order striking the within action on the basis that the relationship between them and the representative plaintiff was insufficient to found a recognized duty of care between a lawyer and non-client. The representative plaintiff alleged that he and other investors purchased cells based on the representation by Royal Crown that the purchase price could be deducted from the purchaser's earned income for income tax purposes. Royal Crown opposed the certification of the within actions on the ground that the relationships between them, and the plaintiff, did not establish a common issue within the meaning of s.6(1)(c) of the Act. The Chambers judge dismissed the application and certified the action as a class action against all defendants. The proposed appeal by the proposed appellant and the representatives of the plaintiff both opposed the Chambers order striking on the grounds that the evidence of clients involved in the mining industry using legal opinions provided by Royal crown as a marketing tool is so commonly known among tax lawyers that the lawyer should have been alive to the practice and should have taken appropriate steps to guard against opinion letters being inappropriately used for inducing potential investors to invest with the client or clients. The evidence of the clients involved involved in mining industry use legal opinions as a Marketing Tool is so common among tax attorneys that the Chambers Judge should have had the full benefit of expert evidence regarding the duty of a lawyer to client. Evidence of clients using legal opinion provided by the plaintiff as a tool to induce potential investors into investing with the clients or clients might be of interest to the plaintiff. The tax opinions provided were inappropriately used by the client to induce prospective investors to buy the plaintiff's cell. The chambers judge reviewed the evidence before him and found it was not plain and obvious that the representative had no cause of action against the applicant. The court reviewed the tax opinions and the tax opinion letters and concluded that the tax evidence of those clients was so commonly used by tax lawyers as a way of marketing tool that they did not require the assistance of an analysis by the Court of Appeal. The Court of appeal judge concluded that evidence of client-client communications being inappropriately and inappropriately used to induce investors to take appropriate steps against potential investors and advised them to guard for opinion letters. The Chamber judge reviewed other tax opinion correspondence and found that the information contained in the tax letters was not relevant to the action.

e_2013skqb264.txt,"The parties had three children during their marriage. After the marriage ended in 1988, the husband respondent, medical specialist, moved from Moose Jaw to Ontario where his annual income was about $175,000. The children stayed with the petitioner wife in Moose Jaw. She was not able to work as registered nurse until she upgraded her education, which she slowly did as she could afford it. She and the children lived on very little income and relied upon social assistance because the respondent often did not pay child support. The parties were regularly in court. In 1994, the respondent left his position in Ontario and moved to Milwaukee, believing his prospects were better in the U.S. However, he lost his position in Milwaukee and opened his own clinic. His income dropped to as little as $15,000 in 2001. In this application, the respondent applied to vary two support orders, one made in 1998 and the other issued in 2001. He sought to expunge the arrears in respect of each and a declaration that the three children are no longer children of the marriage. His reason for seeking to have the arrears expunged was because he, now 72, wanted to retire in the next couple of years. The petitioner, 63, deeply in debt and on long-term disability, was still caring for one of their children because he suffers from schizophrenia. HELD: The Court held that two of the children had ceased to be children of the marriage as of 2002 and 2008 respectively. With respect to the third child, the Court found that as a result of the serious and long-term mental health problems suffered by him, he remained a child of the marriage. The Court then found that the respondent's arrears in respect of the 1998 child support order were $7,000. Based upon the respondent's imputed income of $109,000 per year established by the Court in its 2001 order, and the dates upon which the two children ceased to be so under the Divorce Act, the Court calculated the amount of child support owed by the respondent at $186,300. The Court rejected the respondent's argument that he could not afford to pay the arrears because his expenses left him with an income surplus of only $13,000. The Court discounted most of the claimed expenses and found that the respondent had $58,000 at his disposal and therefore had the ability to pay his arrears. The Court found that the respondent had chosen to minimize his earning capacity by staying in the U.S. in private practice and thus the respondent could not assert that the Court should use his actual income rather than his imputed income to vary the amount of child support he was ordered to pay in 2001. The undue hardship that the petitioner had suffered for 25 years constituted the most compelling reason for the Court to refuse to reduce or expunge the respondent's arrears. The application was dismissed and the respondent ordered to pay arrears and to pay child support in the amount of $927.","FIAT: The respondent sought to vary two orders issued in 1998 and 2001. He wants to expunge the arrears in respect of each and also seeks a declaration that their three children are no longer children of the marriage. HELD: 1) The arrear of child support arreared was $183,746. The petitioner was 63 years old and living with her mother. The respondent had not been paying child support for some time. He was putting money away for his retirement expenses. The wife was 63 and the child support was $186,738. 2) The respondent was trying to obtain a support order for his impending retirement. He had not paid child support in years. He did not have the ability to pay the arraars because he could have taken employment that paid him at least $110,000 a year. He knew that he was expected to maximize his earning capacity but simply chose not to. 3) The court found that the respondent did not meet the threshold for entitlement to child support. The court ordered that the arrow be reduced to $183.746 as the respondent had failed to meet his obligations under the 2001 order. The arrow was calculated using the income of the wife. 4) The Court found that it could not find that the petitioner did not not have a financial capacity to pay child support, which was $185,742. 5) The applicant had not proven that he could not pay child care expenses. 6) The petitioner had not demonstrated that she could not work as a registered nurse. She had no independent verification to support his claims of illness or how his medical condition might affect his ability to work or earn an income. The Court ordered that he pay $1,683 in monthly child support and $176,737 for child support expenses. 7) The amount of child care arreages owed by the parties was $32,865. The amount owed by both parties was the amount owed under the 2002 order. 8) The parties had been married for 25 years. The parties lived together for many years. They had three children. The husband had recently retired from his job in the United States. He now lived in a modest retirement community. The children lived with the petitioner for several years. 9) The husband was working in the city and had a long term disability. He paid child care costs of $1.5 million in 2001.
