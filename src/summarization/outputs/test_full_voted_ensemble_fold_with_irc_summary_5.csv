The issues were decided as follows: 1) the trial judge was found to have applied the wrong test as to de facto care and control of the vehicle. The appeal on the first ground was dismissed, however, because the Crown could rely on the presumption in s. 258(1)(c); the accused had been driving 10 minutes before the stop and within two hours of the breath tests, so whether he was in de facto care and control at the time of the stop was irrelevant and did not result in a miscarriage of justice; 2) there was no evidence of the failure to observe the appellant while the breath tests were administered, nor was there a suggestion of the significance of the failure to do so, therefore, the appeal on that ground was dismissed; 3) the trial judge also addressed the issue of evidence if the 2008 amendments did not apply and the appellant was therefore not prejudiced in this regard. The appellant nonetheless argued that the trial judge erred in law by misapprehending evidence. The appeal court concluded that the trial judge did not err in law because his reasons did not disclose that he failed to consider relevant evidence relating to a material issue;  4) the Crown conceded that the 2008 amendments did not apply retroactively. The appeal court found that the trial judge was incorrect in giving a strong message to the unrepresented appellant that there was no point in tendering evidence on the accuracy of the Intoxilyzer results. The trial judge’s comments strongly suggested that the only expert evidence that would be relevant would be with respect to equipment malfunction and not operator error. The appeal was granted on this ground because the trial judge’s comments were found to compromise trial fairness resulting in an error of law; 5) the s. 9 Charter breach was not raised by the appellant at trial but it was raised in his brief following trial, and therefore the appeal court found that the trial judge was obliged to decide whether or not to consider the issue. The appeal was also allowed on this ground because the trial judge did not comply with his duty to consider the issue and the appeal court could not determine whether the failure to give reasons resulted in a miscarriage of justice; and 6) there was no issue of trial fairness. The appeal court concluded that there would be prejudice to the integrity of the justice system that would be manifested if the appellant had a fourth trial. Nine and a half years passed since the offence date and the facts of the case were less serious than some drinking and driving cases. Also, there was no other remedy available to remedy the wrong.

The trial judge did not err in concluding that the accused did not provide evidence to the contrary so as to rebut the presumption of accuracy, he had no reasonable doubt as to the guilt of the accused. 2)The Court of Appeal allowed the appeal from the bench and, rather than ordering a fourth trial, decided to allow the appellant's appeal and order a new trial.","He has appealed that conviction pursuant to s. 813 of the Criminal Code.

[16] In my respectful opinion, the learned trial judge’s reasons disclose that he applied the wrong legal test as to de facto care and control. Further, given that he did so less than two hours before the administration of the Intoxilyzer test, the Crown was entitled to rely on the presumptions in s. 258(1)(c) of the Criminal Code to prove that the appellant’s blood alcohol level was the same at the time of the offence as that disclosed by the breath tests. As such, the fact that the learned trial judge committed an error of law in relation to the test to be applied in determining whether the appellant had care and control after the appellant stopped did not result in a substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice.

[30] That said, it is my view that the trial judge’s reasons do not disclose an error within the meaning of the third part of the test outlined in Morrissey.  That is, they do not disclose that the trial judge failed to consider relevant evidence relating to a material issue which played an essential part in the reasoning process which resulted in the conviction. This unrepresented accused was given a very strong message by the learned trial judge that there was no point in leading evidence in an attempt to challenge the accuracy of the Intoxylizer results. Further, and although the learned trial judge initially referred to the fact that the appellant could prove either equipment malfunction or operator error, his comments, taken as a whole, strongly suggest that the only expert evidence that would have been relevant would be evidence relating to equipment malfunction. [51] In these circumstances, it would be inappropriate to hold the appellant responsible for the failure to press the issue of operator error, or to refuse relief because he did not do so. [52] In the result, it is my respectful opinion that the trial judge’s comments compromised trial fairness, thereby resulting in an error of law within the meaning of s. 686(1)(a)(ii) of the Criminal Code. The appeal is accordingly granted on this ground. [56] However, this is not a case where the alleged Charter breach was first raised on appeal. In the result, the appeal should be allowed on this ground as well.

As such, the fact that the learned trial judge committed an error of law in relation to the test to be applied in determining whether the appellant had care and control after the appellant stopped did not result in a substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice.

The Court of Appeal allowed the appeal from the bench and, rather than ordering a fourth trial, to stay the proceedings. HELD: The appeal was granted and a new trial ordered.

Further, and although the learned trial judge initially referred to the fact that the appellant could prove either equipment malfunction or operator error, his comments, taken as a whole, strongly suggest that the only expert evidence that would have been relevant would be evidence relating to equipment malfunction. [51] In these circumstances, it would be inappropriate to hold the appellant responsible for the failure to press the issue of operator error, or to refuse relief because he did not do so. [52] In the result, it is my respectful opinion that the trial judge’s comments compromised trial fairness, thereby resulting in an error of law within the meaning of s. 686(1)(a)(ii) of the Criminal Code. The appeal is accordingly granted on this ground. [56] However, this is not a case where the alleged Charter breach was first raised on appeal. In the result, the appeal should be allowed on this ground as well.

Further, given that he did so less than two hours before the administration of the Intoxilyzer test, the Crown was entitled to rely on the presumptions in s. 258(1)(c) of the Criminal Code to prove that the appellant’s blood alcohol level was the same at the time of the offence as that disclosed by the breath tests. As such, the fact that the learned trial judge committed an error of law in relation to the test to be applied in determining whether the appellant had care and control after the appellant stopped did not result in a substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice. Rather, it is quite clear, based on the evidence as a whole - including the appellant\'s admissions as to when he drove to the grid road - that the appellant had care and control, not more than approximately ten minutes before he was first approached by the police. The appeal on this ground is accordingly dismissed.",0.3768996960486322,"The appeal was allowed, and rather than order a new trial, the charge was stayed. The issues were decided as follows: 1) the trial judge was found to have applied the wrong test as to de facto care and control of the vehicle. The appeal on the first ground was dismissed, however, because the Crown could rely on the presumption in s. 258(1)(c); the accused had been driving 10 minutes before the stop and within two hours of the breath tests, so whether he was in de facto care and control at the time of the stop was irrelevant and did not result in a miscarriage of justice; 2) there was no evidence of the failure to observe the appellant while the breath tests were administered, nor was there a suggestion of the significance of the failure to do so, therefore, the appeal on that ground was dismissed; 3) the trial judge also addressed the issue of evidence if the 2008 amendments did not apply and the appellant was therefore not prejudiced in this regard. The appellant nonetheless argued that the trial judge erred in law by misapprehending evidence. The appeal court concluded that the trial judge did not err in law because his reasons did not disclose that he failed to consider relevant evidence relating to a material issue;  4) the Crown conceded that the 2008 amendments did not apply retroactively. The appeal court found that the trial judge was incorrect in giving a strong message to the unrepresented appellant that there was no point in tendering evidence on the accuracy of the Intoxilyzer results. The trial judge’s comments strongly suggested that the only expert evidence that would be relevant would be with respect to equipment malfunction and not operator error. The appeal was granted on this ground because the trial judge’s comments were found to compromise trial fairness resulting in an error of law; 5) the s. 9 Charter breach was not raised by the appellant at trial but it was raised in his brief following trial, and therefore the appeal court found that the trial judge was obliged to decide whether or not to consider the issue. The appeal was also allowed on this ground because the trial judge did not comply with his duty to consider the issue and the appeal court could not determine whether the failure to give reasons resulted in a miscarriage of justice; and 6) there was no issue of trial fairness. The appeal court concluded that there would be prejudice to the integrity of the justice system that would be manifested if the appellant had a fourth trial. Nine and a half years passed since the offence date and the facts of the case were less serious than some drinking and driving cases. Also, there was no other remedy available to remedy the wrong. The balancing of interests also led the court to conclude that this was one of those clearest of cases calling for a stay of proceedings.","The appellant was convicted of having care and control of a motor vehicle while his blood alcohol content exceeded 80 milligrams of alcohol in 100 millilitres of blood, contrary to s. 253(b) of the Criminal Code. He appealed his conviction, arguing that the roadside demand had not been made forthwith and that whether or not the accused had consumed beer within fifteen minutes of taking the roadside test was pure speculation. The trial judge found that the appellant rebutted the presumption in s. 258(1)(c)(iv) that the person who occupies the driver’s seat is deemed to have care or control of the vehicle. He found that even if he was wrong in concluding that the accused did not provide evidence to the contrary so as to rebut the presumption of accuracy, he had no reasonable doubt as to the guilt of the accused. The Court of Appeal allowed the appeal from the bench and, rather than ordering a fourth trial, to stay the proceedings. HELD: The appeal was granted and a new trial ordered. The court found that, in the circumstances of the case, the appellant did not establish an abuse of process as a result of the fact there were three trials. The only thing the accused added to his viva voce evidence was the addition of the emergency brake, which would have to be released prior to the vehicle moving. This did not alter the fact that his vehicle was capable of almost immediate movement and as such, created the risk the section is designed to prevent.","He has appealed that conviction pursuant to s. 813 of the Criminal Code. The readings achieved on both the roadside instrument and the subsequent Intoxilyzer readings simply could have not been obtained by the consumption of one or two beer while stopped at the roadside in the manner the accused described.

Further, given that he did so less than two hours before the administration of the Intoxilyzer test, the Crown was entitled to rely on the presumptions in s. 258(1)(c) of the Criminal Code to prove that the appellant’s blood alcohol level was the same at the time of the offence as that disclosed by the breath tests.

5_2007skca90.txt,"These appeals concern a referendum on the question of whether the University of Saskatchewan Student's Union should join the Canadian Federation of Students (the Federation). The referendum was held in the fall of 2005. A majority of the students voted in favour of joining the Federation. The respondent Robin Mowat then applied to the Court of Queen's Bench pursuant to The Non-profit Corporations Act (the Act) and obtained an order declaring the referendum to be of no force or effect. The Federation and the Student's Union now seek to overturn that order. They argue that Mowat had no standing to bring his application and that the Chambers judge erred in his application of the relevant statutory provisions. HELD: The appeals must be dismissed. 1) The respondent is a 'proper person' to bring the application pursuant s. 222(d) of the Act. He was attending the University and very actively involved on campus and the referendum campaign. Over 44% of the students voted against joining the Federation. The Act gives the right to make an application to a complainant, not to a complainant who speaks for a significant portion of the members of a corporation. The fact that the respondent's application was argued a few months after the respondent had convocated should not defeat his right to bring his concerns forward. An individual's status as a student is inevitably temporary. There is no justice in denying the respondent's standing only because the process for reviewing the referendum results played out so slowly that he was unable to bring the matter before a court prior to the date of his convocation.  2) The Controverted election cases are not applicable in the circumstances of this case. Section 225 of the Act creates and delimits a statutory remedy for particular kinds of corporate conduct. The assessment of an application pursuant to s. 225 of the Act must be measured against the concepts of oppression, unfair prejudice and unfair disregard as provided in that section. Administrative law concepts should be imported into that analysis only with considerable care and only for the purpose of giving meaning to the statutory terms found in the section itself. 3) The critical point is that the Council abandoned a formal process which had been put in place specifically to address the very significant concerns raised by the respondent and other about the referendum. Whether that turn of events was somehow inevitable is not the real issue. Rather, the essence of this case is the unfairness and prejudice the Council's decision involved for those who had opposed joining the Federation. It is unnecessary to look more closely at the specific problems that arose in relation to the referendum process. The decision of the Student's Union to override the decision of the Elections Board was itself something that warranted the granting of relief pursuant to s. 225 of the Act.","The students' union applied to the Court of Queen's Bench pursuant to The Non-profit Corporations Act and obtained an order declaring the referendum to be of no force or effect.

The referendum was held in the fall of 2005. A majority of the students voted in favour of joining the Federation. The respondent Robin Mowat then applied to the Court of Queen's Bench pursuant to The Non-profit Corporations Act (the Act) and obtained an order declaring the referendum to be of no force or effect. The Federation and the Student's Union now seek to overturn that order. They argue that Mowat had no standing to bring his application and that the Chambers judge erred in his application of the relevant statutory provisions. HELD: The appeals must be dismissed. 1) The respondent is a 'proper person' to bring the application pursuant s. 222(d) of the Act. He was attending the University and very actively involved on campus and the referendum campaign. Over 44% of the students voted against joining the Federation. The Act gives the right to make an application to a complainant, not to a complainant who speaks for a significant portion of the members of a corporation. The fact that the respondent's application was argued a few months after the respondent had convocated should not defeat his right to bring his concerns forward. An individual's status as a student is inevitably temporary. There is no justice in denying the respondent's standing only because the process for reviewing the referendum results played out so slowly that he was unable to bring the matter before a court prior to the date of his convocation.  2) The Controverted election cases are not applicable in the circumstances of this case. Section 225 of the Act creates and delimits a statutory remedy for particular kinds of corporate conduct. The assessment of an application pursuant to s. 225 of the Act must be measured against the concepts of oppression, unfair prejudice and unfair disregard as provided in that section. Administrative law concepts should be imported into that analysis only with considerable care and only for the purpose of giving meaning to the statutory terms found in the section itself. 3) The critical point is that the Council abandoned a formal process which had been put in place specifically to address the very significant concerns raised by the respondent and other about the referendum.

The Board decided that the appellant purchased the documentation independent of the valves and were subject to tax under ss.5(9) unless exempted under ss.8(1)(f).

The definition adopted does give rise to the artificiality noted earlier i.e. determining whether technical papers are produced, distributed or available to a sufficiently broad audience. The appeal is allowed.  2)The board determined that the word ""published"" was intended to speak to purpose and not the extent of the audience. There was no absence of evidence such that the Board could not reasonably reach the conclusion which it did. 3)If, as it was determined, the purchaser did not pay tax on what is referred to as 'Documentation charges', was it exempted from tax on an appeal of this nature?","This is an appeal by Husky Oil Operations Ltd.
(""Husky"") from a decision of the Board of Revenue
Commissioners of Saskatchewan (the ""Board""). To focus upon the extent to
which technical papers are directed at a public audience so as
to determine their taxability makes no sense and is at odds
with the very proposition that technical papers can be exempt
from tax. In conclusion, the appeal is allowed and the decision
of the Board reversed.",0.2849872773536895,"The respondent, under the provisions of the Education and Health Tax Act and the Department of Revenue and Financial Services Act, conducted an audit resulting in the assessment of sales tax in the amount of $37,842.07. Husky appealed the Board's decision which upheld the assessment. HELD: The appeal was allowed and the decision of the Board reversed. 1)The Board's finding that the Appellant fails to meet the requirements of s. 8(1)(f) of the Act and is therefore not entitled to claim an exemption. The broad interpretation eliminates this anomaly. 2)The evidence before the Board was more consistent with documentation charges being part of the purchase of the valves and one cannot avoid the tax consequence by allocating the price to alleged components or by separately invoicing various charges. 3)On an appeal the facts are deemed to have been conclusively established by the findings of the board unless made on evidence which does not warrant that finding.",0.4378478664192949,4_1996canlii6841.txt,Husky Oil appealed the decision by the Board of Revenue Commissioners which held Husky liable to pay tax on documentation charges. At issue was the interpretation by the Board of the word 'published' as used in ss.5(1)(b) of eg. 1 when defining the word 'books' and whether the drawings were exempt from tax. HELD: The appeal was allowed and the decision of the Board reversed. 2)There was evidence which could support either interpretation of the facts. To focus upon the extent to which technical papers are directed at a public audience so as to determine their taxability makes no sense and is at odds with the proposition that technical papers can be exempt from tax.  5)Having determined that the word published is intended to speak to purpose and not to extent of the audience it was not necessary to comment upon the definition adopted by the Board.

e_2004skqb372.txt,"This is an appeal by the City of Regina (the City) and Canadian Union of Public Employees Local 21 (CUPE) from a decision of the Tribunal under The Saskatchewan Human Rights Code (the Code) in the matter of complaints filed by the respondent against the City and CUPE. It became clear that the main issues on the appeal were the duty to accommodate and the alleged resignation of the respondent. The respondent filed a complaint under Part II of the Code alleging that CUPE and the City discriminated against him on the basis of his disability. The Commission substantiated this allegation before the Tribunal by showing there was a discriminatory impact on the respondent as a result of the seniority system established by the collective agreements in force from time to time between the City and CUPE. The Tribunal found that all of the efforts made in response to the respondent did not deal directly and effectively with his claim that the seniority standards in the collective agreement were discriminatory towards him on the basis of his disability. The Tribunal agreed with the Commission that their efforts were too little too late to reverse the systemic discrimination. The accommodations did not meet the duty to accommodate short of undue hardship. The Tribunal found that the City and CUPE contravened s. 16 and s. 18(1) of the Code by discriminating against the respondent on the basis of his disability. HELD: The appeals by the City and CUPE on liability are dismissed. The parties were allowed to refer the issue of damages to the Tribunal. 1) The superior expertise of human rights tribunal is confined to fact finding and decision making in the context of human rights and therefore reasonableness is the test for judicial review. If the issue is one of law, the standard of review is one of correctness. In other words, the appropriate standard of review by superior court of factual determination is whether the decision is patently unreasonable. Where human rights commission is required to interpret laws of general application, the correctness test applies. 2) The Court agreed with the Commission that the seniority system prevented a person such as the respondent from ever getting a permanent position, without accommodation, by giving priority to all those who could work more hours or gain permanent status by being flexible enough to work at the wide range of positions that the City had to offer. The respondent could not take advantage of this reward system because he could only bid into truck driver positions. The City and CUPE were too late in developing the plan. The plan was conceived in early 1999 to be executed when the respondent reached the top of the seniority list, probably in about 2000. But by this time, he was unable to work. 3) The characterization of the order of the Tribunal is not to direct the respondent be given a permanent position despite the seniority rights of others. It is to give him the benefits he would have had if his seniority had accrued in a non-discriminatory manner. 4) Whether CUPE had knowledge of the problem is irrelevant. The breach occurs as soon as there is discrimination. The City and CUPE are jointly responsible where a collective bargaining agreement that they negotiated is discriminatory. 5) For either the City or CUPE to avoid liability they must discharge their duty to accommodate up to the point of undue hardship. 6) The Tribunal's finding that there was no undue hardship is supported by the evidence. There are approximately 1,400 casual and permanent positions. Moving the respondent up the seniority list would have relegated certain union members in a large bargaining unit by one, which is insignificant. If this occurred, although the respondent would obtain the next permanent position, this would not be in disregard of the rights of other employees. Neither the City nor CUPE presented any evidence that would establish that a retroactive adjustment itself would create an undue hardship in the context that it would cause the seniority list to become unmanageable or ambiguous. It is not without significance that even if the membership of CUPE opposed the placing of the respondent into a permanent position, this by itself does not justify a finding of undue hardship. 7) The mandate of the Tribunal, once a finding of discrimination is made, is to determine what losses are caused by the discriminatory conduct. The Tribunal found that the respondent's resignation was one effect of the discrimination. The Court found there was no merit to this ground of appeal.","HELD: The appeal was dismissed. The tribunal found that the City was not prejudiced by the considerable time that has elapsed since the complaint took place; the tribunal also found that it was not responsible for the discrimination against the applicant. The applicant had been a casual employee for 16 years and had been employed by the City for 15 years.

F. LePage, sitting as a Tribunal (the “Tribunal”) under The Saskatchewan Human Rights Code, S.S. 1979, c. S-24.1 (the “Code”), in the matter of complaints filed by Gary Wayne Kivela (“Mr. Kivela”), against his employer the City. [6] Mr. Kivela filed a complaint under Part II of the Code, alleging that CUPE discriminated against him on the basis of his disability. The Commission substantiated this allegation before the Tribunal by showing that there was a discriminatory impact on Mr. Kivela as a result of the seniority system established by the collective agreements in force from time to time between the City and CUPE. While not disregarding the efforts of the Respondents going to great lengths to accommodate Mr. Kivela, I agree with the Human Rights Commission that their efforts of accommodation were “too little, too late” to reverse the systemic discrimination experienced by Mr. Kivela over the years. 117. In conclusion I find that the City of Regina and the Canadian Union of Public Employees, Local 21 contravened sections 16 and 18(1) of the Code by discriminating against the complainant Mr. Kivela on the basis of his disability. [61] I agree with the Commission that in effect, the seniority system prevented a person such a Mr. Kivela from ever getting a permanent position, without accommodation, by giving priority to all those who could work more hours or gain permanent status by being flexible enough to work at the wide range of positions that the City had to offer. [64] Here, the characterization of the order of the Tribunal is not to direct that Mr. Kivela be given a permanent position despite the seniority rights of others. It is to give Mr. Kivela the benefits he would have had if his seniority had accrued in a non‑discriminatory manner. I agree with counsel for the Commission that whether CUPE did or did not have knowledge is irrelevant. The employer and CUPE are jointly responsible where a collective bargaining agreement that they negotiated is discriminatory. [71] Here the Tribunal’s finding that there was no undue hardship is supported by the evidence. Moving Mr. Kivela up the seniority list would have relegated certain union members in a large bargaining unit by one, which is insignificant. Neither the City nor CUPE presented any evidence that would establish that a retroactive adjustment itself would create an undue hardship in the context that it would cause the seniority list to become unmanageable or ambiguous. It is not without significance that even if the membership of CUPE opposed the placing of Mr. Kivela into a permanent position, this by itself, does not justify a finding of undue hardship. The mandate of the Tribunal once a finding of discrimination is made is to determine what losses are caused by the discriminatory conduct. I therefore will permit the parties, if they cannot settle the quantum of damages, to refer that issue to the Tribunal. CONCLUSION [83] For all the above reasons, the appeals by the City and CUPE on liability are therefore dismissed.",0.3989501312335958,"This was an appeal by the City of Regina and Canadian Union of Public Employees (CUPE) from a decision dated October 10, 2003, of Roger J.

It became clear that the main issues on the appeal were the duty to accommodate and the alleged resignation of the respondent. The respondent filed a complaint under Part II of the Code alleging that CUPE and the City discriminated against him on the basis of his disability. The Commission substantiated this allegation before the Tribunal by showing there was a discriminatory impact on the respondent as a result of the seniority system established by the collective agreements in force from time to time between the City and CUPE. The Tribunal found that all of the efforts made in response to the respondent did not deal directly and effectively with his claim that the seniority standards in the collective agreement were discriminatory towards him on the basis of his disability. The Tribunal agreed with the Commission that their efforts were too little too late to reverse the systemic discrimination. The Tribunal found that the City and CUPE contravened s. 16 and s. 18(1) of the Code by discriminating against the respondent on the basis of his disability. HELD: The appeals by the City and CUPE on liability are dismissed. The parties were allowed to refer the issue of damages to the Tribunal. 2) The Court agreed with the Commission that the seniority system prevented a person such as the respondent from ever getting a permanent position, without accommodation, by giving priority to all those who could work more hours or gain permanent status by being flexible enough to work at the wide range of positions that the City had to offer. The respondent could not take advantage of this reward system because he could only bid into truck driver positions. 3) The characterization of the order of the Tribunal is not to direct the respondent be given a permanent position despite the seniority rights of others. It is to give him the benefits he would have had if his seniority had accrued in a non-discriminatory manner. 4) Whether CUPE had knowledge of the problem is irrelevant. The breach occurs as soon as there is discrimination. The City and CUPE are jointly responsible where a collective bargaining agreement that they negotiated is discriminatory. 6) The Tribunal's finding that there was no undue hardship is supported by the evidence. Moving the respondent up the seniority list would have relegated certain union members in a large bargaining unit by one, which is insignificant. Neither the City nor CUPE presented any evidence that would establish that a retroactive adjustment itself would create an undue hardship in the context that it would cause the seniority list to become unmanageable or ambiguous. It is not without significance that even if the membership of CUPE opposed the placing of the respondent into a permanent position, this by itself does not justify a finding of undue hardship. 7) The mandate of the Tribunal, once a finding of discrimination is made, is to determine what losses are caused by the discriminatory conduct. The Tribunal found that the respondent's resignation was one effect of the discrimination. The Court found there was no merit to this ground of appeal."

There was no correspondence between the parties confirming the terms of the agreement. It was agreed that the discussions concerned the fact that Standard was not solvent at that date and that Hyndman entered an arrangement with Standard to operate under Hyndman's authority; Hyndman would make payments but would not agree to having the leases assigned to them. In issue was for how long the lease payments were to continue and on what conditions. HELD: The action against Hyndman was dismissed with taxable costs.

The defendant had an obligation to the plaintiff, Redhead, either in contract or equity for the lease payments on the vehicles and for the repairs to them for the period from September 1, 1993, until February 11, 1994. The actions taken by both the defendant and the plaintiff were taken for the benefit of Standard in an attempt to keep it operational. It would be unjust not to make an award. 5)The defendant was prepared to assume a risk to the arrangement because of Standard's insolvency and that Redhead might not be paid on its trucking contracts.  6)The Court was clear from Cox's notes and Duda's evidence at trial that it was understood by the parties that the obligation to make the lease payment would be contingent on Standard's ability to make money on its trucks. 7)The evidence of Cox and on review of the documents themselves was not conclusive. 8)The court was clear in Cox's evidence that he did not know how the repairs had been authorized. 9)The defendants were not liable for any liability.",0.6351183063511832,3_1999skqb140.txt,"An action for payments owing on vehicles leased by Standard from Redhead and for parts and labour supplied by Redhead to the leased vehicles. At issue was whether Hyndman had an obligation in contract or equity for the lease payments and repairs from September 1993 until February 1994 based on discussions in 1993. HELD: The action against Hyndman was dismissed with taxable costs. Judgment was entered against Standard for $63,267.49 for the outstanding lease payments and parts and service account plus pre-judgment interest calculated from March 1994 to the date of judgment pursuant to the Pre-judgment Interest Act. 1)Redhead's claim against Hyndman was dismissed as there was no contractual relationship between the companies respecting the lease payments. Any verbal arrangement was never verified. It was clear that Hyndman refused to assume the obligations on the leases; that Redhead knew of the risk because of Standard's insolvency and was prepared to take that risk. 2)The facts did not establish appropriate circumstances for an award based on either quantum meruit or unjust enrichment.  3)The claim against Hyndman for unpaid repairs was not proven. Hyndman did make some payments on behalf of Standard for repairs although there was no specific contract to do so.  It was not established that the accounts were forwarded, that Hyndman had notice of the unpaid invoices or issued a purchase order number authorizing the repairs. Hyndman gave notice to Redhead that they would not be obligated for repairs without a purchase order number."

e_2006skqb446.txt,"The respondent father is part of farming partnership with two brothers and two cousins running mixed grain and cattle operation. Division of the matrimonial property is at issue. The issues include what amounts, if any, are to be added to the sources of income set out in the father's total income in his T1 General form to come to the appropriate level of income for the purpose of calculating child maintenance payments. HELD: 1) The father's income has fluctuated significantly in the last years, and the inherent nature of farming is such that it is more appropriate in the circumstances to this operation to use year average. 2) Non-arm's length salary will be added back into income unless the father established that payments were necessary and reasonable. In 2004 the amount of salary paid to the mother for bookkeeping was $5,000. It would appear that the $15,000 paid in 2003 was means of splitting income. $5,000 appears to be reasonable amount. 3) Some of the personal expenses claimed as farm expenses such as electricity, home heat, telephone, meals and office expenses should be added back to income. The father has added back portion of these expenses based on certain percentages being allocated to personal use. It has not been established that more amounts need to be added back. 4) The majority of the capital cost allowance on personal property owned by the father relates to his motor vehicle. He states the personal use of his truck is 10%. The full amount claimed for capital cost allowance is not necessary for the replacement of the vehicle. This along with significant personal use of the vehicle makes it reasonable to add back 50% of the capital cost allowance claimed in each of the years in question. 5) The mother has asked that the Court add back to the father's personal income the amounts claimed in the partnership and then allocated to the individual partners. The father's income tax return includes personal farm component which consists of much smaller income and expense statement on matters that are totally within his control and for which all benefits accrue to him. His tax return also includes the partnership statement which shows the same types of income and expenses but on partnership basis. There are five partners involved, two are his brothers and the other two are his cousins. There is no evidence to suggest that the income statements of the partnership are fashioned in such way to reflect an inaccurate picture on cash basis of the operation of the farm partnership. There is nothing to suggest that the partnership is organizing its expenses or distribution to artificially lower the income of the father. This is not situation where the father is the sole shareholder in corporation. This is not situation in which there is majority ownership in the partnership which would allow the father to control the activities of income distribution or asset purchase. There is nothing in the Guidelines to suggest that the Court should be adding back any of the partnership amounts to the income of the father automatically. There is nothing in the evidence that would lead the Court to the conclusion capital cost allowance being claimed by partnership is inappropriate or indeed that any of the expenses or accounting functions used by the partnership do not reflect the partnership business over the long term. The Court was not prepared to add back to the income of the father the personal expenses claimed in partnership returns as farm expenses, capital cost allowance on real property or personal property owned by the partnership. 6) The total income averaged over 3 years comes to $29,983 each year. Child maintenance shall be paid on that amount.","The parties met, married, made children and then separated. The petitioner mother has custody of the three children. She is employed with a local auctioneer. The respondent father, before, during and after the relationship, is part of a farming partnership with two brothers and two cousins. They have not settled a division of matrimonial property. Issues [1] What amounts, if any, are to be added to the father's total income to come to the appropriate level of income for the purpose of calculating child maintenance? HELD: The Court found that in 2003, 2004 and 2005 the income of the father was $29,983. In 2003, the total amount of child maintenance was $5,000. In 2004, the father had been making the maintenance payments as ordered. In 2005, the majority of the claim by the father in this regard relates to his motor vehicle. He acknowledges portion of the vehicle is used for personal use and states that portion to be 10 percent. The mother says that the portions claimed as personal use should be 50 percent. Evidence was led that the father used the vehicle to efficiently combine personal and business use whenever he could. In looking at the last three years in total, the truck cost was listed at $23,283 with depreciation taken of $18,855 to date. The father testified that he intends to use the truck for a further significant period of time. The full amount claimed for capital cost allowance is not necessary for the replacement. This along with significant personal use makes it reasonable to add back 50% of the capital cost of allowance claimed in each of the years in question which will result in an addition to income in 2003 of $2,882; in 2004, $3,829; in 2005, $1,733; and in 2006, $4,733. The Court awarded the petitioner mother $24,300. The parties have approached this case on the basis that the most representative and fairest method of determining this self-employed father's income is a three-year average under s. 17 of the Federal Child Support Guidelines. The analysis here is substantially different than that contained in the father’s personal farming statement. Each party achieved partial success in their approach to the issue of maintenance. The case law which focuses on the reasonableness of the expense as it relates to capital cost and alleged personal expenses claimed on partnership returns acknowledges that these are legitimate expenses used to reduce income unless it is shown that they are unnecessary or unreasonable.","(a) The respondent’s income is determined to be $29,983, and he shall pay to the petitioner for the support of Reidar Knudson, born December 18, 1998, and Bronwyn Knudson and Kadence Knudson, both born August 9, 2000, the sum of $568.00 per month commencing October 1, 2005, and continuing every month thereafter until a child is no longer a child within the meaning of the Divorce Act, R.S.C. 1985, c. 3 (2nd Supp.), provided that if he has overpaid child maintenance to this date, he may offset the overpayment against future maintenance payments but only to the extent of $50.00 per month so that the maintenance actually paid will not drop below $518.00 per month until the overpayment has been extinguished.",0.223826714801444,"The respondent father is part of farming partnership with two brothers and two cousins running mixed grain and cattle operation.

1996canlii7150.txt,"FIAT. The defendant had been held in contempt of court orders requiring that he account to the plaintiff for her trust funds. The issue here was responsibility for the legal costs incurred by the plaintiff to compel production. Her solicitor/client bill exceeded $50,000 including very large disbursements as a trustee was appointed to preserve the property and the defendant solicitor's files were seized. An accountant then prepared what amounted to a forensic audit.HELD: The court was able to withdraw from further intervention. Additional information could be obtained through the normal discovery process.  1)The contempt was not as blatant as first appeared. Part of his failure to produce documentation arose from the sorry state of his records and proper identification of assets was due in part to production orders against third parties. 2)The defendant solicitor ought to pay the solicitor/client costs because he caused the expense of pre-trial production by his stalling tactics. However the appropriate route in the circumstances was to leave costs to the trial judge.

The parties were married in 1960 and separated in 1989. They had two children, aged 18 and 19 years of age. At the conclusion of the hearing and oral argument, the parties agreed that there was no possibility of reconciliation with a permanent breakdown of the marriage as evidenced by the fact that the parties had been living separate and apart for at least one year prior to the hearing.

8_2008nssc358.txt,"The corollary relief judgment provided that the parties would share parenting of their two children approximately equally. Child support would be based on the difference between what each party would otherwise have paid if the shared custody arrangement had not been in effect. The wife now applied to have the amount paid by the husband increased due to his increase in income and a decline in her income. Following the divorce, the wife had opened her own business which only produced negligible income and in each of the past four years, she had withdrawn between $10,000 and $14,000 from her RRSP, which amounts she argued should be not considered when calculating her contribution to the children's support. She also sought to have the court go back to when the parties first separated to have the husband pay any deficiency which the court might find. The husband requested that the court impute income to the wife on the basis that she was intentionally underemployed by continuing to operate a business that failed to produce a reasonable level of income. Application granted in part; monthly amount of child support payable by the husband is increased based on his increased income; the wife's RRSP income was considered in the calculation of child support as it had been a recurring income figure over the past four years; no income imputed to the wife but if she could not draw a reasonable level of income from the business within the next year, it would be open to the court to reconsider this issue. Given that the previous variation order was a consent order and both parties had legal counsel at the time and had not appealed that order, the court was not prepared to retroactively vary its terms.","The parties were married in 1993 and had two children, aged 12 and 7.

Section 27 does not give the minister the power to revoke when a person contravenes The Fisheries Regulations. The Crown has conceded that Kevin Callele is not a member of the Executive Council. [26] In conclusion, I find that there was no prohibition order in effect within the meaning of section 27 of The Fisheries Act. Counts 1, 2 and 3 are dismissed.",0.4600760456273765,"At the close of the Crown's case, defence brought a Charter application challenging the constitutionality of s. 35 of The Fisheries Act, alleging it breaches s. 11(d) and s. 13 of the Charter. HELD: There was no prohibition order in effect within the meaning of the Fisheries Act. Counts 1, 2, 3 and 4 were dismissed. 1)There was no evidence that the accused had the authority under s. 27 of the Act to revoke his licence or to prohibit him from applying for or obtaining a licence at the relevant times. 2)The accused did possess a fishing licence, valid on its face. He acted in compliance with that licence. The issue was whether a person named Kevin Callele had the power to revoke, that power could not be delegated to the accused pursuant to s. 23(2) of The Interpretation Act. 3)The prohibition was not valid on the face of it as being without authority.",0.4276985743380855,2010skpc153.txt,"The accused was charged with angling without a license, applying for a license when prohibited and possessing fish without a license contrary to various sections of The Fisheries Act and The Fisheries Regulations. The issue for the trial judge was whether there was a valid ministerial order revoking the accused's license and prohibiting him from applying for or obtaining a fishing license. HELD: Section 27 of The Fisheries Act (Saskatchewan) does not give the minister the power to revoke the a license when a person contravenes the The Fisheries Regulations. Further, the Acting Executive Director, Fish and Wildlife Branch is not a member of Executive Council as required by the definition of 'Minister' in the Act. The letter was signed by an unknown person who clearly did not meet the definition of 'Minister.' Finally, the letter was not served on the accused personally or via registered mail. There was no prohibition order in effect within the meaning of section 27 of The Fisheries Act. The accused was acquitted of all three counts."

b_2009skca133.txt,"The issues on appeal are whether the parties' children, who were over the age of 18, had withdrawn from the father's charge and were no longer children of the marriage within the meaning of the Divorce Act and therefore disentitled to maintenance after September 2006 when they attended post-secondary education and whether the maintenance paid in the past by the father was sufficient and appropriate. HELD: Appeal allowed. The trial judge made no palpable and overriding error in his finding that the father was not in arrears of maintenance and that there would be no order for retroactive child support. Nevertheless, the trial judge was in error in determining that the children were no longer children of the marriage within the meaning of the Act. The matter is remitted to the trial judge to determine the extent to which the father is obligated to pay maintenance for the children after September 2006.  1) The father and daughters did not have a conventional relationship. The father separated from the mother and daughters early and, since he lived in Hong Kong, could only have a long-distance relationship. The relationship deteriorated in 2006. It would be accurate to describe the daughters as treating their father with disdain. However, this does not necessarily mean that the daughters had withdrawn from the relationship with the father unilaterally. The father could have stayed in contact with the daughters despite the litigation and their failure to provide him with academic records. The father's efforts to contact the daughters were no greater than the daughters' to contact him. The father recognized the financial dependency of the daughters. Their dependency did not end because of the lack of communication. 2) The trial judge placed too much emphasis on the daughters' poor treatment and disdain of the father. His finding that the daughters did not wish to maintain a meaningful relationship with the father misapprehends the evidence respecting the historical and ongoing nature of their relationship. The fact that the emphasis of the relationship after 2003 shifted does not imply that they had no meaningful relationship in their own way. The proper conclusion to be drawn from all the evidence of the relationship before September 2006 and the relative silence after that time is that father and daughters were fighting and this mutual fight was prolonged and sustained by the litigation and the intervention of the mother. This does not mean that they had withdrawn from the relationship with him unilaterally.

The plaintiff did not provide a sufficient evidentiary foundation to establish estoppel by convention as it did not tender the invoices that were paid. Even if such evidence had been led, there was no convincing evidence of detrimental reliance as the plaintiff presented no evidence that it would have turned to alternative and more lucrative work.","Reliable Truck Trailer Inc. is a mobile vehicle and equipment repair company situated in Pense, Saskatchewan. In the summer of 2015 it entered into an oral agreement with Super Save, Inc., hereafter referred to as 'Super Save', in which it agreed to provide, on a 'call out' basis, repair services for Super Save's fleet of trucks and associated equipment. When required, it would also provide shop supplies, parts, and services on a number of occasions. During the relationship, the defendant paid the plaintiff's invoices as they were presented, but ceased to pay them as they became due. Reliable was not prepared to accept the lesser amount and it now brings this action to recover the amount that it says is due. HELD: 1) The plaintiff received some but not nearly all of the money that was sought but not entirely. The defendant has been successful in reducing the amount of money that it sought. The plaintiff asks that this Court grant it out of pocket expenses that it incurred in having to retain an expert to give evidence on the issue of a fair and reasonable price to be paid for goods and services. The amount sought was unreasonable. 2) The defendant properly pointed out that this trial had to be adjourned on one occasion because the plaintiff had not adequately prepared and that it had, therefore, incurred the cost of having his expert attend not once but twice. 3) There was no evidence as to how long the supposed 'convention' of paying these assorted costs occurred. The parties were in general agreement that parts which would cost a significant amount would not be purchased by the plaintiff unless it had first discussed the matter with the defendant. It was only in November of 2015 that the defendants felt that they were being charged too much.

e_2008skca94.txt,"This appeal was brought on a narrow ground from a judgment in the Court of Queen's Bench granting variation of a child support order pursuant to s. 17(1) of the Divorce Act. The appeal challenged the chambers judge's interpretation and application of s. 7(1.1) of the Federal Child Support Guidelines, which defines the term 'extraordinary expenses.' The appellant argued that the chambers judge erred in ordering the appellant to contribute proportionately to the costs associated with the children's extracurricular activities without finding that these were 'extraordinary expenses' within the meaning of the Guidelines. The appellant argued these expenses were ordinary and not extraordinary within the meaning of s. 7(1)(d) and (f) and s. 7(1.1) of the Guidelines. It was the appellant's position that these expenses were covered by the basic child support order which the respondent received tax free, in addition to the appellant's responsibility for 73% of the children's health care and day care expenses. HELD: Appeal dismissed with costs to the respondent. Per Hunter J.A. (Gerwing J.A. concurring): All the information needed to determine the s. 7(1)(f) expenses eligible for proportionate sharing was before the Chambers judge: he knew the total income of the recipient spouse; he knew the previous extracurricular activities and the 11 current extracurricular activities that the children participated in, along with the estimated annual cost. Updated financial statements were filed by both the appellant and respondent. The Chambers judge exercised his discretion and granted an order requiring the appellant to pay his proportionate share (73%) of the extracurricular activities he listed, which is approximately one-half of the children's extracurricular activities. Accordingly, he did not make a palpable and overriding error, nor did he err in law, and his conclusion is supported by the evidence before him on this application. There is no basis to interfere with the decision of the Chambers judge. Per Smith J.A. (in dissent): Significant deference must be given by this Court to the chambers judge in relation to child support orders. This is particularly so to the extent that such orders involve the exercise of discretion. In this case the trial judge erred in law in failing to consider and apply the definition of 'special or extraordinary expenses' in s. 7(1.1) of the Guidelines. First, it is impossible without some evidence, explanation or explicit finding, to understand why even the total of all the children's extracurricular activities would be considered 'extraordinary' in the statutory sense, given the level of child support ordered and the respondent's annual income. There was simply no evidence to support such conclusion. Second, the order did not, in fact, come close to ordering that the appellant pay proportion of half the activities, since it excluded the cost of music lessons for the two older children. In addition, it included the cost of Tae Kwon Do for which there was no evidence at all. In short, such an interpretation lacks any rational basis. Third, it is clear that, up until the argument on the appeal, the parties themselves had interpreted the order more generally, as an order that the appellant pay proportion of all the children's extra-curricular activities. This interpretation certainly makes more sense, for the alternative would require variation in the order, or new agreement, every time the children changed or added activities. It is unlikely that the chambers judge would have confined his order so specifically, absent, of course, an agreement of the parties, or reasonable finding that specific activity constituted an extraordinary expense. The chambers judge erred in failing to consider the definition of extraordinary expenses in s. 7(1.1), or this Court's decision in Ryba v. Schoenroth, and acted without any evidence that the expenses in question constituted extraordinary expenses within the meaning of the Guidelines. Accordingly, the appeal is allowed and the order of the chambers judge that the appellant pay proportion of the children's extracurricular activities is set aside. The appellant should have the costs of the appeal.","HELD: The appeal was dismissed. The chambers judge did not make a palpable and overriding error nor did he err in law and his conclusion was supported by the evidence before him. The parties were parents of three children, ages 8, 9 and 10. The respondent requested an increase in the basic child support payment, including retroactive child support, and determination of the eligible expenses and proportionate share of s.7 expenses. The appellant argued that the chambers judge erred in failing to take into account the total costs of the children's extracurricular activities, which were ordinary expenses and thus included in the table amount fixed by s.3(1)(a) of the Guidelines.","Disposition: Appeal dismissed

The appeal challenged the chambers judge's interpretation and application of s. 7(1.1) of the Federal Child Support Guidelines, which defines the term 'extraordinary expenses.' The appellant argued that the chambers judge erred in ordering the appellant to contribute proportionately to the costs associated with the children's extracurricular activities without finding that these were 'extraordinary expenses' within the meaning of the Guidelines. The appellant argued these expenses were ordinary and not extraordinary within the meaning of s. 7(1)(d) and (f) and s. 7(1.1) of the Guidelines. It was the appellant's position that these expenses were covered by the basic child support order which the respondent received tax free, in addition to the appellant's responsibility for 73% of the children's health care and day care expenses. HELD: Appeal dismissed with costs to the respondent. Per Hunter J.A. (Gerwing J.A. concurring): All the information needed to determine the s. 7(1)(f) expenses eligible for proportionate sharing was before the Chambers judge: he knew the total income of the recipient spouse; he knew the previous extracurricular activities and the 11 current extracurricular activities that the children participated in, along with the estimated annual cost. Updated financial statements were filed by both the appellant and respondent. The Chambers judge exercised his discretion and granted an order requiring the appellant to pay his proportionate share (73%) of the extracurricular activities he listed, which is approximately one-half of the children's extracurricular activities. Accordingly, he did not make a palpable and overriding error, nor did he err in law, and his conclusion is supported by the evidence before him on this application. There is no basis to interfere with the decision of the Chambers judge. Per Smith J.A. (in dissent): Significant deference must be given by this Court to the chambers judge in relation to child support orders. This is particularly so to the extent that such orders involve the exercise of discretion. In this case the trial judge erred in law in failing to consider and apply the definition of 'special or extraordinary expenses' in s. 7(1.1) of the Guidelines. First, it is impossible without some evidence, explanation or explicit finding, to understand why even the total of all the children's extracurricular activities would be considered 'extraordinary' in the statutory sense, given the level of child support ordered and the respondent's annual income. There was simply no evidence to support such conclusion. Second, the order did not, in fact, come close to ordering that the appellant pay proportion of half the activities, since it excluded the cost of music lessons for the two older children. In addition, it included the cost of Tae Kwon Do for which there was no evidence at all. In short, such an interpretation lacks any rational basis. Third, it is clear that, up until the argument on the appeal, the parties themselves had interpreted the order more generally, as an order that the appellant pay proportion of all the children's extra-curricular activities. This interpretation certainly makes more sense, for the alternative would require variation in the order, or new agreement, every time the children changed or added activities. It is unlikely that the chambers judge would have confined his order so specifically, absent, of course, an agreement of the parties, or reasonable finding that specific activity constituted an extraordinary expense. The chambers judge erred in failing to consider the definition of extraordinary expenses in s. 7(1.1), or this Court's decision in Ryba v. Schoenroth, and acted without any evidence that the expenses in question constituted extraordinary expenses within the meaning of the Guidelines. Accordingly, the appeal is allowed and the order of the chambers judge that the appellant pay proportion of the children's extracurricular activities is set aside.

The Court found that he found that approximately one-half (i.e., six) of all the children’s activities were “extraordinary,” and that they were covered by the basic child support order of $2,532 per year, which the respondent received tax free.","Disposition: Appeal dismissed

The judge therefore declined to order the accused, who had been convicted for a repeat offence, to comply for life. 2)Nothing in the Code suggests the lifetime duration of the order rests on the offender being sentenced separately for each offence.","Disposition: Allowed (Orally) [1] The Crown’s appeal from the sentencing judge’s order under s. 490.012(1) of the Criminal Code, which directed Leo Harris Burns to comply with the Sex Offender Information Registration Act (“SOIRA”) for 20 years, is allowed.

6_2009nssc387.txt,"The divorcing parties disagreed about whether the wife's son from a previous relationship (now 13) was a 'child of the marriage.' While they lived together for seven years and had one child together, they were married for less than a year. The wife alleged the husband had stood in the place of a parent to the child. She claimed this was evidenced by the fact that: he started acting like a dad before the parties lived together (when the child was two); he was involved in things like medical appointments and school activities; the child's biological father only recently became involved; and they had discussed adoption early in the relationship. The evidence showed the decision to allow the child's biological father to assume an increasing role in his life was made solely by the wife. The child no longer had contact with the husband. The child is not a 'child of the marriage.' The husband did not stand in the place of a parent to him. He was a big part of the child's life but his role was mostly incidental to the relationship with the wife and a normal part of living with a child. The marriage was short and the father's parenting role was diminished before the marriage (by the mother's choice to allow the biological father back into the child's life, and the parties' failure to pursue the idea of adoption that was raised early on). Applying the Supreme Court's decision in Cook (2000), the threshold for finding parental status is high and reserved for cases where a person can clearly be shown to have assumed a parental role in substantial substitution for the biological parent. Such is not the case here.","The parties married in 2001 and separated less than one year later. They have a child, Ella, born April 3, 2004.

5_2002skqb378.txt,"All of the parties agreed on February 4, 2002 that the mother and grandmother would have joint custody of the 4 year old. The father was granted reasonable access on reasonable notice. The issue of child support was adjourned sine die with an order that the father provide copies of his income tax returns for the past 3 years. Issues were whether child support should be retroactive; s.7 expenses; costs. HELD: 1)The father was to pay ongoing monthly child support of $293 for so long as the child remains a child within the meaning of the Family Maintenance Act. 2)He was to pay retroactive child support of $1,500 in monthly installments of $100. There must be some justification for retroactive support orders. This Court followed the approach taken by BC Court of Appeal in L.S. v. E.P., which set out the factors a court should consider in granting retroactive child support. He should have paid $335 in 2000; $324 in 2001; $293 in 2002. It was not clear why the petitioner did not seek financial disclosure through the Court. 3)The father was to pay his 59% share of the costs of the music program, gymnastics, swimming and craft camp within 10 days of receiving receipts. There was no prior spending pattern for the court to consider, as the child had no independent needs and was only 3 months old when the parents separated. While illness can qualify as a legitimate reason for requiring child care, the illness must relate to the child's custodian, not to a third party. The preschool expense was reasonable in relation to the total means of the three parties. The $20 kindergarten enrollment expense did not qualify as extraordinary. Retroactive s.7 expenses were not warranted. 4)There was no order for costs as results were mixed.","HELD: The Court found that the child support order was not retroactive to August 2000 and that retroactive support should be fixed at $1,500.

2009nsca44.txt,"The municipality appealed the trial court's decision to summarily strike their claim against the province, pursuant to R14.25 of the Civil Procedure Rules (1972). At trial, the municipality argued s. 36 of the Constitution Act compels the province to take appropriate steps to alleviate regional disparities. Arguing this is an enforceable obligation that was breached by the province, the municipality sought a declaration from the court to that effect. The municipality's arguments on appeal focused on the justiciability of s. 36. The province concentrated on the fact the judge had dismissed based on deficiencies in the pleadings, calling the municipality's claim too vague to succeed. Appeal dismissed. The effective standard of review is correctness - whether the judge erred in law by striking the claim. The appeal court carefully framed the issues, and examined s. 36 (its intent, and application). Rule 14.25 is a drastic remedy, and the trial judge was aware the province had a high threshold to meet in order to have the claim struck. While s. 36 might be justiciable, it does not provide an enforceable right to municipalities. Rather, it embodies an agreement among federal and provincial governments, and only those parties who were privy to the agreement can act to have it enforced.

The court struck the claim as disclosing no reasonable cause of action. HELD: The respondent appealed the decision to strike the claim. The Court held that, without a challenge to legislation, the Municipality does not create a justiciable issue by referring in the claim to s.36 of the Constitution Act, when the commitments set out in that section do not alter the Legislature's right to exercise legislative authority. A general attack on “government” action, alleging that the Nova Scotia regime is constitutionally deficient, is too vague a basis for a court to determine under s.52 of the Act that law “is inconsistent with the provisions” and “of no force or effect.” The court also held that the respondent’s proposed interpretation of s. 36 of the Charter could not be struck summarily because it was not plain and obvious that the claim would fail.","Result: Appeal dismissed. 2.

The province concentrated on the fact the judge had dismissed based on deficiencies in the pleadings, calling the municipality's claim too vague to succeed. Appeal dismissed. The effective standard of review is correctness - whether the judge erred in law by striking the claim. The appeal court carefully framed the issues, and examined s. 36 (its intent, and application). Rule 14.25 is a drastic remedy, and the trial judge was aware the province had a high threshold to meet in order to have the claim struck. While s. 36 might be justiciable, it does not provide an enforceable right to municipalities. Rather, it embodies an agreement among federal and provincial governments, and only those parties who were privy to the agreement can act to have it enforced. On this basis, the municipality's claim had no chance of success and the trial judge was correct to dismiss it.","The applicant municipality appealed its decision to strike its claim under Civil Procedure Rule 14.25(1)(a) of the Constitution Act, 1982, arguing that the federal government had breached its obligation to provide equalization funds to the province. The applicant municipality sought a declaration that the province had breached s. 36 of the Act. The court struck the claim as disclosing no reasonable cause of action. HELD: Appeal and cross-appeal dismissed. 1)The court found that the respondent municipality's pleadings disclosed a reasonable cause. The Court found that pursuant to Civil Procedure rule 14.24 the respondent's proposed interpretation of s.36 was not justiciable. 2)The respondent municipality was not in breach of its constitutional commitments. 3)The Court held that, in the context of this appeal, the Court of Appeal should not be hesitant to strike such claims. 4)The issue for the Chambers judge was whether pursuant to the Civil Procedure Rules s.14.25, the appellant municipality's plea did not disclose any reasonable cause for action. It concluded that they did not. 5)The appeal was therefore a generalized expression of dissatisfaction respecting the province's failure to take appropriate steps to alleviate this disparity.","Result: Appeal dismissed. 2. The commitment set out in s. 36 embodies an agreement among the provinces and the federal government following a comprehensive negotiation process. Held: Appeal and cross-appeal dismissed per reasons for judgment of MacDonald, C.J.N.S.; [2] For reasons that I will develop, I would dismiss this appeal. Accordingly, the Order granting the Province’s motion to strike the proceeding will provide that, if an appeal from that decision is allowed, this Court will retain jurisdiction to decide whether the claim should be converted to an action.  The issue for the Chambers judge was whether, pursuant to Civil Procedure Rule 14.25, CBRM\'s pleadings disclosed a reasonable cause of action. Finally, as I have already acknowledged, s. 36 might be justiciable in certain circumstances. [80] Thus, when it comes to legislative intent, it appears that s. 36 represents a legislative compromise with commitments by and for only the negotiating parties - namely the federal government and the provinces. It offers no support for the concept of a commitment to municipalities. In an appropriate context, s. 36 might represent a justiciable commitment, but only among the federal and provincial governments who were privy to the agreement that is represented by s. 36. [87] The Chambers judge committed no error of law because it remains ""plain and obvious"" that these pleadings disclose no reasonable cause of action.

e_2017skqb380.txt,"HELD: 1) The court ordered joint custody and continued primary residence with the wife and specified access to the husband. The child’s interests were best served by a parenting regime that preserved the stability the wife provided as his primary caregiver, while expanding the periods of uninterrupted time with his father. It was best that the parties interact minimally with each other. The mother was generally contemptuous of the husband’s role as parent and sometimes restricted or denied the child’s access with him. There was no credible evidence that the child was suicidal as the mother alleged, nor did any evidence support her allegations of physical or sexual abuse. Rather, evidence confirmed that the child was smart, sometimes sensitive, but generally happy. 2) The husband had professional corporation. His income was determined from his line 150 income, as adjusted to reflect the actual dividend income he received. His income should not be augmented by dividend income equal to his corporation’s net earnings. Only current pre-tax earnings are truly surplus to corporation’s needs, without exposing it to encroachment on its capital or undermining its viability. The relevance of the wife’s income was limited to the apportionment of s. expenses. It was not appropriate to impute income to her. She was intentionally underemployed, but her decision was justified initially by the needs of her son and more recently by her own reasonable educational needs and the obligation to become qualified to practice medicine in Canada. Retroactive child support was not appropriate, except in respect of the two-month period when the wife was overseas, the husband was caring for their child and he admittedly neglected to pay child support in accordance with court order. There was considerable evidence upon which to conclude that a retroactive award would place an undue hardship upon the husband as, pursuant to the terms of this judgment, he was obliged to assume significant family debt, provide a considerable equalization payment and pay increased child and spousal support. 3) The husband retained the family home and sole responsibility for the mortgage thereon. The court ordered him to pay one half of the equity in the home to the wife. Otherwise, the parties were to retain all other items of family property in their respective possession and be solely responsible for any indebtedness in their respective names. The Family Property Act does not mandate the apportionment of debt, equal or otherwise, save to the extent that fairness requires an unequal division of family property to reflect the parties’ respective obligations. The court’s discretion to equalize the parties’ debt by an uneven division did not extend to the family home. 4) The wife was entitled to compensatory and non-compensatory spousal support. The disparity in their incomes was directly attributable to her role in the marriage and their mutual efforts to advance his career. The wife’s income consisted almost entirely of spousal support. However, the high amount of debt assumed by the husband coupled with his limited means for satisfying this judgment, warranted a departure from the range of outcomes suggested by the Spousal Support Advisory Guidelines. Given the genuine and material uncertainty as to the wife’s future need and extent to which she will achieve self-sufficiency, an indefinite award reviewable on the earlier of a date approximately one year from the trial date or the wife becoming qualified to practice medicine was appropriate. The court declined to impute income to the wife or to order retroactive spousal support. 5) Judgment for divorce was granted, with judgment to take effect on the conclusion of the appeal period.","HELD: The Court found the petitioner's Federal Child Support Guidelines income to be slightly in excess of $245,000 and directed that he pay interim child support in the amount of $1,949.00 and interim spousal and child support of $5,250.00 per month.

No such agreement exists in this case, and my interim order of August 7, 2014, while providing for interim parenting, did nothing to displace that presumption. [300] The evidence confirms that D.K. is a smart, sometimes sensitive but generally happy child. [304] In assessing the veracity of her claims, I note the respondent acknowledged, under cross-examination, that she had also previously accused the petitioner of threatening her and of sexually assaulting D.K., although she never made a formal complaint. [309] While I accept that the respondent has been D.K.’s primary and psychological parent throughout his life, I am equally satisfied on the evidence that she is generally contemptuous of the petitioner’s role as a parent and she has, except when it has suited her needs, restricted or in some instances, completely denied D.K.’s right to enjoy reasonable access with the petitioner. [310] In the circumstances, I am satisfied that D.K.’s interests will be best served by a parenting regime that preserves the stability the respondent has traditionally provided as his primary caregiver, while expanding the periods of uninterrupted time he enjoys with the petitioner. [343] Finally, there is considerable evidence upon which to conclude that a retroactive award would work an undue hardship upon the petitioner. Pursuant to the terms of this judgment, he will be obliged to assume significant family debt, to provide the respondent with a considerable equalization payment in respect of her interest in the family home, and to pay increased child and spousal support. [344] Applying the D.B.S. factors holistically to the circumstances of this case, I am not satisfied that it is an appropriate instance in which to make a retroactive order, save and except for the two months period in which the petitioner admittedly refused or neglected to pay child support in accordance with the interim order of this Court. As such, the petitioner shall pay to the respondent, on account of retroactive child support, the sum of $3,898.00. As there was no evidence that these proceeds, or any portion thereof continued to exist or are otherwise traceable as of the date of application, they do not meet the definition of family property. The respondent is entitled to an equalization payment from the petitioner in the amount of $36,850.00, representing one half of the parties’ total equity therein of $73,700.00. [373] On the evidence before me, I have no hesitation in concluding that the respondent has established she is entitled to support on both a compensatory and non-compensatory basis. However, the unusually high amount of debt assumed by the petitioner, coupled with his limited means of satisfying such an award warrant a departure from the range of outcomes suggested by the SSAG. [393] There is at present in this case, a genuine and material uncertainty as to the respondent’s future need and the extent to which she will achieve some degree of self-sufficiency.

[304] In assessing the veracity of her claims, I note the respondent acknowledged, under cross-examination, that she had also previously accused the petitioner of threatening her and of sexually assaulting D.K., although she never made a formal complaint. [309] While I accept that the respondent has been D.K.’s primary and psychological parent throughout his life, I am equally satisfied on the evidence that she is generally contemptuous of the petitioner’s role as a parent and she has, except when it has suited her needs, restricted or in some instances, completely denied D.K.’s right to enjoy reasonable access with the petitioner. [310] In the circumstances, I am satisfied that D.K.’s interests will be best served by a parenting regime that preserves the stability the respondent has traditionally provided as his primary caregiver, while expanding the periods of uninterrupted time he enjoys with the petitioner. [343] Finally, there is considerable evidence upon which to conclude that a retroactive award would work an undue hardship upon the petitioner. Pursuant to the terms of this judgment, he will be obliged to assume significant family debt, to provide the respondent with a considerable equalization payment in respect of her interest in the family home, and to pay increased child and spousal support. [344] Applying the D.B.S. factors holistically to the circumstances of this case, I am not satisfied that it is an appropriate instance in which to make a retroactive order, save and except for the two months period in which the petitioner admittedly refused or neglected to pay child support in accordance with the interim order of this Court. As such, the petitioner shall pay to the respondent, on account of retroactive child support, the sum of $3,898.00. As there was no evidence that these proceeds, or any portion thereof continued to exist or are otherwise traceable as of the date of application, they do not meet the definition of family property. The respondent is entitled to an equalization payment from the petitioner in the amount of $36,850.00, representing one half of the parties’ total equity therein of $73,700.00. [373] On the evidence before me, I have no hesitation in concluding that the respondent has established she is entitled to support on both a compensatory and non-compensatory basis. However, the unusually high amount of debt assumed by the petitioner, coupled with his limited means of satisfying such an award warrant a departure from the range of outcomes suggested by the SSAG. [393] There is at present in this case, a genuine and material uncertainty as to the respondent’s future need and the extent to which she will achieve some degree of self-sufficiency. In the circumstances, I conclude that it is appropriate to make an indefinite award, which will be reviewable on the earlier of December 1, 2018, or the respondent becoming qualified to practice medicine. In all the circumstances, I decline to make any order with regard to retroactive spousal support. CONCLUSION [399] The parties shall continue to enjoy joint custody of their son D.K., born --------------------. The petitioner’s obligations in respect of retroactive child support are fixed at $3,898.00. [414] Commencing December 1, 2015 and on the first day of each and every month thereafter, the petitioner shall pay support for the respondent in the amount of $6,000.00, provided however that the said order shall be reviewable at the instance of either party upon the earlier of the respondent becoming qualified to practice medicine in Canada, or the 1st day of December 2018. Within 14 days thereafter, the petitioner shall pay to the respondent the sum of $36,850.00, representing her interest in the equity therein.",0.1329856584093872,"HELD: The Court granted the respondent interim primary residence and an equal division of family home and property. The Court found the petitioner's Federal Child Support Guidelines income to be slightly in excess of $245,000 and directed that he pay interim child support for D.K. in the amount of $1,949.00 and interim spousal and child support of $5,250.00 per month.",0.1422222222222222,e_2017skqb380.txt,"HELD: 1) The court ordered joint custody and continued primary residence with the wife and specified access to the husband. The child’s interests were best served by a parenting regime that preserved the stability the wife provided as his primary caregiver, while expanding the periods of uninterrupted time with his father. It was best that the parties interact minimally with each other. The mother was generally contemptuous of the husband’s role as parent and sometimes restricted or denied the child’s access with him. There was no credible evidence that the child was suicidal as the mother alleged, nor did any evidence support her allegations of physical or sexual abuse. Rather, evidence confirmed that the child was smart, sometimes sensitive, but generally happy. Retroactive child support was not appropriate, except in respect of the two-month period when the wife was overseas, the husband was caring for their child and he admittedly neglected to pay child support in accordance with court order. There was considerable evidence upon which to conclude that a retroactive award would place an undue hardship upon the husband as, pursuant to the terms of this judgment, he was obliged to assume significant family debt, provide a considerable equalization payment and pay increased child and spousal support. 3) The husband retained the family home and sole responsibility for the mortgage thereon. The court ordered him to pay one half of the equity in the home to the wife. Otherwise, the parties were to retain all other items of family property in their respective possession and be solely responsible for any indebtedness in their respective names. The Family Property Act does not mandate the apportionment of debt, equal or otherwise, save to the extent that fairness requires an unequal division of family property to reflect the parties’ respective obligations. The court’s discretion to equalize the parties’ debt by an uneven division did not extend to the family home. 4) The wife was entitled to compensatory and non-compensatory spousal support. The disparity in their incomes was directly attributable to her role in the marriage and their mutual efforts to advance his career. The wife’s income consisted almost entirely of spousal support. However, the high amount of debt assumed by the husband coupled with his limited means for satisfying this judgment, warranted a departure from the range of outcomes suggested by the Spousal Support Advisory Guidelines. Given the genuine and material uncertainty as to the wife’s future need and extent to which she will achieve self-sufficiency, an indefinite award reviewable on the earlier of a date approximately one year from the trial date or the wife becoming qualified to practice medicine was appropriate. The court declined to impute income to the wife or to order retroactive spousal support. 5) Judgment for divorce was granted, with judgment to take effect on the conclusion of the appeal period."

7_2005skca97.txt,"This case concerns the fixture financing provisions of The Personal Property Security Act, 1993 (PPSA). The respondent claims damages from the appellant Credit Union. The claim arises from the Credit Union's delay in removing a Quonset in which the Credit Union held a security interest. The trial judge found in favour of the respondent and awarded damages on the basis that the Credit Union became a tenant at sufferance of the respondent when it failed to remove the Quonset and therefore was obliged to pay rent. The issue is whether the PPSA precludes a claim by a land owner against a financer arising from the financer's failure to remove a fixture within a commercially reasonable time after giving notice of its intentions in that regard. HELD: Appeal allowed. Cross appeal dismissed. In light of the causes of action pled and the evidence brought forward, the respondent's claim against the Credit Union cannot succeed.  1) Section 36 of the PPSA may speak exhaustively to the relative priorities of financers and land owners in fixtures. It does not necessarily speak in that way to the full range of rights and claims that those parties might have against each other. There is no principled basis on which a person with an interest in land should be denied meaningful relief when a financer, without excuse, acts in a commercially unreasonable manner by failing or refusing to remove a fixture after giving formal notice of its intention to do so. 2) It would have been improper for the respondent to deny permission to remove the building unless the Credit Union paid an amount in respect of the property taxes attributable to it. Allowing a person with an interest in land to oblige financers to pay property taxes before realizing on their security would amount to a substantial realignment of the careful balance between the rights of fixture financers and holders of property interest reflected in s. 36 of the PPSA. 3) The Credit Union could not have been either a tenant at sufferance or a tenant at will of the respondent for the fundamental reason that there was no landlord and tenant relationship between them. The respondent's claims in this regard fail. 4) The respondent has failed to present evidence that would allow this Court to quantify the benefit conferred on the Credit Union and to provide appropriate relief. As a consequence, no effect can be given to the unjust enrichment argument. 5) In light of the conclusion that there was no tenancy at sufferance or tenancy at will, the cross-appeal fails.","This case concerns the fixture financing provisions of The Personal Property Security Act, 1993. The respondent Gari Holdings Ltd. claims damages from the appellant Langham Credit Union Ltd. The claim arises from the claim arising from the Credit Union's delay in removing from Gari's land a quonset in which the financer held a security interest. The trial judge found in favour of Gari and awarded damages on the basis that it became a tenant at sufferance and was obliged to pay rent. HELD: The appeal was allowed. 1)The PPSA does not operate to preclude the claims advanced by Gari in this case. It is consistent with the regime established pursuant to it. Section 36 provides only that a person with an interest in land may refuse permission to remove goods until he or she has received adequate security for reimbursement of damages caused by their removal. The plaintiff has established that while the building was a fixture on the property prior to it being constructed, it had changed its position as of September 1, 1999. That payment was made in order to avoid tax enforcement proceedings by the Town of Prince Albert Land Titles Office. 2)The trial judge's award effectively disregards the priority provisions of s. 36 and substitutes a new remedy for the rights expressly set out in ss. 36(9) to (16). The Credit Union took the position that it would have been improper for Gari to deny permission to allow the removal of the building unless the credit Union paid an amount in respect of the property taxes. 3)Gari's claims in this regard must fail.","Disposition: Appeal allowed Cross-Appeal dismissed [1] This case concerns the fixture financing provisions of The Personal Property Security Act, 1993, S.S. 1993, c.

[2] In order to resolve this appeal it is necessary to consider whether the PPSA precludes a claim by a land owner against a financer arising from the financer\'s failure to remove a fixture within a commercially reasonable time after giving notice of its intentions in that regard. At the end of December 2000, it applied for an order that removal of the Building be postponed until the Credit Union paid (a) $3,500 as security for reimbursement for possible removal damage; (b) rent of $500 per month from April 1999 through to the date the Building was removed, and (c) $2,818.04 of municipal property taxes for the period April 1999 to December 31, 2000. With respect to the Applicant’s claim for occupation rent and reimbursement of taxes paid over the past year, this portion of the application is dismissed.

Therefore, evidence of the results of the analyses so made is, pursuant to s. 258(1)(c) of the Criminal Code, conclusive proof that the concentration of alcohol in Mr. Knoedler’s blood both at the time when the analyses were made and at the time when the offence was alleged to have been committed was the lowest of the concentrations determined by the analyses, which was 100 milligrams in 100 millilitres of blood. [37] In the circumstances, I allow the Crown’s appeal, set aside the verdict of acquittal on the charge of operating a motor vehicle while over .08 and enter a verdict of guilty with respect to the offence of operating a motor vehicle while over .08 under s. 253(b) and 255(1) of the Criminal Code, being Count No. 1 on Information No. 24312600.",0.3647604327666152,"The Crown appealed the respondent's acquittal on a charge of driving over .08.

During trial, the defence gave verbal notice of a Charter issue but did not elect to seek a voir dire or called any evidence in support of the Charter application and did not call any witnesses for the defence. HELD: The Crown's appeal was granted and a verdict of guilty to driving over .08 was entered. The Court elected to impose sentence and remained seized with the matter. The trial judge failed to consider the totality of the circumstances in determining whether the officer had reasonable and probable grounds to make a breath demand.

HELD: The appeal is dismissed. 1) The learned trial judge failed to consider the contradictory evidence available to the police officer in forming the objective grounds for the demand sufficient to require additional objective information, such as an objective and subjective component. The existence of reasonable and probable grounds entails neither an objective or subjective component and the issue was not pursued at the hearing of this appeal.  2) The trial judge erred in attempting to balance the observations of the officer which tended to indicate that the accused was impaired by juxtaposing them against other observations which would indicate normalcy. The officer made no note of improper driving when she first observed the pickup truck, nor when she pursued it and it pulled over to stop.

Knoedler (“Mr. Knoedler”) on June 4, 2009, in Provincial Court on a charge that on or about October 27, 2007, at Esterhazy District , in the Province of Saskatchewan, having consumed alcohol in such quantity that the concentration thereof in his blood exceeded eighty milligrams of alcohol in one hundred millilitres of blood, he did operate a motor vehicle, contrary to s. 253(b) and s. 255(1) of the Criminal Code and on a charge that on the same date and at the same place, while his ability to operate a motor vehicle was impaired by alcohol, he did operate a motor vehicle, contrary to s. 253(a) and s. 255 of the Criminal Code. In the circumstances, the appeal against the acquittal on the charge of impaired driving is dismissed and this appeal will proceed on the basis that the Crown seeks to overturn the acquittal on the charge of driving while over .08.

Lockyer had reasonable and probable grounds to make the breath demand. [30] With respect, I am of the view that the learned trial judge erred in finding that Cst.

[47] When I consider the evidence of the lay witnesses and the evidence of Constable Zildjan, if it had been admissible, I find that up to the time of the motor vehicle collision the headlights were in operation on the plaintiff Hawes’ motor vehicle. [59] In conclusion, even if I found the witness qualified to express an opinion on the condition of the lamps prior to the accident, his evidence is not probative and lacks consistency to the point where I could not accept his opinion. I would award $12,000 general damages with interest thereon at the rate of 2.5 percent thereon for five years. I would reduce damages by 20 per cent. She should also recover from the defendants general non-pecuniary damages of $12,000.00 with prejudgment interest thereon at the rate of 2.5% annually in accordance with the decision of the Nova Scotia Court of Appeal in Bush v. Air Canada (supra) for a period of five years which I find was a reasonable time to bring the matter to trial. [97] The plaintiff, Aulden Pottie, shall recover from the defendants $20,000.00 representing 80% of the non-pecuniary award of $25,000.00 and prejudgment interest thereon at the rate of 2.5% annually for five years. [98] Mr. Pottie shall also recover from the defendants loss of earning capacity of $9600.00 representing 80% of the $12,000.00 previously assessed. The defendants will recover 20% of their costs in one bill from the plaintiff, Aulden Pottie.",0.5288326300984529,"The plaintiffs were in a motor vehicle accident. The defendant was operating a police vehicle at the time of the accident. At the time, the plaintiffs were living in common law relationship and they had spent the evening hours visiting various bars and pubs in celebration of birthdays of relatives. The plaintiffs were travelling at a high rate of speed when they were struck by the defendant's police vehicle, which was stationary at the intersection. The defendants claimed the headlights were not in operation when it approached the intersection and that the plaintiff was contributory negligent for driving at 2:00 a.m. The plaintiff was driving directly through the intersection on a green light and the police vehicle was approaching the intersection when it turned, without signal light in operation, in front of the plaintiff's vehicle. HELD: The plaintiffs claim the defendant was not qualified to express an opinion.  1) The evidence of the lay witnesses convinced me he was in the field in which it is sought to have the witness’ opinion. 2) The Court found that up to the time the motor vehicle collision was occurring, the defendant’s headlights were in operation on the plaintiff vehicle and the plaintiffs’ vehicle was burned out. 3) There was not presented evidence which established the officer was capable of expressing his opinion in his own capacity. 4) The court found that the exhibits were in “near perfect condition” which would be sufficient for an opinion in this case. 5) There were no issues with the destruction of the exhibits. There was no evidence that the witness was not present when the accident occurred.",0.5179856115107913,d_2006nssc26.txt,"The two plaintiffs were injured when the defendant police officer made a left hand turn in front of their motor vehicle at night. Although the plaintiff driver was proceeding through a green light, the defendant alleged that her vehicle's headlights were not in operation. General damages awarded to the plaintiff driver in the amount of $12,000; general damages awarded to the second plaintiff in the amount of $25,000 (reduced by 25% due to that plaintiff's failure to wear a seat belt). The court found that even if the second plaintiff's tendonitis was not caused by the accident, it was definitely aggravated by it. The headlights were in operation on the plaintiff's vehicle at the time of the collision; evidence was not presented which established that the defendant's expert was qualified to express the opinion he gave in his testimony as to the state of the headlights and even if he was qualified to express an opinion on the condition of the lights prior to the accident, his evidence was not probative and lacked consistency; it conflicted with the clear evidence advanced by persons at the scene prior to and at the time of the impact."
2_1999skqb76.txt,"Division of matrimonial property and the matrimonial home were in issue. The respondent claimed exemption for his own house and all of the assets he had before the marriage which lasted 21 months. HELD: The petitioner was awarded $1,945 plus costs of $5,000. The respondent's claim was inequitable in its entirety. 1)Saskatchewan precedents suggest that neither a marriage of short duration nor prior ownership of a home or inheritance or gifts by one side of the family constituted extraordinary circumstances. However, prior ownership by the petitioner and its occupancy by her children, the economic imbalance between the spouses and the brevity of the marriage combined to make this an 'extraordinary' case. The home was to remain in the petitioner's name. It was the long term family home of the petitioner and her 10 children born of a previous marriage. Five of those children still lived with her in the home. The respondent had a permanent job, the prospect of an inheritance, a pension and his own home with no mortgage. 2)Credit was given to the respondent for half of the debts assumed. One-half of the accrual to his pension and his two life insurance contracts was credited to the petitioner less a 30% deduction for income tax. The respondent's house, jointly owned with his mother, was exempt property.","HELD: The Court awarded the petitioner $1,945.00 plus an award of costs of $5,000.00. The Court directed that the matrimonial home be divided equally. The petitioner argued that the prior ownership of the home by the parties, which they never lived in, must be distributed equally unless am satisfied that it would be unfair and inequitable to do so having regard only to any extraordinary circumstance; or unfair to the spouse who has custody of the children. The court cautioned that the children in this context refers to children of this marriage and not to the five or ten holdovers from Sharon's first marriage.","It was, prior to the 21 month marriage between the parties, the long term family home of Sharon Lang and her 10 children all born of a previous marriage. [7] Edward Lang is employed by the public school system and has a permanent job.

I am persuaded however, that the prior ownership of the home by Sharon and its occupancy by her many children, the economic imbalance between Edward and Sharon and the brevity of the marriage combine to make this an out of the ordinary or unusual case. The matrimonial home will therefore not be distributed but allowed to remain in Sharon’s name as it was for many years before she met Edward. There is also: (1) an accrual to Edward’s pension during the period between the marriage and the application date of May 21, 1998 valued at $8,358.00; (2) an accrual to his Standard Life contract during the same period in the amount of $1,200.00.

9_1998canlii13836.txt,"The accused who had plead guilty to a charge of dangerous driving causing death sought a conditional sentence to be served in the community. Various witnesses gave conflicting accounts of the driving leading up to the accident and the accident itself. Two vehicles driving at a high rate of speed, one in the left lane and one in the right hand curb lane passed vehicles stopped at a cross walk, the later striking and killing a pedestrian. The vehicles had been observed pulling around other vehicles whenever possible and 'jousting' with each other. HELD: A sentence of 90 days to be served intermittently in a provincial correctional centre was imposed. Conditions of probation included restraint from the consumption of alcohol and non-prescription drugs for 24 hours prior to attendance at the centre. An 18 month probation order required him to perform 200 hours of community service and to enroll in a defensive driving course. He was prohibited from operating a motor vehicle for three years and was to pay a surcharge of $250.  1)The Saskatchewan Court of Appeal had not to date considered the question of whether it was appropriate that a sentence of imprisonment be served in the community where the offence is that of dangerous driving causing death. It has consistently endorsed sentences of incarceration for the offence of impaired driving causing death. Alternatives to incarceration were rejected as not adequately reflecting the gravity of the offence and as not serving to deter either the offender or the general public from committing like offences. 2)The driver's lack of attention together with excessive speed caused the accident. Alcohol was not involved. He stopped to render assistance whereas the driver of the second car which had been racing with him left the scene of the accident immediately. Principles of general and specific deterrence, rehabilitation, denunciation, protection of the public and maintenance of public confidence in the administration of justice were to be considered. 3)Specific deterence had to be emphasized in view of the driver's subsequent convictions for two speeding offences. The accused had six speeding convictions. He had a minor youth record involving mischief.","The accused was 19 years of age at the time of the accident and had just passed a pedestrian crossing the street. He was driving a light colored Audi that passed him at a high rate of speed. The pedestrian was thrown from the vehicle. The accused was charged with dangerous driving causing death. HELD: The Court of Appeal held that a sentence in the low end of the range is one which should be imposed and that such a sentence should be served inthe community rather than in a corrections facility.  1)The accused had consumed significant quantity of alcohol and was in no shape to drive vehicle. His actions were clearly inappropriate and imprudent and his failure to monitor and perceive the situation in front of him resulted in tragic consequences. For whatever reason, he failed to exercise his right to be free from alcohol and drugs and drove at speed in excess of 60 km/hr.  2)The court found that incarceration should be limited to 18 months and that under the circumstances of this offence a conditional sentence would not be appropriate.","The accused, Chad J.

There is clear severability between the threshold issue of liability and the consequential issue of damages in the plaintiffs' action.

The issues in this litigation are such that delay in full disclosure of material pertaining to damages makes little difference. Both parties know the profitability of the SR&ED consulting business. The risks that must be weighed in considering settlement pertain to liability. Those risks have not changed by granting the defendants their application. 3)In Saskatchewan, authority to sever the issues at trial is founded on the Court of Queen”s Bench inherent jurisdiction.

They ask that disclosure, discoveries and the trial ought to proceed to determine whether the defendants are liable to the plaintiffs and to what extent. Then, if liability is found, disclosure, discoveries and the trial should proceed to assess damages. The defendant also seeks an order pursuant to Rule 173 of the Queen's Bench Rules striking a paragraph of the plaintiff's claim. HELD: 1) Authority to sever trials in Saskatchewan is founded on the Court's inherent jurisdiction. Laing C.J.Q.B. reviewed the discretion available to the Court in Chaban v. Kramer Ltd., 2008 SKQB 27. Upon considering the factors in Chaban, it must be concluded that the defendants' application has merit. There is clear severability between the threshold issue of liability and the consequential issue of damages in the plaintiffs' action. The entitlement to sue for disgorgement of profits hinges on whether the defendant, as the plaintiff's former employee, was in a position of a fiduciary. Disclosure pertaining to the defendants' ongoing business, financial affairs and clientele become relevant only upon a finding of liability. The Court may exercise its discretion only if the court can make a finding that the defendants will suffer severe prejudice if the issues of liability and damages are not bifurcated. Much of the defendants' client base results from a joint venture with a major accounting firm. This joint venture requires confidentiality. Disclosure of these relationships would jeopardize the defendants' obligation to maintain this confidence. Serious prejudice to the defendants in the instant case has been established. It is appropriate to exercise the Court's discretion in the defendants favour and grant the order severing the plaintiffs' claim against them. The application to sever the threshold issue of liability from damages only pertains to the plaintiffs' claim. The defendants' counterclaim against the plaintiffs and their two principals shall continue in the normal course. 2) The defendants' application to strike portions of the plaintiffs' statement of claim is dismissed. The paragraphs refer to Wolff being an applied science technologist and holding himself out as a person with a strong sense of ethics. The plaintiffs plead that the code of ethics for an applied science technologist provides that a person with such a designation will not 'use directly or indirectly an employer's or client's confidential information' in competition with the client and alleges that Wolff has breached the code of ethics. While Wolff may be subject to discipline by his governing body, that does not constitute a multiplicity of proceedings as defined by s. 29 of The Queen's Bench Act. The facts pled are material facts relevant to the plaintiff's claim of Wolff's breach of fiduciary duty and breach of contract.","FIAT: The defendants applied for an order severing the plaintiffs' claim between liability and damages. The plaintiffs alleged that Wolff, along with Sparks, set up a competing business through their corporation, Advance-Tek Consulting, to compete against the plaintiffs in the scientific research and experimental development (SR&ED) grants from the Canada Revenue Agency. Wolff was bound by a confidentiality and non-competition agreement with the defendants.

As a result, the last three sentences of para. 4 and Exhibit “A” to the petitioner’s affidavit of October 16, 2012 is struck and the Local Registrar is directed to remove Exhibit “A” from the court file. [8] The respondent brought a motion returnable October 19, 2012 claiming child and spousal support together with exclusive possession of the family home. The petitioner does not oppose the respondent remaining in the home on a time limited basis and suggests it should terminate June 27, 2013. There will be an order granting the respondent interim exclusive possession of the family home. Pursuant to s. 9(a) of the Guidelines, the petitioner shall pay child support to the respondent of $1,213.00 per month commencing September 1, 2012 and payable on the first of each month thereafter. [22] The petitioner shall pay to the respondent by way of interim spousal support the sum of $500.00 per month commencing September 1, 2012 and payable on the first of each month thereafter.",0.7590551181102362,"The parties attended a settlement meeting and reached an agreement on seven issues. The respondent filed a Notice of Objection to the petitioner's affidavit, including Exhibit A. The petitioner did not oppose the respondent remaining in the home on a time limited basis and suggested it should terminate June 27, 2013. HELD: 1) The respondent was to pay child support of $1,213 per month commencing September 1, 2012 and payable on the first of each month thereafter. 2) The parties did not reach agreement on all issues. There was no agreement that any agreements reached at the meeting could not be used in evidence. If the division of family property was not settled by June 27th, either party may seek to have the issue of continued possession reviewed upon 14 days notice. 3) The petitioner was to receive interim spousal support in the amount of $500.00 per month for the first two months and $400.00 for the third month. 4) The Court concluded from the material before it that while the parties may have reached agreement on a number of issues, they failed to reach an interim exclusive possession of the family home. The Court directed the Local Registrar to remove Exhibit A from the court file. 5) The court concluded that the policy considerations which underly settlement privilege and as identified in Tucker-Lester require that unless all of the issues have been resolved, privilege continues to extend to those issues where there may have been a consensus unless there is a clear understanding and agreement that once one of these issues is resolved it is off the table and considered to be settled irrespective of what may happen with respect to other issues that may exist as between the parties.",0.5360501567398119,7_2013skqb67.txt,"The respondent filed a Notice of Objection to the petitioner's affidavit regarding the meeting and the appended exhibit that was entitled: 'Minutes of the Meeting'. The petitioner stated that there was no agreement that what had been agreed upon in the meeting could not be used in evidence, although he acknowledged that not all outstanding issues were resolved in the meeting. The other issues before the Court were the custody of the children, the parenting arrangements and whether the petitioner should pay interim spousal and child support and in what amount. The respondent remained in the family home and sought an order for exclusive possession. The parties could not agree on who may claim the eligible dependant credit or AED for the children. HELD: The Court held that because the parties had not reached agreement on all of the issues, the settlement privilege extended to the agreement. Therefore, the exhibit and a number of sentences in the petitioner's affidavit were struck. The Court ordered a shared parenting arrangement and gave the respondent an order for exclusive possession of the family home until June 2013. The petitioner was ordered to pay $1,213 per month in child support and additional $186 per month to contribute to child care expenses and his proportional share of s. 7 expenses. The petitioner was ordered to pay interim spousal support in the amount of $500 per month. The Court reviewed the tax consequences to the parties, particularly in light of the shared parenting arrangement and noted that as the parties could not agree on who may claim the eligible dependant credit or AED for the children that that matter should be dealt with at the pre-trial conference."

Also at issue was whether a forensic accountant should have been permitted to testify as to the present value of the Plaintiff's future earning capacity. HELD: Appeal dismissed. 1)The forensic accountant's evidence was properly admitted as explanatory of the calculations done. The same calculations could have been done by a computer program or by counsel or the trial judge with the assistance of the tables to the Rules of Court. 2)The trial judge properly explained to the jury that the accountant was not testifying as an expert. 3)Given the nature of the accountant's evidence, no expert fees should be permitted to the Plaintiff for the accountant's report or attendance. 4)The Appellant's argument that the trial judge failed to properly direct the jury as to the weight to be given to the accountant's evidence was rejected. 5)The Court was unable to say that the jury's award for loss of future income was so inordinately high that it should be set aside and a new trial ordered. 6)The Plaintiff's cross-appeal relating to the disability benefits was also dismissed.","Following a jury trial of this action for damages for personal injuries and loss in an automobile collision, a judge awarded damages of $409,251.18 to the respondent.

e_2012skpc43.txt,"The accused was charged with impaired driving and driving over .08. He argued that the investigating officer did not have reasonable and probable grounds to make a breath demand pursuant to s. 254(3) of the Criminal Code resulting in the arbitrary detention of the accused. The accused argued the Certificate of Analysis should be excluded. The officer responded to complaint of possible impaired driver weaving on the roadway and onto the sidewalk. The officer located vehicle with the same licence plate number. He observed the vehicle weaving from right to left in its lane. The vehicle braked suddenly and made right turn from the left lane. The officer activated his emergency equipment. The vehicle pulled over quickly but lurched forward and stopped abruptly as the officer walked towards the vehicle. The accused had glossy eyes, slurred speech, poor muscular control, difficulty extracting his licence and displayed poor balance when walking to the police vehicle. The officer did not note smell of alcohol. HELD: In this case, there was no dispute that the officer's belief in reasonable and probable grounds was honestly held and subjectively valid. While the officer could have asked the accused if he had been drinking alcohol, the weight to be given to any response from the officer was subjective Ã» he was not required to accept what he was told. Although it is possible to speculate that the symptoms of impairment in this case were caused by some medical condition, there is no evidence of any other possible explanation for the egregious driving and physical condition of the accused. In the absence of any evidence suggesting an alternative explanation, it is reasonable to conclude that the most obvious case was impairment by alcohol. The driving pattern and physical symptoms of the accused paint a stereotypical portrait of a motorist impaired by alcohol. The absence of a smell of alcohol or any admission of consumption does not vitiate the probative value of the other indicia when considered in their totality. In the face of the manner of driving and very significant symptoms of impairment, it would be ludicrous to suggest that the officer could only have had a reasonable suspicion that the accused had alcohol in his body. The Court found that the officer had reasonable and probable grounds. No charter breach was established. The certificate was not excluded.","The accused was charged with operating a motor vehicle while his ability to do so was impaired by alcohol or drugs contrary to s. 255(1) and 253(1)(a) of the Criminal Code and with operating while his blood alcohol concentration exceeded 80 milligrams of alcohol in 100 millilitres of blood contrary to ss.255(1.3) and s.253(1(b)) of the Code. The accused asserts that he was arbitrarily detained as the officer did not have reasonable grounds to make a demand for a sample of his breath for analysis. HELD: The Court held that there was no breach of s.8 or s.9 of the Charter and the Certificate of Analysis was therefore admissible. The only issue to resolve was whether the officer reasonably could have only a mere suspicion that the accused had alcohol in his body. Based on the totality of the above evidence, the Court found that the demand for breath samples amounted to a warrantless search which is prima facie unreasonable. The Court also held that any potential violation of the accused's rights would fall toward the lower end of the spectrum.","BACKGROUND [1] On July 14, 2010, Mr. Palmer was charged with operating a motor vehicle while his ability to do so was impaired by alcohol or a drug contrary to ss. 255(1) and 253(1)(a) of the Criminal Code, and also with operating a motor vehicle after consuming alcohol in such a quantity that the concentration thereof in his blood exceeded 80 milligrams of alcohol in 100 millilitres of blood contrary to ss. 255(1) and 253(1)(b) of the Criminal Code. The accused asserts that he was arbitrarily detained as the officer did not have reasonable grounds to make a demand for a sample of his breath for analysis. Consequently, the grounds upon which the demand was based cannot be said to be objectively reasonable, the detention was arbitrary, the breath samples unlawfully seized and therefore, the evidence thus obtained should be excluded pursuant to s. 24(2) of the Charter. [21] Clearly, Constable Walz could have asked the accused if he had consumed alcohol, but the weight attached to any response would have been up to the officer; he is not required to accept what he was told and terminate an investigation in the face of a denial or explanation from the accused: [23] It is the view of this Court that the driving irregularities and the physical symptoms of the accused in this case paint a virtual stereotypic portrait of a motorist impaired by alcohol. In the face of the manner of driving demonstrated by the accused and the very significant symptoms of impairment, it would be ludicrous to suggest that the officer reasonably could have only a mere suspicion that the accused had alcohol in his body. On the whole of the observations and information in the possession of the officer, I find that he did have reasonable grounds to effect an arrest for impaired driving and that the grounds to make the demand are objectively sustainable. There is nothing in the evidence to suggest that the officer wilfully or recklessly disregarded the rights of the accused.",0.5772811918063315,"The accused was charged with impaired driving and driving over .08. He argued that the investigating officer did not have reasonable and probable grounds to make a breath demand pursuant to s. 254(3) of the Criminal Code resulting in the arbitrary detention of the accused. The accused argued the Certificate of Analysis should be excluded. The officer responded to complaint of possible impaired driver weaving on the roadway and onto the sidewalk. The officer located vehicle with the same licence plate number. He observed the vehicle weaving from right to left in its lane. The vehicle braked suddenly and made right turn from the left lane. The officer activated his emergency equipment. The vehicle pulled over quickly but lurched forward and stopped abruptly as the officer walked towards the vehicle. The accused had glossy eyes, slurred speech, poor muscular control, difficulty extracting his licence and displayed poor balance when walking to the police vehicle. The officer did not note smell of alcohol. HELD: In this case, there was no dispute that the officer's belief in reasonable and probable grounds was honestly held and subjectively valid. While the officer could have asked the accused if he had been drinking alcohol, the weight to be given to any response from the officer was subjective Ã» he was not required to accept what he was told. Although it is possible to speculate that the symptoms of impairment in this case were caused by some medical condition, there is no evidence of any other possible explanation for the egregious driving and physical condition of the accused. In the absence of any evidence suggesting an alternative explanation, it is reasonable to conclude that the most obvious case was impairment by alcohol.

The Director of Labour Standards ordered the employer to pay $1,500 in lieu of a proper notice of termination. The grounds raised were that the adjudicator erred in law in finding the respondent had not frustrated or fundamently breached her employment contract; the adjudicator exceeded his jurisdiction by holding the employer had an obligation to attempt to resolve the workplace difficulties that prohibited the respondent from reporting to work. The employee had been charged with stealing three pencils on her way through a store to the salon where she worked. The Crown subsequently withdrew the shoplifting charges. She was prohibited from returning that the store and as there was no alternate entrance to the salon the employer treated the contract as frustrated or breached, therefore releasing him of any obligation to pay wages in lieu of notice. HELD: The appeal was dismissed with costs. 1)The adjudicator concluded the employer failed to meet the thresholds stipulated in O'Connell which set out the six essential elements for determining whether events had frustrated an employment contract: a critical rather than a trivial supervening event; an event protracted in time; not within the contemplation of the parties; coming about without fault on either party; an event that rendered the parties incapable of performing their contractual obligations; the performance of a contract would radically alter the original agreement into something other than that intended.

The grounds relied on by the appellant gave rise to the following issues: (1) Did the adjud adjudicator err in law by finding that the respondent's conduct had not frustrated or materially breached her employment contract? (2) Whether the judge exceeded his jurisdiction by holding that Cajon, as the appellant's employer, had an obligation to attempt to resolve a situation of work difficulties that prevented her from reporting to work? (3) The adjudicator applied the appropriate principles of law to the facts, as hefound them. In addition, his findings of fact cannot be said to be 'patently unreasonable' because there was some evidence before him on which he could arrive at his conclusions. HELD: The appeal was dismissed with costs.  1)Cajon's president did not examine his company's lease (which was not produced at the hearing) in order to determine whether the rights of access and egress were guaranteed to the Respondent and its employees (which seems likely) and under which circumstances, if any, these rights could be suspended or terminated. Rather, Mr. Johns simply contacted the franchisor and was told that his employees should have followed the rules imposed upon Zellers employees. This does not seem reasonable on the part of the president in the circumstances. It has seven-year employee who presumably had performed her work satisfactorily and the only efforts by the employer were to ask Zellerers whether it was acting reasonably and to make the inquiry (just described) of the franchiseisor. An employer surely must be expected to make further inquiries and to engage in further efforts to ensure that it can comply with its obligations under the employment contract (i.e. to permit its employees access to the workplace) before it can claim that it is incapable of performing its contractual obligations. 2)The adjudicator acted within his jurisdiction when determining what the terms of Ms. Kovach's employment contract were and that the terms had not been frustrated by her conduct. 3)The appellant acted within its jurisdiction when deciding what terms of employment were and whether the terms should have been subject to proper notice.","[1] The appellant (""Cajon"") seeks an order quashing the

HELD: The appeal was dismissed with costs. 1)The adjudicator concluded the employer failed to meet the thresholds stipulated in O'Connell which set out the six essential elements for determining whether events had frustrated an employment contract: a critical rather than a trivial supervening event; an event protracted in time; not within the contemplation of the parties; coming about without fault on either party; an event that rendered the parties incapable of performing their contractual obligations; the performance of a contract would radically alter the original agreement into something other than that intended. The employer did not establish he was incapable of performing his obligations by permitting the employee access to the workplace. The adjudicator applied the appropriate principles of law to the facts as he found them. 4)The adjudicator acted within his jurisdiction when determining the terms of the employment contract and that the employer had not fulfilled his obligations.

2002skqb68.txt,"An appeal from a summary conviction for unlawfully using a searchlight for the purpose of hunting. The trial judge made three distinct and alternate findings: based on the evidence presented, night hunting with an artificial light is so inherently dangerous as not to attract protection as an aboriginal right; based on the Sparrow test for prima facie infringement and justification, s.11.1(3) of the Regulations withstands both prima facie infringement and justifiability scrutiny; based on the authorities, s.11.1(3) of the Regulations does not touch the appellant's core as Indians and, therefore, does not give rise to interjurisdictional immunity. The trial judge found that aboriginal hunting rights must be exercised subject to any legislation that expresses legitimate safety concerns. The facts were not in dispute. The appellants, who were of Metis heritage and engaged in the traditional Metis way of life, argued they enjoy hunting rights within the meaning of s.12 of the Natural Resources Transfer Act and are exempt from any hunting prohibition when hunting on unoccupied Crown land. The respondent acknowledged that if they are Metis, they enjoy an aboriginal right to hunt for food as protected by s.35(1) of the Constitution Act, 1982. However, they are subject to the regulation prohibiting night hunting with artificial lights (except when hunting on a Reserve) because its primary objective is safety. At issue was whether the appellants, as Metis, are subject to s.11.1(3)of the Saskatchewan Regulations passed pursuant to the Wildlife Act. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. 1)The appellants failed to come within s.686(1)(a)(i) or (ii) of the Criminal Code. 2)The findings were supported by the evidence and were reasonable. There was no wrong decision on a question of law.  3)Aboriginal and Treaty rights are not absolute. Reasonable regulations aimed at ensuring safety do not infringe these rights. Laws having a safety objective do not infringe aboriginal rights. As safety legislation, s.13.1(3) has a conservation component. The Province has jurisdiction to pass conservation laws. Legislation prohibiting night hunting with artificial lights has been considered by the courts of several provinces. All courts found the practice dangerous and upheld the limiting provincial legislation. 4)The Court preferred the approach taken in R. v. Bernard, which is to consider safety as a factor in determining prima facie infringement and if necessary, justification pursuant to the Sparrow test. The issue in this case is whether the limiting legislation is a prima facie infringement on the appellants' right to hunt for food and if so, whether it is justifiable. Since Sparrow, it has become unnecessary and perhaps inappropriate to attempt to define aboriginal hunting rights. Sparrow presented three questions when deciding whether there has been a prima facie infringement of hunting rights: is the limitation reasonable; does the regulation cause undue hardship; does it deny their preferred means of exercising that right. In Seward and Bernard, the Sparrow test of infringement and justification was the only test applied. No infringement was found in either case. 5)The trial judge concluded the practice of night hunting by means of artificial light is highly dangerous. The prohibition was found not only to be reasonable but essential. The regulation presented no undue hardship and was never the preferred means of hunting by people of Sapwagamik. The legislation could not be considered a diminution of any assumed aboriginal right and there was thus no prima facie infringement of hunting rights by s.11.1(3).  6)It was not accepted that because Reserves are exempted, safety was not the primary purpose. Reserves were exempt out of respect for Band Council's right to pass their own safety laws pursuant to the Indian Act. 7)The trial judge correctly identified the test for justification of a legitimate regulation as being whether the legislation has a valid objective; whether the honour of the Crown is at stake; has there been as little infringement as possible; has the aboriginal group been consulted. 8)Section 11.1(3) restricts the method of hunting at night and to that extent it likely is a conservation infringement. If so, it is still permissible provincial legislation. It meets the Sparrow justification test because of the strong safety component. 9)Provincial hunting laws regulate aboriginal hunting rights; they do not extinguish them. Accordingly, such laws do not cross the interjurisdictional immunity boundary. They do not touch the core of Indians at the heart of s.91(24) of the Constitution. The regulation applies to appellants as hunters, not as Metis.","The appellants were convicted of unlawfully using a searchlight for the purpose of hunting wildlife contrary to s. 11.1(3) of the Saskatchewan Regulations passed pursuant to The Wildlife Act, 1998. The trial judge held that the appellants as Indians within the meaning of the Natural Resources Transfer Agreement (NRTA) did not have an Aboriginal right to hunt at night with an artificial light. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. 1)The trial judge correctly identified the test for justification of a legitimate regulation of a constitutional aboriginal right and the doctrine of interjurisdictional immunity. The focus has shifted to the limiting legislation in both Aboriginal and Treaty hunting rights cases. The appellants have failed to come within the provisions of s. 686(1)(a)(i) or s. 901 of the Code. 2)The appellant had aboriginal hunting rights protected by the Constitution. The NRTA in 1930 altered those hunting rights. The provisions of the Wildlife Act altered those rights by eliminating commercial hunting; by expanding the hunting area to include all unoccupied Crown land; and by authorizing the Province to make conservation laws. 3)The respondent acknowledges that if Metis are Indians they enjoy hunting rights within s. 12 of the NRTA. Their argument is that they are exempt from any hunting prohibition when hunting on unoccupied crown land.","[1] This is an appeal by Mervin Maurice and Walter Gardiner from their summary conviction on October 5, 2001, for unlawfully using a searchlight for the purpose of hunting wildlife, contrary to s. 11.1(3) of The Saskatchewan Regulations passed pursuant to The Wildlife Act, 1998.

Further, the trial judge concluded that the legislation could not be considered a diminution of any assumed aboriginal right.

The doctrine of interjurisdictional immunity is not triggered by it. 3)The trial judge correctly identified the test for justification of a legitimate regulation of a constitutional aboriginal peoples' right.

The court has agreed that the Metis of Northwest Saskatchewan hold an existing and historical Aboriginal right to hunt moose and deer for food which had not been extinguished prior to 1982. The Province has jurisdiction to pass conservation laws. 2)The issue on this appeal is whether the appellants are Indians within the meaning of s. 91(1) of The Constitution Act, 1867. The objective was primarally safety, both from the words used in the legislation and the evidence introduced. The doctrine of interjurisdictional immunity is not triggered by it. 3)The trial judge correctly identified the test for justification of a legitimate regulation of a constitutional aboriginal peoples' right. The trial judge did not go on (pages 27 to 32) to consider infringement and justification pursuant to Sparrow. Nor should the decision be set aside on the ground of a wrong decision on a question of law. The appellants have aboriginal hunting rights protected by the Constitution but must meet the Sparrow justification test. 4)The question of whether the appellant's aboriginal rights are not absolute and, as already indicated, laws having a safety objective do not infringe aboriginal rights. The regulation prohibiting night hunting with artificial lights does not extinguish that right but only curtails method of exercising it which is, in any event, universally disapproved by the holders of the right.","[1] This is an appeal by Mervin Maurice and Walter Gardiner from their summary conviction on October 5, 2001, for unlawfully using a searchlight for the purpose of hunting wildlife, contrary to s. 11.1(3) of The Saskatchewan Regulations passed pursuant to The Wildlife Act, 1998. The issue in this case is whether the limiting legislation is a prima facie infringement on the appellants’ right to hunt for food and, if so, whether it is justifiable. Further, the trial judge concluded that the legislation could not be considered a diminution of any assumed aboriginal right. [18] The trial judge correctly identified the test for justification of a legitimate regulation of a constitutional aboriginal peoples’ right:
1. Does the legislation have avalid objective?

2. Is the honour of the Crown at stake in dealing with the Aboriginal peoples?

3. Has there been as little infringement as possible?

4. Has the Aboriginal group been consulted? But aboriginal rights are not absolute and, as already indicated, laws having a safety objective do not infringe aboriginal rights. The Province has jurisdiction to pass conservation laws. Section 11.1(3) restricts the method of hunting at night and to that extent it likely is a conservation infringement. CONCLUSION [27] It cannot be said that the findings of fact by the trial judge are unsupported by the evidence or are unreasonable. Nor should the decision be set aside on the ground of a wrong decision on a question of law. The appellants have failed to come within the provisions of s. 686(1)(a)(i) or (ii) of the Criminal Code.

There was no wrong decision on a question of law. Laws having a safety objective do not infringe aboriginal rights. The issue in this case is whether the limiting legislation is a prima facie infringement on the appellants' right to hunt for food and if so, whether it is justifiable. The prohibition was found not only to be reasonable but essential. The regulation presented no undue hardship and was never the preferred means of hunting by people of Sapwagamik. The legislation could not be considered a diminution of any assumed aboriginal right and there was thus no prima facie infringement of hunting rights by s.11.1(3). 7)The trial judge correctly identified the test for justification of a legitimate regulation as being whether the legislation has a valid objective; whether the honour of the Crown is at stake; has there been as little infringement as possible; has the aboriginal group been consulted. 8)Section 11.1(3) restricts the method of hunting at night and to that extent it likely is a conservation infringement.

9_1996canlii6888.txt,"The surviving spouse of the insured deceased, who died in a motor vehicle accident, took issue with the calculation of the death benefit paid for herself and her two children which had been reviewed and approved by SGI. At issue was whether the weekly income replacement benefit referred to in Division 5 of the Act had a separate and distinct meaning from the income replacement benefit in Division 4. HELD: SGI's decision was set aside and SGI was directed to recalculate and pay the death benefit to the surviving spouse and dependent children in accordance with the directions of the court.  1)The Interpretation Act requires legislation be given a fair, large and liberal construction to best assure the attainment of its objectives and that definitions given apply to the entire statute and regulations unless a contrary intention appears in the statute or regulations. 2)The phrase income replacement benefit (IRB) used in s136(1) is not analogous to the IRB in s146(1). There is no requirement to use the formula in s136(1) to calculate the surviving spouse's death benefit. S146(1) is a self-contained formula. 3)Because the Act is silent on a maximum yearly employment income the actual income earned is the sum that is used to determine the IRB in s146(1). The ordinary meaning of a death benefit being one-half the weekly IRB is that the payment is made on a weekly basis. 4)The IRB as calculated in s146(5) is the same as the IRB in s 146(1). 5)Leave was granted for the parties to bring the matter back, if required, with respect to the interest on benefits not paid.","The applicant was the survivings spouse of the deceased who died in a motor vehicle accident. Any benefits she was entitled to were in accordance with the Automobile Accident Insurance Act, as amended by the Act. She took issue with the calculation of the death benefit, which was based on the deceased's gross yearly employment income rather than on his gross income. Her counsel appealed the decision. HELD: The application was dismissed. 1)The interpretation suggested by SGI was appropriate when calculating the benefit for the surviving spouse for dependent children. 2)SGI was not required to calculate any other form of income that might otherwise be payable to victim, such as deemed income for students who are unable to earn an income. 3)The deceased's net income was $51,343. The death benefit was derived from a 'weekly income replacement benefit' calculated by the deceased calculated on a specific formula. The deceased received a death benefit equal to 50% of that net income.  4)The Interpretation Act requires legislation be given fair, large and liberal construction to best assure the attainment of its objects.  5)The language used in s.146(1) of the Act for calculating the deceased spouse's death benefit causes special problems. SGI equated the acronym 'IRB' with the defined phrase 'income replacement benefit', which was incorrect. Counsel for Korpess argued that SGI's interpretation of the IRB was appropriate.","The applicant, Zelma Korpess, is the surviving
spouse of Roy Korpess, who died in a motor vehicle
accident. She received a
death benefit for herself and for her two children. Because she took issue with the calculation of the
amount paid, her counsel applied for a review of the
decision as provided by the Act. Section 146(1) is a self-contained formula. Because the Act
is silent on this limit in Division 5, I must conclude
that the actual income earned, without any limiting
maximum, is the sum that is used to determine the IRB
in s. 146(1). The ordinary
meaning of this is that the payment is made to the
surviving spouse on a weekly basis. CONCLUSION It is hereby ordered that SGI\'s decision is set
aside. SGI is directed to recalculate and pay Mrs.
Korpess the death benefit to her as a surviving spouse
and for her two dependent children in accordance with
the directions of this court. Although I am entitled to award interest on the

There is no requirement to use the formula in s136(1) to calculate the surviving spouse's death benefit. S146(1) is a self-contained formula. 3)Because the Act is silent on a maximum yearly employment income the actual income earned is the sum that is used to determine the IRB in s146(1). The ordinary meaning of a death benefit being one-half the weekly IRB is that the payment is made on a weekly basis. 4)The IRB as calculated in s146(5) is the same as the IRB in s 146(1). 5)Leave was granted for the parties to bring the matter back, if required, with respect to the interest on benefits not paid.","The surviving spouse received a death benefit for herself and for her two children.

The 'weekly income replacement benefit' referred to in Division 5 of the Act is a different statutory creature than the 'incomereplacement benefit' in Division 4. The ordinary meaning of this is that the payment is made to the surviving spouse on a weekly basis.  2)The 'income replacement' in s.146(1) was not the same as in s146(5) and was calculated on a monthly basis. 3)The deceased's net income was $51,343.

DS was apprehended by the Ministry when he was born. Both NS and DS were the subject of a consent order for 6 months in October 2007. Both children have been in care for most of their lives. The Ministry requests a six month order with a proviso that it be for the purposes of allowing the Ministry to make long term placement plans for both children. The mother HH is not seeking a return of the children to her but supports the position of NOS, the father, who ask that the children be returned to him in his care. HELD: 1) If the children are returned to NOS, they will not receive a level of parenting that is above the minimal standard that will be tolerated by our society. Both children have some difficulties which must be managed carefully to ensure their continued growth and improvement. 2) Given the difficulties the parents struggle with, they can not provide that management. The Ministry has tendered substantial evidence of criminal activity on the part of NOS and police involvement in the life of HH. The criminal behaviour of NOS in and of itself would not disqualify him from parenting the children if the children were not exposed to that behaviour. There is a risk that the children may be exposed to such behaviour in the future. There is no evidence that NOS has done so in the past. The evidence of domestic violence is equivocal. There is evidence of consistent fighting and disruption of their relationship in the past. The Court finds that the relationship is unstable. The parents' addictions continue to loom large in their lives and relationship. The Court is not convinced that the father's addiction has been stabilized and is fully under control. There have been slip-ups and missed appointments at the methadone clinic. This should not be visited on the children. HH is even less advanced in dealing with her addictions than NOS. The evidence indicates good intentions but not the personal strength to take and complete programming whether offered by the methadone client, or ordered as a condition of the court. This is troubling because if the parents don't have the strength to achieve this, there is a question as to whether they have the personal strength to provide the minimal care for these children required by law on a day to day basis. 3) If the children are returned to NOS, they are likely to suffer physical and emotional harm. While the parents have had successful visits with the children while in care and had a period of some months where the children were apparently looked after by them, this does not convince the Court that they belong with NOS. The day to day stress of parenting is substantially different than visits of several hours.

DS was apprehended by the Ministry when he was born. Both NS and DS were the subject of a consent order for 6 months in October 2007. Both children have been in care for most of their lives. The Ministry requests a six month order with a proviso that it be for the purposes of allowing the Ministry to make long term placement plans for both children. The mother HH is not seeking a return of the children to her but supports the position of NOS, the father, who ask that the children be returned to him in his care. HELD: 1) If the children are returned to NOS, they will not receive a level of parenting that is above the minimal standard that will be tolerated by our society. Both children have some difficulties which must be managed carefully to ensure their continued growth and improvement. 2) Given the difficulties the parents struggle with, they can not provide that management. The Ministry has tendered substantial evidence of criminal activity on the part of NOS and police involvement in the life of HH. The criminal behaviour of NOS in and of itself would not disqualify him from parenting the children if the children were not exposed to that behaviour. There is a risk that the children may be exposed to such behaviour in the future. There is no evidence that NOS has done so in the past. The evidence of domestic violence is equivocal. There is evidence of consistent fighting and disruption of their relationship in the past. The Court finds that the relationship is unstable. The parents' addictions continue to loom large in their lives and relationship. The Court is not convinced that the father's addiction has been stabilized and is fully under control. There have been slip-ups and missed appointments at the methadone clinic. This should not be visited on the children. HH is even less advanced in dealing with her addictions than NOS. The evidence indicates good intentions but not the personal strength to take and complete programming whether offered by the methadone client, or ordered as a condition of the court. This is troubling because if the parents don't have the strength to achieve this, there is a question as to whether they have the personal strength to provide the minimal care for these children required by law on a day to day basis. 3) If the children are returned to NOS, they are likely to suffer physical and emotional harm. While the parents have had successful visits with the children while in care and had a period of some months where the children were apparently looked after by them, this does not convince the Court that they belong with NOS. The day to day stress of parenting is substantially different than visits of several hours. The evidence does not convince the Court that the children would receive consistent care month after month despite one past success in doing so. The children are in need of protection and should not be returned to NOS or HH. 4) Although the Ministry seeks a 6 month order with the notation that it is for the purposes of permanency planning, the Court is not inclined to make such an order. A 6 month order is premised on a reasonable prospect of change by the parents within a reasonable time. The parents have this opportunity to demonstrate that they are serious about changing their lives so that their children can be returned to them.","HELD: The Ministry of Social Services sought a six month order pursuant to s. 37(c) of The Child and Family Services Act with respect to the two children.

9_1996canlii6809.txt,"FIAT. The plaintiff brought an action against five defendants claiming fibromyalgia, chronic fatigue and a skin rash were the result of silicone implants. One of the defendants, Dow Chemical, sought a declaration that the Court of Queen's Bench did not have jurisdiction to hear the action and to have the service ex juris set aside. Dow Chemical argued that there was no causal connection between it and the plaintiff's damages. HELD: The application was dismissed. The plaintiff was awarded her taxable costs in any event of the cause. It must be assumed that the allegations have a factual basis and liability may rest with the defendant, Dow Chemical, in both tort and contract, therefore it was considered appropriate to assume jurisdiction.  1)The Court did not have jurisdiction over the defendant on the basis of common law. The defendant is not resident in Saskatchewan and has no direct or real connection to the province. 2)The plaintiff is assumed to have suffered damages in both contract and tort. Applying Queen's Bench Rule 31(l)(f)(g) and the Moran case, the Court should assume jurisdiction absent any reason to the contrary. 3)Three of the four main topics in the statement of claim have reference to Dow Chemical: the failure to inform certain regulatory bodies and the public at large about the risk of breast implants; marketing and distributing the implants which were of non-merchantable quality and breach of warranties. 4)The final plea was that Dow Corning and Dow Chemical were in reality one and the same entity. It was thus suggested that the corporate veil should be pulled aside and any wrongful acts of Dow Corning should be treated as those of Dow Chemical. This differs significantly from vicarious liability where no fault is attributable to the third party but liability attaches because of the relationship. If fault were found to be directly attributable to Dow Chemical there would be a causal connection. 5)The allegation that Dow Chemical breached its duty to disclose the inherent risk suggested a link between the alleged failure to disclose and the injuries.  6)The doctrine of forum non conveniens was not invoked and therefore not considered. Appeal to Court of Appeal dismissed Sept. 9/96.","The plaintiff underwent bilateral augmentation mamoplasty and received silicone breast implants manufactured by Dow Corning. Ten years later she received replacement breast implants, bearing the trade name Surgitek, which were manufactured by Medical Engineering Corporation and Bristol-Myers Squibb.

The plaintiff brought an action against five defendants claiming fibromyalgia, chronic fatigue and a skin rash were the result of silicone implants.

Dow Chemical argued that there was no causal connection between it and the plaintiff's damages. HELD: The application was dismissed. The plaintiff was awarded her taxable costs in any event of the cause. It must be assumed that the allegations have a factual basis and liability may rest with the defendant, Dow Chemical, in both tort and contract, therefore it was considered appropriate to assume jurisdiction.  1)The Court did not have jurisdiction over the defendant on the basis of common law.

Applying Queen's Bench Rule 31(l)(f)(g) and the Moran case, the Court should assume jurisdiction absent any reason to the contrary. 3)Three of the four main topics in the statement of claim have reference to Dow Chemical: the failure to inform certain regulatory bodies and the public at large about the risk of breast implants; marketing and distributing the implants which were of non-merchantable quality and breach of warranties. 4)The final plea was that Dow Corning and Dow Chemical were in reality one and the same entity. It was thus suggested that the corporate veil should be pulled aside and any wrongful acts of Dow Corning should be treated as those of Dow Chemical. This differs significantly from vicarious liability where no fault is attributable to the third party but liability attaches because of the relationship. If fault were found to be directly attributable to Dow Chemical there would be a causal connection. 5)The allegation that Dow Chemical breached its duty to disclose the inherent risk suggested a link between the alleged failure to disclose and the injuries.  6)The doctrine of forum non conveniens was not invoked and therefore not considered.

Allowing the appeal and remitting the matter to Provincial Court for trial, that the Tobacco Access Act is legislation in relation to matters of health, and therefore within provincial jurisdiction. It does not conflict with the federal Tobacco Act. The trial judge therefore erred in finding that the Tobacco Access Act was ultra vires. The trial judge also erred in law with respect to the defence of due diligence. The question is not, as the trial judge thought, whether the employee who sold the tobacco was duly diligent, but whether the accused, her employer, exercised all reasonable care by establishing a proper system to prevent the commission of the offence, and by taking all reasonable steps to ensure the effective operation of the system."

9_2011skpc15.txt,"The accused was charged with aggravated assault and mischief. The evidence on the aggravated assault was that the accused had struck the victim in the face with a plastic candle holder. The victim suffered significant injury to his face and eye, which was still noticeable 6 weeks later. The victim testified that the accused had been drinking and the parties got into an argument. The victim touched the accused on the back in an effort to calm her down and she spun around and struck the victim in the face with the candle holder. The accused gave a warned statement and testified at trial that she believed she had backhanded the victim with her fist. In her warned statement, she qualified her denial by saying that her recollection was not clear and that she didn't really remember. The evidence on the mischief was that when the police attended to the residence after the victim had gone by ambulance to hospital and the accused was standing in front of the house in front of a broken window. HELD: The accused was convicted of aggravated assault. The inescapable conclusion from the evidence is that the accused struck the victim in the face with the candle holder. The accused's version that she struck the victim with her fist is not believable when considered in the context of her qualified denials about hitting him with the candle holder, her level of intoxication and the significance of the injury inflicted on the victim. When an individual intentionally strikes another in the face with a hard plastic object, it is objectively foreseeable that wounding, maiming or disfiguring of the victim may result. The accused was acquitted of the mischief charge because there was no direct evidence that she had broken the window and there was no evidence that the window was not broken prior to the offence date.","The accused was charged with mischief under $5,000 and aggravated assault. The major issue for determination was whether the accused can be convicted of both charges. HELD: The accused was convicted of mischief. The court held that the Crown had not proved the requisite intent to sustain convictions under s. 267 or s. 268 of the Criminal Code. The Court concluded that to convict for mischief there must be an unlawful act and an objectively dangerous act.","Background [1] The accused, Karyn Mae Fayant is charged with mischief under $5,000.00 by smashing a window, and with an aggravated assault upon Joe Cwynar. There is circumstantial evidence that she broke the window, upon which I would say she probably broke the window. However, in my view, the evidence falls short of proof beyond a reasonable doubt. On this basis I would find her not guilty of the charge of mischief. [18] In the case at bar, it is readily apparent that the accused applied some force to Mr. Cwynar and as a result, she must at least be convicted of common assault contrary to s. 266 of the Criminal Code.

The evidence on the aggravated assault was that the accused had struck the victim in the face with a plastic candle holder. The victim suffered significant injury to his face and eye, which was still noticeable 6 weeks later. The victim testified that the accused had been drinking and the parties got into an argument. The victim touched the accused on the back in an effort to calm her down and she spun around and struck the victim in the face with the candle holder.

A conditional discharge would do little to discourage others in Mr. Roberts' situation from undertaking similar sorts of criminal activity. 2)The sentence imposed was not properly reflected the gravity and the offence was significant and should attract a criminal record. 3)Leave to appeal was granted and the Crown's appeal should be allowed.,0.689655172413793,c_2004skca153.txt,"The respondent was convicted after trial of fraud exceeding $5,000 contrary to s. 380(1)(a) of the Criminal Code.

The Crown appeals asking that a 12 month conditional sentence be imposed with a condition of 200 hours of community service.

The court reviewed the factors set out in Machula v. Kuse and found that the applicant had failed to provide the specific information required to direct an assessment of six years of legal services covering a multitude of issues on a substantial number of files. The court distinguished the applicant from the case of Vo v. Phillips Legal Profession Corp. because the defendant was not an unsophisticated client. The length of time was unusual, which would further support the need for clearly outlined reasons to justify going back six years. Further, the applicant had not made any complaints to the defendant even during the post-election period and had assured him that he would be paid. The defendant would be severely prejudiced by the assessment requested because of the time that it would take him from his practice to review six years of billings on hundreds of attendances.

The agreement provided, among other things, that the parties would live separately and that neither would claim spousal support from the other. The following clause appeared in the agreement: 11. HELD: The parties did not cohabit for more than 90 days and there was no serious argument that they cohabited in 1997. The only issue was for how long. The respondent disputed that evidence and insisted that the period of cohabitation extended from June 1997 until September 18. The petitioner's account was accepted but the respondent's was not accepted. In the final analysis, it comes to a question of credibility. The parties clearly intended to re-establish their life together as husband and wife in the fullest sense. They swore that they had cohabitated for ten days in May 1997, June 1997, September 1997 and June/July 1997 and then June/September 1998. The Respondent disputed the evidence of a period of 90 days. If the petitioner's testimony is accepted, the cohabitations would have extended for at least 95 days.  1) The respondent evasive, argumentative andultimately untruthful in his answers to a number of questions.  2) The circumstances surrounding the signing of the so-called separation agreement and the reason he gave forit were the same as in the divorce proceedings. There was no real argument that the two parties had been living together for 10 days in 1997 and from June/97 until June/98. The wife swore that the dates of the parties' 1997 marriage were ten days each and they lived together for 90 days with reconciliation as the primary purpose. The provisions contained in the Agreement will not be affected except as provided in this clause.  3) The Court reviewed the evidence in this matter. It was not necessary for the Court to review the evidence. The Court dealt with the issue of credibility in light of the narrow issue presented to it for determination.","The Facts [2] The parties signed a contract described as a
separation agreement dated September 6, 1996. [7] I found the respondent evasive, argumentative and

6_2015skqb138.txt,"Wills and Estates – Proof of Will in Solemn FormWills and Estates – Testamentary Capacity After the death of the testator, one of his five daughters brought an application for an order directing a trial to prove the testator’s 2013 will in solemn form on the ground that the testator did not have testamentary capacity to understand the nature of the document he was signing or the extent of his property. The testator and his wife had executed mirror wills in 2012. His wife died in September 2013, and within two days of her death the testator had signed a new will. It was based on his first will with some revisions. The value of the estate was approximately $343,000 and the will made bequests of $100 to the applicant and another daughter. The testator left the rest and residue of the estate divided into equal shares between his three other daughters. The applicant deposed that at the time the testator’s wife was dying, she visited him and found him to be very confused. When the testator’s lawyer came to meet with him as his wife was dying, the applicant stated that the testator said he did not remember the lawyer and would not sign anything. The only other evidence submitted by the applicant was a letter from the testator’s physician, who reported that he saw the testator in early September 2012 and that he was then alert and could recognize him. The evidence presented by the two daughters who were named as executors of the will consisted of their own affidavits and the affidavits of a friend of the testator; a bank official who had prepared a power of attorney for the testator made at the time of the death of his wife; and the lawyer who prepared the original 2012 wills and the 2013 will. The contents of the various affidavits deposed to the testator’s estranged relationship with the applicant and her sister, his intention to exclude the applicant from his will, and that he appeared to be mentally capable. The lawyer’s affidavit deposed that at the initial meeting that she attended with the testator when his wife was dying, he was devastated by grief and she did not take any instructions. When she met with him again to take instructions regarding his new will, she kept notes of them—the testator had expressly instructed her to make sure that the two daughters would get nothing except for the specific bequests. The lawyer confirmed that she had no concerns with the testator’s capacity. HELD: The application was dismissed. The court held that the applicant’s evidence in support of the challenge to the will was extremely thin and the descriptions of the testator’s behaviour did not raise doubt regarding his capacity regarding his property and his disposition of it.

The testator and his wife had executed mirror wills in 2012. His wife died in September 2013, and within two days of her death the testator had signed a new will. It was based on his first will with some revisions. The value of the estate was approximately $343,000 and the will made bequests of $100 to the applicant and another daughter. The testator left the rest and residue of the estate divided into equal shares between his three other daughters. The applicant deposed that at the time the testator’s wife was dying, she visited him and found him to be very confused. When the testator’s lawyer came to meet with him as his wife was dying, the applicant stated that the testator said he did not remember the lawyer and would not sign anything. The only other evidence submitted by the applicant was a letter from the testator’s physician, who reported that he saw the testator in early September 2012 and that he was then alert and could recognize him. The evidence presented by the two daughters who were named as executors of the will consisted of their own affidavits and the affidavits of a friend of the testator; a bank official who had prepared a power of attorney for the testator made at the time of the death of his wife; and the lawyer who prepared the original 2012 wills and the 2013 will. The contents of the various affidavits deposed to the testator’s estranged relationship with the applicant and her sister, his intention to exclude the applicant from his will, and that he appeared to be mentally capable. The lawyer’s affidavit deposed that at the initial meeting that she attended with the testator when his wife was dying, he was devastated by grief and she did not take any instructions. When she met with him again to take instructions regarding his new will, she kept notes of them—the testator had expressly instructed her to make sure that the two daughters would get nothing except for the specific bequests. The lawyer confirmed that she had no concerns with the testator’s capacity. HELD: The application was dismissed.

The applicant was denied income assistance for failure to supply requested information. He appealed the decision and the appeal board ordered his income assistance be reinstated. The respondent refused to reinstate assistance and made a request for additional information. Eventually, the applicant supplied the requested information and his assistance was reinstated.

(e) it is otherwise an abusive of process of the Court; and (f) it may order the action to be stayed or dismissed or judgment to be entered accordingly. There are different parties in civil proceedings from criminal and of course, a different burden of proof. In the criminal proceedings the plaintiff did not have control of the proceedings. As in all criminal cases, he was simply witness and was required to answer the questions of crown counsel in direct examination and to respond to the questions posed to him in cross-examination. 3) The court reviewed the procedure to be followed on an application under Rule 173. It found that victim who is witness for the Crown in unsuccessful criminal proceedings should be entitled to proceed independently in subsequent civil proceedings against the same defendant. Its exercise would not be justified merely because the story told in the pleadings is highly improbable and one which it is difficult to believe could be proved. Particulars of the injuries sustained by the plaintiff included traumatic ruptures of the cornea, extensive anterior segment disruption, extensive posterior segment disruption and disruption of posterior segment/retina.

ANALYSIS After deciding that the respondents had ""sufficient interest"" within the meaning of s.6 of The Children\'s Law Act and therefore status, a decision with which, as noted, we agree, the trial judge then had to decide the issue of custody. This rule prevails even in contests between a natural parent and a stranger. The findings of the trial judge were strongly supported by the evidence, the law was correctly applied, and therefore his decision ought not be overturned. The matter is, therefore, remitted to the Family Court to determine reasonable access. The appeal is, therefore, dismissed with costs here and below and the matter returned to the Family Court for a determination of reasonable access to the child by the mother.",0.4937655860349128,"The appellant, who is mentally handicapped, appeals the entrusting of custody of her 5 year old son to the respondents. The child was born in 1989 and in 1990 the appellant and her child were placed in the home of the respondent. The relationship between the respondent and the child broke down and she left the care of the respondents on May 30, 1992. The trial judge misconstrued important evidence and misinterpreted important facts. HELD: Appeal dismissed with costs and the matter returned to the Family Court for a determination of reasonable access. 1)The trial judge erred in deciding the best interests of the child when in fact the level is funding level and not a care level is not material as there exists other strong evidence, including that of the court appointed psychologist as to concerns about the child's ability to care for the child, and the risk to the child if he is left unsupervised for extended periods of time in the mother's care. 2)The court reviewed the evidence and found the respondents had sufficient interest within the meaning of s.6 of the Children's Law Act and therefore status, a decision with which, as noted, the trial judge then had to decide the issue of custody.",0.5643835616438357,4_1994canlii3885.txt,"The Respondents sought and were granted custody of the child.

4_2009skqb403.txt,"The petitioner is a 39 year old nurse. She is legally married to Mr. McPhail and together they are the biological parents of three children. The petitioner separated from Mr. McPhail in October 2001 after the petitioner became romantically involved with the respondent, Dr. Hunt. The petitioner and the respondent began cohabitating sometime between November 2002 (according to her) and September 2003 (according to him). They separated in July 2008. The petitioner now commences a petition in which she claims relief from the respondent, Dr. Hunt, under The Family Property Act, The Children's Law Act, 1997 and The Family Maintenance Act, 1997. The three issues to be determined on this application are whether the petitioner has established a prima facie case that the respondent stood in loco parentis to the children such as to justify an interim child support order, whether the petitioner has established that she is entitled to interim spousal support and whether the Court should order an interim distribution of matrimonial property in favour of the petitioner in the amount of $20,000. HELD: 1) The petitioner has fallen short of establishing a prima facie case that the respondent stood in loco parentis to the children. The Court cannot make a determination based on conflicting affidavits. The determination will have to be made after trial. 2) There is no dispute the parties cohabitated as spouses for in excess of 2 years and that she is a spouse by virtue of the legislation. The principles in Marcotte v. Marcotte, 2008 SKQB 223 apply to the present case. In 2008 the respondent reported income of over $267,000, he has the ability to pay. The petitioner has annual income of over $71,000. Although the parties had a combined income of over $350,000 while they were together, it appears that their assets after their liabilities are deducted will result in a minimal net worth. The Court concludes that the petitioner is in need of some financial assistance, albeit not to the degree that she has suggested. A modest transfer of funds from the respondent to the petitioner should alleviate the majority of her negative cash flow problems. The petitioner's cohabitation with the respondent can only be described as short term. A spousal support payment of $1,500 per month is an appropriate interim amount. The payments will be paid for a total of 8 months.  3) Paying any money to any party at this stage does not meet the criteria set forth in the decisions of this Court. It is far from certain whether any money will be flowing from the respondent to the petitioner. The application for an interim distribution of family property is dismissed.","The applicant is 39 years old licensed practical nurse who is employed with the Mamawetan Health Region. She is married to a self-employed carpenter who also lives in La Ronge. They have three children. The applicant commenced a petition in October 2008 in which she claims relief under The Family Property Act, S.S. 1997, The Children's Law Act, 1997, and Family Maintenance Act 1997. HELD: The application for interim relief was dismissed without prejudice to the petitioner's right to claim child support. 1)It is now well established in this jurisdiction that the court can, and should, make an interim order for child support in disputed in loco parentis cases where the applicant has made a prima facie case for entitlement. The fact that one is not the biological parent does not necessarily mean that one may not be legally required to provide maintenance for his or her child. 2)The circumstances of the'rent' that the applicant claims she pays are somewhat cloudy. After the separation, she moved back to the residence on Sinotte Crescent. She claims that she pays rent in the amount of $150.68 weekly (which amounts to $7,835.36 yearly). The credit card entry is double entry in that it is not an expense not already covered by the other expenses.

Although Dr. Hunt did not specifically consent to Ms. McPhail’s application for sole custody, in light of the position that Dr. Hunt takes on the other issues, there is no opposition to Ms. McPhail’s request, and it is appropriate to grant Ms. McPhail the relief that she seeks respecting sole custody. [10] Accordingly, there will be an order that Ms. McPhail shall have sole custody of her three children, namely: Jordan Darcy Rex McPhail, date of birth January 9, 1993 (16), Mitchell Kenneth Lloyd McPhail, date of birth May 6, 1995 (14), Chase Aaron Joshua McPhail, date of birth October 3, 1999 (9). 1.

The guardian appealed SGI's decision that the children were not entitled to any additional benefits. She argued that since the money paid was in relation to the youngest child, who in the circumstances took the place of a surviving spouse, the death benefit becomes fixed at $47,427, and the formula used in s.146(1) would be half of the income replacement benefit(the IRB) that the deceased would have been entitled to had she survived the accident.

The sole issue was whether any additional child care benefits were payable under s.146(5) when the deceased was unemployed and had no income at the time of the fatal motor vehicle accident. HELD: The appeal was dismissed without order as to costs. Where the deceased victim would not have been entitled to any benefit had she survived the accident, the minimum death benefit is still payable, but that amount does not become a factor in calculating the IRB for the purpose of applying the formula contained in s.146(5). It is the total amount payable as a death benefit. The IRB in this case was zero and the amount payable pursuant to the formula in either s.146(1) or s.146(5) is zero. Where no benefit other than the minimum death benefit of $45,000 (adjusted for inflation) is payable under s.146(3), no further amount is payable under either s.146(5) or s.147(5).","The deceased single mother, who was unemployed and had no income, appealed the decision of Saskatchewan Government Insurance that the children were not entitled to any additional dependant child care benefits.

HELD: The application was granted. 1)The Court found that there was a reasonable apprehension of bias and that the learned justice of the peace ought to have recused himself from considering the application to issue the search warrant, having previously acted in a solicitor/client relationship with the spouse of the applicant. 2)The application was dismissed. 3)The court found that the application was not pre-ordained and that there were reasonable and probable grounds for a warrant to search the applicant's (and his wife's) home.",0.5675675675675675,d_2006nssc280.txt,"The accused applied to quash a search warrant, which authorized the search and seizure of his accounting records for a two-year period. Although the correct information was contained in the informant's file, there were two errors made in the Information to Obtain the warrant; the Crown argued that the errors were inadvertent and not intended to deceive the Justice and that the things to be searched for had relevance beyond the discrepancies. The applicant also argued that the issuing Justice should have recused himself due to being in a conflict of interest situation from having provided independent legal advice to the applicant's wife in respect of a mortgage transaction approximately seven years ago and later being consulted by the wife when the parties were experiencing marital difficulties. Application to quash the warrant allowed on the basis that there were not reasonable and probable grounds for its issuance; there was no reasonable apprehension of bias on behalf of the Justice. The court drew the inference that the informant would not have pursued the warrant without the undisputed and seriously erroneous information and noted that these errors occurred despite the presence of contrary information in the informant's file. There was no evidence as to what information the wife had imparted to the Justice in their previous encounters; the oath sworn by the Justice and the fact that the last time the Justice represented the wife was approximately five years prior to the issuance of the warrant militated against a reasonable person having an apprehension of bias."

4_2007skqb397.txt,"The plaintiff claims damages against the defendants Tim Sullivan and Sullivan Instrumentation (collectively 'Sullivan') for breach of an employment contract when Sullivan was employed by the plaintiff to perform services for PCS at the mine. The issue is whether Sullivan breached his employment contract by submitting a proposal to PCS when he was still employed by the plaintiff. HELD: 1) There is nothing wrong with Sullivan setting up his corporation with a view to starting a competitive business after his employment with the plaintiff ended. An employee must be free to plan his future after his employment with his employer ends. He did not prepare the proposals during working hours. He prepared them with the assistance of his wife, when he was off work in Regina. However, it has been held that an employee who submitted a bid in competition to his or her employer during a period of working notice was in breach of the employment contract. Therefore, Sullivan breached his duty of fidelity to the plaintiff. 2) However, the Court was not satisfied that the plaintiff proved it would have been in a position to perform further work for PCS if Sullivan had not submitted a proposal. There were no union members available for it to hire. It had no employees ready to perform the contract. It would appear the plaintiff had abandoned any thought of continuing the contract until the end of December. If he had pulled employees from another contract, he would have suffered no damage. 3) Sullivan was not in a managerial position with the plaintiff. He did not possess any confidential information or trade secrets. He knew nothing as to the profit margins of the plaintiff. He did have business experience but not confidential information or a trade secret. 4) The plaintiff in this case is entitled to no more than nominal damages in the amount of $500 plus costs.","The plaintiff claims damages against the defendant for breach of contract and breach of fiduciary duty. The defendant entered into a contract with the plaintiff for term of two months. The contract was extended by PCS in mid-April and then again in June until the end of September. The plaintiff alleges that the contract was also extended for further three months from September 30 until December 2005. The trial judge concluded that the respondent was deriving benefit from both his employer and from competitor. He also found that although the giving of unreasonable notice constituted a fundamental breach of the employment contract, the defendant had not elected to treat the contract as being at an end when given notice of her dismissal. The employment contract had not terminated until October 7, 1995. The claim against PCS is dismissed. HELD: The plaintiff is entitled to costs against the plaintiff and the plaintiff is awarded costs against Sullivan. 1)The trial judge erred in characterizing the employee's actions as mere preparation. The employee competed with her employer for business which had been the employer's; her placing of the bid went beyond preparation. 2)The plaintiff proved it would have been in a position to perform further work for PCS if Sullivan had not submitted a proposal. 3)The court found no case law on point in this province and was unable to distinguish Sullivan's actions from those of Restauronics.",[2] The plaintiff also claims damages against the defendants Tim Sullivan and Sullivan Instrumentation Inc.

c_2013skpc37.txt,"The accused was charged with impaired driving and driving with a blood alcohol level over .08. The accused was permitted to use his cell phone on the way to the RCMP detachment to call his wife in Calgary and request help in finding a lawyer. He did not receive a call back from his wife. The RCMP officer advised the accused that he could provide a phone book and access to a phone and that Legal Aid was available. The accused stated that he would talk to Legal Aid. After the call was completed, the accused asked the officer if they had got the dumbest lawyer they could find. The officer asked the accused if he was satisfied with his call and he said 'sure.' The accused testified that his response was sarcastic, but the officer took it at face value. The accused said nothing further about the lawyer call. The accused's movements in the detachment were recorded on VHS videotape. The video is a series of still shots taken every four seconds and there is no audio. The video was taped over every 60 days and had been destroyed before it was requested by defence counsel. HELD: There was no breach of the accused's rights under s. 10(b) of the Charter. Even though the accused's cell phone was taken from him before he received a call back from his wife, it is clear that the accused made a conscious decision to call Legal Aid, and by implication, did not wish to pursue the first course of action. There was no obligation on the part of the RCMP to provide the accused with a Prosper warning.

HELD: 1) The child completed grade 12 in 2004 having turned 18 in February. He returned to high school in the fall of 2004. He worked at McDonald's during that year and lived with his mother. Thereafter he attended SIAST and then commenced classes with New Media. He is still under his mother's charge. She provides him with room and board. He is only 19 years old. He has been pursuing his education. The fact that he changed his course of study does not disentitle him to consideration for support. He is a person within the meaning of s. 4(2) of the Act. This will continue until March 2006 when he has completed his current course of study. 2) The respondent's income fluctuates. It is appropriate to take an average of the last 3 years to determine his income.  3) Some attention must be paid to the financial ability of each parent to contribute. After deducting the table amount, the respondent would have a gross annual income of $19,781.52. On that basis the court was not prepared, even in the face of some shortfall for the child, to order the respondent to pay any additional amounts. The guideline amount is the appropriate amount to be paid until the end of this year's study.","HELD: The Court found that the respondent was a person within the meaning of s. 4(2) of The Family Maintenance Act, 1997 and that he had had that status on a continuing basis to the present time. The Court ordered an order for ongoing child maintenance, based on the Federal Child Support Guidelines (SOR/97‑175) commencing September 1, 2005 payable to and including March 1, 2006. The father was to be reimbursed for any payments made subsequent to that date. The respondent's income fluctuated in the past three years and the Guideline amount was the appropriate amount to be paid until the end of this year's study in March 2006.","Mr. Brown takes the position that in July of 2004 and thereafter, Warren ceased to be a person within the meaning of the Act as he was not, by reason of the pursuit of reasonable education, unable to withdraw from Ms. Donald’s charge or to obtain the necessaries of life. [28] I am satisfied on the basis of the evidence before me that Warren is a person within the meaning of s. 4(2) of The Family Maintenance Act, 1997 and that he has had that status on a continuing basis to the present time.

[39] Accordingly, Mr. Brown is ordered to pay to Ms. Donald for the maintenance of Warren Brown, born February 26, 1986, the sum of $181.00 per month commencing September 1, 2005 and payable on the first of each and every month thereafter up to and including February 1, 2006.

HELD: The accused was found not guilty of the offence charged. Although the accused was economically dependent on the defendant, was required to perform duties mainly for him and was in relationship with him that more closely resembled an employee relationship than that of independent contractor, the Crown took the position that both the defendant and the plaintiff were employers for the purposes of the Act, but as the plaintiff was not present on the day of the accident, only the defendant was charged. The Crown's argument that he was dependent on Harnish and Murphy jointly does not accord with the profit-sharing agreement. The fact that fishermen have traditionally seen themselves as being self-employed is an important factor in deciding this issue, but is not conclusive. Nor does the Crown argue that the defendant should be considered an employer although all four fishers were dependent on him for the licence.","[1] Ausman William Murphy faces a charge under s. 13(1)(a) of the Nova Scotia Occupational Health and Safety Act that, as an employer, he failed to take reasonable precautions to ensure the health and safety of persons at a workplace. · Harnish, Murphy, Heisler and Zinck had a profit-sharing agreement, pursuant to which 10% of the gross was paid to Brian Coolen for the use of his tuna licence, 10% to Larry Harnish as boat share, 26% to Murphy or Harnish, depending on whose nets the fish in question came from, and after expenses were deducted, the net profits would be divided equally among the four.

He now claims an exemption in that amount. 2) There were several other debts and expenses which the respondent submitted should be taken into account. 3) An RRSP registered in the name of the respondent was found to be exempt. The interest earned would not be exempt, but have no evidence as to what that has been. 4) The petitioner received no benefit from these expenses. Her furniture was included in the distribution. 5) The respondent's RRSP was not registered in her name. However, as best I can make out, it was acquired prior to the marriage. Accordingly, the petitioner should be paid $2,400 for the automobile and boat resulting in a total of $33,257.31. 6) In addition to the farm machinery, the respondent sold his tractor and the sale proceeds were used for the farm expenses. 7) There appears to be an RRSP registration in the respondent's name as well as a bank account. However the respondent shall have three months in which to pay the amount of the judgment and, in the event payment is not made, he may apply to this court for directions as to sale of the family home. 8) There is an exemption for the tractor in respect to the purchase of two 80-11 Seed Rites which were acquired from an uncle's estate and the 30' Morris rod weeder of value of $225. Both are statute-barred and the value of the tractor is unclear. 9) A debt of $1,200 which was referred to three appraisals; one which was done at the behest of the petitioner and two for the respondent. The father owns the tractor. 10) An exemption in respect of the 30's and 40' Morris Rod weeder are included. 11) The farm machinery comprises a major portion of the Family property. It is here that there is a serious dispute regarding what pieces",0.5546218487394958,c_2002skqb155.txt,"The wife sought distribution of family property in accordance with the Family Property Act. HELD: The petitioner was given judgment for $51,725.82 with taxable costs of the action payable within 3 months, failing which, the petitioner may apply for directions as to sale of the family property. The family property was divided equally from the date the action was commenced. The legislation does not permit an exemption in the circumstances for the $12,000 from the sale of the respondent's trailer used to purchase the acreage. Two other tractors were exempt and a partial exemption was allowed for a snowmobile and some tools. While he owned a truck prior to the marriage, it could not be traced to the current truck. The petitioner's automobile and boat were added to the distribution value of the machinery. The value of livestock to be distributed was $25,261. The RRSP purchase prior to the marriage was exempt. The claim for the debt for the tractor owned by the father and alleged debt for a rod weeder were rejected. Debts owed to the father for a tractor and a truck were statute-barred. The petitioner should bear no responsibility for monies paid for fertilizer, chemicals, fuel, repairs, parts and insurance as they were on-going expenses for the operation of the farm. The petitioner's claim for $1,000, borrowed from a friend to pay legal fees, was not considered a matrimonial debt."

2_2008nsca28.txt,"The worker was unsuccessful in his claim for compensation for gradual onset stress when the Workers' Compensation Appeal Tribunal (WCAT) found that the conditions in his workplace did not constitute unusual or excessive stressors as required under the terms of the relevant Board policy. The worker appealed, arguing, inter alia, that the WCAT erred in finding that his subjective reaction to the stressors in the workplace was not relevant. Appeal dismissed; the WCAT correctly applied the objective approach in determining whether there were workplace events or stressors sufficient to support a claim for gradual onset stress. The Board policy reflected the previous applicable law; namely, that workplace events and stressors must be unusual and excessive in comparison to the work- related events or stressors experienced by an average worker in the same or similar occupation.","The Workers' Compensation Appeals Tribunal (WCAT) held that the workplace stressors experienced by the respondent worker were not unusual and excessive in comparison to those experienced by an average worker in the same or similar occupation. WCAT applied the correct legal test in this case, which was reviewed for correctness. The issue was whether WCAT was wrong to take this approach and if so, whether it applied it unreasonably to the worker's situation. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. The policy provides that both gradual onset and traumatic event stressors are compensable under the Government Employees Compensation Act (GECA) and sets out the conditions under which each type of stress is compensable. The Policy also sets out certain legal principles that must be met. The first requirement is that the stressors must be excessively and unusually stressful, objectively viewed and, in the actual case of the individual worker, give rise to the mental or physical condition on which the claim is based. The second requirement is the exclusion of work related events such as 'routine employment related actions' and 'labour relations issues'. WCAT did not err in failing to give weight to the opinion of the respondent's treating psychologist in the absence of evidence to the contrary to rebut that opinion. The third requirement is an objective assessment of the nature of the workplace events and stressors from an objective point of view. This is consistent with the scheme and purpose of the GECA and furthers its overall intent to provide no fault compensation for injuries resulting from workplace accidents. The question of whether the policy is more restrictive than the general law that applies to GECA is reviewed according to the reasonableness standard. The Court found that WCAT erred in finding that there were 'unusual or excessive' stressors in the workplace which could ground a claim for gradual onset stress. It found that they were not. The Appeal Commissioner's reasoning process was unreasonable in that, having found there were unusual or excessive stressors, there was no causal link between those stressors and his stress injury.","Held: Appeal dismissed per reasons for judgment of Cromwell, J.A.; [1] This appeal turns on one main question: in deciding the worker’s gradual onset stress claim under the Government Employees Compensation Act, R.S.C. 1985, c.

The Board policy reflected the previous applicable law; namely, that workplace events and stressors must be unusual and excessive in comparison to the work- related events or stressors experienced by an average worker in the same or similar occupation."

The fire occurred less than a day before the first policy was to be cancelled. The defendant refused to honour the policy. It claimed that the formal Proof of Loss filed by the plaintiff was fraudulent, as it failed to disclose the existence of the second policy.

The insured property was totally destroyed by fire some 22 hours before the deadline. The mortgage was in both names and the insured insured did not know of the fire loss.

The defendant's evidence was that he had only entered his vehicle to listen to music while he decided whether to walk to a nearby party or his girlfriend's house. Defendant found not guilty of either offence charged. From the defendant's whole course of conduct, which included driving the vehicle to the pub before consuming any alcohol, walking to his friend's house and back again to the pub, as well as his stated intention to leave the vehicle where it was, the court concluded that he had rebutted the presumption under s. 258(1(a).

[8] From the whole course of conduct of the defendant on that evening, including the fact that he drove the vehicle to the location where it was found before consuming any alcohol and walked to his friend’s house and from his friend’s house back to the pub, as well as his stated intention to leave the vehicle where it was and walk either to the next party or to his girlfriend’s home, I am satisfied that the defendant has rebutted the presumption under s. 258(1)(a). The defendant’s car was parked on a level parking lot with its nose two feet or less from a building; the parking brake was engaged; the vehicle was in first gear and the engine was not running. From these facts I conclude that there was little, if any, danger of the vehicle being set in motion unintentionally, or of its thereby becoming a danger to the public. Conclusion [17] The Crown having failed to establish beyond reasonable doubt that the defendant was in care or control of his motor vehicle at the time in question, I find that the defendant is not guilty of either offence charged.",0.3914209115281501,"The accused was charged with care and control of a motor vehicle contrary to s. 253(a) of the Criminal Code; and having consumed alcohol in such a quantity that the concentration of his blood exceeded eighty milligrams in one hundred milliliters of blood. The accused's acts involved the use of the car's equipment to turn the key in the ignition to the accessories position and to play music on the stereo. He was found by the investigating officer behind the wheel of the vehicle in the driver's seat. He also testified that he did not intend to drive the vehicle. HELD: The accused was not guilty of either offence. 1)The risk assessment should not involve conjecture or speculation. It may be speculation or conjecture to conclude that every driver whose BAC exceeds 80, might change his mind; however, it would be wrong to preclude trial court from assessing the risk of change of intention, on the facts of the individual case, especially where it is accepted that one effect of the consumption of alcohol is the impairment of judgment. 2)There were other considerations that added to the public risk or increased the likelihood of the accused changing his mind.",0.4460431654676259,d_2007nspc68.txt,"The defendant was charged with impaired driving and operating a motor vehicle with a blood alcohol content over the legal limit.

e_2000canlii19619.txt,"Accused charged with impaired driving, being over.08 and driving while disqualified. The charges arose out of an incident where he rear-ended car stopped in front of him at red light. The accident victim estimated the time of the accident to be around 1:30 a.m. After the accident, the victim, witnesses and attending police officers noticed that the accused displayed signs of intoxication. The police arrived at the scene at 2:12 a.m. The accused was seated in the police car and was first spoken to shortly before 3:00 a.m. The officer determined through CPIC that the accused was prohibited from driving in Saskatchewan. The demand for breath sample was made at 2:48 a.m. At 2:50 a.m. he was given his rights and he spoke to lawyer prior to providing sample. HELD: The evidence of the crown witnesses was accepted over that of the defendant. The Court found beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant was the operator of the vehicle when the collision occurred and therefore the accused was found guilty of driving while disqualified. The crown was not able to prove beyond a reasonable doubt the time of the accident and, therefore, is not entitled to rely upon the presumption provided in s.258(1) of the Code. The Court was not able to conclude that the first sample was taken within 2 hours of the incident. On the charge of impaired driving, the Court had no doubt that the accused's ability to operate a motor vehicle was impaired by alcohol. The Court also held that there was no breach of fundamental justice by virtue of the discussion of the police witnesses with the civilian witnesses during the trial. When witness remains in the courtroom after an exclusion order and then testifies, the trial judge may consider this in deciding the weight to be given to the evidence of that witness. This principle is equally applicable to the case at hand where witnesses who had yet to testify discussed the evidence with other witnesses after their testimony. The Court rejected the defence argument that there was an appearance of unfairness about the trial process that requires that a stay of proceedings to be entered.

The accused's testimony was most apparent to me because of his insistence that there were only two people in the cab of the truck who he said was driving. The driver of the Sunfire was unsteady on his feet and leaned on vehicle to support himself. He had alcohol on his breath and his eyes were bloodshot. The cab driver's testimony that he saw the accused get out of his truck and fall asleep enroute to his destination was questionable. The police were operating under very tight time lines in order to meet the requirements permitting reliance on the presumption. 3)The Court was unable to conclude that the first sample was obtained within two hours of the accident.

b_2010skca58.txt,"The appellant was charged on a four count information in connection with an alleged impaired driving incident. He contended the information was a nullity because it contravened s. 789(2) of the Criminal Code. The Provincial Court trial judge severed the count which was the source of the difficulty. The appellant then sought an order from the Court of Queen's Bench quashing the trial proceedings. That application was dismissed and the appellant appealed to this Court. At trial, the appellant made an application for an order quashing the information as being a nullity. He contended it was drafted so as to violate the Code s. 789(2) of which states: 'No information in respect of an offence for which, by reason of previous convictions, a greater punishment may be imposed shall contain any reference to previous convictions.' The trial judge dismissed the application to quash. He held that the defect could be addressed in one of two ways: The drive while disqualified charge could be amended to strike out the words 'by reason of an order pursuant to Section 253 and 254 of the Criminal Code.' Alternatively, he said the defect could be cured if that count was severed. The trial judge advised that he was satisfied he could fairly try the appellant even with knowledge that he had or might have a criminal record. The appellant's application for a writ of certiorari quashing the information was dismissed by the Court of Queen's Bench. In this Court, the appellant did not pursue his argument that the information was a nullity which should have been quashed in its entirety. Rather, he contended that, after recognizing a problem in relation to s. 789(2) of the Code and severing count 4 of the information, the trial judge should have dealt only with that count. More specifically, the appellants contended that an apprehension of bias arose when the judge elected to proceed on the first three counts, i.e. the charges concerning impaired driving, refusing a breath demand and obstruction. This was said to be the case because the judge had learned of a previous conviction in the course of severing the drive while disqualified count. HELD: The appeal is dismissed. The test for apprehension of bias is well settled. The leading case in the criminal context is R. v. S.(R.D.). The test is: what would an informed person, viewing the matter realistically and practically Ã» and having thought the matter through Ã» conclude. It is inevitable that accused persons will appear before judges who know of their criminal histories. The community rightly trusts that such information will play no part in judicial decision making. Accordingly, at least in the normal course, mere knowledge of an accused's criminal record does not automatically disqualify a judge from presiding at a trial.

The appellant then sought an order from the Court of Queen's Bench quashing the trial proceedings. That application was dismissed and the appellant appealed to this Court. At trial, the appellant made an application for an order quashing the information as being a nullity. He contended it was drafted so as to violate the Code s. 789(2) of which states: 'No information in respect of an offence for which, by reason of previous convictions, a greater punishment may be imposed shall contain any reference to previous convictions.' The trial judge dismissed the application to quash. He held that the defect could be addressed in one of two ways: The drive while disqualified charge could be amended to strike out the words 'by reason of an order pursuant to Section 253 and 254 of the Criminal Code.' Alternatively, he said the defect could be cured if that count was severed. The trial judge advised that he was satisfied he could fairly try the appellant even with knowledge that he had or might have a criminal record. The appellant's application for a writ of certiorari quashing the information was dismissed by the Court of Queen's Bench. In this Court, the appellant did not pursue his argument that the information was a nullity which should have been quashed in its entirety. Rather, he contended that, after recognizing a problem in relation to s. 789(2) of the Code and severing count 4 of the information, the trial judge should have dealt only with that count. More specifically, the appellants contended that an apprehension of bias arose when the judge elected to proceed on the first three counts, i.e. the charges concerning impaired driving, refusing a breath demand and obstruction. This was said to be the case because the judge had learned of a previous conviction in the course of severing the drive while disqualified count. HELD: The appeal is dismissed.

4_1994canlii4365.txt,"This was a petition for divorce with an application for settlement of corollary matters, especially custody and access. The mother was the primary caregiver during the marriage, but the father also made significant contributions. The parties had an interim order for joint custody, which the father sought to continue. The mother sought sole custody with generous access. The evidence was that although both parents were good parents, they had difficulty in resolving problems between them, causing a lack of communication. Allowing the mother's application, that because the day to day decision-making was problematic, it was necessary for one of the parties to be given final say. Both parents were to continue to share in rights and responsibilities on major issues. As the parties lacked flexibility, a detailed access plan was incorporated.","The parties separated in June 1992 and the respondent voluntarily left the matrimonial home in November 1992. There was a marriage breakdown and the divorce was granted. The parties' claim under the Matrimonial Property Act and for Corollary Relief under the Divorce Act was resolved by agreement prior to trial except for 1) how the children's investments should be administered; 2) custodial alternatives'sole or joint custody'; 3) specific access; 4) quantum of child maintenance. The specifics of this case lead me to believe that the parties, who have functioned under joint custody for eight and half months, need more than the tool or the guide that is being suggested by the respondent. The children's investment in Canada Savings Bonds and Mutual Funds exist in the childrens' names in the approximate amount of $2,000 each. They are happy and content to be with their father. The day to day physical custody, and decision making during this period are their greatest concerns. To date, it has not been the 'occasional resort' to the Court referred to in Krugger v. Krugger (1980), 11 R.F.L. (2d) 52. It is impossible to determine the source or the reason why the symptoms or responses of the children are occurring. It could be any single or combination of factors that have occurred since June 30, 1993.","The parties\' claim under the Matrimonial Property Act, R.S.N.S. 1989, c. 275 and for Corollary Relief under the Divorce Act, R.S.C. 1985 (2nd Supp), c. 3 was resolved by agreement, prior to trial, except for

HELD: The appeal was dismissed. 1)There was no palpable or overriding error in the assessment of the evidence or in the interpretation or application of the law to the evidence.

However this rule does not apply here because there was some direct evidence concerning his ability to operate the vehicle during the first time frame (R.v.Comba).

Neither the deceased's Will nor the codicil made in November and December 1989 respectively made provision for the second son born December 1989, subsequent to the separation of the parties. The elder son was the sole beneficiary and the farmlands were to be held in trust for him until he turned twenty-one. The younger son was diabetic and had extraordinary medical expenses. The eldest required braces. The mother's income was $1,089 per month. The deceased had been paying support in the amount of $150 per month per child pursuant to the 1991 divorce order. The mother sought an order under s17(4) of the Divorce Act varying child maintenance from $300 to $1,245 per month for the two children. The Executors did not oppose the application but put in issue the Estate's ability to support that level of maintenance. HELD: The younger child was entitled to share equally with his brother in the estate as a reasonable provision had not been made for his maintenance. Maintenance was varied to $900 per month for the two children.  1)Different considerations arise in the context of a Dependants' Relief Act application taken in conjunction with a variation application. The phrase 'reasonable provision' in s9(1) of the Dependants' Relief Act is to be no longer defined as that which would permit the dependent to maintain the standard of living enjoyed during the lifetime of the testator but is to be determined having regard to the testator's legal and moral obligations to the dependent and others (Ostrander). A more generous award may result. 2)The preservation of an inheritance until the children attain the age of twenty-one is not a predominant factor. The amount of maintenance is not, of necessity, tied to the standard of living experienced when the testator was alive or to the net income the Estate will generate subsequently. The court departed from the Guidelines for the reason the award was made in conjunction with a Dependent's Relief application, the income of the estate was currently unknown, but the court was satisfied that reasonable provision has been made for the children. 3)There was nothing in the Will, read as a whole with reference to the ordinary rules of construction which required the term personal effects to be given anything other than their ordinary meaning; with the clarification that the testator did not wish to preserve personal use vehicles. Thus, personal effects did not include grain, livestock, farm machinery, equipment or other assets related to the operations of the farm.  4)Counsel for both parties were entitled to their costs of the proceedings to be paid on a solicitor-client basis out of the estate.","The deceased made a will and codicil in November 1989 and December 11, 1989 respectively.

The deceased himself provided in the will that the Executors had absolute and uncontrolled discretion to encroach on capital for the purposes of child maintenance, education, benefit and advancement. The estate was substantially smaller, the children had a longer period of dependency and, whereas in Thauberger (supra) the interest income exceeded the level of support claimed, here it is unknown what income the Estate will generate.

Neither the deceased's Will nor the codicil made in November and December 1989 respectively made provision for the second son born December 1989, subsequent to the separation of the parties. The elder son was the sole beneficiary and the farmlands were to be held in trust for him until he turned twenty-one. The younger son was diabetic and had extraordinary medical expenses. The eldest required braces. The mother's income was $1,089 per month. The deceased had been paying support in the amount of $150 per month per child pursuant to the 1991 divorce order. The mother sought an order under s17(4) of the Divorce Act varying child maintenance from $300 to $1,245 per month for the two children. The Executors did not oppose the application but put in issue the Estate's ability to support that level of maintenance. HELD: The younger child was entitled to share equally with his brother in the estate as a reasonable provision had not been made for his maintenance. Maintenance was varied to $900 per month for the two children.  1)Different considerations arise in the context of a Dependants' Relief Act application taken in conjunction with a variation application. The phrase 'reasonable provision' in s9(1) of the Dependants' Relief Act is to be no longer defined as that which would permit the dependent to maintain the standard of living enjoyed during the lifetime of the testator but is to be determined having regard to the testator's legal and moral obligations to the dependent and others (Ostrander). A more generous award may result. 2)The preservation of an inheritance until the children attain the age of twenty-one is not a predominant factor. The amount of maintenance is not, of necessity, tied to the standard of living experienced when the testator was alive or to the net income the Estate will generate subsequently. The court departed from the Guidelines for the reason the award was made in conjunction with a Dependent's Relief application, the income of the estate was currently unknown, but the court was satisfied that reasonable provision has been made for the children. 3)There was nothing in the Will, read as a whole with reference to the ordinary rules of construction which required the term personal effects to be given anything other than their ordinary meaning; with the clarification that the testator did not wish to preserve personal use vehicles. Thus, personal effects did not include grain, livestock, farm machinery, equipment or other assets related to the operations of the farm.  4)Counsel for both parties were entitled to their costs of the proceedings to be paid on a solicitor-client basis out of the estate.","The petitioner sought an order under the Dependents' Relief Act varying child maintenance from $150 per child to $1,245 per month for the two children.

The accused who had ten nets on two lakes at the time of seizure admitted to being commercial fisherman. The Crown had stated to the defence that fishing for commercial purposes would not be an issue. The trial judge dismissed the defence motion for a direction that the Crown comply with his undertaking that the issue was whether the Metis of Northwestern Saskatchewan have an aboriginal right to fish for food. The Provincial Court Judge found both accused not guilty on three of the counts on the basis of standard criminal law defences but would have convicted on the other three charges but for the constitutional defence. The Crown appealed the acquittals based on the constitutional defence. Grounds for appeal included failure to distinguish between an Aboriginal right to fish for food and for commercial purposes; failure to find the accused were engaged in commercial fishing and that neither the accused nor their ancestors possessed an Aboriginal right to fish for commercial purposes; by concluding that scrip issued to Metis pursuant to s6(f) of the Dominion Lands Act and Order-Council did not extinguish any Aboriginal right to fish for food or commercial purposes; the trial judge erred by failing to conclude that the requirement to obtain a licence before fishing with a net was not a prima facie infringement of an existing aboriginal right to fish for food; in acquitting the accused when neither the Aboriginal rights defence nor equality rights defence had any application to the charge. The Saskatchewan Metis Nation and National Council were granted Intervenor status. HELD: 1)The first three grounds were dismissed. The trial judge found that the Crown had not breached an undertaking, nor misrepresented its position with respect to the constitutional issue but implicitly found that the respondents had been prejudiced through the misunderstanding during pre-trial communications between council as to the issues that would be argued during trial. The trial judge was entitled to find as fact that it was not the intention of the parties to confine the issue to commercial fishing. 2)Once it was determined the actual activity was fishing for the purpose of selling the fish, the only rights that could be said to be infringed were either the right to exchange fish for money or goods or the right to fish commercially (Gladstone). The aboriginal right to fish for food was no longer relevant because the evidence did not establish that as the activity they were engaged in. 3)The trial judge's finding that an Aboriginal right to fish existed in Metis persons of northwest Saskatchewan separate and apart from the issue of aboriginal title was one he was entitled to make and should not be disturbed. The case law makes it perfectly clear that aboriginal rights are site specific and the finding of a right in one group in one location does not establish the same right for another group in another location (Van der Peet). 4)There is no basis to distinguish between Indian and Metis people when considering whether a licensing requirement constitutes an infringement of the aboriginal right to fish for food. 5)The departmental policy which placed a higher priority on treaty Indian fishing than domestic licence food fishing for Metis persons constituted an infringement. Once an infringement is found the onus shifts to the Crown to demonstrate that the regulation is justifiable. The infringements could not be justified because they did not relate to any identifiable objective that made them necessary. 6)The trial judge should not have based his decision on the Charter when it was not part of the argument before him without first giving counsel the right to address the argument. 7)Since there is no requirement on a Metis person in the geographical area delineated to have a licence it followed that Regulation 27 requiring a person to legibly mark the licence number of the stakes was also an infringement that could not be justified.","The Crown appeals the acquittal of the respondents following trial in Provincial Court on three charges related to fishing, in contravention of the Saskatchewan Fishery Regulations passed pursuant to the Fisheries Act.

The aboriginal right to fish for food was no longer relevant because the evidence did not establish that as the activity they were engaged in. 3)The trial judge's finding that an Aboriginal right to fish existed in Metis persons of northwest Saskatchewan separate and apart from the issue of aboriginal title was one he was entitled to make and should not be disturbed. 4)There is no basis to distinguish between Indian and Metis people when considering whether a licensing requirement constitutes an infringement of the aboriginal right to fish for food. 5)The departmental policy which placed a higher priority on treaty Indian fishing than domestic licence food fishing for Metis persons constituted an infringement. The infringements could not be justified because they did not relate to any identifiable objective that made them necessary. 6)The trial judge should not have based his decision on the Charter when it was not part of the argument before him without first giving counsel the right to address the argument. 7)Since there is no requirement on a Metis person in the geographical area delineated to have a licence it followed that Regulation 27 requiring a person to legibly mark the licence number of the stakes was also an infringement that could not be justified."

When the police approached a group of youth standing around vehicles, through one of the vehicle's open windows they noticed two open bottles of beer. While searching the vehicle for liquor, they moved a knapsack on the floor to check under the seat; the knapsack felt heavy and it felt like there were bottles inside it.

The fact that they were found in an open motor vehicle in the open spot was also significant in the conclusion that the marijuana and cocaine were possessed by the defendant, not for sale. 4) There is no evidence that the defendant changed his hands when he entered the vehicle to change his hands. It is clear that he consented.

The Court found that the evidence seized was admissible.","[1] Shea Patrick William Ernst is charged with possession of cannabis marijuana for the purpose of trafficking, with possession of cocaine for the purpose of trafficking, both under s. 5(2) of the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act and with possession of property obtained by crime under s. 355(b) of the Criminal Code. I therefore find that that cocaine had been in the defendant’s personal possession up to the point of handing it to Hyslop and thereafter was in the joint possession of the defendant and Hyslop. [21] In regard to the drugs and money found in the knapsack, I note that the knapsack was in the personal possession of the defendant when he entered the motor vehicle, that no one else had any access to it from then until the police seized it. [22] In short, I am satisfied that the only reasonable inference to be drawn from all of the evidence before the court is not only that the knapsack was in the personal possession of the defendant, but that, because it contained items of such a personal nature, because the cocaine the defendant handed to Hyslop came from the knapsack, and because no one else had access to the knapsack, the defendant must have had knowledge of all of its contents and, for the same reasons, consented to their being there. [25] For the reasons stated above, I find that the three rolls of cash in the amount of $1000 each were in the possession of the defendant and that, because they were in small denominations, found in the same bag as large amounts of cocaine and marijuana, rolled in the manner in which drug dealers commonly hold their cash, and as the defendant was a student the previous year and therefore unlikely to have large amounts of cash from any other source, the only reasonable inference here is that these rolls of cash were proceeds of drug trafficking. Conclusion [26] The defendant is guilty of all three charges before the court.",0.6632258064516129,"The accused was charged with possession of cannabis marijuana for the purpose of trafficking and cocaine for the use of trafficking both under s.5(2) and with trafficking of property obtained by crime. The accused had a knapsack with him in the vehicle console where the police later found it and a large amount of cash in the back pocket of the defendant's backpack. The police officers seized the backpack and at subsequent search at the police station it was found to contain: an unopened bottle of Olands Export Ale, 232 grams of cannabis marihuana, 63 grams of cocaine, bundles of cash containing $3000 in total, a digital scale, a black wallet, a toothbrush and deodorant. HELD: The accused was guilty of all three charges before the Court. 1) The only reasonable inference to be drawn from all of the evidence before the court is not only that the knapsacks was in the personal possession of the accused but that, because the cocaine was found in the same bag as large amounts of cocaine and marijuana, rolled in the manner in which drug dealers commonly hold their cash, and as the accused was a student the previous year and therefore unlikely to have large quantities of cash from any other source, the only logical inference here is that these rolls of cash were proceeds of drug trafficking. 2) The evidence was circumstantial in which the Crown had not proven beyond a reasonable doubt that the drugs and money were in the accused's possession. The evidence established that the accused had knowledge of all of its contents and consented to their being there. 3) There was no evidence to support the Crown's inference that the items seized by the police in this case were possessed for sale, not personal use.

The defendant was found guilty on all charges. The evidence established that the defendant had handed the packages of cocaine found in the console of the vehicle to the vehicle's owner; thus the cocaine was in the defendant's personal possession initially and thereafter in the defendant's and his friend's joint possession. The knapsack was in the personal possession of the defendant when he entered the vehicle and no one else had access to it until the police seized it; the only reasonable inference to be drawn was not only that the knapsack was in the personal possession of the defendant but that since it contained items of such a personal nature and since the cocaine handed to the friend had come from the knapsack and no one else has access to it, the defendant must have had knowledge of all its contents and consented to them being there. The three rolls of cash were also in the possession of the defendant and since they were in such small denominations and were found in the same bag as the large amounts of cocaine and marijuana, rolled in the manner in which drug dealers commonly hold their cash, and as the defendant was a student the previous year and therefore unlikely to have large amounts of cash from any other source, the only reasonable inference was that the rolls of cash were the proceeds of drug trafficking."

The three youngest children had been in the Agency's temporary care and the oldest child had been in the supervised care of her paternal grandparents. The family had come to the Agency's notice due to problems with money, food shortage and housing. Despite several years of assistance from a Family Skills Worker and Parent Aid, concerns remained as to the mother's willingness and ability to care for her children. The oldest child had continuously moved between her biological father's home (which was often with the mother) and her paternal grandparents. The biological father had custody of her at the present time. The paternal grandparents wanted custody of both the oldest and youngest children, whom they believed to be their son's children. Application granted; the oldest child to be placed in the supervised care of her paternal grandmother and the biological father is not to live in that home; both parents can have supervised carefully monitored access to that child (if access is not exercised by either party, that access will be terminated); the three youngest children are to be placed in the permanent care of the Agency for the purposes of adoption with both parents' access to these children to be weaned. Access between all four children will continue at least until it becomes impossible due to the current adoption law in the province.

The Youth Court judge interpreted the Act as meaning the respondent's sentence had continued to run while he was at large and had expired. She held that no action was required on the alleged breach of the custody and supervision order. The Crown appeals the decision. HELD: Appeal allowed. 1) The Youth Court judge erred in her interpretation of the Act. On a proper reading of the Act, the respondent was deemed not to be serving his sentence during the time period between when the warrant was issued and when he was apprehended. 2) A straightforward analysis of the Act serves to answer the question of whether the respondent's sentence continued to run while he was at large. Section 102(1) of the Act sets out the authority of the director, when a young person has breached or is about to breach a condition of his community supervision. The director may, pursuant to s. 102(1)(a), permit the young person to continue to serve his sentence in the community or, pursuant to s. 102(1)(b) of the Act, if the breach is serious and increases the risk to public safety, the director may order the young person to be remanded in custody until a review is conducted. Section 102(2) goes on to make s. 107 and s. 108 applicable to an order for remand and review made pursuant to s. 102(1)(b). Section 107(1) is the provision referred to by s. 102(2) that is of concern. There is an obvious modification of s. 107(1) which 'the circumstances require' when it applies in the context of a breach of the conditions of community supervision. That modification involves the notional deletion of the opening words of the subsection that refers to s. 106 and the substitution in their place of a reference to s. 102. This means two things. First it means that, when the director decides to issue an order under s. 102(1)(b) remanding a young person in custody until a review is conducted, the director has the authority to issue a warrant authorizing the apprehension of the young person. Second it means that if a warrant is issued, the young person's sentence does not run until he or she is apprehended. 3) The court went on to comment further on some of the considerations that seem to have led to the decision in the court below, including the purpose of the Act, the reference to s. 107 that is found in s. 102(2) and the relationship between the concept of the suspension of supervision and the running of the sentence itself.","The respondent had just begun serving the community supervision portion of his custody and supervision order made pursuant to the Youth Criminal Justice Act (YCJA) when he walked away from his designated residence and thereby breached the terms of the order.

Second it means that if a warrant is issued, the young person's sentence does not run until he or she is apprehended. 3) The court went on to comment further on some of the considerations that seem to have led to the decision in the court below, including the purpose of the Act, the reference to s. 107 that is found in s. 102(2) and the relationship between the concept of the suspension of supervision and the running of the sentence itself.","The respondent had just begun serving the community supervision portion of his youth sentence when he walked away from his designated residence and thereby breached the terms of the order. The provincial director immediately issued a warrant for his apprehension but he was not found by police until almost a month later. His case went to the Youth Justice Court for review under s. 103 of the Youth Criminal Justice Act. The Crown appealed her decision and argued that, on a proper reading of the YCJA, the respondent was deemed not to be serving his sentence during the time between when the warrant was issued and when he was apprehended. The Youth Court judge held that the sentence had continued to run while he was at large and, as a result, had already expired. She held that no action was required on the alleged breach of the custody and supervision order. HELD: Appeal allowed. 1) The court accepted the Crown's argument and found that the youth court judge erred in her interpretation of s. 107(1)(b). For the reasons which follow, that this proviso cannot have been intended to incorporate the power to suspend which is provided for under a separate section. These sections may allow the issuance of a warrant authorizing apprehension, which is found in s. 102(2), and may direct the provincial director to review the case promptly, as that is the focus of s102. This language is inconsistent with the notion that the right of appeal particularized in ss. 109(4) to (8) arises only in relation to certain kinds of orders and, in particular, that it arises only when there has been an unsuccessful attempt to keep the young person in custody. The court reviewed the case and, within forty-eight hours, cancelled the suspension of the conditional supervision or refer the case to the youth justice court for review. 2) The Court reviewed the Youth Court decision and found, with any modifications that the circumstances require, that the Minister of Justice's ability to “suspend” community supervision is subject to appeal.","Disposition: Appeal allowed [2] The Youth Court judge interpreted the YCJA as meaning the respondent’s sentence had continued to run while he was at large and, as a result, had already expired. [3] The Crown appeals her decision and argues that, on a proper reading of the YCJA, the respondent was deemed not to be serving his sentence during the time period between when the warrant was issued and when he was apprehended. [4] I accept the Crown’s argument and find, [25] A straightforward analysis of the YCJA serves to answer the question of whether the respondent’s sentence continued to run while he was at large. It would have been prudent for the Youth Court judge in this case to have written K.P.A #1 in less wide-ranging terms and, having written it as she did, to have treated it less as precedent and more as the collection of obiter observations it was.

As the results of the action were mixed, no costs were ordered.","The parties were previously before the Court in an action for custody, access, support, divorce and division of family property.

This judgment deals with the divorce of a young couple who resided in the family home on the SE¼-27‑52-05-W3rd in the Province of Saskatchewan. The parties were in agreement that other family property be divided equally between them. However, there was no evidence as to how the value arrived at other than an inspection of the property.

b_2012skqb443.txt,The parties were involved in a dispute regarding the custody of their children. The respondent husband sought to adduce as evidence an offer of settlement made by him to the petitioner. The respondent argued that he had waived any privilege regarding the proposal. HELD: The Court held that settlement proposals were privileged and that both parties jointly held it; the respondent could not unilaterally waive it. The Court denounced the respondent for exhibiting it to his affidavit as an attempt to infer that he was the better parent because the offer was so reasonable that only an unreasonable person would not accept it. The Court should only rarely be advised of settlement negotiations and even more rarely in chambers applications.,"FIAT: The application at bar is another salvo in a bitter custody and access dispute. The respondent has instructed the petitioner to forward the following without prejudice proposal in order to attempt settlement of the parties parenting and child support matters. Just as promised, the letter goes on to set out a detailed, comprehensive offer of settlement. HELD: 1) Settlement privilege aside, and with the exception of few issues such as costs and limitation periods or when a party seeks to establish a concluded agreement, am hard pressed to come up with a situation where the existence of a settlement proposal would be relevant to an issue before the Court. The law is clear that settlement proposals should seldom be made known to the Court, it happens too often and for no good reason. It is common sense that settlement is less likely if the parties do not engage in full and frank discussions at all if such could be used to their detriment. The privilege is clearly an important one and in cases of doubt as to whether the correspondence does relate to the negotiations, the Court should undoubtedly err on the side of protecting the privilege. 2) The respondent exhibited a letter to his counsel that was from his counsel to the petitioner's counsel.

3_2000canlii19612.txt,"The plaintiffs claim for crop damage caused by the defendant's cattle entering the plaintiff's canola field. The defendant denies he is responsible or negligent, but admits his cattle were in the field.HELD: Damages were awarded in the amount of $2,533.45. The court valued the loss at $3,052.36. It then deducted 2% attributed to wild animal damage, 5% for the plaintiffs failure to calculate actual yield from the rest of the crop, 5% that the plaintiffs would have paid in dockage and 5% for the cost of production. Civil liability for crop damage caused by cattle flows from the Stray Animals Act. A cattle owner is strictly liable for damages caused by his straying cattle.  This liability may possibly even be absolute and only an act of god may serve as a defence. The issue here is the quantum of the damage. The fact that the defendant was refused access to the plaintiff's property to repair the fence has no bearing on liability in this case. An independent adjuster assessed the damage at 557 bushels. The court found on the facts that the damage was caused exclusively by the defendant's cattle on several occasions.","The plaintiff's claim against the defendant was for crop damage sustained as a result of the defendant's cattle getting into the plaintiff's canola field in late July, 1999.

[2] Mr. Sutherland has pleaded guilty to an offence under the Occupational Health and Safety Act , that he failed to take every precaution that is reasonable in the circumstances to ensure the health and safety of persons at the workplace. Mr. Sutherland’s guilty plea relates to the fact that on August 13, 2006, there was a manure pit on the farm that did not have a barrier. He drowned in a manure pit. Mr. Sutherland ’s failure was in not securing the manure pit which had its damaged barricade removed while a new one was on order, or not arranging for an alternative to using the pit, alternatives that did exist on the farm at the time. Other factors that are relevant to the issue of proportionality in this case are the fact that Mr. Sutherland is before me as an individual not a large corporation and the fact that Mr. Boake also had responsibilities under the Occupational Health and Safety Act that he did not meet. [9] The principle of parity in sentencing requires that ""a sentence should be similar to sentences imposed on similar offenders for similar offences committed in similar circumstances"", but this case does not lend itself easily to comparisons. I am satisfied that the joint recommendation of counsel for a total penalty of $25,000 is appropriate in this case. I accept the submission that a $25,000 penalty is a significant penalty for Mr. Sutherland. [13] I am going to direct that the fine portion of the penalty be paid, as is jointly recommended, to the Canadian Farmers’ Disability Registry. In addition I am directing that Mr. Sutherland perform 160 hours community service specifically with respect to farm safety, including preparation and travel to meetings associated with the issue.",0.5754276827371695,"The defendant, who owned and operated a family dairy farm, pleaded guilty to an offence under the Occupational Health and Safety Act for failing to take every precaution that is reasonable in the circumstances to ensure the health and safety of persons at the workplace. The defendant's guilty plea relates to the fact that on August 13, 2006, there was a manure pit on the farm that did not have a barrier. He had been out all night at social event and had been drinking and had not slept. His blood alcohol concentration was significantly over the legal limit for operating any kind of vehicle. He made substantial changes to the farm since the tragedy, including building a new dairy barn. These plans were in the works before Mr. Boake's death but had been informed by the tragedy. He was in no condition to be operating equipment, which he needed to do to remove manure to the manure pit and placed himself at risk. His failure was in not arranging for an alternative to use the pit, alternatives that did exist at the time. HELD: The defendant was sentenced to a total penalty of $25,000. 1)It is material to me as well that the evidence in Exhibit 1, containing diagrams and photographs of the defendant's farm, and the submissions of Mr. Yuill indicate clearly that the defendant was conscientious about safety issues before August 13 2006 and has endeavored to address and improve safety at his farm since his death. The farm was inherently dangerous and farm work being inherently dangerous, accidents are daily risk. This was a case where safety was a daily risk and the defendant took steps to improve safety. 2)The defendant's failure was not in failing to secure the barricade which had its damaged barricade removed while a new one was on order.

There is nothing in the original order that could be interpreted as saying that the plaintiffs could cross-examine on the affidavit. In the view of the Court, having chosen not to file reply affidavits pursuant to the original order, it is not reasonable for plaintiff's counsel to embark on a totally different approach several weeks after the deadline has passed.

d_2010skca52.txt,"The appellant contests an order for $600.00 monthly spousal support given by a Chambers judge on an application to review a previous order which granted the respondent $300.00 monthly spousal support for a period of 1 year. The parties were married for 24 years following a 2-year period of cohabitation. They have 2 adult children, one of which is largely supported by the appellant. Both parties have some health problems. Originally, the appellant was ordered to pay the respondent $300.00 in monthly spousal support for a period of 1 year. Given the appellant's health difficulties and the fact that he was nearing retirement, the trial judge noted that the respondent would do well to become self-sufficient as soon as possible. The Chambers judge who reviewed the original order found that, during the year period the respondent was collecting spousal support, she had not engaged in any gainful employment. She had sold her house and used the proceeds to spend over 4 months living in Hawaii and Jamaica. She obtained probationary employment just after filing a notice of motion but lost the job before the hearing commenced. HELD: The appeal is allowed, the orders of the Chambers judge for spousal support and costs against the appellant are set aside. The Chambers judge imputed an income of $14,289 to the respondent on the basis that she was capable of working 30 hours per week at minimum wage. He did not indicate why he did not find her capable of full time employment. The Chambers judge made an error in calculating the income of the appellant. He also discounted the expenses borne by the appellant in relation the maintenance of their adult child, who was a full-time student. It was incumbent on the respondent to establish that she was unable to become self-sufficient. The evidence did not begin to establish that and, in fact, clearly showed that she made little effort to do so within the year allocated by the trial judge.","This appeal from a spousal support order was allowed orally from the bench for the reasons set out.

They had two adult children, born in 1984 and 1989. The respondent had taken a buyout of her pension and job in exchange for $35,000. She had been diagnosed with breast cancer in 2005 and had had surgery followed up by radiation. She also had shingles and an attack in the nature of stroke in March 2006. She was receiving social assistance in the sum of $14,000 annually. HELD: The appeal is allowed orally. 1) The evidence before Sandomirsky J established that during the year following the one year order of Ottenbreit J. the respondent had not engaged in any gainful employment at all. She sold her house and used the proceeds to spend over four months out of Canada, living in Hawaii part of the time and spending month-long vacation in Jamaica. She paid for her adult children to visit her. Finally, on April 14, 2009, she commenced employment at Westfair Foods in a probationary position. This was after the 1 year spousa maintenance order had expired and only few days prior to filing the application to review that order and to award to her substantial permanent spousousal Support. Prior to the hearing of her application, she lost this position and said in her affidavits, filed in support of the application, that she was “disabled and still receiving treatments”, that her was enrolled in legal assistant program, and that she had sought permanent full time employment since losing the Westfair foods position, but had been unable to receive any offers of employment. She filed no medical evidence to indicate that she could not work and did not, in fact, say she was unable to work. In fact, she indicated she was seeking a full time position. 2) The chambers judge imputed an income to the respondent of $13,289 based on the assumption she was capable of working 30 hours week at minimum wage.

The respondent was 60 years old and the appellant was 53. The parties had separated in 2003 after 24 years of marriage following two years of cohabitation. At the time of the judgment, the respondent had been diagnosed with breast cancer and had had surgery followed up by radiation. She was receiving social assistance in the amount of $14,000 annually. The chambers judge discounted the relevance of the expenses of maintaining Catherine on the basis that she was over 18, without determining whether she was still a child of the marriage as a full time student. HELD: Appeal allowed. 1) It was incumbent on the respondent on the review application to establish she was unable to become self sufficient. The evidence did not begin to establish that and, in fact, clearly showed that she had made no effort at all to do so within the year allocated by the Ottenbreit order and prior to the filing of the notice of motion, and little effort between that time and the hearing of the application. 2) The order of Sandomirsky J. is set aside and the respondent is ordered to pay $600 per month. 3) The respondent's application for costs is dismissed.",0.5627240143369175,d_2010skca52.txt,"The appellant contests an order for $600.00 monthly spousal support given by a Chambers judge on an application to review a previous order which granted the respondent $300.00 monthly spousal support for a period of 1 year.

He did not indicate why he did not find her capable of full time employment. The Chambers judge made an error in calculating the income of the appellant. He also discounted the expenses borne by the appellant in relation the maintenance of their adult child, who was a full-time student.

The applicant argues that solicitor and client costs of $70,000 should be awarded because the offer to settle of $250,000 is close to the total judgment award of $230,000 including party and party costs of $20,000.

At the end of trial, the applicant requested the Court to reserve on the matter of costs. The applicant intended to make a submission for award of solicitor and clients costs. Evidence was led at trial about insubstantial offers made directly between the parties. Further evidence now indicates that substantial offers were made through council although not led at trial. The applicant argues that solicitor and client costs of $70,000 should be awarded because the offer to settle of $250,000 is close to the total judgment award of $230,000 including party and party costs of $20,000. The respondent takes the position that the estate was willing to pay reasonable maintenance costs and the quantum of maintenance could have been summarily determined without the necessity of extensive discoveries and without a lengthy trial. The respondent submits the approach of a needs-based assessment was upheld by the judgment and is always the approach always taken on behalf of the estate. The respondent argues the real question is whether the parties were acting bona fide during their negotiations and the issue should not be determined on the basis of the closeness of the offers. HELD: Solicitor and Client Costs of $70,000 are not appropriate in this case. The applicant's conduct was not entirely pure. The applicant was made aware in a prior judgment that under The Dependants' Relief Act there is nothing to indicate that a person is entitled to part of an estate as a beneficiary but rather that a beneficiary is entitled to maintenance. In spite of this ruling the applicant continued to claim the whole of the estate and to pursue full disclosure of the financial worth of the estate. Solicitor and client costs are within the discretion of the court but such discretion is exercise only in rare and exceptional circumstances. The conduct of the respondent cannot be characterized as reprehensible, scandalous or outrageous. The respondent's unwillingness to make full financial disclosure did contribute to the increase of costs but is insufficient to merit full solicitor and client costs. The Court awards fixed costs to the applicant in the amount of $47,000 together with disbursements.","The applicant applies for amendment of the judgment of March 19, 1999 insofar as it relates to costs.

HELD: 1)The Court ordered fixed costs to the applicant in the amount of $47,000, together with disbursements.  2)The applicant's conduct was not entirely pure. The total recovery of $230,000 is close to the offer of $250,000 made in September of 1996. 3)The court did not hear argument on the issue of costs at trial; there is a substantial monetary difference between party and party costs awarded in the judgment, and the amount awarded in that case. 4)It is not appropriate for the Court to fix costs in lump sum.  5)In fixing costs, the court reviewed the principles in Nalder v. Hawkins (1833), Myl. K. 243; 39 E.R. 38 (Q.B.).

At the time his driver's license was revoked. At trial the defence argued that the words'motor vehicle' in s. 287(2) do not include an ATV and that even if those words did, the accused should be found not guilty because his license revocation was irrelevant since he could never have been licensed to drive an ATv on the highway. The Crown argued that because the accused was driving motor vehicle on highway and his 'driver's license' was revoked he was guilty of the offence. HELD: The accused was found not convicted of driving a motor vehicle while his license was suspended and the charge under s.287(2 was dismissed. The defence argued the words “motor” in s 287(3) do include an electric vehicle and that the accused could be charged with an offence of operating motor vehicle, or for speeding, or a motor offence since he was never licensed to operate an AT vehicle on the road. The offence was committed while his ATV was registered. The words 'truck' and “across highway” do not appear to include either a vehicle prohibited from operation upon the highway by s. 11. The accused could not have obtained a license to drive the ATV because it was a prohibited vehicle. It was vehicle of the wrong type or class to get a license. Under the Motor Vehicle Act an individual driving vehicle upon highway must be properly licensed.

The Defence argues that it is not that simple. The use of motor vehicles on public highways by those individuals who had their licences or privilege of obtaining licences to do so cancelled, suspended or revoked. Before one can be convicted of such an offence find that it must be proven that they were driving a vehicle of type and class for which they could properly have been permitted to drive it on a highway.

The court found with respect to each issue that the trial judge had not erred: 1) the defence had acknowledged the appellant had used force and that his spouse had not consented to it.

The trial judge was entitled to accept the spouse’s testimony as she was not cross-examined at trial. There was nothing in the transcript that showed the trial judge took a zero tolerance approach.

The evidence was reasonably capable of supporting her decision; and 3) the appellant had not identified how the trial judge had erred on any of the grounds an appeal court could consider.

The accused was convicted of dangerous driving and assault. He was acquitted of all other charges. The complainant testified that she was driving down the road when she noticed that the accused was following her. She described her husband as being aggressive, smelling of alcohol and agitated. She was unable to exit because he stopped beside her. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. The trial judge correctly identified the law in Saskatchewan in relation to this principle and the trial judge made no error on the de minimis issue. The standard of review is not whether the conclusion was correct, or even if an appellate court would have interpreted the evidence differently, but whether there is evidence upon which a trier of fact properly instructed could have reasonably reached the decision. 1)The trial judge's decision focussed primarily on the fact the accused overtook the complainant and 'pushed' her to the side of the road. The lack of care must be serious enough to merit punishment. 2)The accused's driving behaviour was a marked departure from the conduct expected of a reasonably prudent driver in the circumstances. The offence will only be made out if the accused intentionally applied force directly or indirectly to the complainant, the complainant did not consent to the force applied, and she was forced off the road to avoid collision. 3)The Court reviewed the evidence and re-examined the evidence. There was nothing in the transcript which suggested that the judge took a zero tolerance approach to domestic assault without consideration to the fact that the manner in which the appellant drove was inherently dangerous. The evidence was nonetheless reasonably capable of supporting the Court's decision.","There is nothing in the transcript which suggests the trial judge took a zero tolerance approach in rendering her decision. 14: 14 …I am not entitled to re-weigh the evidence and to substitute my own opinion for that of the trial judge.

While the court has jurisdiction to hear human rights complaints, the jurisdiction only arises after the tribunal process has been exhausted. Since the tribunal procedure has not been completed, the portions of the statement of claim dealing with the human rights complaint are stayed on the basis that the underlying issues may only be heard by the court upon application of the Chief Commissioner of the Saskatchewan Human Rights Code pursuant to s. 29.6 of the Code. With respect to the claim that the defendant breached The Animal Protection Act, the essence of the claim is to seek damages against the plaintiff for the loss of the service dog. That portion of the claim must be struck because the plaintiffs cannot circumvent the provisions of The Animal Protection Act, 1999 nor eliminate the defendant’s right to be charged and tried in Provincial Court through the expediency of claiming a declaration in a civil suit. The third claim is that the defendant was negligent in allowing other children to interact with the service dog will not be struck because, assuming the facts in the pleadings are true, the claim for damages is viable. Likewise, the fourth claim that the defendant intentionally inflicted mental and emotional suffering on the autistic plaintiff will not be struck as is not plain and obvious from the pleadings that the claim cannot succeed. The plaintiffs’ application for an interlocutory injunction was dismissed because the claims that have not been struck are not rationally connected to the injunction, even assuming the remaining claims present a serious issue to be tried they do not justify a finding that the plaintiffs will suffer irreparable harm if the injunction is refused and the balance of convenience weighs in favour of not granting an injunction.","The plaintiffs are the five children of the Lawless family who reside near Maryfield, Saskatchewan. Although the family has an English speaking background, the children attended École de Bellegarde, a French language school located approximately 35 km from Maryfield. Their attendance at the school was made possible by provisional permission granted to them by the school administration. In February 2013, the school informed the family that the children's provisional approval to attend the school would not be extended for the 2013-2014 school year. The Lawless children applied to strike out the statement of claim.

The Applicant took the position that because it received tentative approval before the new road standard was incorporated, its application should be grand-parented and it should only have to meet road standards as they existed at the time it received the tentative approval. Technically in the case at bar it was not refused it was simply declared incomplete. This was significant in light of s. 250(3) which gives the development officer his jurisdiction. The application was incomplete and the applicant was entitled to a declaration that the application is complete.","The development officer has a different interpretation. I find that s. 283 represents the legislator’s effort to protect developers exactly like the Applicant who received tentative approval under one regime and are to be protected from any subsequent changes. On the same basis, the Applicant is entitled to a declaration that the application for final subdivision is complete, (again subject to non-contentious error in the plan). [19] It is significant that the right of appeal is from a refusal. Therefore, an order for mandamus is appropriate and I so order. Specifically, I direct the development officer to issue the final approval (subject only to the Applicant correcting the technical error in the plan).",0.3853211009174311,"Land developer after applying for and failing to receive final subdivision approval applied for and received a tentative subdivision approval in 1997. Shortly thereafter, the Municipality passed a new subdivision by-law requiring higher road standards. The applicant applied for final approval in 1998 and received the same in 1998. The next day, the application was determined by the development officer to be incomplete for essentially two reasons: 1) it failed to comply with the new road standards and 2) one of the bearings on the plan was missing. The Municipality relied upon s. 278 of the Municipal Government Act in its submission that the higher road standard represented a major obstacle for the applicant. The Applicant took issue with the development officers decision to declare the application incomplete and looked to this Court for relief.

Certiorari granted; declaration issued that application for final subdivision approval was complete; order for mandamus granted and the development officer directed to issue final approval (subject only to the applicant correcting the technical error in the plan). The development officer misinterpreted the legislation. Since the applicant had already received tentative approval under the old regime, it did not have to meet the new higher standards for final approval. There was not another legal remedy open to the applicant equally convenient, beneficial and appropriate. The right of appeal under the legislation existed only from a refusal by a development officer and technically, this was not a refusal as the application was found incomplete. Both the right of appeal under the Act and the Board's power to grant an appeal were limited, either of which could result in the applicant having no remedy"

The respondent's farming income was determined on a 3 year average as it varied from year to year. The facts justified adding back 25% of the capital cost allowance on the machinery over the last 3 years for Guideline purposes.

Given he paid child support and the extra costs, their income was nearly the same. 5)Of the six quarter sections owned by the respondent prior to marriage, there was no equity in one and the increase in value in the others was marginal.

The court ordered that all or part of the capital cost allowance be taken and added to the Guideline amount of support for the parties to obtain the total payable for the three children. 1) The petitioner was employed and the respondent was unlikely to increase in the near future. Given the fact that after the respondent pays child support (including the extra costs) he will be nearly the same, the Court declined to order any spousal support. 2) The court found that the petitioner was in loco parentis in respect of the farm equipment and that the respondent received the sum of $300 per month from the natural father of the child. The Court found that although the petitioner had only completed seeding on one-third of the land, she was in possession of the other half of it. 3) The Court concluded that the facts justify adding back 25% of the average capital cost on land and buildings, less one-half the costs of the appraisals. 4) The evidence with respect to the remaining issues leaves much to be desired.
