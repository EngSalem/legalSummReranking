Campbell, 2008 NSSC 310 Date: 20081024 Docket: SH 213071 Registry: Halifax Between: Force Construction Limited Plaintiff/ Defendant by Counterclaim and Tammy Campbell Defendant/ Plaintiff by Counterclaim DECISION ON COSTS Judge: The Honourable Justice Kevin Coady Heard: March 3-7, 2008 April 2, 2008, in Halifax, Nova Scotia Written Submissions: September 8, 2008 September 29, 2008 Decision: October 24, 2008 Counsel: Cory Withrow, for the plaintiff Allen Fownes, for the defendant By the Court: [1] This trial was heard over seven days in early March and early April, 2008. The court issued 71 page decision on May 16, 2008. The last paragraph of the decision stated: will accept written submissions on costs if the parties request such relief. However I will state that this is one of those cases where there is no clear winner. Also, I find that both parties contributed to the circumstances that led to this trial. [2] Notwithstanding these words Force Construction Limited indicated that they wished to make submissions on the recovery of costs, disbursements and pre-judgment interest. [3] On September 8, 2008 received submissions from Ms. Campbell. She advances the position articulated by the court, that is, “that the parties should bear their own individual costs.” Alternatively she proposes set off approach. [4] On September 29, 2008 received submissions from Force Construction Limited. They point out that they made Rule 41A formal offer to settle on May 25, 2007 in the amount of $67,800 ($60,000 plus HST). This offer was not accepted by Ms. Campbell and she recovered $64,147.85 after trial. Additionally they argue that they were more successful than Ms. Campbell and that Ms. Campbell was the party most responsible for the necessity of the trial. Force Construction Limited seeks $10,045.00 in trial costs, $850.00 in previously awarded costs, $5,092.57 in disbursements and prejudgment interest of $10,643.24 for total of $26,630.81. [5] The question is whether my after trial perception should be disturbed as result of the above submissions. [6] found both parties to be hostile and aggressive towards each other. They were stubborn and not prepared to give an inch. observed their court reactions to the evidence and their disdain for each other. It was clear to me that they could not see the strengths in their opponents case or the weaknesses in their own. have no hesitation in saying that the only way this dispute could be resolved was by way of trial. [7] There is no clear winner in this case. In fact this is one of those cases where success and failure are shared almost equally. Ms. Campbell was successful on issues relating to the septic system, the in-floor radiant heating system, the laundry room drain, the outdoor drainage system, the heating system and various other smaller items. Force Construction Limited was successful on deficiencies, aspects of the septic system, exterior wall insulation and various other smaller items. Additionally the plaintiff was fully successful on the counterclaim. [8] There were problems associated with the construction of this home where both parties contributed materially. This was clearly the case with deficiencies. Force Construction Limited were often sloppy in their construction. Ms. Campbell refused to recognize proper deficiencies that should have been resolved pursuant to the building contract. There is also an element of this joint contribution in relation to the septic system. [9] The following are factors working against Force Construction Limited’s position on costs: The septic system installation brought Ms. Campbell to tears and have described it as “circus”. It was unwise for them to continue with the peat system when the conventional system proved unworkable. Force Construction Limited did not have the skills required to effectively install the peat system. This failing has effected the property from an aesthetic and future cost perspective. The in-floor heating system turned into disaster for both parties but it was Force Construction Limited that created this problem. am satisfied that they employed unskilled workers who were unable to follow installation instructions properly. The fact that the system extended outside of exterior walls and that nails were driven through piping supports this conclusion. The plaintiffs behaviour in relation to the laundry room is egregious and went long way to create distrust on the part of Ms. Campbell. They recognized that they had “missed it” during construction. They developed “thrown together” solution that did nothing other than to dupe the owner into thinking the problem was solved. The plaintiff accepted at least $39,000.00 in cash outside of the building contract. It was the parties dark little secret until everything fell apart. This fraudulent behaviour on the part of both contributed to the parties sense of mistrust and suspicion. [14] There are number of factors attaching to Ms. Campbell that, no doubt, led to her position that she would not seek costs. They are as follows: Ms. Campbell’s role in fraudulent cash payment that may have been as much as $59,000.00 Ms. Campbell caused the breach in this contract by not paying anything for the house construction notwithstanding she took possession. Ms. Campbell’s counterclaim was entirely unsuccessful because she had no evidence to support these claims. Ms. Campbell’s failure to allow the builder the contractual right to correct the deficiencies. Ms. Campbell advanced large and complex claim surrounding the installation of the levelwall insulation without supporting evidence. [20] In light of the above referenced factors, find that both parties contributed to the length of the trial, the complexities of the issues and the attitude of the parties leading up to, and during, the trial. [21] The only new factor contained in the plaintiff’s submissions is that they made Rule 41A offer to settle on May 25, 2007 in the amount of $60,000.00. This offer was not accepted and the plaintiff was awarded $64,147.85. On the basis of this result the plaintiff feels greater entitlement to costs generally and double costs after May 25, 2007. [22] Civil Procedure Rule 41A.09(1) states: 41A.09.(1) Unless ordered otherwise, where an offer to settle was made by plaintiff at least seven (7) days before the commencement of the trial or hearing of the proceeding and was not revoked or accepted prior to the commencement of the trial or hearing, and where that plaintiff obtains judgment as favourable or more favourable than the terms of the offer to settle, that plaintiff shall be entitled to party and party costs plus taxed disbursements to the date of the service of the offer to settle and thereafter to taxed disbursements and double the party and party costs. [23] Civil Procedure Rule 41A.11 states: 41A.11. Notwithstanding the provisions of this rule, the court, in exercising its discretion as to costs, may take into account any offer to settle made in writing, the date the offer to settle was served, the terms thereof and any other relevant matters. [24] The latter allows this court to consider or not consider an offer to settle in the exercise of its discretion as to costs. It is important that courts support Rule 41A offers when assessing costs post trial. However, in this particular case I have no confidence that any offer made by either the plaintiff or the defendant, short of 100% vindication, would have resolved this case in advance of trial. [25] The intent of Rule 41A is to induce settlements and avoid trials. There should be departure from the prima facie operation of the rule only where the interests of justice clearly require it. Bell Canada v. Olympia North Developments Ltd. (1994), 1994 CanLII 239 (ON CA), 111 D.L.R. (4th) 589 (C.A.). Nonetheless the application of Rule 41A is discretionary matter and exercise my discretion, in this case, against factoring it into my overall assessment of costs. [26] Civil Procedure Rule 63.02 addresses costs generally: 63.02.(1) Notwithstanding the provisions of rule 63.03 to 63.15, the costs of any party, the amount thereof, the party by whom, or the fund or estate or portion of an estate out of which they are to be paid, are in the discretion of the court, and the court may, (a) award gross sum in lieu of, or in addition to any taxed costs; (b) allow percentage of the taxed costs, or allow taxed costs from or up to specific stage of proceeding; [E.62/9(4)] (c) direct whether or not any costs are to be set off. (2) The court in exercising its discretion as to costs may take into account, (a) any payment into court and the amount of the payment; (b) any offer of contribution. [27] The discretion referred to in this rule includes the decision not to award costs in certain circumstances. [28] In Orkin’s The Law of Costs (2nd ed) the exercise of discretion is discussed at page 2-11: The discretion is judicial one to be exercised according to the circumstances of each particular case and based upon material before the court. The discretion is that of the trial judge and its exercise is not to be referred or delegated; nor can it be fettered by any consent of the parties, even though great weight should be given to such consent. The principles that should be observed in exercising discretion as to costs have been defined as follows: First, the principle of indemnity is paramount consideration. Secondly, the courts must approach the matter on the basis that encourages settlement of all actions from the outset. Thirdly, the court must discourage actions and defences which are frivolous. Fourthly, the court must discourage unnecessary steps in the litigation. The view has been expressed that costs should not be imposed as matter of arbitrary or capricious practice by courts, but there should be consistency of pattern. [29] The author goes on to state that “a party’s conduct both before and during the litigation process as well as the degrees of success achieved are relevant to the exercise of the courts discretion as to costs”. have concluded that both parties conduct led to the need for this trial. have also found that success was mixed and it would be impossible to conclude that one was more successful that the other. [30] I exercise my discretion not to award costs and the parties will bear their own costs. This includes disbursements and pre judgment interest, something both parties had to endure. This was case with high settlement prospects but the parties were not really open to this kind of resolution.",2008nssc310.txt,"Despite the court's finding of no clear winner and that both parties had contributed to the circumstances that led to the trial, the plaintiff sought costs on the basis that the defendant had refused its offer to settle.

BETWEEN: HER MAJESTY THE QUEEN, and MICHAEL WAYNE MUISE, Respondent Mr. A.C. Reid and Mr. Peter MacKay, A/C, for the appellant Mr. P.B. Scovil, for the respondent Appeal Heard: October 16, 1990 Judgment Delivered: October 16, 1990 BY THE COURT: Appeal allowed and sentence varied to six months imprisonment for Criminal Code s. 221 offence, per oral reasons for judgment of Clarke, C.J.N.S., Hallett and Matthews, JJ.A. concurring. The reasons for judgment of the court were delivered orally by CLARKE, C.J.N.S.: This is Crown appeal against the sentence imposed on the respondent, Michael Wayne Muise, on February 13, 1990. Mr. Muise pled guilty that on July 29, 1989 he was criminally negligent in the operation of a motor vehicle on Forest Street in Yarmouth and thereby caused bodily harm to Robert Hubbard, contrary to s. 221 of the Criminal Code. He was sentenced to serve 90 days on an intermittent basis, placed on probation for two years, with conditions, required to perform 100 hours of community service and prohibited from operating a motor vehicle for three years. Mr. Muise drove his car at an excessive speed through four‑way stop intersection, without stopping. He collided with car operated by Mr. Hubbard who was making lawful left turn. Mr. Hubbard was injured. Both cars were demolished. At the time of the accident Mr. Muise was disqualified from driving a motor vehicle. In addition, he was intoxicated, he was operating a car that was mechanically defective and he was not wearing a seat belt. That portion of his prior criminal record which is relevant to this offence includes the following:1981 ‑ dangerous driving, for which he was sentenced to serve 21 days1987 ‑ refusal of a Breathalyzer demand1988 ‑ Breathalyzer offence ‑ over 80Mr. Muise\'s prior motor vehicle violations include:August 1985 ‑ driving while disqualifiedDecember 1985 ‑ driving while disqualifiedApril 1987 ‑ driving while disqualified The pre‑sentence report is generally unfavourable. While indicating good work record, it reflects longstanding addiction to alcohol and general disrespect for the law. The effect of the trial judge's remarks at sentencing is that while he recognized the respondent was charged with serious offence from which the general public needs protection, he was not prepared to incarcerate the respondent and thereby take him out of the work force. In short, he decided to give Mr. Muise one more chance. After reviewing the entire record and considering the submissions of counsel made to the court this morning, with respect, we are unable to agree that the trial judge imposed sentence which is fit for the serious circumstances provoked solely by the imprudent, unlawful and exceedingly dangerous acts of the respondent. This court has emphasized, time and again, the need to stress general deterrence in an effort to protect the public against actions such as those committed by Mr. Muise. Similar observations have been made by the Supreme Court of Canada (see R. v. Hufsky (1988) 1988 CanLII 72 (SCC), 84 N.R. 365 at 381). Specific deterrence must also be emphasized. Somehow Mr. Muise must be made to realize that he cannot mix drinking and driving. His prior record is anything but promising. We recognize the need to consider the potential for the reform and rehabilitation of the respondent and in that respect, we have carefully considered what the trial judge said. Having regard for all of the circumstances, it is our unanimous opinion that the sentence is inadequate and fails to reflect the serious nature of the offence and the emphasis that must be placed upon both general and specific deterrence as they relate to the public in general, and the respondent in particular. (See R. v. McVeigh (1985) 1985 CanLII 115 (ON CA), 22 C.C.C. (3d) 145.) Leave to appeal is granted and the appeal is allowed. We order that the sentence be varied to six months imprisonment, with credit being given the respondent for time already served since February 13, 1990. We further order that the probation order be varied by deleting therefrom the provision that the respondent perform 100 hours of community service. In all other respects the probation order and the prohibition order as issued by the trial judge will continue. C.J. N. S. Concurred in: Hallett, J.A. Matthews, J.A.

213,": The ultimate question in this appeal is whether the evidence adduced by the Crown - the defence called no evidence - was insufficient to such a degree that the trial judge\'s verdict of guilty ought to be found by this Court either unreasonable or one that cannot be supported by the evidence and, on the basis of the Yebes v. The Queen (1987), 1987 CanLII 17 (SCC), 36 C.C.C.
The appellants alleged two insufficiencies in the evidence: (i)""The absence of any expert evidence that the injuries sustained by Musam Musleh [the victim-complainant] resulted from any blows such as kicks or punches and as such were the result of an assault.""
In short, they contended that the Crown failed to discharge the burden of proving identity.
The officer testified: It was very evident and plain to see that Mr. Musleh had been severely beaten about the face.
In view of all of this evidence, there was sufficient evidence for the trial judge to reach conclusion respecting the cause of the injuries beyond reasonable doubt without resorting to medical opinion.
On the question of identity, it is true that there was no direct evidence to implicate the appellants.
It is fair to infer that the victim received his injuries at the spot where the pool of blood was found at the southeast corner of the Enjoy Gardens building and next to the 7-Eleven store where the victim went for help after he suffered the injuries.
The resulting hostility on the part of both appellants manifested itself in the bar at the Checkerdome which precipitated the decision by the doormen to escort the appellants and the victim out of the bar onto the parking lot.
The threesome then shortly after were seen to gravitate to the spot where the pool of blood was found.
and also to R. v. MacFarlane (1981), 61 C.C.C.

), where he said: `It is not mandatory for the prosecution to prove that the respondent had the exclusive opportunity in case where other inculpatory circumstances are proved.'
If they did not, then the ""other inculpatory evidence"" of motive and hostility, puts the present case into the category of one where ""something less than exclusive opportunity may suffice"".
In either case the circumstantial evidence of opportunity is sufficient to sustain a finding of identity beyond a reasonable doubt.
Through the cross- examination of one of the Crown witnesses (the counterman at the 7-Eleven), there was an attempt to formulate an explanation for the unexplained injuries by injecting the notion of an unidentified third person having committed the assault.
At best it was speculative and cannot form an evidentiary base for reasonable inference.
To the foregoing may be added the fact that the appellants both failed to testify.
This fact may be taken into account by Court of Appeal when dealing with the question: ""Is this reasonable verdict?""
275 at 280 and VTzeau v. The Queen, [1977] S.C.R.
They rely on s. 651(3) of the Code which provides: 651(3) Where no witnesses are examined for an accused, he or his counsel is entitled to address the jury last, but otherwise counsel for the prosecution is entitled to address the jury last.
It deals with counsel's entitlement to address jury, not with counsel's entitlement to present argument to judge sitting without jury.
The statutory entitlement to address jury last may indeed be substantive right of defence, as observed by Dubin J.A.
The traditional entitlement to present argument to a judge sitting without a jury last, however, is a procedural entitlement to which the curative provision contained in s. 686(1)(b)(iv) applies.","At trial in Provincial Court, the accuseds called no evidence and were convicted.
They appealed on the basis that the Crown's evidence was so insufficient that a verdict of guilty was unreasonable or was one which could not reasonably be supported on the evidence.
HELD: Appeal dismissed.
1)No medical evidence was necessary to establish that the victim's injuries were caused by an assault, given the photographs admitted into evidence, the evidence of the police officer who was called to the scene of the assault and the evidence of the 7-11 clerk who was first approached by the victim for assistance.
2)Evidence of exclusive opportunity was unnecessary to sustain a conviction where there was other circumstantial evidence pointing to the identity of the accuseds.
3)Although a failure to permit an accused who calls no evidence to argue last in a jury trial might be a good ground of appeal, the failure to be permitted to argue last before a judge alone was merely a procedural error which could be cured under the curative provision contained in S.686(1)(b)(iv) of the Criminal Code.",24,"J.

The appellants alleged two insufficiencies in the evidence: (i)""The absence of any expert evidence that the injuries sustained by Musam Musleh [the victim-complainant] resulted from any blows such as kicks or punches and as such were the result of an assault."" In short, they contended that the Crown failed to prove that an offence of assault, or indeed an offence of any kind, had been committed. (ii)""The absence of any evidence that the Appellant[s] delivered any blows to [the victim]"". In short, they contended that the Crown failed to discharge the burden of proving identity. As well, the appellants alleged an error of law by ""convicting on circumstantial evidence, when other reasonable explanations existed"". In our respectful view the appellants failed on all three of those submissions. As to the need for expert evidence to pinpoint thecause of the injuries suffered by the victim, the questionis readily resolved by examining the circumstancesimmediately preceding the infliction of the injuries, bythe description of the injuries given by the victim, (who,although he did not remember how the injuries wereinflicted, had a very good recollection of their nature) bylooking at the photographs of the victim taken thefollowing day, by the opinions of both the counterman atthe 7-Eleven store who saw the victim shortly after theinjuries were inflicted and called the police, and of theinvestigating officer who saw the victim shortly afterthat. The officer testified: It was very evident and plain to see that Mr. Musleh had been severely beaten about the face. The extent of his injuries were actually quite unbelievable. I've been an officer for 18 years, and with 18 years police experience, and I've been to lot of injuries, assaults, and beatings of that nature, and this is one of the worst beatings that I've even [sic] seen, or attacks on an individual, specifically to his face. In view of all of this evidence, there was sufficient evidence for the trial judge to reach conclusion respecting the cause of the injuries beyond reasonable doubt without resorting to medical opinion. On the question of identity, it is true that there was no direct evidence to implicate the appellants. There was, however, strong circumstantial evidence. It is fair to infer that the victim received his injuries at the spot where the pool of blood was found at the southeast corner of the Enjoy Gardens building and next to the 7-Eleven store where the victim went for help after he suffered the injuries. Shortly before the victim went into the 7-Eleven store, three persons saw the victim and the appellants at the spot where the pool of blood was found: Mr. Iluk, the victim's casual acquaintance, and the two doormen at the Checkerdome bar who earlier had escorted the two appellants and the victim out of the bar. In addition to that compelling inculpatory evidence of opportunity, there was the evidence of motive. One of the appellants took umbrage at the victim's having had sexual relations or at least boasting of having had relations with the former's younger sister. The resulting hostility on the part of both appellants manifested itself in the bar at the Checkerdome which precipitated the decision by the doormen to escort the appellants and the victim out of the bar onto the parking lot. The threesome then shortly after were seen to gravitate to the spot where the pool of blood was found. The law in this regard is settled. In Yebes, McIntyre J., after referring to Ferianz, [1962] O.W.N. 40 (Ont. C.A.) and also to R. v. MacFarlane (1981), 61 C.C.C. (2d) 458 (Ont. C.A.) said at p. 432: It may then be concluded that where it is shown that crime has been committed and the incriminating evidence against the accused is primarily evidence of opportunity, the guilt of the accused is not the only rational inference which can be drawn unless the accused had exclusive opportunity. In case, however, where evidence of opportunity is accompanied by other inculpatory evidence, something less than exclusive opportunity may suffice. This was the view expressed by Lacourciï¿½re J.A. in R. v. Monteleone (1982), 1982 CanLII 2162 (ON CA), 67 C.C.C. (2d) 489 at p. 493, 137 D.L.R. (3d) 243 at p. 247, 1982 CanLII 2162 (ON CA), 38 O.R. (2d) 651 (Ont. C.A.), where he said: `It is not mandatory for the prosecution to prove that the respondent had the exclusive opportunity in case where other inculpatory circumstances are proved.' It is also supported by further comments of Martin J.A. in R. v. Stevens (1984), 1984 CanLII 3481 (ON CA), 11 C.C.C. (3d) 518 at p. 534 et seq., and see, as well, Imrich v. The Queen (1977), 34 C.C.C. (2d) 143 at p. 147, 1977 CanLII 27 (SCC), 75 D.L.R. (3d) 243 at pp. 247-8, [1978] S.C.R. 622 at p. 627, per Ritchie J. Here the appellants may or may not have had an exclusive opportunity. If they did not, then the ""other inculpatory evidence"" of motive and hostility, puts the present case into the category of one where ""something less than exclusive opportunity may suffice"". In either case thecircumstantial evidence of opportunity is sufficient tosustain a finding of identity beyond a reasonable doubt. As for other reasonable inferences to be drawn from the evidence, in our respectful view the trial judge was correct to find that the evidence does not yield up any such other reasonable inferences. Through the cross- examination of one of the Crown witnesses (the counterman at the 7-Eleven), there was an attempt to formulate an explanation for the unexplained injuries by injecting the notion of an unidentified third person having committed the assault. The testimony in that respect was highly tentative and unsatisfactory. At best it was speculative and cannot form an evidentiary base for reasonable inference. To the foregoing may be added the fact that the appellants both failed to testify. This fact may be taken into account by Court of Appeal when dealing with the question: ""Is this reasonable verdict?"" (Corbett v. R., 1973 CanLII 199 (SCC), [1975] S.C.R. 275 at 280 and VTzeau v. The Queen, [1977] S.C.R. 277 at 288.) The procedural point raised by the appellants (the calling by the appellants to present argument first when there was no evidence called by them) has no merit. They rely on s. 651(3) of the Code which provides: 651(3) Where no witnesses are examined for an accused, he or his counsel is entitled to address the jury last, but otherwise counsel for the prosecution is entitled to address the jury last. The wording of the provision is clear. It deals with counsel's entitlement to address jury, not with counsel's entitlement to present argument to judge sitting without jury. The statutory entitlement to address jury last may indeed be substantive right of defence, as observed by Dubin J.A. in R. v. Hawke (1975), 1975 CanLII 672 (ON CA), 22 C.C.C. (2d) 19. The traditional entitlement to present argument to a judgesitting without a jury last, however, is a proceduralentitlement to which the curative provision contained in s.686(1)(b)(iv) applies. We would be prepared to invoke thatcurative provision in this instance. In summary, we find that the verdict is not unreasonable, that it can be supported by the evidence, and that the judge made no error of law. In the result theappeal is dismissed.",4_1994canlii4625.txt,"At trial in Provincial Court, the accuseds called no evidence and were convicted.
They appealed on the basis that the Crown's evidence was so insufficient that a verdict of guilty was unreasonable or was one which could not reasonably be supported on the evidence.
HELD: Appeal dismissed.
1)No medical evidence was necessary to establish that the victim's injuries were caused by an assault, given the photographs admitted into evidence, the evidence of the police officer who was called to the scene of the assault and the evidence of the 7-11 clerk who was first approached by the victim for assistance.
2)Evidence of exclusive opportunity was unnecessary to sustain a conviction where there was other circumstantial evidence pointing to the identity of the accuseds.
3)Although a failure to permit an accused who calls no evidence to argue last in a jury trial might be a good ground of appeal, the failure to be permitted to argue last before a judge alone was merely a procedural error which could be cured under the curative provision contained in S.686(1)(b)(iv) of the Criminal Code."

Counsel: Carson Demmans for Pioneer Grain Company Limited Robert C. Magnusson and for the Trustee, Sullivan Associates Inc. Jillian M. Drennan, Student-at-Law FIAT ALLBRIGHT J. August 25, 2006 [1] The applicant, Pioneer Grain Company Limited, seeks from the Court an order pursuant to Rule 30(1) of the general rules under the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act, R.S.C. 1985, c. B-3 setting aside the decision of the registrar dated July 20, 2006, upholding the disallowance of the claim of Pioneer Grain Company Limited, as a secured creditor in the proposal of Shane Paul Sabourin. Additionally, the applicant seeks an order pursuant to Rule 30(2) of the general rules under the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act under s. 187(11) of The Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act extending the time for the bringing of this appeal. [2] On the occasion of the hearing, counsel for the respondent, Sullivan Associates Inc., consented to the extension of the time for the bringing of the appeal, and accordingly the issue relates to whether the applicant has demonstrated basis for the order sought under Rule 30(1) of the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act. [3] By way of background, on February 3, 2004, Shane Paul Sabourin granted Pioneer Grain Company Limited security interest in all of his present and after acquired property. Pioneer Grain Company Limited then filed proof of claim in the proposal of Shane Paul Sabourin setting forth their position as secured creditor based on security agreement dated February 3, 2004. [4] Thereupon, Sullivan Associates Inc., in their capacity as the Trustee of the proposal of Shane Paul Sabourin disallowed the claim of Pioneer Grain Company Limited as secured creditor in Notice of Disallowance of Claim, Right to Priority or Security dated June 7, 2006. [5] On July 20, 2006, the registrar issued decision upholding the disallowance of the claim of Pioneer Grain Company Limited as secured creditor in the proposal of Shane Paul Sabourin. [6] It is the position of the applicant that in doing so, the registrar erred in law by holding that the unperfected security interest of Pioneer Grain Company Limited did not qualify Pioneer Grain Company Limited as secured creditor in the proposal. [7] The registrar in bankruptcy issued formal judgment dated July 20, 2006, and the eight page judgment sets forth in detail the background to the disputed issue, and canvasses the submissions of the applicant and the Trustee, and then provides an analysis leading to the registrar’s conclusion. [8] The registrar defines the issue in the following terms: “Should the applicant be permitted to make claim as secured creditor under the debtor’s proposal?” Under the registrar’s background assessment, the following facts are relevant: [3] The debtor filed proposal on May 18, 2006. The proposal has been approved by the debtor’s creditors. [4] The debtor executed security agreement with the applicant on February 3, 2004. The security agreement was not registered until May 30, 2006. [5] The trustee, after conducting the necessary property searches with the applicable registries, disallowed the applicant’s claim for the following reason: The security agreement dated February 3, 2004 in all of the debtor’s past and after acquired property was not registered pursuant to The Personal Property Security Act prior to the date of the debtor’s Proposal on May 18, 2006. [8] The trustee is of the opinion that the proposal will not be viable if the applicant’s claim is allowed to rank as secured claim. Court approval of the proposal has been adjourned pending the outcome of this appeal. [9] The registrar identifies the appropriate provisions of the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act and of The Personal Property Security Act, 1993, S.S. 1993, c. P-6.2. As noted, the judgment then canvasses the submissions of the applicant and the Trustee. The registrar’s judgment under the heading “Discussion and Analysis” concludes as follows: [19] find myself in agreement with the majority of the submissions of the trustee. Proposals should be encouraged as an alternative to bankruptcy. In order to do so certainty must be part of the equation. Certainty can only be achieved if there is definitive date to determine the claims of creditors. To permit otherwise and endorse what the applicant has done in this situation would basically spell disaster for the efficacy of the proposal process. It would be virtually impossible for trustee to make recommendations and for creditors to make reasoned decisions if the ranking of creditors’ claims could change post filing date. For this reason prefer to utilize section 62.(1.1) as the basis for upholding the trustee’s decision. On May 18, 2006 the trustee had confirmed that the claim of the applicant was not perfected. The trustee’s only choice at this point was to permit the applicant’s claim as unsecured. The applicant’s contention that the debtor knew it had secured claim is not compelling. The trustee is statutorily charged to determine the claims of creditors. This can only be accomplished by the trustee performing various registry searches relevant to fixed date to determine the ranking of creditors. The proposal is developed based upon the trustee’s due diligence in this regard and recommendations are made to the creditors concerning the viability of the proposal. [20] am also of the view that the registration of the security agreement by the applicant subsequent to the date the proposal was filed was contrary to the statutory stay provision as set out in section 69(1)(a) of the BIA. It is undisputed that leave was not obtained for this purpose. [21] word about the trustee’s primary argument that section 20(2)(a) of the PPSA should be utilized to uphold the trustee’s decision. [22] agree that section 66.(1) of the BIA can and should be used when required to make efficient use of the proposal process. also agree that the application of this provision would permit the trustee to utilize both sections 135 and 72(1) of the BIA to efficiently complete the trustee’s duties when determining the claims of creditors. respectfully depart from the trustee’s analysis on the utilization of this provision to permit court to read into section 20(2)(a) of the PPSA that it applies to proposals. would submit that this goes beyond the scope of section 66.(1). In short, the trustee’s analysis that permits court to get to the PPSA is correct but the submission that section 20(2)(a) of the PPSA is applicable to proposals is not supported by the legislation. This can only be accomplished by an amendment to that section. [23] In conclusion, the applicant’s appeal of the disallowance of its claim as secured is dismissed. The trustee did not request costs and none will be awarded. [10] In reviewing the registrar’s judgment, it is clear that he succinctly and accurately sets forth the facts of the matter and to that end there has been no complaint regarding the judgment. [11] Further, I have considered the registrar’s analysis in this matter and can find no fault with his reasoning. The registrar’s interpretation is supported by the legislation and based upon the undisputed facts which he found, the interpretation is reasonable.

(2d) 397, which was upheld on appeal. have opted to give brief oral decision to dispose of this matter, so that the parties may move further as they see fit. The Appeal Court has spoken in the Boyd Garland case and am bound by that decision. If the case is to be re‑considered, then it is proper for the Appeal Division to do that. In the first instance I have to deal with the question of whether or not certiorari lies in this case, with respect to the actions of the Deputy Minister. The whole matter arose as result of June 2, 1991 letter, addressed to Mr. Larkin and signed by Paul F. Langlois, Assistant to the Deputy Minister. No question has been raised as to whether or not Mr. Langlois was speaking for the Deputy Minister at that time, or the Minister, so nothing turns on that point. To quote from Mr. Langlois' letter: ""I have conducted a check of our records and found that Local 116 is neither certified nor is party to a voluntary recognition agreement with Steen Contractors Limited. It has also been confirmed that Steen Contractors Limited is not member of the Labour Management Bureau Limited's Insulator Trade Division. Since none of these conditions have been met, there is no collective agreement binding on the parties and, consequently, no authority to make an appointment under Section 107 of the Trade Union Act."" am of the view, after having reviewed the authorities, that Coopers and Lybrand v. Minister of National Revenue 1978 CanLII 13 (SCC), [1978], 24 N.R. 163 (S.C.C.), concerns an interpretion of the relevant provisions of the Federal Court Act. am more persuaded by the decisions in Morin v. Comite National, 60 N.R. (123) and in Martineau v. Matsqui Institution 1979 CanLII 184 (SCC), [1979], 30 N.R. 119, which, in my view, state the present statuts of the law with respect to an application for certiorari. refer to quotation from Morin v. Comite National, where the Court relied on the British case, Padfield v. Minister of Agriculture [1968], A.C. 997, and quoted from it as follows: The Minister in exercising his powers and duties, conferred upon him by statute, can only be controlled by prerogative writ which will only issue if he acts unlawfully. Unlawful behavior by the Minister may be stated with sufficient accuracy for the purposes of the present appeal (and here adopt the classification of Lord Parker, C.J. in the Divisional Court) (a) by an outright refusal to consider the relevant matters, or (b) by misdirecting himself in point of law, or (c) by taking into account some wholly irrelevant or extraneous consideration, or (d) by wholly omitting to take into account relevant consideration."" I again refer to the letter of Mr. Langlois, where he states:"" ... Local 116 is neither certified nor is party to a voluntary agreement ..."". So, the Minister, in refusing to appoint an arbitrator in this case considered those two preconditions. now refer to page of the Boyd and Garland decision which is at the crux of this entire matter: In its submission Boyd argued that there are only two methods by which an employer can become bound by collective agreement and those are (1) certification and (2) voluntary recognition. In the absence of any statutory provisions, that is quite true. However, by virtue of sections 89 et seq of the Trade Union Act the legislature has provided for a rather hybrid scheme of labour relations applicable to the construction industry. One of the features of that scheme is that an employer can assign its bargaining and negotiating rights to an accredited employers\' association\'. The Labour Management Bureau is just such an association. These provisions, in effect, provide for a third method of union recognition ‑ quite apart from certification and voluntary recognition. Having entered into the agreement with the Labour Management Bureau, Boyd is clearly bound by any agreement made on its behalf'."" then refer to the decision of the Appeal Division in Boyd and Garland where Chipman, J.A. stated, in part: ""I accept he view of Richard, J. that the provisions of Part II establish a scheme where, in the construction industry, there is an exception to the general rule that there are only two methods by which a union can obtain bargaining rights for the employees, i.e. (a) certification and (b) voluntary recognition."" On that basis, it is my finding in accordance with the tests laid out in the Morin case, that Mr. Langlois, misinterpreted point of law and thus gave rise to the review of his decision by this Court. He misdirected himself on a point of law by stating that there were only two methods by which a party can attain bargaining rights, whereas Boyd and Garland, on appeal affirmed there was a third method pursuant to Part 2 of the Act. For that reason, there is sufficient ground to grant an order of mandamus with certiorari in aid, ordering the Minister to exercise his discretion under Section 107(4) of the Trade Union Act according to law as set out in Part 2 of the Act as confirmed by Boyd and Garland. It seems to me that this removes any barrier to appointing an arbitrator to hear the subject grievance. The parties will bear their own costs on this application. J.

Quite apart from certification and voluntary recognition, the union could attain bargaining rights pursuant to Part II of the Trade Union Act, which allowed an employer in the construction industry to assign bargaining and negotiating rights to an 'accredited employers' association' such as the Construction Management Labour Bureau Ltd.
The Court ordered the Minister to exercise his discretion under s.107(4) of the Act according to law as set out in Part II of the Act and confirmed by the Appeal Division in Boyd &amp; Garland."
453,"The issues in this case began long before the notice of termination of tenancy (which ultimately prompted this Court's involvement) and stem from number of complaints made by both the tenants and the landlord.
The tenants applied first to the Rentalsman's Office early in 1994 for an order directing the landlord to do certain repairs and maintenance.
On this same day the landlord served the tenants with a notice of termination of tenancy.
He did not, as the tenant had requested, prohibit the landlord from unauthorized visits or direct the removal of particular clause in the tenancy agreement but chose instead to refer the parties to the appropriate provisions in The Residential Tenancies Act R.S.S.
The tenants appealed this decision to Matheson J. who dismissed the appeal in an unreported judgment dated June 10, 1994 (Q.B.M.
The tenants' response to receipt of the termination notice was not to move.
They claimed the termination notice was meant to punish them for applying to the Rentalsman's Office for protection of their rights.
All this resulted in another hearing before the same deputy rentalsman who had heard the previous application on May 10, 1994 to consider the landlord's claim for possession.
The landlord included among his reasons for wanting possession two letters indicating his desire to sell the premises and his ill health necessitating sale.
This decision displays the animosity which continued to exist between the tenants and the landlord.
The final portion of the decision reads: Having reviewed the various differences between this landlord and tenant over the course of two hearings, am of the opinion that there is little or no chance for the parties to reconcile their differences whatever they may be and the landlord was justified in serving notice to terminate.
DECISION: Having so found, make the following Order; This tenancy will terminate as of midnight on the 3lst of July 1994.
Order Writ of Possession be issued directing the Sheriff at the Judicial Centre of Regina to place this landlord in possession of these premises no sooner than the lst of August 1994.
To assist with relocation costs, the total rent for June and July is abated.
The landlord's specific concern was the abatement of rent for June and July which amounted to $1,150.
The tenants then applied for leave to appeal to this Court under s. 49(2) of The Residential Tenancies Act.
Leave was granted on the question of ""whether the learned chambers judge correctly found an error of law or want of jurisdiction entitling him to overturn the decision of deputy rentalsman Slinn abating the rent for June and July.""
Justice Sirois's function was governed by s. 49(1) of The Residential Tenancies Act: 49(1) Any person who is aggrieved by decision or order of the Rentalsman may appeal the decision or order on question of law or of jurisdiction of the Rentalsman to judge of Her Majesty's Court of Queen's Bench for Saskatchewan within 30 days of the date of the decision or order.
Although not specifically stated, this Court's function must also be limited to determining whether Sirois J. erred in so concluding.
The source of the Court of Appeal's jurisdiction is s. 49(2): 49(2) Any person who is aggrieved by decision or order of judge of Her Majesty's Court of Queen's Bench for Saskatchewan pursuant to sections 47.1 to 47.3 or pursuant to subsection (1) of this section may appeal the decision or order to the Court of Appeal within 30 days of the date of the decision or order with leave of the Court of Appeal or judge of that court.
One turns first to determine whether the deputy rentalsman had the power to abate rent in this case.
(4) Where, in any proceeding by landlord for possession of residential premises, it appears to the Rentalsman that: (a) notice to terminate the tenancy agreement was given to the tenant because of the tenant's bona fide complaint to the Rentalsman or to any other agency of the Government of Saskatchewan alleging the contravention of any statute, bylaw or other law dealing with health or safety standards, including housing standards; (b) notice to terminate the tenancy agreement was given to the tenant because of the tenant's attempt to secure or enforce his rights under this Act; or (c) on the evidence presented, the landlord has contravened term or condition of the agreement or has contravened any condition set out in section 20; the tenant may in the same proceedings apply to the Rentalsman for relief and the Rentalsman may grant such relief, including relief with respect to payment of rent or reasonable compensation and the granting of an injunction to restrain any contravention as mentioned in clause (c), as he considers just having regard to the proceedings, the conduct of the parties and to all other circumstances.
The deputy rentalsman did not make it clear pursuant to which section he ordered rent to be abated.
That the deputy rentalsman had the authority to abate rent under s. 47(4) is clear on the face of the section.
In s. 47(2) the legislature has used general words: ""may make any order the Rentalsman considered just and equitable"" followed by specific types of orders.
The list of specific orders might have been given because they are extraordinary: they are either injunctive, require the payment of money or give possession of the premises to the landlord.
Was the list intended to be exhaustive as to extraordinary powers or was it given out of an abundance of caution?
The power to abate rent on landlord's application for possession is specifically mentioned in s. 47(4).
Does this limit further the rentalsman's powers under s. 47(2)?
The first statement saying the landlord was justified in serving the termination notice would seem to rule out any possibility of jurisdiction falling under the rubric of s. 47(4).
But the last statement would lead one to conclude that the differences arose, in part, from reasonable complaints by tenants which would then justify the abatement of rent under s. 47(4).
Nor should he be so limited by s. 47(4) to ordering an abatement if he finds the landlord was only motivated by one reason, i.e., to rid himself of his tenants for their reasonable complaints.
(One could envisage fact situations where the rentalsman may have to consider the predominate motivating reason, but we do not have that type of case here.)
This obviates the necessity of deciding whether he also had the jurisdiction to abate rent under s. 47(2).
The landlord did not articulate legal reason which would preclude the deputy rentalsman from making the decision he made.
The landlord may be justified in his concern if it were required in all cases, but that is not the case here.
In this case, the deputy rentalsman heard the tenants and the landlord in two separate hearings and had access to Matheson J.
The landlord in the second hearing wanted writ of possession so as to be able to sell the premises not to re-rent them.
The landlord received his writ of possession, but not for two months hence.
Both sides were intent on complete success and the deputy rentalsman sought an order which would give each side part of what they had demanded.
It is not our task to pass judgment on the behaviour of either tenants or landlords as it relates to the exercise of their right.
It must be kept in mind we are not dealing with The Landlord and Tenant Act but rather The Residential Tenancies Act passed in an attempt to provide tenants with some security of tenure (see: Williams Rhodes Canadian Law of Landlord and Tenant 6th ed.
The Commission could receive new evidence and make any just and equitable order (see old s. 50).
There is no longer full re-hearing on an appeal from the rentalsman's decisions.
On this basis some deference must be shown to those aspects of the rentalsman\'s decisions which reflect an exercise of discretion.
In the result, the appeal is allowed and the decision of the rentalsman restored.
As neither the landlord nor the tenant was represented by counsel, there will be no order as to costs.","The landlord applied for possession of residential premises after his tenants refused to vacate in response to a written notice to vacate.
The deputy rentalsman ordered that the landlord should have possession, but also ordered that the last two months rent would abate in order to assist the tenants with their moving costs.
The landlord appealed the abatement of rent and a chambers judge reversed the deputy rentalsman.
The tenants sought and were granted leave to appeal the chambers judge and this appeal resulted.
HELD: Appeal allowed.
1)The chambers judge could only reverse the deputy rentalsman if he exceeded his jurisdiction or erred in law.
2)The deputy rentalsman had jurisdiction to order an abatement of rent pursuant to S.47(4) of the Act.
3)The jurisdiction is a discretionary one.
The court will therefore show some deference to a decision of the rentalsman involving this jurisdiction.
In this case the deputy rentalsman made no reversible error.",34,"THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR SASKATCHEWAN HELMUT (HAL) REICH (APPELLANT) and ACHIM LOHSE and ISABELLE DAILLY (RESPONDENTS) APPELLANTS and THE OFFICE OF THE RENTALSMAN (RESPONDENT) CORAM: The Honourable Mr. Justice Wakeling The Honourable Mr. Justice Sherstobitoff The Honourable Madam Justice Jackson COUNSEL: The appellant Mr. Reich appeared on his own behalf The respondents Mr. Lohse and Ms. Dailly were represented by Mr. Lohse Mr. Wayne Mulholland for the respondent Rentalsman DISPOSITION: Appeal Heard: 25 July, 1994 Appeal Allowed: August, 1994 Reasons: August, 1994 On Appeal From: QBM 456/94, Regina Appeal File: 1915 Reasons by: The Honourable Madam Justice Jackson In concurrence: The Honourable Mr. Justice Wakeling The Honourable Mr. Justice Sherstobitoff JACKSON J.A. The issues in this case began long before the notice of termination of tenancy (which ultimately prompted this Court's involvement) and stem from number of complaints made by both the tenants and the landlord. The landlord, Mr. Helmut Reich, began leasing his premises to Achim Lohse and Isabelle Dailly on August l, l993. The tenancy was not an amicable one. The tenants applied first to the Rentalsman's Office early in 1994 for an order directing the landlord to do certain repairs and maintenance. hearing was held on March 21, 1994. On this same day thelandlord served the tenants with a notice of termination oftenancy. The deputy rentalsman who conducted the hearing on this first complaint released his decision on May 3, 1994 at which time he ordered the landlord to remove stove, replace refrigerator and make appropriate repairs to floor tiles, fence and gate. He did not, as the tenant had requested, prohibit the landlord from unauthorized visits or direct the removal of particular clause in the tenancy agreement but chose instead to refer the parties to the appropriate provisions in The Residential Tenancies Act R.S.S. 1978, c. R-22. The tenants appealed this decision to Matheson J. who dismissed the appeal in an unreported judgment dated June 10, 1994 (Q.B.M. No. 446, Judicial Centre of Regina). The tenants did not appeal that decision further. Meanwhile the landlord's termination notice still had to be dealt with. The tenants' response to receipt of the termination notice was not to move. They claimed the termination notice was meant to punish them for applying to the Rentalsman's Office for protection of their rights. All this resulted in another hearing before the same deputy rentalsman who had heard the previous application on May 10, 1994 to consider the landlord's claim for possession. The landlord included among his reasons for wanting possession two letters indicating his desire to sell the premises and his ill health necessitating sale. The deputy rentalsman's decision on the landlord's application for possession was rendered May 13, 1994. This decision displays the animosity which continued to exist between the tenants and the landlord. The final portion of the decision reads: Having reviewed the various differences between this landlord and tenant over the course of two hearings, am of the opinion that there is little or no chance for the parties to reconcile their differences whatever they may be and the landlord was justified in serving notice to terminate. The differences between the Landlord and Tenants did not solely arise from reasonable complaints by tenants. DECISION: Having so found, make the following Order; This tenancy will terminate as of midnight on the 3lst of July 1994. Order Writ of Possession be issued directing the Sheriff at the Judicial Centre of Regina to place this landlord in possession of these premises no sooner than the lst of August 1994. To assist withrelocation costs, the total rent for June and July isabated. Now it was the landlord\'s turn to appeal the deputyrentalsman\'s decision. The landlord's specific concern was the abatement of rent for June and July which amounted to $1,150. The matter was heard by Justice Sirois on June 2l, l994. Justice Sirois ordered, without giving reasons, thatthe deputy rentalsman\'s order was to stand with respect totermination of the tenancy on July 31, 1994 (as opposed tosome earlier date). However, he reversed the decision toabate rent for June and July. The tenants then applied for leave to appeal to thisCourt under s. 49(2) of The Residential Tenancies Act. Leave was granted on the question of ""whether the learnedchambers judge correctly found an error of law or want ofjurisdiction entitling him to overturn the decision ofdeputy rentalsman Slinn abating the rent for June andJuly."" Justice Sirois's function was governed by s. 49(1) of The Residential Tenancies Act: 49(1) Any person who is aggrieved by decision or order of the Rentalsman may appeal the decision or order on question of law or of jurisdiction of the Rentalsman to judge of Her Majesty's Court of Queen's Bench for Saskatchewan within 30 days of the date of the decision or order. Therefore, it can be assumed that, in overturning thedecision of the rentalsman with respect to the abatement ofrent, Justice Sirois decided the rentalsman either: (i)exceeded his jurisdiction; or (ii) erred in law. Although not specifically stated, this Court's function must also be limited to determining whether Sirois J. erred in so concluding. The source of the Court of Appeal's jurisdiction is s. 49(2): 49(2) Any person who is aggrieved by decision or order of judge of Her Majesty's Court of Queen's Bench for Saskatchewan pursuant to sections 47.1 to 47.3 or pursuant to subsection (1) of this section may appeal the decision or order to the Court of Appeal within 30 days of the date of the decision or order with leave of the Court of Appeal or judge of that court. One turns first to determine whether the deputy rentalsman had the power to abate rent in this case. The relevant provisions of The Residential Tenancies Act are ss. 47(1)(a),(1.1),(1.2),(2) and (4): 47(1) An application for an order respecting any residential tenancy dispute may be made: (a) to the Rentalsman, in the form and manner that the Rentalsman may direct; (2) On receiving an application pursuant to clause (1)(a) or determining pursuant to subsection (1.2) that hearing should be held, the Rentalsman: (a)may direct an investigation into the matter; (b)shall hold hearing; (c)after holding the hearing pursuant to clause (b), may make any order the Rentalsman considers just and equitable in the circumstances including an order: (i)directing any person found contravening or failing to comply with tenancy agreement, this Act, the regulations or an order made pursuant to this Act to stop that contravention or failure and to so comply; (ii)requiring tenant to pay to the Rentalsman all or any part of any instalment of rent otherwise payable to the landlord; (iii)requiring the payment of damages; (iv)granting possession of residential premises; and (d)shall, where an order is made pursuant to sub-clause (c)(ii), use the moneys paid to the Rentalsman to remedy the landlord's contravention of or failure to comply with tenancy agreement, this Act, the regulations or an order made pursuant to this Act. (4) Where, in any proceeding by landlord for possession of residential premises, it appears to the Rentalsman that: (a) notice to terminate the tenancy agreement was given to the tenant because of the tenant's bona fide complaint to the Rentalsman or to any other agency of the Government of Saskatchewan alleging the contravention of any statute, bylaw or other law dealing with health or safety standards, including housing standards; (b) notice to terminate the tenancy agreement was given to the tenant because of the tenant's attempt to secure or enforce his rights under this Act; or (c) on the evidence presented, the landlord has contravened term or condition of the agreement or has contravened any condition set out in section 20; the tenant may in the same proceedings apply to the Rentalsman for relief and the Rentalsman may grant such relief, including relief with respect to payment of rent or reasonable compensation and the granting of an injunction to restrain any contravention as mentioned in clause (c), as he considers just having regard to the proceedings, the conduct of the parties and to all other circumstances. The deputy rentalsman did not make it clear pursuant to which section he ordered rent to be abated. Under s. 47(2), the rentalsman may make ""any order [he or she] considers just and equitable"" including an order (i) stopping any contravention under the Act; (ii) requiring tenant to pay to the rentalsman any rent; (iii) requiring damages to be paid; and (iv) granting possession of residential premises. Under s. 47(4), the rentalsman may, among other things, grant relief with respect to rent, if it appears to the rentalsman: (i) the tenancy was being terminated because of the tenant's bona fide complaint or attempt to enforce rights under the Act; or (ii) the landlord had contravened the agreement or s. 20 of the Act. (The deputy rentalsman has all the powers of the rentalsman (see s. 7(3) of the Act). That the deputy rentalsman hadthe authority to abate rent under s. 47(4) is clear on theface of the section. Whether he also had the authority under s. 47(2) depends on the construction of s. 47(2). In s. 47(2) the legislature has used general words: ""may make any order the Rentalsman considered just and equitable"" followed by specific types of orders. The list of specific orders might have been given because they are extraordinary: they are either injunctive, require the payment of money or give possession of the premises to the landlord. The abatement of rent, too, might be regarded as extraordinary. Was the list intended to be exhaustive as to extraordinary powers or was it given out of an abundance of caution? The power to abate rent on landlord's application for possession is specifically mentioned in s. 47(4). Does this limit further the rentalsman's powers under s. 47(2)? The deputy rentalsman made two statements which are somewhat contradictory. He said: (i)""the landlord was justified in serving notice to terminate""; and (ii)""the differences between the landlord and tenants did not solely arise from reasonable complaints by tenants."" The first statement saying the landlord was justified in serving the termination notice would seem to rule out any possibility of jurisdiction falling under the rubric of s. 47(4). But the last statement would lead one to conclude that the differences arose, in part, from reasonable complaints by tenants which would then justify the abatement of rent under s. 47(4). If the differences did not arise ""solely"" from the tenants' reasonable complaints, they must have arisen in part from such complaints. The rentalsman's powers under s. 47(4) cannot be so restricted that he must find precisely the reason for the landlord's desire for possession. Nor should he be so limited by s. 47(4) to ordering an abatement if he finds the landlord was only motivated by one reason, i.e., to rid himself of his tenants for their reasonable complaints. It would be rare case, indeed, where the rentalsman could abate rent if he had to first find the landlord was motivated only by such reason. (One could envisage fact situations where the rentalsman may have to consider the predominate motivating reason, but we do not have that type of case here.) On balance, it is my interpretation of the deputy rentalsman's order that he was exercising jurisdiction under s. 47(4), and it was possible for him to so exercise that jurisdiction. This obviates the necessity of deciding whether he also had the jurisdiction to abate rent under s. 47(2). Having concluded that the deputy rentalsman had the authority to abate rent, it follows that Sirois J. erred in overturning the deputy rentalsman's decision to abate the rent for June and July. The landlord did not articulate legal reason which would preclude the deputy rentalsman from making the decision he made. The landlord, in detailed written submissions, indicated his concern for himself and other landlords if required automatically to provide an abatement of rent if they wished to legitimately terminate tenancy. The landlord may be justified in his concern if it were required in all cases, but that is not the case here. Therentalsman has a discretion to determine those cases wherean abatement of rent is appropriate. Whether the rentalsman orders an abatement of rent is the rentalsman's decision to make (assuming it is otherwise made in accordance with the law.) In this case, the deputy rentalsman heard the tenants and the landlord in two separate hearings and had access to Matheson J.'s written judgment. The landlord in the second hearing wanted writ of possession so as to be able to sell the premises not to re-rent them. The tenant did not want to give up possession. The landlord received his writ of possession,but not for two months hence. The deputy rentalsman abatedthose two months rent. Both sides were intent on complete success and the deputy rentalsman sought an order which would give each side part of what they had demanded. Our jurisdiction and that of the Queen's Bench on an appeal from the rentalsman is simply supervisory one with respect to the interpretation of the law and the rentalsman's jurisdiction. It is not our task to pass judgment on the behaviour of either tenants or landlords as it relates to the exercise of their right. That is the function of the rentalsman. It must be kept in mind we are not dealing with The Landlord and Tenant Act but rather The Residential Tenancies Act passed in an attempt to provide tenants with some security of tenure (see: Williams Rhodes Canadian Law of Landlord and Tenant 6th ed. (vol. 2) p.17-1). This protection was given to tenants to address the unequal bargaining power between landlords and tenants (see: Residential Tenancies in British Columbia by G.B. Klippert at p. 42 and Residential Tenancies (3rd ed.) by D.H.L. Lamont Q.C. at pp.1-4). Prior to August l4, 1992, appeals from the rentalsman's decisions were taken to the Rent Appeal Commission (see old s. 49). These appeals were far-ranging. The Commission could receive new evidence and make any just and equitable order (see old s. 50). The Residential Tenancies Amendment Act, 1992 s.s. 1992, c. 37 (which came into force on August 14, 1992) abolished the Rent Appeal Commission and permitted applications to be made directly to the Queen's Bench, in certain circumstances (see: ss. 47(1)(b), 47.1 to 47.3), or to the rentalsman (see s. 47(1)(a) above). Wherethe application is made to the rentalsman, the appellatejurisdiction of the Queen\'s Bench is restricted to findingerror of law or jurisdiction. The jurisdiction previously given to the Rent Appeal Commission has not been given to the Queen's Bench. There is no longer full re-hearing on an appeal from the rentalsman's decisions. On this basissome deference must be shown to those aspects of therentalsman\'s decisions which reflect an exercise ofdiscretion. In the result, the appeal is allowed and the decisionof the rentalsman restored. As neither the landlord nor the tenant was represented by counsel, there will be no order as to costs.

55, it was held that “[a] decision will be unreasonable only if there is no line of analysis within the given reasons that could reasonably lead the tribunal from the evidence before it to the conclusion at which it arrived.” 2.
[12] The applicant argues that the prohibition on the reimbursement of the cost of medical marihuana exceeds the Board’s jurisdiction.
[14] The Board found that it had the power to create POL 10/2011 as an exercise of the exclusive jurisdiction granted to it under s. 22(1) of the Act.
While it is certainly arguable that the Board cannot rely on blanket prohibition to deny the reimbursement of particular drug, this does not appear to be the case here.
The use of the word “shall” in s. 106(1) requires the Board to provide medical aid to injured employees.
[19] The applicant further argues that decision to ban the reimbursement of specific type of drug effectively forces patients to take different course of treatment from that recommended by their doctor.
[23] Based on the wording of the Act and the context of the relevant provisions, I am of the view that the Board’s interpretation that the Act granted the Board discretion to refuse to reimburse a specific medical treatment is reasonable.
[24] Section 22(1) grants the Board “...exclusive jurisdiction to examine, hear and determine all matters and questions arising under this Act and any other matter in respect of which power, authority or discretion is conferred upon the board ...”.
There is nothing in the language of s. 106(1) indicating that determining what “may be necessary” for particular patient is outside the ambit of the Board’s exclusive jurisdiction.
[27] am of the view that the conclusion that the Board has discretion to refuse to reimburse particular treatment falls within the range of “possible acceptable” interpretations of the Act.
[29] The applicant takes the position that the Board has denied reimbursement for medication that had worked for Mr. Heilman for 10 years and that had been recommended by an expert doctor.
[32] According to the respondent, the Board’s decision is “...clearly within the range of reasonable outcomes.
[34] The Board’s conclusion falls within range of acceptable outcomes and is supported by the evidence.
Many studies noted side effects and most recommended further research before drawing definitive conclusions on the use of marihuana as medicine.
[35] The Board’s conclusion led to its ruling that the cost of medical marihuana should not be reimbursed as the Board can deny reimbursement for treatment that has not been proven safe or effective.
The Board’s decision to decline reimbursement on the basis that medical marihuana is not proven and therefore not “necessary or required” is reasonable when one considers the availability of Sativex.
[40] The Board refused reimbursement on the basis that medical marihuana is potentially unsafe and its positive effects are clinically unproven.
[42] Again, there is no evidence that the Board made its decision on the basis of considerations such as the potential political consequences of paying for medical marihuana.","HELD: The application was dismissed.
With respect to the issues, the Court found: 1) that the board had not relied upon the clause in the Policy Statement but on the evidence before it.
It was not necessary to decide then whether the Policy Statement was ultra vires; 2) that the board’s interpretation that the Act granted discretion to the board to refuse to reimburse a specific medical treatment was reasonable; 3) that the board’s conclusion was reasonable.
The scientific studies did not definitively stated that medical marijuana was effective.
In some situations where a patient’s only recourse would to be to use a non-clinically approved drug whose safety and efficacy was still questioned, a determination that the medical aid was not necessary or required might be unreasonable, but not in this case where the applicant declined to try Sativex;

Sarauer for the applicant Leonard D. Andrychuk Q.C. for the respondent JUDGMENT WHITMORE J.A. November 14, 2013 Ex officio INTRODUCTION [1] This is an application for judicial review of decision of The Workers’ Compensation Board (the “Board”) denying the applicant reimbursement for the cost of the applicant’s medical marihuana. [2] The applicant suffers from chronic back pain and muscle spasms as result of work related injuries incurred in 1981 and 1982. The respondent concedes the applicant is entitled to compensation under The Workers’ Compensation Act, 1979, S.S. 1979, c. W-17.1 (the “Act”). [3] The applicant has been prescribed numerous medications for pain over the years with varying degrees of success. In 2002, on the recommendation of his physician, he commenced using medical marihuana. The marihuana provides him more effective relief without the severe side effects that accompany other drugs. His primary method of marihuana consumption is through baked goods or vaporizer, although he smokes it when other methods are not readily available. [4] In 2011, the Board denied the applicant reimbursement for the cost of his medical marihuana. Upon an application for judicial review of that decision, Justice McMurtry found that the Board improperly fettered its discretion by relying on the submissions of the Board’s medical consultant and medical department. See: Heilman v. Saskatchewan (Workers’ Compensation Board), 2012 SKQB 361 (CanLII), 404 Sask. R. 134. Justice McMurtry remitted the matter to the Board. The applicant brings this application to review the Board’s decision to once again deny reimbursement to the applicant. 1. What is the standard of review of the Board’s decision to deny reimbursement of Mr. Heilman’s medical marihuana costs? 2. Did the Board exceed its jurisdiction in enacting Policy Statement of POL 10/2011 to deny reimbursement of medical marihuana claims in all cases? 3. Does the Board have the jurisdiction to deny reimbursement for specific medical treatment? 4. Did the Board’s decision to deny reimbursement to Mr. Heilman meet the appropriate standard of review? 5. Was the Board’s decision made for an improper purpose? Did the Board base its decision on irrelevant considerations? 1. What is the standard of review of the Board’s decision to deny reimbursement of Mr. Heilman’s medical marihuana costs? [5] In the earlier decision referred to, Justice McMurtry determined that the applicable standard of review was that of reasonableness. The parties agree that reasonableness is the appropriate standard of review for this matter as well. [6] Dunsmuir v. New Brunswick, 2008 SCC (CanLII), [2008] S.C.R. 190 (“Dunsmuir”) established that there are only two standards of review, that of reasonableness and that of correctness. In Mellor v. Saskatchewan (Workers’ Compensation Board), 2012 SKCA 10 (CanLII), 385 Sask. R. 210 (“Mellor”) at para. 19, the Court held that the standard of review for decisions of The Workers’ Compensation Board will be reasonableness if the question before the Board “...relates to the interpretation and application of the Act, is within the Board’s expertise and does not raise issues of general legal importance...”. In the case before me, the Board is interpreting and applying the Act. There are no issues of general legal importance. Thus the appropriate standard of review in this matter is the standard of reasonableness. [7] In Pasiechnyk v. Saskatchewan (Workers’ Compensation Board), 1997 CanLII 316 (SCC), [1997] S.C.R. 890, [1997] S.C.J. No. 74 (QL), the Supreme Court specifically found that the Saskatchewan Workers’ Compensation Board has significant expertise in dealing with all aspects of the workers’ compensation system. [8] In reviewing the reasonableness standard in Mellor, the Court of Appeal held that decision is reasonable if it falls within the range of “possible acceptable outcomes”. In Dunsmuir, at para. 47, it was held that “...[i]n judicial review, reasonableness is concerned mostly with the existence of justification, transparency and intelligibility within the decision‑making process. But it is also concerned with whether the decision falls within range of possible, acceptable outcomes which are defensible in respect of the facts and law.” [9] In the case of Canada (Director of Investigation and Research Competition Act) v. Southam Inc., 1997 CanLII 385 (SCC), [1997] S.C.R. 748, [1996] S.C.J. No. 116 (QL) at para. 56, it was held that decision is unreasonable where it “is not supported by any reasons that can stand up to somewhat probing examination.” In the case of Law Society of New Brunswick v. Ryan, 2003 SCC 20 (CanLII), [2003] S.C.R. 247 at para. 55, it was held that “[a] decision will be unreasonable only if there is no line of analysis within the given reasons that could reasonably lead the tribunal from the evidence before it to the conclusion at which it arrived.” 2. Did the Board exceed its jurisdiction in enacting Policy Statement of POL 10/2011 to deny reimbursement of medical marihuana claims in all cases? [10] The Board has approved Policy 10/2011 which contains specific policy for the reimbursement of medications which includes policy regarding reimbursement for medical marihuana, which does not allow reimbursement for medical marihuana. [11] Statement of Policy 10/2011 reads as follows: 5. The WCB will not reimburse the costs of obtaining, growing, or using medical marihuana (i.e., the smoked form). [12] The applicant argues that the prohibition on the reimbursement of the cost of medical marihuana exceeds the Board’s jurisdiction. Although the applicant acknowledges that clause was not specifically mentioned in the decision, he argues the clause was influential in the decision and should be held ultra vires. [13] The respondent argues that clause is not relevant as the Board did not apply or rely on it in reaching its decision. The respondent states that the Board’s decision was based on its authority under the Act rather than relying on clause 5. The respondent further states that the Board decided the issue of reimbursement by asking whether, based on the evidence, medical marihuana was “appropriate and needed” to treat Mr. Heilman. [14] The Board found that it had the power to create POL 10/2011 as an exercise of the exclusive jurisdiction granted to it under s. 22(1) of the Act. The respondent argues there is no evidence that the Board relied on clause to deny reimbursement. Rather, the decision was based on medical research and on the fact that Mr. Heilman had not tried the marihuana drug derivative Sativex. [15] am in agreement with the position of the respondent. While it is certainly arguable that the Board cannot rely on blanket prohibition to deny the reimbursement of particular drug, this does not appear to be the case here. The Board did not rely on Policy Statement 5 or even mention it in its decision, but based its decision on the evidence before it. Therefore, even if Policy Statement is ultra vires, it does not decide this matter. It is not necessary to decide whether Policy Statement 5 is ultra vires. 3. Does the Board have the jurisdiction to deny reimbursement for specific medical treatment? [16] The relevant statutory provisions of the Act are as follows: 21.1(1) The board shall: ... (b) arrange to provide any medical aid or treatment that may be required in the circumstances as result of injuries to workers; 22(1) The board shall have exclusive jurisdiction to examine, hear and determine all matters and questions arising under this Act and any other matter in respect of which power, authority or discretion is conferred upon the board and, without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the board shall have exclusive jurisdiction to determine: (a) whether any condition or death in respect of which compensation is claimed was caused by an injury; (b) whether any injury has arisen out of or in the course of an employment; (c) the existence and degree of functional impairment to worker by reason of an injury; (d) the permanence of functional impairment resulting from an injury; (e) the degree of diminution of earning capacity caused by an injury; (f) the average earnings; (g) the existence of the relationship of any member of the family of worker and the degree of dependency; (h) whether any industry or any part, branch or department of any industry is within the scope of this Act and the class to which it is assigned; (i) whether any worker is within the scope of this Act. (2) The decision and finding of the board under this Act upon all questions of fact and law are final and conclusive and no proceedings by or before the board shall be restrained by injunction, prohibition or other proceeding or removable by certiorari or otherwise in any court. (3) Notwithstanding subsection (2), the board may reconsider any matter that it has dealt with or may rescind, alter or amend any decision or order it has made. 106(1) Every worker who is entitled to compensation or who is disabled only on the day of the accident shall be entitled without charge to: (a) any medical aid that may be necessary as result of the injury; (b) any other treatment by health care professional; (c) any artificial member or apparatus that may be necessary as result of the injury, and to have any artificial limbs and eyes and any surgical appliances such as belts, braces, supports and orthopaedic shoes, whether provided before or after this section comes into force, repaired, maintained and renewed when necessary by reason of accident or ordinary wear and tear; (d) any transportation or sustenance occasioned by the medical aid. (2) Medical aid shall be furnished or arranged for by the board as it may approve. [17] The Board found that it had authority to determine “if it will reimburse any worker for medications whose medical efficacy has not been established” pursuant to its exclusive jurisdiction granted by s. 22(1) to determine all matters in questions arising under the Act. [18] The applicant argues that the Act does not grant such broad authority. Instead, s. 22(1) must be read in context with s. 106(1). According to the applicant, neither ss. 106(1) or (2) permits the Board to decide that particular medical aid will not be reimbursed. The use of the word “shall” in s. 106(1) requires the Board to provide medical aid to injured employees. [19] The applicant further argues that decision to ban the reimbursement of specific type of drug effectively forces patients to take different course of treatment from that recommended by their doctor. [20] The respondent’s position is that the Board’s conclusion that the Act provides discretion to determine whether or not to reimburse the cost of the drug is “well within the bounds of reasonableness.” (Brief, para. 36) The respondent states that s. 21.1(1)(b) and ss. 106(1) and (2) must be read together with s. 22(1) which expressly grants the Board exclusive jurisdiction to hear and determine “all matters and questions arising under this Act ...”. [21] According to the respondent, the question of whether medical aid is “required in the circumstances” under s. 21.1(1)(b) or is “necessary as result of the injury” under s. 106(1)(a), are matters arising under the Act. The Board is expressly given jurisdiction to decide such matters by s. 22(1). Therefore, according to the respondent, the Board has jurisdiction to deny reimbursement for medical aid that it determines is not required or necessary in particular case. [22] The respondent states that the Board was required to interpret its own statute with which it is well familiar. The approach to interpreting legislation is articulated by Elmer Driedger in Construction of Statutes, 2nd ed. (Toronto:Butterworths, 1983) as quoted in Rizzo Rizzo Shoes Ltd. (Re), 1998 CanLII 837 (SCC), [1998] S.C.R. 27, [1998] S.C.J. No. (QL) and as referred to in Mellor, supra: ... Today there is only one principle or approach, namely, the words of an Act are to be read in their entire context and in their grammatical and ordinary sense harmoniously with the scheme of the Act, the object of the Act, and the intention of Parliament. [23] Based on the wording of the Act and the context of the relevant provisions, I am of the view that the Board’s interpretation that the Act granted the Board discretion to refuse to reimburse a specific medical treatment is reasonable. [24] Section 22(1) grants the Board “...exclusive jurisdiction to examine, hear and determine all matters and questions arising under this Act and any other matter in respect of which power, authority or discretion is conferred upon the board ...”. [25] The question of what medical aid is necessary for particular patient is, by definition, question arising under the Act. There is nothing in the language of s. 106(1) indicating that determining what “may be necessary” for particular patient is outside the ambit of the Board’s exclusive jurisdiction. The most that might be said is that s. 106(1) mandates the Board to provide particular medical aid once the Board has determined that aid is necessary for the patient. The plain language of s. 106(1), read in conjunction with the rest of the Act, does not lead to the conclusion that the Board has no say over whether particular medical aid is necessary and should be reimbursed. [26] The same analysis applies to s. 21.1(1)(b). There is nothing in the language of that section that suggests the Board does not have the power to determine whether particular type of treatment “may be required in the circumstances” and to refuse treatments that are found not to be required. [27] am of the view that the conclusion that the Board has discretion to refuse to reimburse particular treatment falls within the range of “possible acceptable” interpretations of the Act. Following the language of Ryan, supra, there is line of analysis that could “reasonably lead the tribunal from the evidence before it to the conclusion at which it arrived.” Therefore, in my view, the Board’s decision that it has the power to deny reimbursement meets the standard of reasonableness. [28] The applicant’s position is that once doctor recommends course treatment or medication, the Board has no authority to determine whether such treatment is “necessary as result of the injury” under s. 106(1). do not find this to be reasonable interpretation, however, even if this is reasonable interpretation of the Act, it is not the only reasonable interpretation. The Board provided an interpretation that was also reasonable and deference must be given to it. 4. Did the Board’s decision to deny reimbursement to Mr. Heilman meet the appropriate standard of review? [29] The applicant takes the position that the Board has denied reimbursement for medication that had worked for Mr. Heilman for 10 years and that had been recommended by an expert doctor. The only reason the Board could provide was perceived lack of scientific approval for medical marihuana. [30] The respondent replies that the Board denied reimbursement only after thorough consideration of medical studies dealing with the use of medical marihuana for pain relief. The Board acknowledged the applicant’s evidence that marihuana was providing more effective relief than other drugs. However, the Board noted that the studies presented did not support the applicant’s claim that the use of marihuana in “...smoked, vaporized form or in baked goods, is currently safe or effective, or will be so in the long term. All of the studies indicated further research was required.” [31] The Board concluded that because medical marihuana had not been “scientifically proven” as appropriate for Mr. Heilman’s condition with respect to “...effectiveness, long term effects, interaction with other medications or safety of medication...”, it would not approve reimbursement. The Board also found that viable marihuana substitutes, such as Sativex, were available but the applicant had not tried to use them, despite the fact that reimbursement is available for the cost of Sativex. [32] According to the respondent, the Board’s decision is “...clearly within the range of reasonable outcomes. To argue otherwise would be to suggest that the medical studies support only one reasonable conclusion that medical marihuana is proven, effective treatment for Mr. Heilman’s condition...”. Furthermore, it would require finding that Sativex was not reasonable alternative to marihuana. [33] In its decision, the Board canvassed the studies submitted by the applicant. After providing brief summary of each study, the Board concluded that while the studies suggested that there may be “promise at some point in the future related to the use of medical marihuana”, nevertheless further research was required to assess the relative risks and benefits, recommended dosages, safety, quality and efficacy of marihuana as medicine. [34] The Board’s conclusion falls within range of acceptable outcomes and is supported by the evidence. The Board did not misinterpret or misconstrue the results of the studies. The studies did not definitively state that medical marihuana was effective. Many studies noted side effects and most recommended further research before drawing definitive conclusions on the use of marihuana as medicine. [35] The Board’s conclusion led to its ruling that the cost of medical marihuana should not be reimbursed as the Board can deny reimbursement for treatment that has not been proven safe or effective. The Board’s explicit assumption is that an unproven drug is not, using the language of ss. 106(1) and 21.1(1)(b) “necessary” or “required” for the patient. The Board said at p. “[w]here there is scant evidence regarding the effectiveness, long term effects, interaction with other medications or safety of medication, including medical marijuana [sic], the Board finds that it is not necessary to the worker that he be provided with this type of medical aid for the treatment of his injury.” [36] It is possible that a situation may arise where a patient’s only recourse is to use a non-clinically approved drug whose safety and efficacy is still somewhat questioned. In such a case, a determination that the medical aid is not “necessary” or “required” might be unreasonable but this is not the case here. [37] As the Board noted, Mr. Heilman had the opportunity to try Sativex, marihuana derivative that does not share the potential adverse side effects associated with marihuana. Mr. Heilman declined to try Sativex. The Board’s decision to decline reimbursement on the basis that medical marihuana is not proven and therefore not “necessary or required” is reasonable when one considers the availability of Sativex. [38] Ultimately, the Board’s decision is reasonable. The Board essentially held that the benefits and safety of medical marihuana have not been established to the point that it is “necessary” or “required” medical aid. This conclusion is supported by research and is all the more reasonable when one considers alternative medication. This may not be the best decision for Mr. Heilman, particularly in view of the fact that medical marihuana has worked for Mr. Heilman for 10 years, however, the Board’s decision was within range of reasonable outcome supported by the evidence. 5. Was the Board’s decision made for an improper purpose? Did the Board base its decision on irrelevant considerations? [39] The applicant argues that the Board’s decision was made for an improper purpose. According to the applicant, the Board denied reimbursement because medical marihuana is socially contentious. [40] The Board refused reimbursement on the basis that medical marihuana is potentially unsafe and its positive effects are clinically unproven. If the Board has authority to refuse reimbursement for such reasons, there is no improper purpose. There is no evidence before me that the Board based its decision on the basis that medical marihuana is controversial moral issue. [41] The applicant also asserts that the Board based its decision on irrelevant considerations, in effect, misconceived perception of the potential political ramification of paying for medical marihuana. [42] Again, there is no evidence that the Board made its decision on the basis of considerations such as the potential political consequences of paying for medical marihuana. On the face of its reasons, the Board denied reimbursement specifically because medical marihuana is potentially unsafe and unproven. [43] In the end result, the application is dismissed. J.A. P. A. WHITMORE",8_2013skqb403.txt,"HELD: The application was dismissed.
With respect to the issues, the Court found: 1) that the board had not relied upon the clause in the Policy Statement but on the evidence before it.
It was not necessary to decide then whether the Policy Statement was ultra vires; 2) that the board’s interpretation that the Act granted discretion to the board to refuse to reimburse a specific medical treatment was reasonable; 3) that the board’s conclusion was reasonable.
The scientific studies did not definitively stated that medical marijuana was effective.
In some situations where a patient’s only recourse would to be to use a non-clinically approved drug whose safety and efficacy was still questioned, a determination that the medical aid was not necessary or required might be unreasonable, but not in this case where the applicant declined to try Sativex;
and 4) that there was no evidence that the board based its decision on irrelevant considerations such as the potential political ramifications of paying for medical marijuana."
500,"Marie K. Stack for the applicant Gary L. Bainbridge for the respondent JUDGMENT LAING J. September 16, 2014 [1] The University of Saskatchewan (the “University”) applies for judicial review of decision by Arbitrator Andrew Sims (the “Arbitrator”) rendered on March 24, 2014.
(2) Does the interpretation of s. 51 by the Arbitrator meet the applicable standard of review?
BACKGROUND FACTS [4] The parties agreed to lengthy statement of facts and the admissibility of number of documents before the Arbitrator.
In letter dated April 5, 2005 the president on behalf of the Board of Governors advised Professor Iliopoulou that her probationary period had been renewed.
(3) The president shall: (a) call meetings of the board, council and assembly in accordance with their respective bylaws and this Act; (b) make recommendations to the board respecting the appointment, promotion or removal of any faculty member or any of its officers or employees, but the president shall consult an advisory committee set up for that purpose under the bylaws of the board before recommending the appointment of faculty member or of an academic officer; ...
The Advisory Committee referred to in 73(3) to be set up for the purpose of advising the president had not occurred, and the committee did not exist.
... (vii) to submit to the President for transmission to the Board its recommendations for renewal of probation and the award of tenure.
(4th) 445; leave to appeal refused, [2007] S.C.C.A.
The portions of the document quoted are: The award of tenure represents long-term commitment of the University to faculty member.
Promotion of colleagues involves an assessment of their success in performing their academic duties and an evaluation of the likelihood of future accomplishments.
Tenure and promotion both take place against background of values most recently articulated in Framework for Planning at the University of Saskatchewan, adopted by University Council in 1998.
[15] With respect to the president’s powers pursuant to s. 73 of Act, he noted that the scope of this section covers virtually everything over which collective bargaining takes place.
legislation is similar to that in Saskatchewan, that the negotiated procedures involved in processing an application for an award of tenure were significantly different.
He also noted that the British Columbia legislation did not contain the equivalent provision in s. 73(3) of the Act that the president shall consult an advisory committee set up for that purpose under the bylaws of the Board before recommending the appointment of faculty member or of an academic officer.
However, this is statute creating and dividing up responsibilities within University and these terms should be given meaning consistent with that context.
In ordinary employment law, the expiry of probationary period is not considered the advent of new and different hiring.
While the academic probation process is more sophisticated, the granting of tenure is still more akin to change in status than new hiring.
interpret promotion as distinct from the attainment of tenure in the same way the distinction is drawn in the University’s own policy statement.
The Strangeway (supra) case clearly proceeds on the basis that tenure is promotion or appointment, but it does so against policy that combines them all together in way different than here, and more significantly it does so on the basis of concession by the parties to that litigation and thus without detailed review of the nature of tenure itself.
[19] He then went on to say if he was in error with respect to the foregoing and tenure was in fact either part of appointment or promotion that the Act could be harmonized with the provisions of the Agreement.
He concluded: Even if the attainment of tenure is an appointment or promotion within the meaning of the Act, the Saskatchewan Act and this collective agreement can more readily be harmonized.
The existence of s. 73(3)(b) makes it more difficult to conclude the President’s authority should be personal and unfettered, and in my view more reasonable to conclude that it is power to be exercised within parameters set by the Board, which includes collective bargaining.
This approach is consistent with those authorities discussed above, including particularly the observation in Bilson that “...the President does not give the Board his own view; he draws his recommendation from the permanent faculty of the university.” Reading the legislation in way that harmonizes its terms with those arrived at through collective bargaining, where possible also accords with the cases that emphasize the value in intra-university dispute resolution.
STANDARD OF REVIEW [20] The parties disagree on the standard of review to be applied to the Arbitrator’s interpretation of s. 51 of the Act.
60: 60 As mentioned earlier, courts must also continue to substitute their own view of the correct answer where the question at issue is one of general law “that is both of central importance to the legal system as whole and outside the adjudicator’s specialized area of expertise” (Toronto (City) v.
Because of their impact on the administration of justice as whole, such questions require uniform and consistent answers.
C.U.P.E., which dealt with complex common law rules and conflicting jurisprudence on the doctrines of res judicata and abuse of process issues that are at the heart of the administration of justice (see para.
[22] The paragraphs from Dunsmuir relied upon by the Association are: 54 Guidance with regard to the questions that will be reviewed on reasonableness standard can be found in the existing case law.
517, where it was held that an administrative decision [page 224] maker will always risk having its interpretation of an external statute set aside upon judicial review.
On the other hand, question of law that does not rise to this level may be compatible with reasonableness standard where the two above factors so indicate.
The Court’s analysis in that matter with respect to whether the standard was one of correctness involved its interpretation of the Administrative Tribunals Act, S.B.C.
Act specified the standards of review to be applied to administrative tribunals, and concluded in s. 58(2)(c) that for all matters not otherwise identified, the standard of review to be applied to the tribunal’s decision was correctness.
as follows: The appeal requires consideration of the relationship between the reviewing role of the courts and the decisions reached by an arbitrator.
The principal legal issue posed by the appeal is the standard of judicial review of the arbitrator’s decisions: is it correctness or patent unreasonableness?
Accordingly, the interpretation of Regulation 298 by the arbitrator in the present case is precisely the situation envisaged by Cory J. in City of Toronto when he enumerated the factors that might give rise to judicial deference.
He stated the privative clause was clearly intended to protect arbitral decisions from judicial review.
[28] The clauses in Article 15 requiring the president to transmit committee decisions to the Board have been in place for at least the last 20 years.
But the president does not give the board his own views; he draws his recommendation from the permanent faculty of the university.
Indeed collective bargaining agreement between the university and the Faculty Association provides that the president is merely to transmit the faculty's tenure recommendations to the board of governors.
[29] am not able to accept the University’s major premise that the interpretation of s. 51 of the Act is matter of general law “that is of central importance to the legal system as whole”.
60 of Dunsmuir above, answers to questions that are of central importance to the legal system require uniformity and consistency and is the rationale for standard of correctness.
referred to above accepted that deference will usually result where tribunal is interpreting its own statute or statutes closely connected to its function with which it will have particular familiarity.
The answer to whether s. 51 of the Act provides the president of the University with veto over matters of tenure does not rise to level that is of central importance to the legal system in Canada.
[32] I find the Arbitrator’s interpretation of sections of the Act are entitled to deference and the standard of review of such interpretations is one of reasonableness.
47 where the following appears: 47 Reasonableness is deferential standard animated by the principle that underlies the development of the two previous standards of reasonableness: certain questions that come before administrative tribunals do not lend themselves to one specific, particular result.
court conducting review for reasonableness inquires into the qualities that make decision reasonable, referring both to the process of articulating the reasons and to outcomes.
But it is also concerned with whether the decision falls within range of possible, acceptable outcomes which are defensible in respect of the facts and law.
29] where Dickson J. wrote: Administrative policy and interpretation are not determinative but are entitled to weight and can be an “important factor” in case of doubt about the meaning of legislation.
The Arbitrator was entitled to consider the history of collective bargaining between the parties as an important factor in deciding the meaning of ss.
[36] The Arbitrator acknowledged that other universities based on their legislation and/or policies make reference to tenure as an appointment or promotion, but rejected that such was the case in the Act.
He referred to the past practice of tenure being the subject of collective bargaining, and why it was reasonable to leave the final decision with the Board of Governors.","HELD: The application was dismissed.
The court held that the standard of review of the arbitrator’s decision was one of reasonableness.
Section 25 of The Trade Union Act states that the conclusions of arbitrators are final and therefore the court noted they should not be interfered with lightly.
Further, the court noted that the decision of the arbitrator was not of significant importance to the general public.
The court reviewed the history of collective bargaining at the university and found that tenure was not dependent on the president’s personal recommendation in the past.
The court found that the arbitrator’s reasoning was transparent and intelligible throughout.
To include the word tenure in the definition of appointment or promotion was not the only conclusion that could be drawn.
The arbitrator’s decision was within the range of acceptable conclusions and was reasonable.",828,"QUEEN’S BENCH FOR SASKATCHEWAN Citation: 2014 SKQB 299 Date: 2014 09 16 Docket: Q.B.G. No. 913 of 2014 Judicial Centre: Saskatoon BETWEEN: THE UNIVERSITY OF SASKATCHEWAN and THE UNIVERSITY OF SASKATCHEWAN FACULTY ASSOCIATION Counsel: John R. Beckman, Q.C. Marie K. Stack for the applicant Gary L. Bainbridge for the respondent JUDGMENT LAING J. September 16, 2014 [1] The University of Saskatchewan (the “University”) applies for judicial review of decision by Arbitrator Andrew Sims (the “Arbitrator”) rendered on March 24, 2014. The award results from grievance filed by the Faculty Association (the “Association”) on behalf of professor who was approved for tenure at the University by the Tenure Appeals Committee established under the collective bargaining agreement (the “Agreement”), which decision was subsequently reversed by the president of the University and upheld by the Board of Governors (the “Board”) on the basis of the president’s submission that the Board had to accept the president’s decision. The Arbitrator found after reviewing The University of Saskatchewan Act, 1995, S.S. 1995, c. U-6.1 (the “Act”) and the Agreement that the president’s personal recommendation to the Board was not required, and the Board was not obliged to follow the president’s recommendation before considering an application for tenure submitted by one of the committees assigned the power to recommend pursuant to the Agreement. The Arbitrator referred the matter back to the Board to consider the Tenure Appeals Committee decision as if the same had been transmitted to them by the president in accordance with the terms of the Agreement. [2] The grounds of the University’s application are: 1. The Arbitrator exceeded his jurisdiction, made an unreasonable decision, or committed an otherwise reviewable error of law by misinterpreting sections of The University of Saskatchewan Act, and in particular Section 51. 2. This error resulted because, among other things, the Arbitrator failed to apply principles/doctrines of statutory interpretation; including but not limited to his failure to consider: the context and purpose of the legislation; the doctrine of presumed intent of the legislature; the contextual approach; and, the doctrine that the interpretation should not produce an absurd result. [3] Section 51 of the Act states: Power of appointment 51 For the purposes of clause 49(1)(j): (a) no person is to be appointed as faculty member unless that person has been nominated for the position by the president; and (b) no faculty member is to be promoted or removed from office except on the recommendation of the president. ... The issue before the Arbitrator was whether decision on tenure is an appointment within the meaning of s. 51(a) or promotion within the meaning of s. 51(b). The issues on this review are: (1) The standard of review applicable to the Arbitrator’s interpretation of s. 51; is it correctness or reasonableness? (2) Does the interpretation of s. 51 by the Arbitrator meet the applicable standard of review? BACKGROUND FACTS [4] The parties agreed to lengthy statement of facts and the admissibility of number of documents before the Arbitrator. summary of the facts set out in the arbitration decision follows. [5] Effective July 1, 2002 Dr. Despina Iliopoulou was appointed as probationary assistant professor in the Department of Sociology for period of three years ending June 30, 2005. The Agreement provided in Article 13, which is entitled “Appointments”, that probationary period would be extended for further three years, during which period of time the candidate was expected to apply for tenure in the fourth, fifth or sixth years of the probationary period. In letter dated April 5, 2005 the president on behalf of the Board of Governors advised Professor Iliopoulou that her probationary period had been renewed. On August 17, 2007 Professor Iliopoulou requested one-year extension regarding her application for tenure and was granted the same in letter dated October 1, 2008. Her tenure request proceeded during the academic year of 2008, which ended on June 30, 2009. [6] Professor Iliopoulou was recommended for tenure by her Department Renewals and Tenure Committee, but was denied tenure by the next level of peer review, the College Review Committee, which was upheld by the University Review Committee. Professor Iliopoulou then appealed to the Renewals and Tenure Appeal Committee, who upheld her appeal and granted her tenure. [7] The Renewals and Tenure Appeal Committee decision was brought to the attention of the University president by the vice-provost, who was of the opinion the decision was wrong and should be reviewed by the president. The president received portions of the tenure file. He then discussed the file with the provost who thought Professor Iliopoulou’s application was weak one. The president then decided to reverse the decision made by the Renewals and Tenure Appeal Committee. In letter dated June 24, 2009 he informed Professor Iliopoulou that her application for tenure was not granted. [8] This matter earlier proceeded to arbitration before different arbitrator. The earlier award was set aside on judicial review in this court (2011 SKQB 322 (CanLII)) on the procedural ground the president’s decision had not been considered by the Board. The Agreement in Article 15 stated tenure was to be granted only by the Board acting in accordance with the provisions of the agreement. The right to grieve decision on tenure was only permitted under the agreement when the Board had reversed decision of one of the committees, including the Renewals and Tenure Appeal Committee. The review decision left open whether the Board was bound by the president’s recommendation. Foley J. in that decision stated: 18 ... It will also be for the Board to deliberate on whether the Act requires the President’s recommendation as to Dr. I’s tenure and, if so, whether it is obliged to follow that recommendation. ... [9] Following Justice Foley’s decision, the president and the vice-president of human resources submitted request for decision to the Board for its meeting on December 9, 2011. The decision requested was: It is requested that the Board of Governors accept the president’s decision not to nominate Dr. Despina Iliopoulou for permanent tenured position at the University of Saskatchewan or promote her to tenured position, thereby reversing the positive recommendation of the Renewals and Tenure Appeal Committee. The motion was passed by the Board at its meeting. The motion reads: That the Board of Governors accept the president’s decision not to nominate Dr. Despina Iliopoulou for permanent tenured position at the University of Saskatchewan or promote her to tenured position, thereby reversing the positive recommendation of the Renewals and Tenure Appeal Committee. THE UNIVERSITY ACT [10] The relevant sections of the “Act” with respect to this grievance are: Primary role of university 4(1) The primary role of the university is to provide post‑secondary instruction and research in the humanities, sciences, social sciences and other areas of human intellectual, cultural, social and physical development.

(2) The president may exercise any powers and shall perform any other duties that are conferred on or assigned to the president by the board. (3) The president shall: (a) call meetings of the board, council and assembly in accordance with their respective bylaws and this Act; (b) make recommendations to the board respecting the appointment, promotion or removal of any faculty member or any of its officers or employees, but the president shall consult an advisory committee set up for that purpose under the bylaws of the board before recommending the appointment of faculty member or of an academic officer; ... The Advisory Committee referred to in 73(3) to be set up for the purpose of advising the president had not occurred, and the committee did not exist. THE COLLECTIVE AGREEMENT [11] The 2007-2009 Agreement is extremely detailed in the matter of faculty appointments, promotion, and tenure. Article 13 deals with appointments to the faculty. Article 13.1 states: 13.1 Appointments to the Faculty. All appointments to the faculty, except Sessional Lecturers, are made by the Board in accordance with the procedures specified in this Agreement. Thereafter follows 11 pages of procedures. Article 13.3.1 states that all appointments to the rank of faculty member are probationary unless otherwise specified. Article 13.3.4 states in part: ... The Appointments Committee will submit to the President for transmission to the Board, the University’s recommendation for the award of tenure on appointment. ... [emphasis added] Article 15 of the agreement addresses the topic of tenure. Article 15.1 defines tenure as follows: ... Tenure means the appointment of an employee to permanent position on the academic staff of the University. Such appointment shall continue subject only to the provisions of Article 15.16. Article 15.3 states: Authority to Award Tenure. Tenure is granted only by the Board acting in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement. The decision of the Board is final and there shall be no appeal within the University against the Board’s decision other than resort to the Grievance Procedure as provided for in Article 15.18, Article 15.19, and Article 28 of the Agreement. The committee process outlined in Article 15 is multi-tiered. Article 15.10.3 (viii) requires the College Review Committee to: (viii) to submit the College’s positive recommendations for renewal of probation to the President for transmission to the Board; its negative recommendations for renewal of probation to the University Review Committee; all its recommendations concerning the award of tenure to the University Review Committee. [emphasis added] Article 15.10.4 addresses the University Review Committee. Articles 15.10.4(v) and (vii) state: (v) to review College recommendations for the renewal of probation from College renewal and tenure committees and all College recommendations for the award of tenure and approve them if they are not inconsistent with the standards of the Department, College, and University. ... (vii) to submit to the President for transmission to the Board its recommendations for renewal of probation and the award of tenure. [emphasis added] Article 15.13 is entitled Renewals and Tenure Appeal Committee: Powers and Procedures. It states in part: Renewals and Tenure Appeal Committees shall meet at the call of the chair and shall conduct their business with dispatch. Renewals and Tenure Appeal Committees shall have the authority to recommend renewal or tenure, deny renewal or tenure, or recommend an extension of probation up to maximum of two years. ... By March 31, meetings and deliberations shall be concluded, decisions rendered and recommendations made to the President for transmission to the Board. [emphasis added] THE POSITION OF THE PARTIES [12] The position of the parties before Arbitrator Sims was much the same as it is on this application. The University’s position is that the Act gives the president the authority to overrule the Renewals and Tenure Appeal Committee in s. 51 of the Act, which states the Board may act only on the president’s recommendation. Fundamental to the University’s position is that the granting of tenure is either an appointment within the meaning of s. 51(a) and/or promotion within the meaning of s. 51(b). It relies on the British Columbia Court of Appeal decision in University of British Columbia v. University of British Columbia Faculty Association, 2007 BCCA 201 (CanLII), 278 D.L.R. (4th) 445; leave to appeal refused, [2007] S.C.C.A. No. 275 (QL) (Rucker decision) for authority that the Agreement cannot fetter the University president’s statutory authority to recommend to the Board appointments and promotions. [13] The Association takes the position that the grant of tenure is neither an appointment nor promotion within the meaning of s. 51(a) and (b). Its position is the reference in s. 51(a) to appointment refers to the original act of appointment to faculty, not to renewals, and not to grants of tenure. In this respect it refers to the definition of faculty member in s. 2(h) of the Act, which states: (h) “faculty member” means person who is employed on full‑time basis by the university or an affiliated or federated college and who serves as professor, associate professor, assistant professor, lecturer, full‑time special lecturer, full‑time instructor, librarian or extension specialist; With respect to s. 51(b) the position is the word “promoted” means between ranks of academic faculty set out in the definition above. THE ARBITRAL AWARD [14] Arbitrator Sims in his award reviewed the literature on tenure from variety of sources. He noted that the University had since at least 1979 published document entitled “University of Saskatchewan Standards for Promotion and Tenure” and noted that the statement treated promotion and tenure as two separate, although related, concepts. The portions of the document quoted are: The award of tenure represents long-term commitment of the University to faculty member. It is status granted as result of judgement, by one’s peers, on both the performance of academic duties and the expectation of future accomplishments. Promotion of colleagues involves an assessment of their success in performing their academic duties and an evaluation of the likelihood of future accomplishments. Tenure and promotion both take place against background of values most recently articulated in Framework for Planning at the University of Saskatchewan, adopted by University Council in 1998. This document guides all of our decisions at the University of Saskatchewan including the collegial decisions of tenure and promotion, which are essential for the University’s standing within the academic community. At the conclusion of his review of articles and cases on tenure, he stated they reveal that: (a) its roots are ancient but it has taken on more contemporary role; (b) tenure is not essential to University. Universities may operate without it and some historically did so, albeit at their peril in terms of their reputation and ability to recruit; (c) tenure provisions, and more specifically the process by which tenure is achieved, are sometimes set unilaterally by Universities, sometimes negotiated as extra contractual policies (sometimes in the form described as “frozen policies”) and sometimes negotiated as part of collective agreement; (d) tenure is sometimes referred to expressly in the statute creating the particular University and sometimes not; (e) tenure usually involves formal approval or granting process beyond the simple judgment by one’s peers, but there is little uniformity as to whether this involves an official like the President or Governing Board, and little uniformity as to when appeals or arbitration is available, and if so, as to which point in the decision-making process any such appeal or right to arbitrate relates. [15] With respect to the president’s powers pursuant to s. 73 of Act, he noted that the scope of this section covers virtually everything over which collective bargaining takes place. He noted there was nothing in s. 73 that allowed the president to negate articles contained in the agreement. With respect to the University’s position that the literature and the authorities support that it is customary for presidents to have the decisive role in matters of tenure, Arbitrator Sims noted: These assertions too must be balanced against decisions, which recognize Presidential authority, but also contractual direction as to the way such authority is to be exercised. See for example, Justice Cameron’s observation in Bilson (supra) [Bilson v. University of Saskatchewan (1984), 1984 CanLII 2421 (SK CA), 16 D.L.R. (4th) 31] that “... the president does not give the board his own views; he draws his recommendation from the permanent faculty of the university ...” [Para. 1] Similarly, from Paine (in the Division Court) [Paine v. University of Toronto (1980), 1980 CanLII 1613 (ON SC), 115 D.L.R. (3d) 461] “.. The president must be taken to have acted through the tenure committee and the appeal committee and their actions are taken as his.” [Page 1] In Diamond v. Hickling 1989 Canlii 2902 (BCCA) [56 D.L.R. (4th) 467] (see below) Lambert J. said: “The President has committed himself to follow the recommendation of the senior appointments committee.” [Para. 5] These references indicate differing views on such questions, discussed in more detail below. [16] The University had relied on the British Columbia decision of Wade v. Strangeway (1994), 1994 CanLII 395 (BC SC), 116 D.L.R. (4th) 714, [1994] B.C.J. 1516 (QL) (B.C.S.C.), Aff’d (1996), 1996 CanLII 2729 (BC CA), 132 D.L.R. (4th) 406, [1996] B.C.J. No. 450 (QL) (B.C.C.A.), where the reviewing judge stated: It is common ground that person who seeks tenure seeks to be “promoted” within the meaning of s. 37(f). Arbitrator Sims noted that s. 27 of the B.C. University Act, R.S.B.C. 1979, c. 419 (since rep.), in question did not refer directly to tenure and opined that the Court’s observation was perhaps based on the parties’ agreement in that case that grant of tenure was promotion. He went on to point out while the B.C. legislation is similar to that in Saskatchewan, that the negotiated procedures involved in processing an application for an award of tenure were significantly different. [17] He next referred to the other main decision relied on by the University, the Rucker decision, supra, and acknowledged the majority of the Court in that case had concluded the statutory grant of authority to the president to make recommendations was paramount, and could not be fettered by the provisions of collective agreement. However, he also noted that the case said nothing about whether the award of tenure is an appointment or promotion, only that if it is, presidential action is necessary precondition to an award of tenure. He also noted that the British Columbia legislation did not contain the equivalent provision in s. 73(3) of the Act that the president shall consult an advisory committee set up for that purpose under the bylaws of the Board before recommending the appointment of faculty member or of an academic officer. [18] The Arbitrator concluded with his ruling and reasons on the meanings of s. 51 and s. 73(3)(b). He stated in part: Does section 51 of the Act mean that the Board may never grant person tenure unless and until they are “nominated for the appointment” or “recommended for the promotion” by the President. After considering the arguments, authorities, and articles set out above, my conclusion is that an award of tenure is neither an appointment nor promotion as contemplated by the Act. It is easy to see that, in their common usage, these terms can overlap. However, this is statute creating and dividing up responsibilities within University and these terms should be given meaning consistent with that context. This Act hardly uses the term tenure at all and not directly in this context. Appointments and promotions have been significant features of University life since its inception. The advent of tenure in its current form is more recent, as described above, and it has emerged in significant part through negotiated changes. There are reasons why legislation might regulate the award of tenure in the same way as promotions and appointments, but there are also reasons why it might be left to University to regulate for itself. It might well be adequately left to the Board of Governors, of which the President is statutory member, acting with the guidance of the academic community under process set by policy or collectively bargained, all without legislative constraint. As noted earlier, this is not choice between Faculty decision and Presidential decision. Rather it is choice between Board of Governors decision and Board decision, but only if the President puts the matter forward, and de facto Presidential decision if the President withholds consent. In my view the legislature has, by default or design, chosen not to restrict the Board’s ability to set up the appropriate process and to award tenure itself. Tenure is closely allied with the concept of probation. Academics are hired in anticipation of their seeking and obtaining tenure. If they achieve tenure they continue with their careers. It is only if they do not that their employment expires at the end of fixed term. This is not quite the same thing as applying for new job. In ordinary employment law, the expiry of probationary period is not considered the advent of new and different hiring. While the academic probation process is more sophisticated, the granting of tenure is still more akin to change in status than new hiring. Promotion, in the University setting, has fairly clear meaning tied to the well accepted academic ranks of professor, associate professor and assistant professor and so on. While colloquially, obtaining tenure is promotion in the sense of “one more step up the career ladder”, it is not in the sense of advancing through the accepted academic ranks, which customarily also involve pay increase. The award of tenure, as understood in the academic world, appears to involve the completion of an academic evaluation process and the consequent removal of the vulnerability inherent with probation. Achieving tenure is the anticipated result, following which they are not longer term or at pleasure appointees but appointees without term who can only be dismissed for just cause and any such just cause, because of tenure, cannot involve an intrusion into academic freedom, although it can include misbehavior or other sufficient cause. interpret appointment in s. 51 as referring to faculty member’s initial appointment, not to each subsequent change in the characteristics of that appointment. interpret promotion as distinct from the attainment of tenure in the same way the distinction is drawn in the University’s own policy statement. [Paragraph 15 supra.] The Strangeway (supra) case clearly proceeds on the basis that tenure is promotion or appointment, but it does so against policy that combines them all together in way different than here, and more significantly it does so on the basis of concession by the parties to that litigation and thus without detailed review of the nature of tenure itself. As result of this interpretation, find no direct clash between the Act and the collective agreement. As result, the University is contractually bound to follow the tenure process it has agreed upon. am reinforced in this conclusion from the evidence of what the parties have done in the past and what has obviously, until the last leg of this dispute, been their common understanding as expressed in the collective agreement, as indicated by their past practice, and as reflected in the University’s own policy statement. However, draw the conclusion above even without considering those factors. These conclusions alone lead me to answer question in the negative. Since tenure is neither an appointment nor promotion within the meaning of those terms in the Act, the power to make an award of tenure, under s. 49(1)(j) is not restricted by the need for Presidential nomination or recommendation under s. 51(3). [19] He then went on to say if he was in error with respect to the foregoing and tenure was in fact either part of appointment or promotion that the Act could be harmonized with the provisions of the Agreement. He referred to the law which discussed the harmonization principle in Durham Regional Police Assn. v. Durham (Region) Police Commissioners, 1982 CanLII 61 (SCC), [1982] S.C.R. 709, 140 D.L.R. (3d) 1, and the cases which followed, which hold that existing legislation must be read in such way as to harmonize with the Agreement unless the operation of the Agreement is clearly excluded by the statute. He concluded: Even if the attainment of tenure is an appointment or promotion within the meaning of the Act, the Saskatchewan Act and this collective agreement can more readily be harmonized. Under the Saskatchewan legislation, s. 73(3)(b) contemplates that the Board will establish an advisory committee for the President. Instead, it has created process through collective bargaining. The existence of s. 73(3)(b) makes it more difficult to conclude the President’s authority should be personal and unfettered, and in my view more reasonable to conclude that it is power to be exercised within parameters set by the Board, which includes collective bargaining. This approach is consistent with those authorities discussed above, including particularly the observation in Bilson that “...the President does not give the Board his own view; he draws his recommendation from the permanent faculty of the university.” Reading the legislation in way that harmonizes its terms with those arrived at through collective bargaining, where possible also accords with the cases that emphasize the value in intra-university dispute resolution. The University’s interpretation would write out the transmission step, the Boards decision-making role in controversial cases and, most significantly, the agreed upon, although limited, ability to arbitrate disputes over the merits and the procedural integrity of the award of tenure process. STANDARD OF REVIEW [20] The parties disagree on the standard of review to be applied to the Arbitrator’s interpretation of s. 51 of the Act. The University’s position is that the standard is one of correctness. The Faculty Association’s position is that it is one of reasonableness. Both parties rely on dicta from Dunsmuir v. New Brunswick, 2008 SCC (CanLII), [2008] S.C.R. 190, in support of their submissions. [21] The passage from Dunsmuir relied upon by the University is para. 60: 60 As mentioned earlier, courts must also continue to substitute their own view of the correct answer where the question at issue is one of general law “that is both of central importance to the legal system as whole and outside the adjudicator’s specialized area of expertise” (Toronto (City) v. C.U.P.E., at para. 62, per LeBel J.). Because of their impact on the administration of justice as whole, such questions require uniform and consistent answers. Such was the case in Toronto (City) v. C.U.P.E., which dealt with complex common law rules and conflicting jurisprudence on the doctrines of res judicata and abuse of process issues that are at the heart of the administration of justice (see para. 15, per Arbour J.). Its submission is that the Act is one of general law, that is both of essential importance to the legal system as whole, and outside the adjudicator’s specialized area of expertise. It relies on the Rucker decision, which held that the standard of review in that case of the British Columbia University Act, R.S.B.C. 1996, c. 468, was one of correctness. [22] The paragraphs from Dunsmuir relied upon by the Association are: 54 Guidance with regard to the questions that will be reviewed on reasonableness standard can be found in the existing case law. Deference will usually result where tribunal is interpreting its own statute or statutes closely connected to its function, with which it will have particular familiarity: Canadian Broadcasting Corp. v. Canada (Labour Relations Board), 1995 CanLII 148 (SCC), [1995] S.C.R. 157, at para. 48; Toronto (City) Board of Education v. O.S.S.T.F., District 15, 1997 CanLII 378 (SCC), [1997] S.C.R. 487, at para. 39. Deference may also be warranted where an administrative tribunal has developed particular expertise in the application of general common law or civil law rule in relation to specific statutory context: Toronto (City) v. C.U.P.E., [2003 SCC 63 (CanLII), [2003] S.C.R. 77] at para. 72. Adjudication in labour law remains good example of the relevance of this approach. The case law has moved away considerably from the strict position evidenced in McLeod v. Egan, 1974 CanLII 12 (SCC), [1975] S.C.R. 517, where it was held that an administrative decision [page 224] maker will always risk having its interpretation of an external statute set aside upon judicial review. 55 consideration of the following factors will lead to the conclusion that the decision maker should be given deference and reasonableness test applied: privative clause: this is statutory direction from Parliament or legislature indicating the need for deference. discrete and special administrative regime in which the decision maker has special expertise (labour relations for instance). The nature of the question of law. question of law that is of “central importance to the legal system ... and outside the ... specialized area of expertise” of the administrative decision maker will always attract correctness standard (Toronto (City) v. C.U.P.E., at para. 62). On the other hand, question of law that does not rise to this level may be compatible with reasonableness standard where the two above factors so indicate. 56 If these factors, considered together, point to standard of reasonableness, the decision maker's decision must be approached with deference in the sense of respect discussed earlier in these reasons. There is nothing unprincipled in the fact that some questions of law will be decided on the basis of reasonableness. It simply means giving the adjudicator’ decision appropriate deference in deciding whether decision should be upheld, bearing in mind the factors indicated. The Association submits that deference applies because on the facts in this matter the three factors referred to in para. 55 of Dunsmuir above point to standard of reasonableness. [23] In the Rucker decision, the University president denied promotion to an assistant professor. The Court’s analysis in that matter with respect to whether the standard was one of correctness involved its interpretation of the Administrative Tribunals Act, S.B.C. 2004, c. 45. The B.C. Act specified the standards of review to be applied to administrative tribunals, and concluded in s. 58(2)(c) that for all matters not otherwise identified, the standard of review to be applied to the tribunal’s decision was correctness. The Court concluded the appropriate standard was correctness because the issue fell within s. 58(2)(c). [24] In the recent case of Cape Breton-Victoria Regional School Board v. Canadian Union of Public Employees, Local 5050, 2011 NSCA (CanLII), 298 N.S.R. (2d) 258, the school board had terminated the grievor’s employment because he had had sex with 15-year-old girl, which was above the age of consent at the time, who attended different school than the one in which he worked. The Arbitrator reinstated the grievor, and in the course of his decision reviewed the provisions of s. 40(1) of the Education Act, S.N.S. 1995-96, c. 1, which set out the duties of support staff members. One of the issues on appeal was the Arbitrator’s interpretation of this section of the Education Act. The school board relied heavily on the Rucker decision, supra. [25] In decision rendered on behalf of the Court, Fichaud J.A. noted Nova Scotia did not have the equivalent of s. 58 of the Administrative Tribunals Act, which had been relied upon in the Rucker decision, and, therefore, the Rucker decision was not helpful. He stated judicial review in Nova Scotia was governed by Dunsmuir, and quoted Justice Bastarache in para. 54 of that decision set out above. He concluded: 25 The arbitrator’s mandate, into which s. 40(1) dovetails, was to apply principles of arbitral jurisprudence to determine whether there was just cause for dismissal within the meaning of the collective agreement. That is labour arbitrator’s core function, and within the court’s zone of deference, attracting reasonableness standard of review: Communications, Energy and Paperworkers’ Union, Local 1520, para. 20 [Communications, Energy and Paperworkers' Union, Local 1520 v. Maritime Paper Products Ltd., 2009 NSCA 60 (CanLII)] and cases there cited. Section 40(1) is “closely connected” to the arbitrator’s function in this grievance, under the principle from Dunsmuir, para. 54. 26 agree with the judge that the appropriate standard of review to the award, including the arbitrator’s use of s. 40(1), was reasonableness. would dismiss the Board’s ground of appeal that challenges the judge’s choice of the standard of review. [26] In an earlier decision in Toronto Catholic District School Board v. Ontario English Catholic Teachers’ Assn. (2001), 2001 CanLII 8597 (ON CA), 55 O.R. (3d) 737, [2001] O.J. No. 3748 (QL) (Ont. C.A.) MacPherson J.A. on behalf of the Court identified the issue in the case at para. as follows: The appeal requires consideration of the relationship between the reviewing role of the courts and the decisions reached by an arbitrator. The context within which this general issue arises is an arbitrator’s decisions flowing from his interpretation of the terms of both collective agreement and general public statute. The principal legal issue posed by the appeal is the standard of judicial review of the arbitrator’s decisions: is it correctness or patent unreasonableness? At para. 28 he noted: 28 ... Accordingly, the interpretation of Regulation 298 by the arbitrator in the present case is precisely the situation envisaged by Cory J. in City of Toronto when he enumerated the factors that might give rise to judicial deference. The arbitrator’s interpretation of Regulation 298 made under the Education Act involved an “external statute ... intimately connected with the mandate of the tribunal and ... encountered frequently as result” (City of Toronto, supra, at 506). He went on to note in this case in para. 31 there was privative clause in play by reason of s. 48 of the Labour Relations Act, 1995, S.O. 1995, c. 1, Sch. A., which required that every agreement “‘provide for the final and binding settlement by arbitration’ of disputes” and that the Arbitrator’s decision was binding upon the parties. He stated the privative clause was clearly intended to protect arbitral decisions from judicial review. He held the standard of review was not correctness, but patent unreasonableness, which was the arbitral standard at the time. [27] The grievance in this matter is brought pursuant to the grievance procedures set out in Article 28 of the 2007-2009 agreement. Arbitrator Sims is one of the three default arbitrators named in the Agreement. Article 28.6 of the agreement states: Powers of the Arbitrator. The arbitrator shall exercise those powers enumerated in The Trade Union Act, [R.S.S. 1978, c. T-17 (since rep. by S.S. 2013, c. S-15.1] as amended from time to time and the arbitrator’s decision shall be final and binding on both parties. Section 25 of The Trade Union Act, R.S.S. 1978, c. T-1 (since rep. by S.S. 2013, c. S-15.1) mandates that alleged violations of collective bargaining agreements are to be settled by arbitration, and states the findings of the arbitrator are final and conclusive, a form of privative clause reflecting the legislature’s intention that such decisions are not to be lightly interfered with on judicial review. [28] The clauses in Article 15 requiring the president to transmit committee decisions to the Board have been in place for at least the last 20 years. This emerges from the Court of Appeal decision in Bilson v. University of Saskatchewan (1984), 1984 CanLII 2421 (SK CA), 16 D.L.R. (4th) 31, 36 Sask.R. 184, (Sask. C.A.). The decision did not involve the interpretation of the Act, but did involve the Court commenting on the Renewals and Tenure Appeal Committee provisions of Article 15 of the Agreement. In para. the Court stated in part: ...By virtue of Section 62(f) of the University of Saskatchewan Act, R.S.S. 1978, c. U‑6, the grant of tenure is matter for the board of governors of the university, acting on the recommendation of its president who is responsible for the general supervision of the academic work of the university, including its teaching staff. But the president does not give the board his own views; he draws his recommendation from the permanent faculty of the university. Indeed collective bargaining agreement between the university and the Faculty Association provides that the president is merely to transmit the faculty's tenure recommendations to the board of governors. The agreement provides for taking the views of the faculty by means of an elaborate mechanism, which, in this case, started with College Tenure Committee. [29] am not able to accept the University’s major premise that the interpretation of s. 51 of the Act is matter of general law “that is of central importance to the legal system as whole”. As noted in para. 60 of Dunsmuir above, answers to questions that are of central importance to the legal system require uniformity and consistency and is the rationale for standard of correctness. The Act in this case is public statute, but it is not statute that has general application to the public at large. It is governance statute relevant only to the University. The interpretation of section of the Act does not impact anyone beyond those involved in the University. [30] As noted by Fichaud J.A. at para. 28 above, the Rucker decision is one of statutory interpretation of the Administrative Tribunals Act in British Columbia, and does not speak to the standard of review applicable at common law. It is also noted that the Rucker decision predates the Dunsmuir decision. Both Fichaud J.A. and MacPherson J.A. referred to above accepted that deference will usually result where tribunal is interpreting its own statute or statutes closely connected to its function with which it will have particular familiarity. They both considered their respective Education Acts, Acts of far more general application than specific University Act, as being sufficiently closely connected to the arbitrator’s function to justify the principle of deference to the arbitrator’s interpretation. The same rationale applies to the decision of the Arbitrator in this case. [31] The Arbitrator in this matter is one of three default arbitrators written into the Agreement. The Act is the constituent Act of the University from which the authority for it to bargain collectively and enter into collective bargaining agreements flows. Thus, it is closely connected to the Arbitrator’s function of interpreting the provisions of the Agreement. There is no evidence on how often Arbitrator Sims has been called upon to rule on grievances brought pursuant to the Agreement, but as person the law stipulates has special expertise in labour relations, it can be expected he will have some familiarity with the Act. The answer to whether s. 51 of the Act provides the president of the University with veto over matters of tenure does not rise to level that is of central importance to the legal system in Canada. It is of interest only to the two parties to the agreement. The Arbitrator’s decision is protected by form of privative clause. The combination of the foregoing points to standard of deference. [32] I find the Arbitrator’s interpretation of sections of the Act are entitled to deference and the standard of review of such interpretations is one of reasonableness. REASONABLENESS [33] The deferential standard of reasonableness was articulated in Dunsmuir at para. 47 where the following appears: 47 Reasonableness is deferential standard animated by the principle that underlies the development of the two previous standards of reasonableness: certain questions that come before administrative tribunals do not lend themselves to one specific, particular result. Instead, they may give rise to number of possible, reasonable conclusions. Tribunals have margin of appreciation within the range of acceptable and rational solutions. court conducting review for reasonableness inquires into the qualities that make decision reasonable, referring both to the process of articulating the reasons and to outcomes. In judicial review, reasonableness is concerned mostly with the existence of justification, transparency and intelligibility within the decision‑making process. But it is also concerned with whether the decision falls within range of possible, acceptable outcomes which are defensible in respect of the facts and law. [34] The University’s position is that the Arbitrator’s interpretation of s. 51 is unreasonable because the Arbitrator did not find that tenure is an appointment pursuant to s. 51(a) of the Act or promotion to permanent faculty position within the meaning of s. 51(b) of the Act. However, the word tenure does not appear in s. 51 or s. 73 of the Act, and so it is not clear from the legislation itself that the words appointment or promotion must include the right to recommend an award or grant of tenure. The fact the University’s position is that the award of tenure is either an appointment or promotion indicates just how unclear it is. 35] However, the history of collective bargaining with respect to tenure clearly indicates the administration of the University did not consider tenure was dependent on the president’s personal recommendation. Where there is doubt about the intention of the legislature, historical administrative interpretation can be relevant factor. In Ruth Sullivan, Sullivan and Driedger on the Construction of Statutes, 4th ed. (Markham: Butterworth Canada Ltd., 2002), it was noted at p. 506: The principle governing the use of administrative interpretation was stated by the Supreme Court of Canada in Nowegijick v. R. [1983 CanLII 18 (SCC), [1983] S.C.R. 29] where Dickson J. wrote: Administrative policy and interpretation are not determinative but are entitled to weight and can be an “important factor” in case of doubt about the meaning of legislation. similar point was made by de Grandpré J. in Harel v. Deputy M.N.R. of Prov. of Que. [1977 CanLII 10 (SCC), [1978] S.C.R. 851]: ... am not saying that the administrative interpretation [relied on by the taxpayer] could contradict clear legislative text; but in situation such as have just outlined, this interpretation has real weight and, in case of doubt about the meaning of the legislation, becomes an important factor. The Arbitrator was entitled to consider the history of collective bargaining between the parties as an important factor in deciding the meaning of ss. 51 and/or 73 of the Act. [36] The Arbitrator acknowledged that other universities based on their legislation and/or policies make reference to tenure as an appointment or promotion, but rejected that such was the case in the Act. He noted that the practices with respect to granting tenure are diverse. He outlined why the legislature back in 1907 may not have wished to limit the collegial approach to tenure decision-making by placing limitation on that collegial process by providing the president with the sole final recommendation. He referred to the past practice of tenure being the subject of collective bargaining, and why it was reasonable to leave the final decision with the Board of Governors. His reasoning is transparent and intelligible throughout. It is also rational. [37] That tenure must be included in the word appointment, or the word promotion, in s. 51 of the Act was not the only conclusion that could be drawn in this matter. The Arbitrator provided more than adequate reasons for his decision, and his decision clearly falls within a range of acceptable and rational conclusions available. The decision satisfies the reasonableness standard. [38] The application to set aside the Arbitrator’s decision is dismissed. The Association is entitled to taxable costs on double Column 3. [39] Judgment accordingly.",8_2014skqb299.txt,"HELD: The application was dismissed.
The court held that the standard of review of the arbitrator’s decision was one of reasonableness.
Section 25 of The Trade Union Act states that the conclusions of arbitrators are final and therefore the court noted they should not be interfered with lightly.
Further, the court noted that the decision of the arbitrator was not of significant importance to the general public.
The court reviewed the history of collective bargaining at the university and found that tenure was not dependent on the president’s personal recommendation in the past.
The court found that the arbitrator’s reasoning was transparent and intelligible throughout.
To include the word tenure in the definition of appointment or promotion was not the only conclusion that could be drawn.
The arbitrator’s decision was within the range of acceptable conclusions and was reasonable."

IN THE QUEEN’S BENCH JUDICIAL CENTRE OF SASKATOON BETWEEN: THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA, as represented by the Attorney General of Canada and ANDEL GRIFFITHS, a.k.a., MICHAEL CAMPBELL, MICHAEL GREEN AND ANDY GRIFFITHS, RESPONDENT H.H. Dahlem, Q.C. for The United States of America and for Attorney General of Canada M.W. Owens for Andel Griffiths JUDGMENT KOCH J. November 14, 2003 [1] Andel Griffiths (“Griffiths”) born September 7, 1975 is Jamaican national living in Saskatoon with his wife Jennifer, Canadian citizen. Griffiths entered Canada April 15, 2003 and is entitled to remain in Canada as permanent resident for the time being. He has permanent resident card which expires May 5, 2008. He has established residence in Saskatoon. [2] The United States of America (“USA”) seeks to extradite Griffiths to face a charge of conspiracy to import into the USA a substance containing cocaine. Griffiths was arrested in Saskatoon on May 28, 2003. On June 16, 2003 he was granted bail pending his extradition hearing. Subsequently the Attorney General of Canada caused to be filed with the court written authority to proceed pursuant to s. 15 of the Extradition Act, 1999, c. 18. Section 24 of the Act obligates the court to proceed with an extradition hearing. Pursuant to s. 29, the hearing must necessarily result in either committal under ss. (1), which places the matter once again before the Attorney General, or discharge under ss. (3). Section 29(1) provides (in part): 29. (1) judge shall order the committal of the person into custody to await surrender if (a) in the case of person sought for prosecution, there is evidence admissible under this Act of conduct that, had it occurred in Canada, would justify committal for trial in Canada on the offence set out in the authority to proceed and the judge is satisfied that the person is the person sought by the extradition partner; [3] Each party has filed a motion as follows:(1) a motion dated September 9, 2003 on behalf of the Deputy Attorney General of Canada representing the USA for an order fixing a date for the hearing of the extradition request in this Court.(2) a motion dated September 25, 2003 on behalf of Griffiths for a stay of proceedings on one or more of the following grounds: contempt of court by the Attorney General of Canada for failing to provide proper disclosure; alternatively, the production by the Attorney General of witness statements and other evidence in compliance with the common law duty of procedural fairness as it applies in administrative proceedings; in the further alternative, the production by the Attorney General of witness statements and other information pursuant to s. of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. [4] heard both motions concurrently. As the outcome of the motion on behalf of Griffiths will affect the disposition of the motion on behalf of the Deputy Attorney General, will first address the Griffiths motion. [5] The issues with respect to disclosure are as follows:1. It is alleged that the Attorney General has not disclosed all the evidence in his custody or control. Counsel for the Attorney General however has undertaken that everything within the control of the Attorney General has been turned over to the solicitor for Griffiths except only the diplomatic note from USA to Canada which initiated the process, which counsel contends is not relevant to the application for hearing. There has been no investigation in Canada of the alleged offence. The Attorney General has only that information which the USA authorities have seen fit to provide to him. accept the contention on behalf of the Attorney General that the diplomatic note is not relevant at this stage. 2. Griffiths’ counsel alludes to the following statement of Allbright J. of this Court when Griffiths was brought before the Court immediately following his arrest: Mr. Miller: It’s very serious allegation. The Court: Yes, it is and know that it’s would be in Mr. Griffiths’ best interest that all of the material available was disclosed, because know he would want to know everything that he has to deal with. And certainly know, Ms. LeClair-Harding that’s her way of she practises law, in wanting to know what’s there to provide the maximum of assistance to someone such as Mr. Griffiths. And subsequently the Court [addressing counsel for the Attorney General]: You will be providing to Ms. LeClair-Harding the information that she requires. He submits that this obligates the Attorney General to produce the investigational information that USA authorities plan to use to prosecute Griffith. Notwithstanding the able submission of counsel for Griffiths am unable to share his interpretation of the words of Allbright J. It does not follow from these comments of Allbright J. that Griffiths is entitled to disclosure additional to that otherwise required by law. Obviously Allbright J. directed or at least urged the Attorney General to make full and prompt disclosure. do not believe however that he intended to order any disclosure in addition to that otherwise required by law. [6] The hearing judge’s role in an extradition proceeding is limited to determining whether there is prima facie evidence that the act alleged would constitute crime in Canada. La Forest J. in the case of The Republic of Argentina v. Mellino, 1987 CanLII 49 (SCC), [1987] S.C.R. 536, 33 C.C.C. (3d) 334, put it this way (at p. 349): [The extradition hearing] is merely to determine whether the relevant crime falls within the appropriate treaty and whether the evidence presented is sufficient to justify the executive surrendering the fugitive to the requesting country for trial there. Responsibility for the conduct of our foreign relations, including the performance of Canada’s obligations under extradition treaties, is, of course, vested in the executive. repeat: the role of the extradition judge is modest one; absent express statutory or treaty authorization, the sole purpose of an extradition hearing is to ensure that the evidence establishes prima facie case that the extradition crime has been committed. See also U.S.A. v. Dynar, 1997 CanLII 359 (SCC), [1997] S.C.R. 462, 115 C.C.C. (3d) 481. [7] In the Mellino case, supra, La Forest J. went on to state at p. 350: In particular, it is not the business of an extradition judge to assume responsibility for reviewing the actions of foreign officials in preparing the evidence for an extradition hearing. This would seem to me to be in breach of the most elementary dictates of comity between sovereign states. foreign state obviously has jurisdiction over the actions of its officials, although, no doubt, the executive of this country must, on occasion, consider such matters in exercising its discretion to surrender fugitive. [8] The role of the hearing judge, vis-à-vis, the role of the Minister of Justice was described by Watt J. of the Ontario Superior Court of Justice in the case of Germany v. Schreiber, [2000] O.J. No. 2618 (S.C.J.), as follows: [71] It has been said, and said repeatedly by courts of the highest authority, that the role of an extradition hearing judge is narrow one, confined to what is specified in the enabling statute. That role is to determine whether there is prima facie case that an extradition crime has been committed by the person sought for extradition. [72] Under the Act, the Minister and the extradition judge occupy two (2) different solitudes. The Minister has role at the beginning and the end of the extradition process. The judge discharges his or her function in the middle. Each operates independently of the other, except to the extent that the Minister’s final involvement is contingent on judicial order for committal. Neither intrudes into the other’s area of responsibility. Neither reviews the other’s determination or decision. [9] Because of the limited role of the hearing judge Charter jurisdiction is necessarily restricted to those issues specific to the functions of the extradition hearing. As Arbour J. of the Supreme Court of Canada held in the case of U.S.A. v. Kwok, [2001] S.C.R. 532, 2000 SCC 18 (CanLII), 152 C.C.C. (3d) 225 (S.C.C.), s. 9(3) of the Extradition Act does not confer an expanded Charter jurisdiction upon the extradition judge. It simply permits the extradition judge to exercise the jurisdiction previously reserved for the habeas corpus judge which includes remedies only for Charter breaches that pertain directly to the circumscribed issues relevant at the committal stage of the extradition process. [10] In Thailand v. Karas, 2000 BCSC 1717 (CanLII), [2000] B.C.J. No. 2689 (S.C.), Lysyk J. stated: [32] line of authority under the former legislation and under the Act provides firm support for the proposition that applications for disclosure will be denied unless they are tied to the limited jurisdiction of the extradition judge. [33] The points made in Dynar include the following. The principles of fundamental justice guaranteed under s. of the Charter vary according to the context in which they are raised: para. 128. The context and purpose of the extradition hearing shape the level of procedural protection that is available to fugitive and the extradition process is not to be equated to the criminal trial process: para. 129. Accordingly, it is neither necessary nor appropriate to transplant into the extradition process all of the disclosure requirements set out in Stinchcombe, and developed in subsequent jurisprudence, relating to domestic criminal proceedings and in regard to the accused’s right to full answer and defence in Canadian trial: para. 130. The committal hearing is neither intended nor designed to provide the discovery function of domestic preliminary inquiry: para. 132. While the fugitive is entitled to know the case against him, for purposes of the extradition hearing, he is generally entitled to disclosure only of materials relied upon by the requesting state to establish its prima facie case: paras. 134-35. Disclosure may be required with respect to justiciable Charter issue, but the material before the extradition court must provide an “air of reality” to the contention that there has been violation of the fugitive’s Charter right(s): para. 136 et seq. [11] In recent decision in this Court on an application for detailed disclosure prior to an extradition hearing in the case of United States of America v. Daul, 2003 SKQB 272 (CanLII), [2003] S.J. No. 389 (Q.B.), Krueger J. commented as follows: [9] The right to make full answer and defence is paramount in trial. In extradition hearings guilt or innocent is not in issue. One must also bear in mind that the extradition procedure is based upon treaty where each state assumes that the reciprocating state has fair and just criminal system. The applicant is entitled to disclosure of the materials on which the United States is relying to establish prima facie case. He is not entitled, at the extradition stage, to present his defence on the assumption that fair hearing will not take place at the trial or in order to avoid trial in the foreign state. [11] Disclosure of the information and materials applied for might, if committed, assist the applicant in his attempt to persuade the Minister not to surrender him. That argument has not been advanced, nor is it expedient at this stage. An appeal to the Court of Appeal was dismissed. [12] Counsel for Griffiths argues that the application before Krueger J. in the Daul case was under s. of the Charter and no consideration was given to parallel common law rights advanced on behalf of Griffiths, specifically, denial of natural justice. see no merit in that argument. The fundamental issue is the extent of Griffiths’ right to disclosure of documents and information. If he is not entitled under s. of the Charter to what he has requested then concurrent common law rights cannot serve to expand his entitlement. [13] It follows that the motion on Griffiths’ behalf is without merit and it is accordingly dismissed. [14] am not prepared to award costs against Griffiths’ solicitor as requested by counsel for the Attorney General. [15] The motion on behalf of the Attorney General to set a date for the extradition hearing is granted. The hearing is to proceed on January 6, 2004 at 10:00 a.m. or at such other date and time as counsel may agree upon in consultation with the Local Registrar.",9_2003skqb481.txt,"The United States of America sought to extradite the respondent to face a charge of conspiracy to import into the USA a substance containing cocaine.

Clearly the court held in that case, and in those which preceded it, that neither plea of set-off based on breach of fiduciary duty or plea of lack of procedural fairness can be defence to foreclosure action and such pleas can only be advanced by way of set‑off or in separate action.","FIAT: The plaintiff sought orders pursuant to Rule 173(a) and (e)of the Queen's Bench Rules and the Court's inherent jurisdiction to strike the entire statements of defence as they failed to disclose reasonable defences; the claims asserted on statements of defence should be advanced in separate actions; and the statements of defence were abuse of the Court's process.
HELD: The applications were dismissed with each defendant to recover separate costs on the appropriate tariff.
Although the defendants' pleading may delay but not defeat or prevent the plaintiff from proceeding with its foreclosure action, the defences were so closely connected with the plaintiff's demands that it would be manifestly unjust for the plaintiff to proceed without taking the defendant's defences into consideration.",657,"G.M. Kraus QUEEN’S BENCH FOR SASKATCHEWAN Citation: 2012 SKQB 99 Date: 2012 03 05 Docket: Q.B.G. No. 256 of 2011 Judicial Centre: Saskatoon IN THE MATTER OF AN APPLICATION PURSUANT TO S. 11 OF THE SASKATCHEWAN FARM SECURITY ACT BETWEEN: FARM CREDIT CANADA, and TITAN VENTURES INC., RESPONDENT Docket: Q.B.G. No. 257 of 2011 Judicial Centre: Saskatoon BETWEEN: FARM CREDIT CANADA, and STOMP PORK FARM (2008) LTD., NATIONAL BANK OF CANADA and SINNETT PORK FARM LTD., Counsel: Joel A. Hesje, Q.C., and Anita Wandzura for the applicant plaintiff Jeffrey M. Lee for the respondent defendant, National Bank of Canada FIAT KOCH J. March 5, 2012 [1] In early 2008, Stomp Pork Farm Ltd., major Saskatchewan hog producer, came under creditor protection pursuant to the Companies Creditors’ Arrangement Act, R.S.C. 1985, c. C-36. In the resulting reorganization two new corporations, Stomp Pork Farms (2008) Ltd. (Stomp (2008)) and Titan Ventures Inc. (Titan), each acquired several pig barns formerly owned by Stomp Pork Farm Ltd. at various locations in Saskatchewan. These acquisitions were financed for the respective purchasers by Farm Credit Canada (“FCC”), as primary lender, and National Bank of Canada (“National”). There may have been other sources of acquisition funding. FCC and National financing is secured by mortgages against the titles to the pig barns. Within year both corporations were in default in their loan payments and the lenders took action. FCC gave notice of its intention to realize on its security. National arranged for the appointment of receiver. [2] In 2009, to alleviate serious economic distress in the pork industry, the federal government, Department of Agriculture, introduced subsidy, the Hog Farm Transition Program (“HTP”), administered by the Canadian Pork Council, federation of provincial pork industry associations. The purpose of the program was to try to save the hog industry overall by helping producers through difficult times. The subsidies were substantial, but producers had to meet stringent conditions in order to qualify for them. Significant amongst the HTP requirements was the necessity for the producer to empty its hog barns and keep them idle for three years. In the event of the sale, lease or transfer of barns during the three-year period the acquirer or user had to assume the HTP conditions, including keeping the barns idle, failing which the subsidies would become repayable with substantial administrative fees and interest. It appears that there was no reference in the HTP conditions to mortgagees. Stomp (2008) and Titan qualified for substantial subsidies. The proceeds are all or partly in trust with National’s solicitors while the parties and their creditors sort out the distribution of them. In the meantime FCC as first mortgagee has had to cover substantial ongoing expenses to maintain and attempt to preserve the value of the vacant barns. [3] In March 2011 the court granted an order to FCC pursuant to s. 9(1)(d) of The Saskatchewan Farm Security Act, S.S. 1988-89, c. S-17.1, providing that the Act does not apply to the FCC mortgages granted by Stomp (2008) and Titan. This enabled FCC to commence foreclosure actions, which it did immediately. To comply with Rule 436(2A) National is named as party defendant in each of the foreclosure actions because National is shown on the titles as subsequent mortgagee, thus having registered interest in the mortgager’s equity of redemption. As is common in such circumstances, FCC as plaintiff in these actions did not explicitly claim relief against National. However, National filed statements of defence alleging an agreement amongst the secured creditors and the owners, including another owner, Stomp Pork (USA) Inc., whereby each of the lenders subordinates its security to the security of the other lenders and holds its interest in the mortgage security on behalf of all lenders in accordance with the terms and conditions of the agreement. National also contends in its statements of defence that FCC is in breach of its covenants to act in commercially reasonable manner in the enforcement of its mortgage security. The foreclosure actions have created the possibility that the rights of the owners to retain for the benefit of the secured creditors the HTP subsidy payments already received and their rights to continue to receive HTP payments will be in jeopardy. [4] At the risk of over-simplification believe that the statements of defence can be summarized as follows: (1) FCC by bringing its foreclosure actions is in violation of the inter-lendor agreement, in particular, its covenant to National to act in commercially reasonable manner in the enforcement of FCC’s security rights. (2) The foreclosure actions may have jeopardized or will jeopardize the owners’ ability to continue their participation in the HTP, both as to the owners’ continuing entitlement to benefits, and as to the possibility of the owners being required to repay benefits already received with interest and penalties. (3) In the alternative, because FCC is acting in contravention of representations to National that FCC would act in commercially reasonable manner in the enforcement of its security, which representations National has acted upon to its detriment, the FCC action is barred during the respective three-year periods of barn use restriction by the doctrine of equitable estoppel. (4) The present FCC claims for foreclosure should be dismissed or the court should declare that FCC is estopped from foreclosing or taking possession of secured property until the expiration of the respective three‑year HTP periods (in the case of Titan in May 2012 and in the case of Stomp (2008) in June 2013). [5] In the present motions FCC seeks orders pursuant to Rule 173(a) and (e) and the court’s inherent jurisdiction to strike the entire statements of defence on the following grounds:(a) the statements of defence filed by the defendant fail to disclose reasonable defences to the plaintiff’s foreclosure proceedings;(b) the claims asserted on statements of defence should be advanced in separate actions; and(c) the statements of defence are otherwise an abuse of the process of this Honourable Court. [6] FCC submits: (a) The statements of defence do not contain allegations which challenge the enforceability of the FCC mortgages or of the foreclosure actions. (b) National has only been added as party defendant to the foreclosure actions required by Rule 436(2A) because of National’s interest in the equity of redemption (subject to the rights of FCC), as disclosed in the Land Titles records. (c) The obvious primary purpose of the statements of defence is to delay the FCC foreclosure actions. (d) National is in effect seeking to enjoin the foreclosure actions without having to meet the more stringent requirements for injunctive relief. [7] National submits: (a) FCC has not met the threshold for Rule 173 relief which requires that the jurisdiction of the court to strike pleadings must be exercised sparingly and only in exceptional cases. (b) The authorities do not support the FCC contention that because the statements of defence do not challenge either the mortgage contract or the amounts owing on the secured indebtedness, National has not raised any reasonable defence. (c) National has raised reasonable defences including: (i) breach by FCC of collateral contracts which are clearly connected to the mortgages, together with the doctrine of equitable estoppel which precludes enforcement in circumstances such as the present; (ii) National has the right to defend the actions because of its interest in the equity of redemption. (d) The purpose of the statements of defence is to protect the interests of National pursuant to the collateral agreements; there is no basis to imply improper motives. [8] The authorities are clear that pleadings should only be struck pursuant to Rule 173 in cases where it is obvious that the claim or defence is devoid of all merit or cannot possibly succeed. Such jurisdiction should be very sparingly exercised, only in very exceptional cases, and where the court is satisfied that the claim or defence is devoid of all merit. See: Odgers’ Principles of Pleading and Practice, 20th ed.; Canada (Attorney General) v. Inuit Tapirisat, 1980 CanLII 21 (SCC), [1980] S.C.R. 735; Sagon v. Royal Bank (1992), 1992 CanLII 8287 (SK CA), 105 Sask. R. 133 (C.A.). [9] Arguably the Supreme Court of Canada has in the recent case of R. v. Imperial Tobacco Canada Ltd., 2011 SCC 42 (CanLII), [2011] S.C.R. 45, prescribed more robust approach to striking pleadings. The words “beyond doubt” from the Inuit case are no longer included in the prescribed criteria. have already commented on the Imperial Tobacco case in my decision in Battiste v. First Nations Bank, 2011 SKQB 473 (CanLII), [2011] S.J. No. 806 (QL), so it is unnecessary to repeat that discussion here. In any event, find that if the Imperial Tobacco case changes the law, the change has no impact on the present decision. [10] Although many of the Rule 173 cases involve allegations in statements of claim it is clear that the same criteria are applicable to statements of defence. See Canada Trustco Mortgage Co. v. Vaidya (1993), 1993 CanLII 6779 (SK QB), 112 Sask. R. 237 (Q.B.); Southwest Credit Union v. Prairie Meadows Farming, 2005 SKQB 405 (CanLII), 270 Sask. R. 100. [11] It is not in dispute that in an application pursuant to Rule 173(a) the court may only consider the pleadings, further particulars thereof, and any document referred to therein, but on an application pursuant to Rule 173(e) the court may assess the merits of the pleading and the motives of the party in presenting it. See Sagon v. Royal Bank, supra; Bank of Montreal v. Schmidt (1989), 1989 CanLII 4749 (SK CA), 75 Sask. R. 157 (C.A.). [12] Of particular note is the case of CIBC v. Sylvester, 2002 SKCA 52 (CanLII), 219 Sask. R. 138. In that case the court struck defence to foreclosure action because it did not challenge the alleged balance owing. The court held that an allegation of breach of fiduciary duty against the plaintiff was not properly included as defence and should only be advanced by way of counterclaim or in separate action. This follows previous decisions of the Saskatchewan Court of Appeal in the cases of Agricultural Credit Corp. v. Lozinski (1994), 1994 CanLII 4540 (SK CA), 123 Sask. R. 157 (C.A.), and Agricultural Credit Corp. v. Reid (1993), 1993 CanLII 6617 (SK CA), 113 Sask. R. 315 (C.A.). [13] The case of 663073 Alberta Ltd. v. Big Mountain Development Corp., 2010 SKQB 274 (CanLII), 357 Sask. R. 292 is of interest. In that case the plaintiff applied to strike portions of the statement of defence in foreclosure action. Specifically in issue was whether the defendant was entitled to plead equitable set-off. The court referred to Rule 104A(1)(c) relating to set-off and dismissed the application on the basis that the defendant’s cross-claim was so closely connected with the plaintiff’s demand that it would be manifestly unjust for the plaintiff to proceed without taking the defendant’s cross-claim into consideration. To like effect is the case of CIBC Mortgage Corp. v. Rowatt (2002), 2002 CanLII 45110 (ON CA), 220 D.L.R. (4th) 139 (Ont. C.A.). [14] Also relevant is the case of Marciano v. Landa, 2005 SKQB 58 (CanLII), B.L.R. (4th) 281. Although this was case seeking relief under The Business Corporations Act, R.S.S. 1978, c. B-10, not foreclosure action, it merits consideration here because Chicoine J. of this court specifically addressed the criteria applicable to an application to strike pursuant to Rule 173(e) as distinct from Rule 173(a). Chicoine J. at para. 44 quoted from Bullen Leake Jacob’s Precedents of Pleadings, 12th ed. as follows: The term “abuse of the process of the court” is term of great significance. It connotes that the process of the court must be carried out properly, honestly and in good faith; and it means that the court will not allow its function as court of law to be misused but will in proper case, prevent its machinery from being used as means of vexation or oppression in the process of litigation. It follows that where an abuse of process has taken place, the intervention of the court by the stay or even dismissal of proceedings, “although it should not be lightly done, yet it may often be required by the very essence of justice to be done.” The term “abuse of process” is often used interchangeably with the terms “frivolous” or “vexatious” either separately or more usually in conjunction. ... In determining the reasonableness of the cause of action, Chicoine J. applied the plain and obvious test. [15] In my opinion this application turns on the interpretation of the impact of the Court of Appeal decision in the CIBC v. Sylvester case, supra. Clearly the court held in that case, and in those which preceded it, that neither plea of set-off based on breach of fiduciary duty or plea of lack of procedural fairness can be defence to foreclosure action and such pleas can only be advanced by way of set‑off or in separate action. But does this mean, as FCC contends, that defendant cannot ever challenge foreclosure action on grounds other than the validity of the security or on the balance owing on the secured debt? do not see that in rejecting the proffered defences in the Sylvester case the Court of Appeal has necessarily circumscribed the pleadable defences in the manner that FCC contends. am unable to accept the submission that these cases serve to preclude the defences advanced by National in the present cases, arising, as they do, specifically from the express provisions of an alleged inter-creditor agreement. I accept that such pleading can serve to delay, but not defeat, FCC, or prevent FCC from proceeding with its foreclosure actions. [16] The defences advanced by National are, as was the situation in the 663073 Alberta Ltd. case, supra, so closely connected with FCC’s demands that it would be manifestly unjust for FCC to proceed without taking National’s defences into consideration. CONCLUSION [17] Both applications are accordingly dismissed. Although the facts and circumstances in each case are virtually identical, the complexity of them makes it appropriate that each defendant recover separate costs on the appropriate tariff.",9_2012skqb99.txt,"FIAT: The plaintiff sought orders pursuant to Rule 173(a) and (e)of the Queen's Bench Rules and the Court's inherent jurisdiction to strike the entire statements of defence as they failed to disclose reasonable defences; the claims asserted on statements of defence should be advanced in separate actions; and the statements of defence were abuse of the Court's process.
HELD: The applications were dismissed with each defendant to recover separate costs on the appropriate tariff.
Although the defendants' pleading may delay but not defeat or prevent the plaintiff from proceeding with its foreclosure action, the defences were so closely connected with the plaintiff's demands that it would be manifestly unjust for the plaintiff to proceed without taking the defendant's defences into consideration."
626,"Introduction: [1] Where person is killed due to the fault of another, the person’s estate may sue the wrongdoer for certain damages which have resulted in “an actual pecuniary loss to the estate.” The main question to be decided in this case is whether the earnings which the deceased would likely have earned had he or she not been killed are “an actual pecuniary loss to the estate” and are, therefore, recoverable by the estate in an action against the wrongdoer.
In their claims under each of them, the appellants rely on allegedly wrongful acts of the respondent for which Paul Levy could have sued had he been injured rather than killed.
Where child is killed as result of another’s negligence, the fatal injuries action is not likely to provide much in the way of compensation for the surviving family members.
It also specifically excludes damages for punitive and exemplary matters, loss of expectation of life and pain and suffering.
Their statement of claim alleges that “... it was reasonably expected that Paul Levy would in future earn income in employment or otherwise, and by his death his estate has suffered pecuniary loss arising from the loss of Paul Levy’s future earning capacity.” [8] The appellants’ claim is straightforward.
If he had been badly disabled instead of killed as result of the accident, he might well have been able to succeed in substantial claim for damages for his lost earning capacity.
The Question for Decision: [13] To succeed on their Survival of Actions Act claim for damages for Paul’s lost earning capacity, the estate: (a) must have cause of action that survives his death for the benefit of the estate; and (b) the damages claimed for his lost earning capacity must not be excluded by the provisions of that Act.
The issue, therefore, is whether the damages sought by the estate for Paul’s lost earning capacity are excluded under s. 4, either because they do not constitute “an actual pecuniary loss to the estate” or because they relate to damages for “loss of expectation of life.” [16] The main legal question on this appeal thus boils down to the interpretation of few words in Nova Scotia’s survival of actions legislation the phrase that restricts recovery of damages in survival actions to “actual pecuniary loss to the estate” and the phrase that prohibits the award of damages for “loss of expectation of life.” [17] The survival of actions legislation was enacted to relieve against specific aspects of very old common law rule.
All of this legislation was enacted against particular background of how damages for lost earning capacity are assessed in personal injury actions by living plaintiffs.
(i) The common law background: [20] This case concerns the rights of survivors of persons killed as result of the negligence of another person.
This rule was considerably amended by legislation in England in 1846 and similar changes occurred in Canadian common law jurisdictions about the same time.
[27] It is significant that the primary purpose of this legislation was to put the survivors of person wrongfully killed in the financial position they would have been in had the deceased lived and continued to provide support.
[28] In the case of Nova Scotia’s legislation, this basic purpose has been expanded in two respects.
[29] think it important to note that this fatal injuries legislation does not do away entirely with the common law rule barring wrongful death actions.
[30] note that this is not an old statute that has been ignored by the Legislature in the many years since it was first enacted.
The statute has been amended several times with respect to both the types of damages that are recoverable and the definition of the persons for whose benefit the action may be brought.
(b) Survivorship Claims: [31] As noted earlier, the common law rule was that actions in tort did not survive the death of the injured person.
For example, there could be no award for exemplary damages: s. 1(2).
That case concerned young woman who had been seriously injured in car accident and died from her injuries four days later.
An award was also made under the survival of actions legislation, but the trial judge refused to include damages for loss of expectation of life.
He stated that living plaintiff could recover damages for loss of expectation of life and that it followed from the words of s. 1(1) of the 1934 Act that the cause of action is made to survive for the benefit of the estate and is, therefore, enforceable by her legal personal representative against the defendant: at 837.
193-94) which described the background to this amendment as follows: Ontario had on the statute books for over fifty years legislation which, while differing in many respects from the English Act, undoubtedly was designed to achieve the same result of allowing the personal representative of person injured by tortious conduct to continue the action for the benefit of the estate.
The living plaintiff may recover substantial non-pecuniary damages for pain and suffering and loss of expectation and enjoyment of life.
[44] In the early 1960's, the Uniform Law Conference of Canada studied and reported on the subject of survival of actions legislation and drafted Uniform Survival of Actions Act: see W.F.
(emphasis added) [47] Apparently accepting the view of the Alberta Commissioners, the Uniformity Commissioners did not include an express exclusion of damages for loss of expectancy of earnings subsequent to death.
Dean Bowker noted that legislation in all but two common law provinces had abolished the claim by statute (Nova Scotia among them, as mentioned earlier).
[51] In many personal injury cases, one of the most significant claims is for compensation for the injured person’s loss of the ability to earn income which has resulted from the accident.
Generally speaking, the approach is to calculate lump sum representing the present value of the income which the victim would likely have earned had he or she not been injured.
Without the injury (and subject to the risks of life and career) the person would likely have continued to earn income until normal retirement age.
That case decided that the recovery for future loss of earnings should be confined to the period during which the plaintiff was likely to remain alive.
began his discussion of the “lost years” issue by noting that neither of the possible approaches, (i.e., using pre-accident or post-accident life expectancy to calculate the loss of future earnings) produced “wholly satisfactory” result: at 225.
[56] As Professor Jolowicz pointed out in the note have just referred to, if the lost years are compensated in the case of living plaintiff, logic would suggest that “... damages for loss of earnings calculated by reference to the deceased’s pre-accident expectation of working life should be awarded for his estate ...” under the survival of actions legislation.
Whatever the logic of Rose v. Ford [1937] A.C. 826 and similar cases, the notion of awarding damages to deceased person’s estate in respect of the tort which killed him is merely fanciful so long as the Fatal Accidents Acts remain on the statute book.
[58] Until it was overruled in 1978, Oliver v. Ashman settled the law of England concerning the calculation of loss of future earning capacity in personal injury action by living plaintiff.
[59] Pickett was claim by living plaintiff for damages suffered as result of his having contracted lung disease from inhaling asbestos in the defendant’s workshops.
The lung disease greatly reduced Mr. Pickett’s life expectancy; at the time of trial, it was only one year.
In assessing the loss of future earnings, the plaintiff’s pre-accident (or in this case pre-illness) life expectancy was to be considered.
[63] Turning to consider the question as matter of principle, Lord Wilberforce rejected the notion that nothing is of value unless the person is there to spend or save it.
... [The law] always has to answer question which in the end can hardly be more accurately framed than as: “Is the loss of this something for which the claimant should and reasonably can be compensated?” (at 781) (emphasis added) [64] Lord Wilberforce concluded in these words: My Lords, in the case of the adult wage earner with or without dependants who sues for damages during his lifetime, am convinced that rule which enables the ‘lost years’ to be taken account of comes closer to the ordinary man’s expectations than one which limits his interest to his shortened span of life.
While agreeing with his colleagues that Benham v. Gambling did not settle the issue as the Court of Appeal had thought in Oliver, he held that the matter should be resolved by legislation rather than judicial decision.
The Court referred to this claim as one for the loss of earning capacity rather than of future earnings, emphasizing that it is “capital asset” that has been lost and which must be valued: at 251.
To understand why this is significant point, must say word about the nature of “general” damages in personal injury cases.
[70] In personal injury cases, the damage award has two main components.
This consists of out-of-pocket expenses and loss of earnings incurred down to the date of trial, and is generally capable of substantially exact calculation.
The familiar examples are medical and surgical fees paid or payable, ambulance and hospital expenses and loss of income.
Damages to compensate this loss are general damages because they are not “... capable of precise arithmetical calculation or at least of being estimated with close approximation to accuracy”.
It is therefore necessary to examine how the “lost years” issue has been treated by the Courts in survival of actions claims.
[76] That case concerned an action by the personal representative of two and one-half year old child who had been severely injured in motor vehicle accident and died the same day.
The only issue at trial was the amount of damages which should be awarded and in that regard, it was recognized that the only substantial claim which could be asserted was for the child’s lost expectation of life.
He noted (at 167) that “[of] course, no regard must be had to financial losses or gains during the period of which the victim has been deprived.
The case involved the claims by the parents of two young men who had been killed in accidents caused by the negligence of the defendants.
It is particularly difficult to justify the law in cases such as the present, in each of which the deceased was young man with no established earning capacity or settled pattern of life.
The process of assessing damages in such cases is so extremely uncertain that it can hardly be dignified with the name of calculation: it is little more than speculation.
These all express the view that the various survival of actions statutes in Canada were not intended to give the estate claim for the deceased’s loss of future earnings.
[88] While the learned authors questioned whether this result was fully justified on the wording of some of the provincial statutes, their observation about the settled practice is an important part of the context in which Nova Scotia’s survival statute was enacted.
[90] First, the English survival of actions statute of 1934 did not explicitly exclude damages for pain and suffering or for loss of expectation of life.
[91] Second, English law was somewhat uncertain until Oliver v. Ashman as to whether living plaintiff could recover damages for loss of earnings during the so-called “lost years”.
However, it was generally accepted until 1978 that there could be no claim for loss of expected future earnings for the time after death in an action by personal representatives under the survival legislation.
It follows that if both claims may be asserted, there is the potential of the defendant being required to pay damages twice over for essentially the same loss.
[95] The cases deciding that the “lost years” should be counted in calculating damages for lost earning capacity for living plaintiff treat the loss as one capable of being valued in money or, in Canada, as something in the nature of capital asset whose value has been diminished or extinguished.
Moreover, the survival of actions legislation was not aimed specifically at the rights and interests of surviving family members in wrongful death cases.
It bears repeating that the claim asserted here is not for the amount by which the estate would have appreciated had the deceased not died prematurely and continued to earn.
Rather, it is for something in the nature of capital asset which the estate could never acquire without the wrongful death.
[99] It is clear that the Nova Scotia Legislature intended to avoid some of the results which had flowed from judicial interpretation of the English survival statute.
[100] The appellants referred us to the explanatory note to the Nova Scotia survival of actions Bill which accompanied its introduction in April of 1954.
The note states that the Bill’s purpose was “... to provide for the survival of [personal] actions by or against the estate of deceased person.” This is hardly controversial.
second consequence is that tortfeasor who causes the death of an unmarried wage-earner has to pay much larger damages than formerly thought to be exigible, for the value of the lost earning capacity will be recoverable by the estate.
It is hard to think that the Legislature’s purpose in enacting the Survival of Actions Act was to render the fatal injuries scheme either irrelevant or duplicative of other remedies depending on the facts of the particular case.
The Fatal Injuries Act may well not achieve what many will think to be just result in all cases, but it does represent clear and considered legislative judgment about which survivors of person wrongfully killed should be compensated and on what terms.
It is embodied in section 9(5) of the Interpretation Act and requires that every enactment be considered remedial and interpreted to insure the attainment of its objects.
[107] turn next to consider whether the appellants’ interpretation is plausible, efficacious and acceptable.
[108] The question here is whether the appellants’ interpretation is plausible in the sense that it complies with the text of the Act.
[109] The issue is whether claim for deceased person’s loss of prospective income relates to “an actual pecuniary loss to the estate.” [110] should say at the outset that in looking for “plausible” interpretation, one is looking for the most plausible interpretation in light of the words used by the legislation judged in their full context.
[112] The appellants submit that the word “actual” may be used in the sense of “real” and that loss may be real even though it is prospective: see Duncan v. Baddeley (1997), 1997 CanLII 11516 (AB CA), 145 D.L.R.
opined in that case that the exclusion of losses other than those which are ‘an actual financial loss’ is meant “... to rid the surviving action of any claim that is notional or fictive (e.g.
[113] First, that interpretation makes the phrase “actual pecuniary loss to the estate” superfluous.
It follows that if the phrase ‘actual pecuniary loss to the estate’ is meant only to exclude exemplary and non-pecuniary damages, it adds nothing to the specific exclusions of these matters.
[116] think more plausible interpretation results from paying attention to the legal parlance surrounding claims for lost earning capacity.
[121] conclude, therefore, that the appellants’ interpretation of the phrase “actual pecuniary loss to the estate” so that it refers to the deceased’s loss of future earnings is not plausible in the sense that it is not the most plausible interpretation in light of the full context in which words are employed.
[122] The question here is what interpretation of the legislation would best give effect to the Legislature’s purpose.
The primary purpose of the fatal injury legislation is to provide compensation to dependants for the loss of prospective support which they could reasonably expect to have received from the deceased had death not occurred as the result of wrongful act.
It is also now clear in both England and in Canada that damages for the prospective loss of earnings in personal injury cases are awarded for the period of the pre-accident life expectancy; i.e., an award is made which includes compensation for the “lost years”.
[128] One of the underpinnings of this argument is the view that similar rules of damages must apply to both fatal injury and survival of actions cases.
It obscures the fundamental question which is not theoretical symmetry but how to unravel the competing interests of survivors with stake in the deceased’s life.
Fatal injuries legislation created new, but limited statutory cause of action for wrongful death in favour of those dependant on the deceased.
In personal injury cases, the loss of prospective earnings is considered something in the nature of capital asset and therefore should not be reduced on account of taxation.
[134] Judges and scholars have recognized that different rules may be appropriate for claims by living plaintiffs and those by the estate of deceased persons.
commented that although the law compelled him to do otherwise, there were good reasons for compensating for the lost years in claim by living plaintiff and not doing so in survival of actions case: at 228.
[135] The second aspect of the appellants’ point is that it is only just that the estate recover what would have been received by the deceased had he lived to pursue his claim.
However, the question of what is acceptable and just in this case is essentially one of policy which has many aspects and with respect to which reasonable people may reasonably differ.
comparison of the majority and minority judgments in Duncan v. Baddeley and consideration of the Alberta Law Reform Institute’s Report in response to that case provide good introduction to the range of questions that must be answered in trying to determine what is just in this context.
Whatever one thinks of these and the many other arguments which are made on this subject, we must remember that this case is not about what the best rule for compensation in wrongful death cases might be.","A fifteen year old died in a motor vehicle accident.
The estate brought a claim for loss of future income and lost earning capacity.
The Chambers judge found that such a claim was not available and the estate appealed.
Appeal dismissed;
the context of the legislation, its purpose and text all support the conclusion that the deceased's loss of prospective earnings is not an actual pecuniary loss to the estate.",597,"J.

CROMWELL, J.A.: I. Introduction: [1] Where person is killed due to the fault of another, the person’s estate may sue the wrongdoer for certain damages which have resulted in “an actual pecuniary loss to the estate.” The main question to be decided in this case is whether the earnings which the deceased would likely have earned had he or she not been killed are “an actual pecuniary loss to the estate” and are, therefore, recoverable by the estate in an action against the wrongdoer. [2] In my opinion, for the reasons which follow, the Legislature has denied such claim to the estate but has provided the deceased’s dependants with statutory cause of action for the lost financial support and other losses resulting from the wrongful death. If the redress under that statutory cause of action is thought to be inadequate, the cure must be legislative, not judicial. II. Facts and Decision of the Chambers Judge: [3] Paul Levy died on January 25, 1999. He was fifteen. His mother, Ann MacLean, along with Paul’s father and two brothers started an action in the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia in which they allege that Paul’s death resulted from the negligent driving of the respondent, Mr. MacDonald. (I will refer to the plaintiffs collectively as the appellants and to Mr. MacDonald as the respondent). [4] The appellants’ action is based on two Nova Scotia statutes. In their claims under each of them, the appellants rely on allegedly wrongful acts of the respondent for which Paul Levy could have sued had he been injured rather than killed. [5] The first statute under which the appellants sue is the Fatal Injuries Act, R.S.N.S. 1989, c. 163. This claim is not directly in issue on this appeal. Under that Act, defined group of persons, including the deceased’s parents, may claim for damages against wrongdoer who caused the deceased’s death. The damages are to compensate the survivors for the loss of financial support which they could reasonably have expected and the loss of the care, guidance and companionship which they would have received from the deceased had he lived. Where child is killed as result of another’s negligence, the fatal injuries action is not likely to provide much in the way of compensation for the surviving family members. Generally no one would have reasonable expectation of receiving significant financial support from the child. While there is provision in the fatal injuries statute for damages for loss of companionship, those damages have generally in the past been fairly modest. [6] The second statute under which the appellants claim is the Survival of Actions Act, R.S.N.S. 1989, c. 453. Under that Act, any right to sue in negligence which Paul would have had, if he had not been killed, survives for the benefit of his estate. However, the Act limits the type of damages which may be recovered by the estate to those which have resulted in “actual pecuniary loss to the estate”. It also specifically excludes damages for punitive and exemplary matters, loss of expectation of life and pain and suffering. The restriction of damages to “actual pecuniary loss to the estate” and the exclusion of damages for loss of expectation of life are at the heart of this appeal. [7] The appellants, in their action under the Survival of Actions Act, advance a claim for Paul’s lost earning capacity. Their statement of claim alleges that “... it was reasonably expected that Paul Levy would in future earn income in employment or otherwise, and by his death his estate has suffered pecuniary loss arising from the loss of Paul Levy’s future earning capacity.” [8] The appellants’ claim is straightforward. They say, in my view correctly, that had he been seriously injured instead of being killed, Paul’s loss of earning capacity would have been treated as capital asset the value of which had been either diminished or destroyed by his injuries. The appellants claim that this capital asset was destroyed by his death, that this loss crystalized in the instant before his death and, therefore, passed to his estate upon death. The estate, they say, can, therefore, sue for damages for this loss under the Survival of Actions Act. [9] The appellants, in essence, ask the Court to interpret the survival of actions legislation so as to prevent an injustice. The deceased here, Paul Levy, was young person. If he had been badly disabled instead of killed as result of the accident, he might well have been able to succeed in substantial claim for damages for his lost earning capacity. Even if he had died from his injuries shortly after that claim had been resolved, his estate would likely have benefited from the award as the unspent portion of the settlement or judgment would pass to the estate on death. As it is, though, unless his estate is entitled to claim for his loss of future earnings, the only significant claim will be under the Fatal Injuries Act. Any recovery under that Act, for reasons mentioned earlier, is likely to be much smaller than would be recovery by seriously injured person who lived to sue. (Of course, none of the facts about liability or damages are before us, so am speaking here in generalities). [10] The respondent says that such damages cannot be awarded under the Survival of Actions Act. His position is that the loss of the deceased’s future earning capacity is not an “actual pecuniary loss to the estate” and therefore is not recoverable. Alternatively, the respondent argues that this claim is for loss of expectation of life and is, therefore, specifically excluded. [11] The appellants applied to MacDonald, A.C.J.S.C. for the determination of preliminary point of law. The question posed for the judge’s determination was whether Paul Levy’s estate has right to claim damages under the Survival of Actions Act in respect to the deceased’s loss of earning capacity. In a written decision reported at (2001), 2001 NSSC 83 (CanLII), 195 N.S.R. (2d) 44, the learned Associate Chief Justice concluded that the estate was not entitled to do so because loss of earning capacity does not constitute an “actual pecuniary loss to the estate,” as required by the Survival of Actions Act. The appellants now appeal that determination. [12] It is important to remember that there has been no trial in this matter. The facts before the Court are those agreed to by the parties for the limited purpose of resolving preliminary point of law. Whether Mr. MacDonald, the respondent on this appeal, was negligent and liable for damages in relation to Paul’s death have not been decided and are not in issue here. The only question on this appeal is one of law, namely, whether, if Mr. McDonald was at fault, Paul Levy’s estate would be entitled to claim damages for Paul’s lost earning capacity. 1. The Question for Decision: [13] To succeed on their Survival of Actions Act claim for damages for Paul’s lost earning capacity, the estate: (a) must have cause of action that survives his death for the benefit of the estate; and (b) the damages claimed for his lost earning capacity must not be excluded by the provisions of that Act. [14] It will be helpful at this point to set out the relevant provisions of the Nova Scotia Survival of Actions Act: (1) Except as provided in subsection (2), where person dies, all causes of action subsisting against or vested in him survive against or, as the case may be, for the benefit of his estate. 4. Where cause of action survives for the benefit of the estate of deceased person, only damages that have resulted in actual pecuniary loss to the estate are recoverable, and in no case are damages recoverable for (a) punitive and exemplary matters; (b) loss of expectation of life; (c) pain and suffering. (emphasis added) [15] For the purposes of this preliminary point of law, it has been assumed that Paul Levy had, at the time of his death, cause of action in negligence “vested in him” against the respondent and that, under s. of the Act, that cause of action therefore survives “for the benefit of his estate”. The issue, therefore, is whether the damages sought by the estate for Paul’s lost earning capacity are excluded under s. 4, either because they do not constitute “an actual pecuniary loss to the estate” or because they relate to damages for “loss of expectation of life.” [16] The main legal question on this appeal thus boils down to the interpretation of few words in Nova Scotia’s survival of actions legislation the phrase that restricts recovery of damages in survival actions to “actual pecuniary loss to the estate” and the phrase that prohibits the award of damages for “loss of expectation of life.” [17] The survival of actions legislation was enacted to relieve against specific aspects of very old common law rule. It was enacted after fatal injuries legislation which addressed another related common law rule. All of this legislation was enacted against particular background of how damages for lost earning capacity are assessed in personal injury actions by living plaintiffs. Therefore, while only few words of the statute are in the foreground of this appeal, there is rich and complicated background against which they must be interpreted. [18] In attempting to find the correct interpretation of these statutory provisions, the Court must “... determine the meaning of legislation in its total context, having regard to the purpose of the legislation, the consequences of proposed interpretations, the presumptions and special rules of interpretation, as well as admissible external aids”: see Ruth Sullivan (ed.), Driedger on the Construction of Statutes (3rd, 1994) at 131. Having considered these matters, the Court should adopt the appropriate interpretation. The appropriate interpretation is one which is plausible in the sense that it complies with the text of the Act, which is efficacious, in the sense that it promotes the legislative purpose and that is acceptable in the sense that the outcome is reasonable and just: Ibid. [19] will, therefore, address the context of the legislation, its purpose and the consequences of the proposed interpretations offered by the parties. will then turn to determination of the appropriate interpretation in light of plausibility, efficary and justice. (i) The common law background: [20] This case concerns the rights of survivors of persons killed as result of the negligence of another person. At common law, the question of what these rights were had simple but harsh answer. There were none. This result flowed from two very old common law rules. [21] The first of those rules was that the estate of deceased person could not sue or be sued for any tort committed against or by the deceased in his or her lifetime: John G. Fleming, The Law of Torts (9th, 1998) at 741; P.A. Landon, Pollock’s Law of Torts (14th, 1939) at 53 54. The second rule was that there was no action at common law for wrongful death. That is, one person could not recover damages from another person for causing the death of third: see e.g., Alberta Law Reform Institute, Report No. 76: Should Claim for the Loss of Chance of Future Earnings Survive Death? (1998). For example, the death of family’s breadwinner due to the wrongful act of another person did not give rise to any right of action on the part of the family members whom the deceased had supported: see A.I. Ogus, The Law of Damages (1973) at 264; Pollock’s Law of Torts, supra at p. 54 58. [22] The result of these two rules was as follows. First, where person was killed due to the fault of another, no cause of action in tort, which the deceased would have had if he had lived, survived his death for the benefit of the estate. Second, those who suffered financial loss as result of the loss of support previously provided to them by the deceased had no independent cause of action against the wrongdoer who caused the death. Thus, the estate had no right of action derived from the wrongful act suffered by the deceased because the deceased’s claim did not survive his or her death. The deceased’s dependants had no separate claim for the loss of support suffered directly by them as result of the wrongful act because no cause of action for wrongful death was recognized. (ii) Legislative reforms: [23] These rules were unsatisfactory. They were changed by legislation in two main respects. First, the dependants of deceased person were given statutory right to sue the wrongdoer whose negligence caused the death of the deceased. Under these statutes (often called “fatal injury” or “wrongful death” statutes), they could recover compensation for the amount they would have received from the deceased had he or she not been killed. Second, legislation (generally called survival of actions legislation) was enacted stating that causes of action which existed in favour of or against the deceased at the time of death survived for or against the deceased’s estate. It will be helpful to review these legislative developments. (a) Wrongful death claims: [24] As noted, the common law did not recognize claim for wrongful death. This rule was considerably amended by legislation in England in 1846 and similar changes occurred in Canadian common law jurisdictions about the same time. By 1873, Nova Scotia legislation permitted an action to be brought for the benefit of the deceased’s “wife, husband, parent or child” against person whose wrongful act caused the deceased’s death: R.S. 1873, c. 113, s. and 2. [25] This action was for what is often referred to as the “dependancy amount”. The damages awarded (apart from certain other claims not relevant here) were to be based on the financial support that the wife, husband, parent and child could reasonably have expected to receive from the deceased had he or she not been killed. The defendant’s liability depended on it being shown that the death was caused by the defendant’s wrongful act which would have entitled the injured party to sue had death not occurred. However, the damages recoverable were based on the loss his or her death caused to the surviving spouse, parent and children. [26] The starting point for the calculation of that loss was (and is) the earnings which the deceased would have received had he or she not been killed; in other words, the earnings during the period by which the deceased’s working life was shortened by the wrongful death. That period is included in what is often called the “lost years”, that is, the years of life lost as result of the wrongful act. [27] It is significant that the primary purpose of this legislation was to put the survivors of person wrongfully killed in the financial position they would have been in had the deceased lived and continued to provide support. [28] In the case of Nova Scotia’s legislation, this basic purpose has been expanded in two respects. First, in 1956, the Fatal Injuries Act (which had been enacted in 1873) was amended to make it clear that, in assessing the compensation to be paid, sums payable on the death of the deceased such as pensions or proceeds of insurance were not to be deducted from the compensation otherwise payable by the defendants: S.N.S. 1956, c.26, s. 1(2). Second, in 1986, the Act was amended to permit recovery of damages for the guidance, care and companionship which the survivors lost as result of the deceased’s death: S.N.S. 1986, c. 30, s. 1(d). In addition to these two major changes, the list of persons included in the definition of dependants has been updated from time to time. [29] think it important to note that this fatal injuries legislation does not do away entirely with the common law rule barring wrongful death actions. Rather, it only modifies the rule in specific ways. The claim under the legislation is limited to defined class of persons. It provides for compensation for all of them, but in one action, and the compensation to which they are entitled is primarily for the loss of support they reasonably could have expected to receive from the deceased had he or she lived. [30] note that this is not an old statute that has been ignored by the Legislature in the many years since it was first enacted. The statute has been amended several times with respect to both the types of damages that are recoverable and the definition of the persons for whose benefit the action may be brought. think it is significant that the Legislature has, over the years, including quite recently, repeatedly addressed itself to both these issues. (b) Survivorship Claims: [31] As noted earlier, the common law rule was that actions in tort did not survive the death of the injured person. This was altered in all Canadian common law jurisdictions and in England by legislation providing that all, or virtually all, causes of action survive for the benefit of, or against, the estate of the deceased. [32] The legislative change in England was made by the Law Reform (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 1934. This was nearly 90 years after the introduction of statutory wrongful death actions. The 1934 Act provided that, upon death, all causes of action subsisting against or vested in the deceased (except defamation, seduction and inducing one spouse to leave another) survived against or for the benefit of the deceased’s estate: s. 1(1). There were certain restrictions on the damages which could be recovered. For example, there could be no award for exemplary damages: s. 1(2). Apart from such restrictions on the damages recoverable and the exclusion of the three types of action referred to earlier, the legislation placed the estate of the deceased in the same position with respect to the action as the deceased would have been had death not occurred. [33] It is important to note that the English statute, unlike the later Nova Scotia one, did not contain stipulation that only damages which were an “actual pecuniary loss to the estate” could be recovered and it did not bar the recovery of damages for loss of expectation of life. [34] The impact of the English legislation was considered by the House of Lords in Rose v. Ford, [1937] A.C. 826 (H.L.). That case concerned young woman who had been seriously injured in car accident and died from her injuries four days later. The woman’s father sued both under the Fatal Accidents Act (1846) (i.e. the wrongful death statute) and under the 1934 survival of actions legislation. An award was made at trial under the former Act which was not challenged on appeal. An award was also made under the survival of actions legislation, but the trial judge refused to include damages for loss of expectation of life. The Court of Appeal agreed that no such damages could be awarded in survival action. The father appealed to the House of Lords and his appeal succeeded. [35] In the House of Lords, four extended speeches were delivered. Lord Atkin (with whom Lord Thankerton concurred) held that if, as he decided was the case, living plaintiff could recover damages for loss of expectation of life, it followed that such “... right is vested in him in life and on his death passes under the Act of 1934 to his personal representative.” at 834. He specifically refrained from deciding, however, how those damages should be calculated as that question was not before the House. Lord Russell of Killowen agreed. He stated that living plaintiff could recover damages for loss of expectation of life and that it followed from the words of s. 1(1) of the 1934 Act that the cause of action is made to survive for the benefit of the estate and is, therefore, enforceable by her legal personal representative against the defendant: at 837. Lord Wright was of the same view, joining the other Law Lords in emphasizing that the result flowed from the fact that living plaintiff could recover damages for loss of expectation of life and that such claims, not being excluded from the general provisions of the 1934 Act, could be asserted after death by the deceased’s personal representatives. [36] Lord Roche agreed that living plaintiff could claim for loss of expectation of life and that the 1934 statute permitted this claim to be asserted by the personal representatives. He also commented on the nature of the compensable loss under this head. He noted that the sum of £1000, which the Court of Appeal found would have been appropriate if damages were recoverable for loss of expectation of life, “... was obviously and rightly arrived at without regard to the question of the amount of future earnings ... [O]rdinarily, person may be assumed to have or be able to earn enough to live his or her life and to enjoy it. Earnings or income are otherwise and to an extent beyond this irrelevant.”: at 861. (emphasis added) [37] turn now to the development of survival of actions legislation in Canada. Dean Wilbur F. Bowker provided succinct summary as follows: The first survival legislation in Canada appeared in Ontario in 1886 as provision in the Trustee Act. The Northwest Territories borrowed Ontario’s Act and Alberta kept it. Thus section 32 of Alberta’s present Trustee Act provides for survival where the victim dies and section 33 where the wrongdoer does. The other western provinces have long had similar provisions. England had none until the Law Reform Act of 1934. Later each Maritime province passed Survival of Actions Act based on the English Act. Newfoundland’s survival provisions are in the Trustee Act, and are confined to torts to property. (W.F. Bowker, “The Uniform Survival of Actions Act” (1964), Alberta L.R. 197 at p. 197) [38] As Dean Bowker noted, general statutory provision for survival of actions in Canadian common law jurisdiction first appeared in Ontario in 1886 (Statute Amendment Act, S.O. 1886, c. 23.). (This was nearly fifty years before the English statute of 1934). The Ontario statute, which was adopted in some other Canadian jurisdictions, simply provided that rights of action, except in defamation, survived and could be asserted by the legal representatives of the deceased person. [39] The history of the Ontario provision is reviewed in detail in Balkos v. Cook (1990), 1990 CanLII 6743 (ON CA), 75 O.R. (2d) 593 (C.A.). One aspect of that history is particularly relevant to the issues on this appeal. [40] Not long after the decision of the House of Lords in Rose v. Ford in 1937, the Ontario provision was amended to undo the effects on Ontario law of that decision being followed. In Balkos, the Court cited 1938 article by Dean Cecil Wright (“The Abolition of Claims for Shortened Expectation of Life by Deceased’s Estate” (1938), 16 Can. Bar Rev. 198, at pp. 193-94) which described the background to this amendment as follows: Ontario had on the statute books for over fifty years legislation which, while differing in many respects from the English Act, undoubtedly was designed to achieve the same result of allowing the personal representative of person injured by tortious conduct to continue the action for the benefit of the estate. For over fifty years no one had thought that personal representative could collect damages for the estate of deceased person based solely on the fact that such person’s life had been shortened or that he had been killed by the defendant’s tortious conduct. Immediately after the new English legislation and the decision of the House of Lords in Rose v. Ford we find all this gone. personal representative is entitled on behalf of the estate to collect damages for the death. Presumably, therefore, this has been, in theory, the law of Ontario for over fifty years only no one knew it until in England legislation similar to ours was passed. (emphasis added) [41] The Nova Scotia survival of actions legislation was enacted in 1954 (Survival of Actions Act, S.N.S. 1954, c. 12). It was thus drafted in light of, among other things, the House of Lords decision in Rose v. Ford and the Ontario amendments of 1938 in response to it. The Nova Scotia legislation contained several exclusions and limitations not found in the earlier Ontario and English legislation. The Nova Scotia Act excluded causes of action for adultery and inducing spouse to leave or remain apart from his or her spouse: s. 2. Most relevant to this appeal is the limitation on damages set out in s. of the 1954 Act which provided: Where cause of action survives for the benefit of the estate of deceased person, only damages that have resulted in actual pecuniary loss to the estate are recoverable; and in no case are damages recoverable for: (a) punitive and exemplary matters; (b) loss of expectation of life; (c) pain and suffering. (emphasis added) [42] Thus, the Nova Scotia legislation excluded damages for loss of expectation of life, and thereby excluded the sorts of claims discussed by the House of Lords in Rose v. Ford. It also excluded damages for pain and suffering. In at least these two respects, the estate of person killed as result of the negligence of another (or injured and dying from some other cause before the negligence claim was resolved) was in significantly different position than seriously injured plaintiff who was able to pursue the negligence claim to judgment (or settlement) while living. The living plaintiff may recover substantial non-pecuniary damages for pain and suffering and loss of expectation and enjoyment of life. The estate of the person cannot. [43] The Nova Scotia legislation also limited damages to “... damages that have resulted in actual pecuniary loss to the estate ...”, limitation not found in the English statute. Like the English act, the Nova Scotia statute provided that the rights conferred under it were in addition to and not in derogation of rights of dependants under the Fatal Injuries Act: s. 5. The current form of the Act retains these features. (I have set out the relevant current provisions above.) [44] In the early 1960's, the Uniform Law Conference of Canada studied and reported on the subject of survival of actions legislation and drafted Uniform Survival of Actions Act: see W.F. Bowker, “The Uniform Survival of Actions Act” (1964), Alberta L.R. 197. The subject was initially referred to the Alberta Commissioners who reported in 1961. Their report reviewed the various provincial and territorial enactments and, among other issues, considered the question of survival of claims for loss of future earnings (what we would now call lost earning capacity) following death. The Alberta Commissioners in 1961 Report of the Alberta Commissioners in 1961 Proceedings of the Forty-Third Annual Meeting of the Conference of Commissioners on Uniformity of Legislation in Canada (August, 1961) were of the view that such claims did not survive death: At least one of the provinces excludes damages for death and compensation for expected earnings subsequent to death. We think this exclusion is not necessary because these items are not included in the first place; they are not surviving rights. ... (page 110) (emphasis added) [45] In the draft Uniform Act filed with the Report of the Alberta Commissioners, s. 6(1)(f) provided that no damages were recoverable for loss of expectancy of earnings subsequent to death. The Commissioners added note indicating they did not recommend inclusion of this restriction as they thought such loss was not recoverable in any case. [46] The Uniform Act was finalized in 1963 and its key provisions were as follows: (1) All causes of action vested in person who dies after the commencement of this Act, other than causes of action in respect of (a) adultery, (b) seduction, or (c) inducing one spouse to leave or remain apart from the other, survive for the benefit of his estate. (2) The rights conferred by subsection (1) are in addition to and not in derogation of any rights conferred by The Fatal Accidents Act. 4. All causes of action subsisting against person who dies after the commencement of this Act survive against his estate. 6. Where cause of action survives for the benefit of the estate of deceased person, only damages that have resulted in actual pecuniary loss to the deceased person or the estate are recoverable and, without restricting the generality of the foregoing, the damages recoverable shall not include punitive or exemplary damages or damages for loss of expectation of life, pain and suffering or physical disfigurement. (emphasis added) [47] Apparently accepting the view of the Alberta Commissioners, the Uniformity Commissioners did not include an express exclusion of damages for loss of expectancy of earnings subsequent to death. [48] Dean Wilbur F. Bowker was one of the Alberta Commissioners. He published an article in 1964 about the Uniform Survival of Actions Act to which have already referred. While the article does not address explicitly the issue of the deceased’s lost earning capacity, it does deal at length with the Uniform Act’s exclusion for damages for loss of expectation of life. Dean Bowker noted that legislation in all but two common law provinces had abolished the claim by statute (Nova Scotia among them, as mentioned earlier). The reason for the Conference’s adoption of that position is instructive. The Conference was of the view that, given the fatal injuries legislation which had been earlier enacted, the award of loss of expectation of life under the survival of actions legislation would be of no practical assistance to dependants. As Dean Bowker put it: ... The legislation should not cast its net so wide as to allow the estate of victim to make claim that represents no loss whatever to the estate. If the Fatal Accidents Act is too narrow it should be widened; and Survival Act should not be the vehicle for doing this indirectly, erratically and inefficiently: at 201 (emphasis added) [49] The texts of the current survival legislation in the common law provinces vary somewhat from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. These have been well summarized elsewhere and will not repeat these summaries here: see S.M. Waddams, The Law of Damages (looseleaf edition, updated December 2001) at para. (c) Compensation for the “lost years” in personal injury actions: [50] There is another common law rule that is part of the context for the interpretation of the survival of actions legislation. That rule concerns the calculation of the loss of future income in personal injury claims by living plaintiffs. [51] In many personal injury cases, one of the most significant claims is for compensation for the injured person’s loss of the ability to earn income which has resulted from the accident. This is often referred to as the loss of future earning capacity. Generally speaking, the approach is to calculate lump sum representing the present value of the income which the victim would likely have earned had he or she not been injured. There are many legal rules concerning how the proper amount of such claims should be calculated. However, only one aspect of this calculation is of concern in this case. [52] Suppose the accident not only disables the victim from earning income, but reduces his or her life expectancy The length of the reduction in life expectancy is referred to as “the lost years”. Should the victim’s lost earnings be determined having regard to the victim’s life expectancy as if there had been no accident or should the amount be determined on the basis of the victim’s reduced life expectancy after the accident? As the question is often put, should the award for lost earning capacity compensate for the “lost years”? [53] The answer to this question today, both in Canada and England, is yes; an award for lost earning capacity is based on the pre-accident life expectancy of the victim. This makes perfect sense because the object of the award is to put the injured person, as nearly as money can, into the position he or she would have been in had there been no injury. Without the injury (and subject to the risks of life and career) the person would likely have continued to earn income until normal retirement age. The award for the lost years thus compensates for the loss of that period of earning as result of the accident. [54] While this law is clear today, the law’s development on this point has rather tortuous history. In England, the answer to the “lost years” question was, at best, uncertain until the decision of the Court of Appeal in Oliver v. Ashman, [1962] Q.B. 210 (C.A.). (For discussion of the law before Oliver v. Ashman, see, for example, A.L. Armitage et al (eds.), Clerk Lindsell on Torts (12th, 1961) at para. 343; and see as well the 11th edition of the same work (1954) at para. 450). That case decided that the recovery for future loss of earnings should be confined to the period during which the plaintiff was likely to remain alive. The calculation was based on the victim’s post-accident, shortened life expectancy; lost earnings were not recoverable for the “lost years”. [55] Oliver v. Ashman is important for four reasons. First, and as already noted, it settled the law in England that expected earnings during the lost years were not compensable in personal injury action by living plaintiff. Second, the court held that this result was mandated by the decision of the House of Lords in Benham v. Gambling, [1941] A.C. 157. Third, the Court expressed the view, following Benham v. Gambling, that the same approach to the “lost years” question should be followed in both personal injury and survival of actions claims. Finally, and notwithstanding the view just mentioned, the case recognized that treating the lost years question the same way in both personal injury and survival of action cases did not always produce sensible results. Holroyd Pearce, L.J. began his discussion of the “lost years” issue by noting that neither of the possible approaches, (i.e., using pre-accident or post-accident life expectancy to calculate the loss of future earnings) produced “wholly satisfactory” result: at 225. Echoing some comments made by Professor Jolowicz in note in [1960] Cambridge Law Journal 160, he observed that the trial judge’s approach of using pre-accident life expectancy (i.e., ignoring the shortened expectation of life) seemed more appropriate in the case of living plaintiff while basing the award on the post-accident life expectancy was more apt in the case of survival of actions claim: 225. [56] As Professor Jolowicz pointed out in the note have just referred to, if the lost years are compensated in the case of living plaintiff, logic would suggest that “... damages for loss of earnings calculated by reference to the deceased’s pre-accident expectation of working life should be awarded for his estate ...” under the survival of actions legislation. However, he continued: So far as is known this has never in fact been done, nor is it desirable that it should be done. Whatever the logic of Rose v. Ford [1937] A.C. 826 and similar cases, the notion of awarding damages to deceased person’s estate in respect of the tort which killed him is merely fanciful so long as the Fatal Accidents Acts remain on the statute book. The loss is not that of the deceased but of his dependants, and those Acts provide the proper medium for the award of damages. It is to be observed, moreover, that damages under the Fatal Accidents Acts are calculated by reference to what the deceased would have earned if he had lived. (emphasis added) [57] should note here one aspect of the decision of the House of Lords decision in Benham v. Gambling which was relied on by the Court in Oliver. Benham was survival of actions case. Viscount Simon, speaking on behalf of unanimous House of Lords, stated that damages for loss of expectation of life (which had been held to be recoverable in survival of actions claims in Rose v. Ford) could not include any allowance for financial losses during the period of which the victim has been deprived: at 167. This is the statement relied on by the Court of Appeal in Oliver v. Ashman for the proposition that loss of prospective earnings for the lost years were not recoverable. [58] Until it was overruled in 1978, Oliver v. Ashman settled the law of England concerning the calculation of loss of future earning capacity in personal injury action by living plaintiff. This position changed, however, when in 1978 the House of Lords reversed Oliver v. Ashman in Pickett v. British Rail Engineering Ltd., [1979] All E.R. 774. [59] Pickett was claim by living plaintiff for damages suffered as result of his having contracted lung disease from inhaling asbestos in the defendant’s workshops. The lung disease greatly reduced Mr. Pickett’s life expectancy; at the time of trial, it was only one year. The trial judge awarded damages for loss of prospective earnings but, following Oliver v. Ashman, limited the award to the period of Mr. Pickett’s shortened life expectancy. He appealed, but died before the appeal had been heard by the Court of Appeal. His widow was substituted as plaintiff. The Court of Appeal, while increasing the amount of general damages, did not disturb the trial judge’s award in relation to loss of future earnings. The plaintiff appealed this aspect and the defendant appealed the increase of general damages to the House of Lords. will limit my consideration of the case to the issue of damages for loss of future earnings during the so-called lost years. [60] The House decided (Lord Russell of Killowen dissenting) that Oliver v. Ashman should be overruled. In assessing the loss of future earnings, the plaintiff’s pre-accident (or in this case pre-illness) life expectancy was to be considered. [61] Lord Wilberforce began his speech by pointing out the apparent injustice on the facts of Pickett. He noted that the law was clear that because Mr. Pickett had brought action in his life-time and recovered judgment, his dependants could not bring an action after his death under the fatal injuries legislation. He also noted that, in fatal injuries claim, unlike personal injury action by living plaintiff, the award would be based on the probable future earnings of the deceased according to his pre-accident life expectancy. In other words, even though Mr. Pickett had died before his appeal had been heard in the Court of Appeal, his widow had been denied any substantial recovery on account of loss of future earnings. The action had been brought and tried while Mr. Pickett had been alive and, therefore, no further action to benefit the dependants could be brought under the fatal injuries legislation. [62] Lord Wilberforce then turned to Oliver v. Ashman. He rejected the view expressed by Holroyd Pearce, L.J. in Oliver that the issue had been settled in Benham v. Gambling. He was of the view that Viscount Simon in Benham was not referring to claim by living person for earnings during the “lost years”. [63] Turning to consider the question as matter of principle, Lord Wilberforce rejected the notion that nothing is of value unless the person is there to spend or save it. He characterized person’s good health and sound earnings as “... an asset of present value quite separate and distinct from the expectation of life which every man possesses ...”. (at 780) Lord Wilberforce added: do not think that the problem can be solved by describing what has been lost as an ‘opportunity’ or ‘prospect’ or an ‘expectation’. ... [The law] always has to answer question which in the end can hardly be more accurately framed than as: “Is the loss of this something for which the claimant should and reasonably can be compensated?” (at 781) (emphasis added) [64] Lord Wilberforce concluded in these words: My Lords, in the case of the adult wage earner with or without dependants who sues for damages during his lifetime, am convinced that rule which enables the ‘lost years’ to be taken account of comes closer to the ordinary man’s expectations than one which limits his interest to his shortened span of life. The interest which such man has in the earnings he might hope to make over normal life, if not saleable in market, has value which can be assessed. man who receives that assessed value would surely consider himself and be considered compensated; man denied it would not. ... (p. 781) (emphasis added) Lord Salmon, Lord Edmund-Davies and Lord Scarman agreed. [65] The law lords agreed that compensating for income that would likely have been earned during the ‘lost years’ is consistent with the fundamental principle of compensation; that is, to put the plaintiff in the financial position he or she would have been in had the compensable injury not occurred. They also affirmed that the loss of future earnings during the lost years has value that can be assessed. They seemed to acknowledge, however, that the loss is of an ‘opportunity’ or ‘prospect’ or an ‘expectation’: see e.g. Lord Wilberforce at 780. Lord Scarman noted that there are “... logical and philosophical difficulties [in] compensating man for loss arising after his death ...” and that while such losses are pecuniary in the sense that “... the money would have been his to deal with as he chose, had he lived ...”, the loss is also, “... to some extent ...”, non-pecuniary loss: at p. 798. [66] Lord Russell of Killowen dissented on the lost years issue. While agreeing with his colleagues that Benham v. Gambling did not settle the issue as the Court of Appeal had thought in Oliver, he held that the matter should be resolved by legislation rather than judicial decision. He rejected the comparison to assessment of damages under the fatal injuries legislation, noting that fatal injuries claims are brought on behalf of living people “... in respect of their living periods, which is expressly based on what they have lost by death.” [67] After Pickett, the law of England in personal injury cases brought by living plaintiffs was that the calculation of loss of future earnings should provide compensation for the lost years. [68] The same rule was accepted in Canada. While apparently both before and after Oliver v. Ashman the question was the cause of some doubt in Canadian courts, the Pickett approach was unequivocally endorsed by the Supreme Court of Canada in Andrews v. Grand Toy Alberta Ltd., 1978 CanLII (SCC), [1978] S.C.R. 229. While the Court referred to this question as controversial one, it endorsed the view that, in personal injury actions by living plaintiffs, the claim for loss of future earnings should be assessed on the basis of pre-accident life expectancy. The lost years should be the subject of compensation: at 252. [69] Also relevant here is the way in which the Supreme Court of Canada characterized the loss of future earnings. The Court referred to this claim as one for the loss of earning capacity rather than of future earnings, emphasizing that it is “capital asset” that has been lost and which must be valued: at 251. The Court recognized, however, that determining this value requires gazing “... more deeply into the crystal ball ...” in order to discover the sort of career the victim would have had the “prospects” and “potential” before the accident: at 251. It is also worth noting that the Supreme Court of Canada in Andrews, consistent with longstanding practice, included the damages for lost earning capacity as part of the award of “general” damages: Andrews at p. 265 266. To understand why this is significant point, must say word about the nature of “general” damages in personal injury cases. [70] In personal injury cases, the damage award has two main components. The first is the special damages component which relates to pre-trial pecuniary loss. The second is the general damages component which includes all non-pecuniary losses as well as future pecuniary losses: see K. Cooper-Stevenson and Iwan Saunders, Personal Injury Damages in Canada (1981), at 43. This distinction between general and special damages is discussed as followed in Cooper-Stevenson and Saunders at p. 43 44: The primary distinction in personal injury cases is between “special damages”, which constitute pre-trial pecuniary loss, and “general damages”, which constitute future pecuniary loss and all non-pecuniary loss. This corresponds with the fourfold division of heads of damage recently adopted in Canada for personal injury cases. The distinction between special and general damages in this sense is now well accepted, and was outlined by Lord Goddard in B.T.C. v. Gourley, [1956] A.C. 185 (H.L.) as follows: In an action for personal injuries the damages are always divided into two main parts. First, there is what is referred to as special damage, which has to be specially pleaded and proved. This consists of out-of-pocket expenses and loss of earnings incurred down to the date of trial, and is generally capable of substantially exact calculation. Secondly, there is general damage which the law implies and is not specially pleaded. This includes compensation for pain and suffering and the like, and, if the injuries suffered are such as to lead to continuing or permanent disability, compensation for loss of earning power in the future. The rationale of this distinction is that pre-trial pecuniary loss is capable of fairly accurate mathematical calculation. This was emphasized by Fullagar J. in Paff v. Speed (1961), 105 C.L.R. 549 (Aus. H.C.) where he explained the categorization more fully as follows: Special damages are awarded in such cases in respect of monetary loss actually suffered and expenditure actually incurred. Their two characteristics are (1) that they are assessed only up to the date of verdict, and (2) that they are capable of precise arithmetical calculation or at least of being estimated with close approximation to accuracy. The familiar examples are medical and surgical fees paid or payable, ambulance and hospital expenses and loss of income. Where the plaintiff has been employed at fixed wage or salary, his loss of income can commonly be calculated with exactness. Where the plaintiff has not been employed, but is, for example, professional man, his monetary loss can be estimated without difficulty by reference to his past earnings. In high proportion of cases the amount of the “special damages” is agreed between counsel for the plaintiff and counsel for the defendant. “General damages” on the other hand, are of their very nature, incapable of mathematical calculation, and (although the expression is apt to be misleading) commonly very much “at large”. They are at large in the sense that jury has, in serious cases, wide discretion in assessing them. Also general damages may be assessed not with reference to any limited period, but with reference to an indefinite future. ... (emphasis added) [71] Although the Court in Andrews did not define the terms ‘pecuniary’ and ‘non-pecuniary’, think these terms are used in their ordinary sense. pecuniary loss is one that is “... of, concerning or consisting of money” (see Katherine Barber, The Canadian Oxford Dictionary (1998) at p. 1071). non-pecuniary loss is one that is not, such as pain and suffering and loss of enjoyment of life. [72] Thus, while lost earning capacity is pecuniary loss because it is loss ‘of, concerning or consisting of money’, it is the loss of future prospect or potential. Damages to compensate this loss are general damages because they are not “... capable of precise arithmetical calculation or at least of being estimated with close approximation to accuracy”. (See Cooper-Stevenson and Saunders, above at p. 44). [73] The facts that, in the case of living plaintiff, the loss of earning capacity is viewed as the loss of “capital asset” and that account must be taken of the “lost years” in assessing its value, play an important part in the appellants’ argument in this appeal. Reduced to the basics, the submission is that once claims by living plaintiffs for future loss of earnings are treated as capital asset with present value calculated by including the lost years, it follows that the same approach should be taken in assessing the estate’s damages in survival of actions case. It is therefore necessary to examine how the “lost years” issue has been treated by the Courts in survival of actions claims. (d) The lost years and survival claims: [74] It would appear from highly respected texts and academic commentary that there was no real controversy, even before Oliver v. Ashman, concerning the rule about the lost years in survival actions. The rule was that there could be no claim for loss of future earnings beyond the time of death: see, e.g., J.A. Jolowicz, “Damages Prospective Loss of Earnings Reduced Expectation of Life”, [1960] Camb. L.J. 160 at 162 163; A.I. Ogus, The Law of Damages (1973) at 116; Clerk Lindsell (10th, 1947) at 290; Clerk Lindsell (12th, 1961) at para. 386; Clerk Lindsell (13th, 1969) at para 419; Clerk Lindsell (14th, 1975) at para. 419. [75] It is convenient at this point to look in more detail at the decision of the House of Lords in Benham v. Gambling, supra, which addressed the nature of the estate’s recovery under the English survival of actions statute for the deceased’s loss of expectation of life. [76] That case concerned an action by the personal representative of two and one-half year old child who had been severely injured in motor vehicle accident and died the same day. The only issue at trial was the amount of damages which should be awarded and in that regard, it was recognized that the only substantial claim which could be asserted was for the child’s lost expectation of life. The trial judge awarded £1200 and that sum was upheld on appeal to the Court of Appeal. The further appeal to the House of Lords raised only the issue of the assessment of damages for loss of expectation of life. [77] Viscount Simon delivered the only extended speech in the House of Lords. He held that the damages for loss of expectation of life should be reduced to £200 and that “... in assessing damages under this head, whether in the case of child or an adult, very moderate figures should be chosen.”: at 168. He noted (at 167) that “[of] course, no regard must be had to financial losses or gains during the period of which the victim has been deprived. The damages are in respect of loss of life, not of loss of future pecuniary prospects.” [78] So long as Oliver v. Ashman and Benham v. Gambling remained good law, there was no reason to think that future loss of earnings beyond the time of death were recoverable in survival of actions case. [79] However, Benham v. Gambling and Oliver did plant the seed of an important change in English law. Both cases took the view that the rule about recovery for the lost years must be the same in both personal injury actions by living plaintiffs and in survival of actions claims. It followed that when the House of Lords, in Pickett overruled Oliver and held that prospective loss of earnings were recoverable for the “lost years” in actions by living plaintiffs, the extension of that approach to survival of actions cases was inevitable. [80] The inevitable happened when the House decided Gammell v. Wilson, [1981] All E.R. 578. The case involved the claims by the parents of two young men who had been killed in accidents caused by the negligence of the defendants. Claims were asserted under both the fatal injuries and the survival of actions legislation. In both cases, awards were made under the survival of actions legislation for loss of prospective earnings during the lost years. These awards were upheld by the House of Lords. [81] The appellant’s submission in this case is that we ought to interpret the survival of actions legislation in Nova Scotia to reach the same result in this case as was reached by the House of Lords in Gammell. It is useful, therefore, to note the extreme reluctance with which the House of Lords reached that conclusion. [82] Lord Diplock commented that, in his opinion, the result in Gammell was neither sensible nor just: at 581. Lord Fraser of Tullybelton had this to say at p. 588: It is, no doubt, just and sensible that, where the death of the family breadwinner is caused by the negligence of some other person, that person should be liable to compensate the deceased’s dependants for the injury which they have suffered from the death. The main element of injury will normally be loss of support. Such compensation is provided for by the Fatal Accidents Act 1976. But it seems to me difficult to justify law whereby the deceased’s estate, which may pass to persons or institutions in no way dependent on him for support, can recover damages for loss of earnings, or other income, which he would probably have received during the ‘lost years’. It is particularly difficult to justify the law in cases such as the present, in each of which the deceased was young man with no established earning capacity or settled pattern of life. In such cases it is hardly possible to make reasonable estimate of his probable earnings during the ‘lost years’ and it is, think, quite impossible to take the further step of making reasonable estimate of the free balance that would have been available above the cost of maintaining himself throughout the ‘lost years’, and the amount of that free balance is the relevant figure for calculating damages. The process of assessing damages in such cases is so extremely uncertain that it can hardly be dignified with the name of calculation: it is little more than speculation. Yet that is the process which the courts are obliged to carry out at present. (emphasis added) [83] Lord Russell of Killowen (the sole dissenter in Pickett) summed up his reluctance to apply Pickett to survival of actions cases as follows at p. 590: My Lords, regret these decisions. think that the law has gone astray by excessive refinement of theory. would welcome legislation which overruled in the future the results of the decision in Pickett, and its extension in cases such as the present, which since Pickett has led to almost grotesque embodiment of estimates, or rather guesses. That might be combined with legislation which in some way prevented respondents being barred from Fatal Accidents Act claim by the fact that the deceased pursued his claim to judgment. (emphasis added) [84] Finally, would quote the following remark of Lord Scarman at p. 595: My Lords, there is some disquiet expressed by judges, and understandably felt by insurers, about two aspects of the law: the ‘double recovery’ now possible in some cases, and the very great discrepancy which can arise, as happened in the Furness case, between the damages recoverable by the estate for the lost years and the damages recoverable by the dependants under the Fatal Accidents Act. Each of these possibilities may well be mischief; certainly, law which allows the discrepancy to arise wears the appearance of anomaly, and is unlikely to be understood or acceptable. [85] Parliament reversed the effects of Gammell the next year by the Administration of Justice Act, 1982. Section 4(2)(a) specifically excepted from actions under the 1934 survival of actions legislation claims for exemplary damages and “... any damages for loss of income in respect of any period after that person’s death.” (emphasis added) In other words, there could be no claim for prospective loss of income under the survival of actions legislation with respect to the period following the death of the deceased. [86] Canadian law, with very few exceptions, has not taken the course followed by the House of Lords in Gammell. It must be remembered as well that the wording of many of the Canadian survival of actions statutes is significantly different than the English statute considered in Gammell. [87] have already referred to Dean Wright’s article in 1938, Dean Bowker’s article and the Uniformity Commissioners Report and draft act in the early 1960's. These all express the view that the various survival of actions statutes in Canada were not intended to give the estate claim for the deceased’s loss of future earnings. Writing in 1981, Cooper-Stevenson and Saunders stated that it was settled, as matter of practice, in all Canadian jurisdictions that the estate could not recover for the deceased’s loss of future earnings in survival of action claim: at 390. They could find no case in Canada in which damages had been awarded in survival action for future earnings. [88] While the learned authors questioned whether this result was fully justified on the wording of some of the provincial statutes, their observation about the settled practice is an important part of the context in which Nova Scotia’s survival statute was enacted. In 1954 (the year the Nova Scotia Act was passed) it was settled practice in other Canadian jurisdictions which had survival legislation that loss of income during the “lost years” was not compensable under the survival of actions legislation. This is not only the view of Cooper-Stevenson and Saunders but of the Uniformity Commissioners in the early 1960's (see above) and of the Alberta Institute of Law Research and Reform in 1977: see Alberta Law Reform Institute, “Should Claim for the Loss of Chance of Future Earnings Survive Death” (Report no. 76, 1998) at 11. This view is strongly supported by the complete absence of case authority to the contrary. In 1954, the same position on the point was held in England. have earlier reviewed the leading texts and scholarly writing supporting that view. (iii) Conclusions concerning context: [89] It may be helpful to summarize the most important conclusions to be drawn from this review of the context in which the Nova Scotia survival of actions legislation was enacted. [90] First, the English survival of actions statute of 1934 did not explicitly exclude damages for pain and suffering or for loss of expectation of life. The English courts held that these were recoverable heads of loss in survival action by the personal representatives of deceased person. By contrast, the Nova Scotia statute explicitly prevented these results by expressly excluding recovery under these heads. [91] Second, English law was somewhat uncertain until Oliver v. Ashman as to whether living plaintiff could recover damages for loss of earnings during the so-called “lost years”. However, it was generally accepted until 1978 that there could be no claim for loss of expected future earnings for the time after death in an action by personal representatives under the survival legislation. The same may be said of the Canadian position. [92] Third, it was settled in England by the early 1940's that damages for loss of expectation of life in survival action (which was permitted in England but not under the Nova Scotia Act) did not include any amount on account of the loss of earnings which could have been anticipated had death not occurred. [93] Fourth, the rights under the Survival of Actions Act were said to be in addition to and not in derogation of any rights under the Fatal Injuries Act. This makes it unlikely that the Legislature foresaw any significant overlap between the remedies available under the two acts. Of course, the calculation of both the dependancy amount, which may be recovered by dependants under the Fatal Injuries Act, and the deceased’s loss of prospective earnings are based on the income the deceased would have earned had he or she lived. It follows that if both claims may be asserted, there is the potential of the defendant being required to pay damages twice over for essentially the same loss. [94] These problems of overlap and potential double recovery might not be insuperable in practice. It is hard to think, however, that the Legislature would have enacted provision which created such overlap and potential for double recovery without addressing, in any manner, the way in which these problems should be resolved. more plausible inference is that the Legislature did not foresee that the loss of prospective earnings might be recovered in survival action and, therefore, did not think that any serious problems of overlap or double recovery were likely to arise. [95] The cases deciding that the “lost years” should be counted in calculating damages for lost earning capacity for living plaintiff treat the loss as one capable of being valued in money or, in Canada, as something in the nature of capital asset whose value has been diminished or extinguished. However, the cases also recognize that this loss is the loss of an ‘opportunity’, ‘prospect’ or an ‘expectation’ (see Pickett at 781), that it relates to the loss of ‘prospects and potential’ and requires gazing “... deeply into the crystal ball ...” (see Andrews at 251). The damages to compensate this loss are categorized as general damages because they cannot be calculated with anything approaching mathematical precision. [96] Survival of actions legislation was enacted to undo the effects of general common law rule holding that personal actions in tort did not survive for or against deceased person. It had the general purpose of putting the deceased’s estate, with very minor exceptions, in the same position as regards causes of action by or against the deceased as the deceased would have been if he or she had not died. However, it did not attempt to place the estate in the same position as regards the available remedies; as noted, certain kinds of losses are not compensable in an estate action and only actual pecuniary losses are recoverable. Moreover, the survival of actions legislation was not aimed specifically at the rights and interests of surviving family members in wrongful death cases. That subject had been addressed earlier by fatal injuries legislation. [97] The primary purpose of the Fatal Injuries Act was to put group of dependants, defined by that statute, in the same economic position (subject to the separate issue of collateral benefits) as they would have been in had the deceased lived and continued to provide support. [98] There is, of course, fundamental difference between claim for damages for loss of prospective earnings in survival of actions claim on one hand, and claims by living plaintiff or by dependants under the wrongful death statutes on the other. In the latter types of claims, the object of the award is to put the plaintiff (or his dependants if the plaintiff has been killed) in the position they would have been in, financially, had the accident not occurred i.e. had the plaintiff not been injured or killed and, therefore, continued to earn and support the dependants. This is not applicable reasoning in the case of claim by the estate for the deceased’s loss of prospective earnings. Such earnings would only have been received by the deceased had he or she not been killed, but the estate only takes the deceased’s assets upon death. The estate’s claim, therefore, is to an “asset” of the deceased which the estate could not get except upon the death of the deceased. It bears repeating that the claim asserted here is not for the amount by which the estate would have appreciated had the deceased not died prematurely and continued to earn. Rather, it is for something in the nature of capital asset which the estate could never acquire without the wrongful death. The Alberta Law Reform Institute notes in its report “Should Claim for the Loss of Chance of Future Earnings Survive Death” at p. 28: ... earning capacity is not something that the deceased person could dispose of while living or by will ... the destruction of the .. deceased person’s ability to earn will not reduce that deceased person’s heritable property and will not reduce the estate. [99] It is clear that the Nova Scotia Legislature intended to avoid some of the results which had flowed from judicial interpretation of the English survival statute. As noted earlier, the Nova Scotia Act specifically eliminated the claim for loss of expectation of life. Of course, as the context in which the Act was passed clearly demonstrates, no reasonably well informed lawyer in Nova Scotia in 1954 would have thought that claim for future earnings survived the deceased’s death. [100] The appellants referred us to the explanatory note to the Nova Scotia survival of actions Bill which accompanied its introduction in April of 1954. The note states that the Bill’s purpose was “... to provide for the survival of [personal] actions by or against the estate of deceased person.” This is hardly controversial. However, the note is somewhat misleading when it goes on to state that the Bill adopted, in substance, the English Act of 1934. As mentioned, the Nova Scotia legislation, unlike the English, excluded damages on account of loss of expectation of life and specifically limited survivor claims to actual pecuniary loss to the estate. The explanatory note is, therefore, of no help on the issue we face in this appeal. 4. Consequences of the Proposed Interpretation: [101] The appellants ask us to reach the same result as the House of Lords in Gammell. have already reviewed the extreme reluctance to reach that result which was expressed by the Law Lords in that case. Their remarks induce in me no enthusiasm to follow their example. They viewed the consequences of their decision as being neither sensible nor just. [102] Professor Waddams in his text The Law of Damages (Looseleaf edition, updated December 2001) describes the decision in Gammell (and, therefore, the results of following it) as having several far-reaching consequences: at para. 6.830. He describes them as follows: ... First, where the same persons are the beneficiaries of the estate and entitled to claim under Lord Campbell’s Act (as is usual)[i.e., the fatal injuries legislation], recovery under the Act was effectively superseded, for the estate’s recovery of the lost earning capacity will always equal or exceed the value of the lost dependency. second consequence is that tortfeasor who causes the death of an unmarried wage-earner has to pay much larger damages than formerly thought to be exigible, for the value of the lost earning capacity will be recoverable by the estate. Thirdly, if it should happen that the estate beneficiaries and the Lord Campbell’s Act claimants are different persons, there is real prospect of the defendant being made to pay twice over for the loss of the deceased’s earning capacity. (emphasis added) [103] The first and third of these consequences view as serious from the point of view of attempting to give effect to legislative purpose. These two consequences mean that the damages available under the Survival of Actions Act, depending on the facts, either supercede or duplicate those available under the Fatal Injuries Act, results which are not consistent with the legislative purpose of either Act. [104] What is really at stake here, as Professors Cooper-Stevenson and Saunders perceptively point out, is the question of which survivors of the deceased deserve protection, and to what extent, through an award to the estate: Personal Injuries Damages in Canada (1981) at 389. In my view, the Legislature spoke very specifically to this issue when it enacted the Fatal Injuries Act. Further, it has amended the provisions of that Act from time to time over the years to expand both the remedies and the group of persons who may make claims. It is hard to think that the Legislature’s purpose in enacting the Survival of Actions Act was to render the fatal injuries scheme either irrelevant or duplicative of other remedies depending on the facts of the particular case. Yet this would be the consequence of the appellants’ interpretation. The Fatal Injuries Act may well not achieve what many will think to be just result in all cases, but it does represent clear and considered legislative judgment about which survivors of person wrongfully killed should be compensated and on what terms. 5. Rules of Interpretation: [105] Only one special rule of interpretation is implicated in this case. It is embodied in section 9(5) of the Interpretation Act and requires that every enactment be considered remedial and interpreted to insure the attainment of its objects. This rule, however, is not directed to giving the statute the most favourable interpretation possible to permit recovery, but to giving an interpretation that will ensure the attainment of the statute’s objects. In my view, this rule is fully complied with through the detailed contextual analysis which am undertaking in this case. 6. Conclusions concerning context, purpose and consequences: [106] In my opinion, neither the context in which the Survival of Actions Act was enacted nor its purpose provides support for the interpretation advanced by the appellants. Where death ensues from an injury wrongfully inflicted (as is alleged in this case), the appellants’ interpretation would effectively give potentially duplicative remedies to two groups of people for the wrongful death. The estate would recover for the beneficiaries under the survival legislation and the dependants would recover under the fatal injuries legislation. However, the Legislature specifically addressed the question of how losses of survivors should be compensated in wrongful death cases when it enacted the Fatal Injuries Act. It was not the purpose of the survival legislation either to duplicate or supercede that recovery. [107] turn next to consider whether the appellants’ interpretation is plausible, efficacious and acceptable. 7. The Appropriate Interpretation (i) Is the appellants’ interpretation plausible? [108] The question here is whether the appellants’ interpretation is plausible in the sense that it complies with the text of the Act. In my view, it is not. [109] The issue is whether claim for deceased person’s loss of prospective income relates to “an actual pecuniary loss to the estate.” [110] should say at the outset that in looking for “plausible” interpretation, one is looking for the most plausible interpretation in light of the words used by the legislation judged in their full context. The phrase “actual pecuniary loss to the estate’ is, as matter of dictionary definition, reasonably capable of bearing the meaning the appellants advance. However, do not think that their position that the deceased’s lost earning capacity is an ‘actual pecuniary loss to the estate’ is the most plausible of the possible meanings which the words may reasonably bear. [111] There is no dispute here that the lost earning capacity is pecuniary loss; it is loss ‘of, concerning or consisting of’ money. The focus of debate, therefore, is whether this pecuniary loss is ‘actual’ and ‘to the estate’. [112] The appellants submit that the word “actual” may be used in the sense of “real” and that loss may be real even though it is prospective: see Duncan v. Baddeley (1997), 1997 CanLII 11516 (AB CA), 145 D.L.R. (4th) 708 (Alta. C.A.). Kerans, J.A. opined in that case that the exclusion of losses other than those which are ‘an actual financial loss’ is meant “... to rid the surviving action of any claim that is notional or fictive (e.g. punitive and exemplary damages) or that is for non-pecuniary loss.” (at 712). However, in applying this reasoning to Nova Scotia’s legislation, two difficulties arise. [113] First, that interpretation makes the phrase “actual pecuniary loss to the estate” superfluous. Punitive damages and damages for pain and suffering and loss of enjoyment of life are expressly excluded by specific language in the Nova Scotia legislation: see ss. 4(a), (b), (c). It follows that if the phrase ‘actual pecuniary loss to the estate’ is meant only to exclude exemplary and non-pecuniary damages, it adds nothing to the specific exclusions of these matters. [114] Second, this interpretation, in the context of the Nova Scotia Act, makes the word “actual” redundant. If all that was intended was to exclude non-pecuniary losses, why add the word ‘actual’ to modify the word ‘pecuniary’? pecuniary loss is, by definition, not non-pecuniary loss, so limitation of recovery to pecuniary loss would have excluded recovery for non-pecuniary losses. [115] With all due respect, it seems to me to be poor definition of phrase that renders it redundant and an even poorer definition of word that renders it meaningless. Yet these are the consequences if the reasoning of Duncan v. Baddeley is applied to the wording of the Nova Scotia survival statute. [116] think more plausible interpretation results from paying attention to the legal parlance surrounding claims for lost earning capacity. Such claims, while relating to “real” losses, have always been treated as an element of the general damages award because they are not capable of precise calculation. Such claims have been recognized as relating to the loss of potential or of prospective earnings. The use of the word ‘actual’ to describe such losses while perhaps not completely implausible strikes me as, at best, curious choice of words. [117] Moreover, think the word actual must be considered as part of the phrase “actual loss ... to the estate.” Under the Nova Scotia Act (unlike the Alberta statute considered in Duncan) the claim must relate to an actual loss to the estate. As MacDonald, A.C.J.S.C. noted in his reasons in the present case, the Alberta legislation is differently worded than the Nova Scotian legislation. In Alberta, the legislation specifies that “... only those damages that resulted in actual financial loss to the deceased or his estate are recoverable ...”: Survival of Actions Act, R.S.A. 1980, c. 30 s. 5. [118] In Duncan, Kerans, J.A. (Coté, J.A. concurring) held that the deceased’s loss of earning capacity is an actual loss to the deceased but not an actual loss to the estate: at page 716. The context in which they reached this conclusion was consideration of s. of the Alberta statute. That section states that, in assessing damages, gains or loss to the estate as result of the death are to be excluded. Kerans, J.A. (with Coté, J.A. concurring) reasoned that this clause would extinguish the loss of earnings claim if it were pecuniary loss to the estate. However, they concluded that the loss was in fact loss to the deceased, not to the estate. [119] In light of the way claims for lost earning capacity have been characterized in personal injury cases, think more plausible interpretation is to say that the phrase “actual pecuniary loss to the estate”, in the context of damages for personal injury and death, refers to more precisely quantifiable claims and excludes general damages. This approach commended itself to majority of the Alberta Court of Appeal in James v. Rentz (1986), 1986 ABCA 95 (CanLII), 27 D.L.R. (4th) 724. In that case, Sevenson, J.A. (as he then was) expressed the view that the limitation of recovery to “actual financial loss to the deceased or his estate” in the Alberta survival legislation was intended to distinguish “... between quantified economic loss in the nature of special damages and general damages. The term “actual” serve[d] to exclude possible or contingent claims.” (at p. 726) (emphasis added) [120] In considering the plausibility of the appellants’ interpretation, it is worth repeating the reasoning which they advance to support the claim that the deceased’s loss of prospective earnings is an ‘actual ... loss to the estate’. It is this. The lost earning capacity is capital asset which is destroyed in the instant before the deceased’s death. The deceased, therefore, dies having suffered this loss. The right to claim this lost capital asset therefore passes to the estate and its loss is, therefore, loss to the estate. This almost metaphysical line of reasoning may be good logic. But to describe this prospective asset, which is notionally lost in the instant before death, as an “actual” loss seems to me to push the language beyond its plausible meaning. [121] conclude, therefore, that the appellants’ interpretation of the phrase “actual pecuniary loss to the estate” so that it refers to the deceased’s loss of future earnings is not plausible in the sense that it is not the most plausible interpretation in light of the full context in which words are employed. (ii) Is the appellants’ interpretation efficacious? [122] The question here is what interpretation of the legislation would best give effect to the Legislature’s purpose. In my view, holding that the estate’s claim for the deceased’s loss of prospective earnings is not ‘an actual pecuniary loss to the estate’ would best serve the legislative purpose of both the survival legislation and the wrongful death statute. [123] will briefly reiterate the purposes of the legislation which have discussed earlier. The primary purpose of the survival of actions legislation is to provide for the general survival of causes of action that arise during the deceased’s life both for and against the deceased’s estate, but not to preserve claims to all heads of damage. There are, as noted earlier, several restrictions on the types of losses which may be compensated in survival action. The primary purpose of the fatal injury legislation is to provide compensation to dependants for the loss of prospective support which they could reasonably expect to have received from the deceased had death not occurred as the result of wrongful act. While the scheme created by these two pieces of legislation may be far from perfect and does, on occasion, give rise to questions of overlap and duplication, and perhaps leave some gaps, it is generally coherent scheme in the vast majority of cases. [124] The award of damages for loss of prospective earnings to the estate in survival action would substantially undermine this coherence and, as noted earlier, give rise to new and very significant issues of overlap and duplication. [125] The comments by the Law Lords in Gammell are instructive. The House of Lords felt that adopting the interpretation urged on us in this appeal led to result that was neither “sensible nor just”, which had no “social, moral or logical justification”, which showed that the law had “gone astray by excessive refinement of theory.” While, of course, we must respect the text of the legislation, we should be slow to conclude the Legislature’s purpose was to achieve such results. (iii) Is appellants’ interpretation acceptable? [126] The question here is which interpretation produces result which is reasonable and just. The appellants have one main point on this issue which may be expressed in two ways. [127] First, the appellants submit that the same rule of recovery for the lost years should apply in survival actions as in personal injury actions. This argument is straightforward and has superficial logical appeal. The law is clear in personal injury cases that the loss of prospective earnings is recoverable head of loss. It is also now clear in both England and in Canada that damages for the prospective loss of earnings in personal injury cases are awarded for the period of the pre-accident life expectancy; i.e., an award is made which includes compensation for the “lost years”. The appellants submit that this claim survives for the benefit of the estate. All causes of action survive under that legislation unless specifically excluded and the loss of earning capacity is, therefore, compensated provided it is an actual pecuniary loss to the estate. The appellants say that there is no exclusion of this claim and that the loss of the deceased’s earning capacity is an “actual pecuniary loss to the estate”. [128] One of the underpinnings of this argument is the view that similar rules of damages must apply to both fatal injury and survival of actions cases. This position was expressed in Oliver v. Ashman where Holroyd Pearce, L.J. said that there is “... no room for distinguishing between claim brought by living plaintiff and claim brought on behalf of dead plaintiff in respect of the loss of earnings during the years of which he has been deprived.” Whatever the merits of that proposition may have been on the state of authorities which confronted the Court in Oliver, it is not, with respect, sound approach to the interpretation of Nova Scotia’s Survival of Actions Act. [129] respectfully adopt the view expressed by Professors Cooper-Stevenson and Saunders in the first edition of their text, Personal Injury Damages in Canada (1981) with respect to this line of argument: ... Inasmuch as living plaintiff receives damages according to his pre-accident life expectancy, so should his estate. But policy-wise this analysis is much too simplistic. It obscures the fundamental question which is not theoretical symmetry but how to unravel the competing interests of survivors with stake in the deceased’s life. In other words, given that damages can be of no practical value to the deceased, which if any of his survivors deserve protection from the wrongdoer through an award to the estate? (emphasis added) [130] For reasons of history and policy, claims by living persons have been treated differently, both under the common law and by statute, from claims on behalf of deceased persons. Historically, at common law, living person could sue in tort, but his or her personal representatives could not assert that cause of action after the person’s death. While, as practical matter, the estate of deceased person would ultimately benefit from damages award made to that person during his or her lifetime, the estate had no claim if the deceased died before recovering judgment on the cause of action. While those dependant on person during life would seem to have strong claim for recovery against wrongdoer who kills that person and thereby takes away the support which he or she provided, no such claim was recognized by the common law. So, as matter of the legal history of this package of rules, there is no reason to think that claims brought by living persons and those asserted by their personal representatives after death should be treated identically. [131] The progress of statutory reforms is also consistent with this view. It is worth remembering that the common law rule against recovery by dependents for wrongful death was the first of these rules to be reformed. Fatal injuries legislation created new, but limited statutory cause of action for wrongful death in favour of those dependant on the deceased. Their claim, expressed simply, was for the support they could have expected to receive out of the earnings the deceased could have expected to make had he or she lived. To the extent that the estate would benefit those who were not dependants under the fatal injuries legislation, the estate had no claim for the wrongful death. [132] As pointed out in Keizer v. Hanna, 1978 CanLII 28 (SCC), [1978] S.C.R. 342, the method of calculating the amount of damage award under the fatal injuries legislation is similar to that used in calculating the amount of an award for loss of future earnings in cases of serious personal injury: at 352. However, the majority of the Court held in Keizer that the question of whether the award should be reduced to reflect the obligation to pay income tax should be answered differently in fatal injury cases than it would be in personal injury actions by living plaintiffs. In personal injury cases, the loss of prospective earnings is considered something in the nature of capital asset and therefore should not be reduced on account of taxation. However, fatal injury award represents the loss of stream of income to the dependant that could only be paid out of the deceased’s after tax income. Dickson, J. explained this distinction in Andrews v. Grand Toy, 1978 CanLII (SCC), [1978] S.C.R. 229 at 259: (ii) Allowance for tax: In The Queen v. Jennings, supra, this Court held that an award for prospective income should be calculated with no deduction for tax which might have been attracted had it been earned over the working life of the plaintiff. This results from the fact that it is earning capacity and not lost earnings which is the subject of compensation. For the same reason, no consideration should be taken of the amount by which the income from the award will be reduced by payment of taxes on the interest, dividends, or capital gain. capital sum is appropriate to replace the lost capital asset of earning capacity. Tax on income is irrelevant either to decrease the sum for taxes the victim would have paid on income from his job, or to increase it for taxes he will now have to pay on income from the award. In contrast with the situation in personal injury cases, awards under the Fatal Accident Acts should reflect tax considerations, since they are to compensate dependants for the loss of support payments made by the deceased. These support payments could only come out of take-home pay, and the payments from the award will only be received net of taxes: see the contemporaneous decision of this Court in Keizer v. Hanna and Much. [133] The symmetry which the appellants assert ought to exist did not exist in the old common law rules, was not adopted by the reforming statutes and does not obtain as regards the allowance for taxation in the two types of damage calculations. [134] Judges and scholars have recognized that different rules may be appropriate for claims by living plaintiffs and those by the estate of deceased persons. In Oliver itself, Holroyd Pearce L.J. commented that although the law compelled him to do otherwise, there were good reasons for compensating for the lost years in claim by living plaintiff and not doing so in survival of actions case: at 228. Comments by the great torts scholar Professor Jolowicz are to the same effect: see Note, [1960] Cambridge Law Journal 160 at 225. [135] The second aspect of the appellants’ point is that it is only just that the estate recover what would have been received by the deceased had he lived to pursue his claim. However, the question of what is acceptable and just in this case is essentially one of policy which has many aspects and with respect to which reasonable people may reasonably differ. comparison of the majority and minority judgments in Duncan v. Baddeley and consideration of the Alberta Law Reform Institute’s Report in response to that case provide good introduction to the range of questions that must be answered in trying to determine what is just in this context. [136] On one hand, it is suggested that rule barring recovery of the deceased’s future loss of income in survival action allows wrongdoer to escape “scot free” and makes it cheaper for the wrongdoer to kill than to injure. On the other, it is asserted that awards should be compensatory, not punitive, and that claim for the deceased’s loss of prospective earnings is for something which is unacceptably speculative. Whatever one thinks of these and the many other arguments which are made on this subject, we must remember that this case is not about what the best rule for compensation in wrongful death cases might be. It is about determining what rule the Legislature has adopted. [137] In my view, the legislative judgment about the issue we face in this case is clear. The context of the legislation, its purpose and its text all support the conclusion, in my view, that the deceased’s loss of prospective earnings is not an “actual pecuniary loss to the estate” and is therefore not recoverable in a Survival of Actions Act claim. [138] In light of that conclusion, do not need to address the respondent’s submission that such an award is precluded by the Act’s exclusion of damages for loss of expectation of life. IV. Disposition: [139] For these reasons, I would dismiss the appeal. At the hearing, the parties indicated that they had agreed on costs and that we need make no order in that regard. Cromwell, J.A.

Waterbury Newton, 2011 NSCA 34 Date: Decision Date 20110415 Docket: CA 338183 Registry: Halifax Between: Walter O. Newton v. Waterbury Newton Respondent Judges: MacDonald, C.J.N.S., Fichaud and Bryson, JJ.A. Appeal Heard: March 21, 2011, in Halifax, Nova Scotia Held: Leave for appeal is granted and appeal is dismissed with costs to the respondent, per reasons for judgment of Bryson, J.A., MacDonald, C.J.N.S. and Fichaud, J.A. concurring. Counsel: Jonathan Cuming, for the appellant Christopher W. Madill, for the respondent Reasons for judgment: [1] Walter Newton seeks leave to appeal and, if granted, appeals the decision of the Honourable Justice Arthur J. LeBlanc of September 30, 2010 in which Mr. Newton was refused stay of proceedings (2010 NSSC 359 (CanLII)). At the conclusion of the hearing, the parties were advised that leave to appeal would be granted but that the appeal would be dismissed, with reasons to follow. These are the reasons. [2] On December 23, 1998, Mr. Newton and Waterbury Newton entered into partnership agreement. Clause 25 of the agreement provided that all disputes between partners relating to the business of the partnership would be arbitrated under the Arbitration Act, R.S.N.S. 1989, c. 19. Section of the Act says: If any party to submission, or any person claiming through or under him, commences any legal proceedings in any court against any other party to the submission, or any person claiming through or under him, in respect to any matter agreed to be referred, any party to such legal proceedings may, at any time after appearance, and before delivering any pleadings, or taking any other steps in the proceedings, apply to that court to stay the proceedings, and that court, or judge thereof, if satisfied that there is no sufficient reason why the matter should not be referred in accordance with the submission, and that the applicant was, at the time when the proceedings were commenced, and still remains, ready and willing to do all things necessary to the proper conduct of the arbitration, may make an order staying the proceedings. [3] On May 31, 2004 Mr. Newton withdrew from the partnership. [4] In September of 2006 Waterbury Newton commenced these proceedings against former client to recover fees and disbursements charged to their client by Mr. Newton while he was still partner. Waterbury Newton amended the statement of claim on March 10, 2008 adding Mr. Newton as defendant. [5] On April 7, 2008 Mr. Newton filed defence. After admitting certain uncontroversial facts, Mr. Newton denied the balance of the allegations in the statement of claim and specifically pleaded clause 25 of the partnership agreement. In seeking dismissal of the claim, Mr. Newton argued that the Supreme Court had no jurisdiction to determine the issues between the parties. [6] Following the filing of his defence, Mr. Newton agreed to attend discoveries and to provide list of documents. However, when he attended discoveries, he refused to answer any questions going to the merits of the claim, citing the arbitration clause in the partnership agreement. He did produce some documents. He agreed to produce others but did not. [7] In March 2010 Waterbury Newton brought motion to compel Mr. Newton to attend discovery and file an affidavit of documents. Shortly before that motion was to be heard, Mr. Newton filed motion seeking dismissal of this action for want of jurisdiction pursuant to Rule 4.07: 4.07 (1) defendant who maintains that the court does not have jurisdiction over the subject of an action, or over the defendant, may make motion to dismiss the action for want of jurisdiction. (2) defendant does not submit to the jurisdiction of the court only by moving to dismiss the action for want of jurisdiction. (3) judge who dismisses motion for an order dismissing an action for want of jurisdiction must set deadline by which the defendant may file notice of defence, and the court may only grant judgment against the defendant after that time. [8] The Chambers judge defined the issue as whether Mr. Newton had attorned to the Court’s jurisdiction. He found that he had. Moreover, he found that Mr. Newton had taken fresh steps to advance the proceeding by producing list of documents and providing additional documents and agreeing to discovery dates. Mr. Newton’s defence was not filed simply to avoid default judgment. He did not confine his defence to plea of want of jurisdiction, but denied the substance of the claim as well. [9] Justice LeBlanc also concluded that Rule 4.07(3) assumes that motion to dismiss must occur before the filing of defence because it directs the judge to set time for filing the defence if the motion fails. [10] An appeal from an interlocutory and discretionary decision is only available if the Chambers judge applied a wrong principle of law or made a clearly erroneous finding of fact, or a failure to intervene would give rise to a patent injustice: Smith v. Attorney General (N.S.), 2004 NSCA 106 (CanLII), at para. 18; A.B. v. Bragg Communications Inc., 2010 NSCA 70 (CanLII), at para. 33. [11] In his factum, Mr. Newton argued that: (a) Former Civil Procedure Rule 11.05 expressly forbade an application to set aside claim once defence had been filed. Since new Rule 4.07 is not so explicit, it should be interpreted more liberally; (b) Mr. Newton’s defence was not an attornment to the jurisdiction of the court within s. of the Arbitration Act or in light of applicable case law, (Navionics Inc. v. Flota Maritima Mexicana S.A., 1989 CarswellNat 141, 26 F.T.R. 148). He argues that he did not intend to forsake arbitration (again, relying on Navionics). Mr. Newton cites Schulz v. Schulz, 2007 NSSC 319 (CanLII) which found that attendance at settlement conference was not attornment to jurisdiction. [12] In my view, these arguments are not persuasive. Mr. Newton’s defence was not confined to plea of “no jurisdiction”. He denied the substance of the claim as well. Nor, unlike Navionics, is there any evidence that he was filing to avoid default judgment. Moreover, he provided documents and attended discovery (albeit he then asserted he had no obligation to answer questions). For more than two years, Mr. Newton did nothing to seek the stay that s. of the Arbitration Act permits. And then he only did so when faced by motion to produce documents and attend discoveries. In Navionics, the defendant was clearly trying to avoid default judgment and sought stay within few weeks of commencement of the action. Unlike Schulz, there is no evidence that Mr. Newton’s attendance at discovery or provision of documents had anything to do with settlement. [13] In his oral submissions, counsel for Mr. Newton argued that Justice LeBlanc erred by not using prejudice test which he claimed was applied by Justice Goodfellow in Canada (Attorney General) v. Marineserve.MG Inc., 2002 NSSC 147 (CanLII) (not case cited to Justice LeBlanc). [14] In Marineserve, the Court was interpreting s. of the Commercial Arbitration Act, R.S., 1985, c.17 (2nd Supp.) which provides in part: Arbitration Agreement and Substantive Claim before Court (1) court before which an action is brought in matter which is the subject of an arbitration agreement shall, if party so requests not later than when submitting his first statement on the substance of the dispute, refer the parties to arbitration unless it finds that the agreement is null and void, inoperative or incapable of being performed. ... [15] In Marineserve, the Attorney General of Canada commenced proceedings on behalf of Transport Canada against Marineserve and Maritime Harbours Society in connection with the operation of the port at Digby. The Attorney General sought broad remedies, including injunctive relief, an accounting, reimbursement for monies it hadn’t received, amongst others. Maritime Harbours filed defence pleading dispute resolution clause in the agreement between itself and Transport Canada which required adjudication of claims under the Commercial Arbitration Act of Canada. Maritime Harbours brought its application before Justice Goodfellow under former Civil Procedure Rules 14.25 and 37.10. Rule 14.25(d) allowed court at any stage of proceeding to grant stay for an abuse of process. New Rule 4.07 is not so accommodating. It assumes that an applicant for stay has not yet defended. [16] Mr. Newton submitted that the facts in Marineserve were virtually indistinguishable from this case. Likewise, he argued that the Nova Scotia Arbitration Act and the Commercial Arbitration Act of Canada had similar language. In reply, Waterbury Newton argued that Marineserve can be distinguished on the following bases: In Marineserve, the delay in bringing an application was only six months whereas, in this case, Mr. Newton’s delay was 26 months; In Marineserve, the court recognized that timeliness was an issue but was satisfied that Maritime Harbours raised the question of arbitration at an early stage; In Marineserve, Justice Goodfellow characterized the litigation as “not yet out of the starting gate”; Unlike the applicant in Marineserve, Mr. Newton furthered the litigation process by agreeing to, and attending discoveries and providing documents; Section of the Nova Scotia Arbitration Act is more specific than Section of the Canadian Commercial Arbitration Act. [17] would add that Justice Goodfellow did not explicitly determine whether the applicant in Marineserve had attorned to the jurisdiction of the court. [18] Counsel for Mr. Newton argued that Justice Goodfellow applied prejudice test because in para. 24 of his decision he cited Queensland Sugar Corp. v. Hanjin Jedda (The), [1995] B.C.J. No. 624 where the Court decided that stay should not issue as it would then be prejudicial for the matter to be referred to arbitration when the litigation process had been well underway. Justice Goodfellow did not explicitly adopt this reasoning but arguably it is implicit in his determination that the litigation in Marineserve had not “progressed out of the starting gate”. That was Justice Goodfellow’s factual finding in the context of exercising his discretion. In contrast, Justice LeBlanc here found that Mr. Newton had filed substantive defence and taken steps in the proceeding. The evidence supports these findings. Therefore, the remedy of stay under s. of the Arbitration Act was no longer available to Mr. Newton. [19] In light of the foregoing, it is not necessary to decide whether there is a meaningful distinction between proceeding under Rule 4.07 for dismissal for want of jurisdiction or Rule 88.02 for abuse of process, which was the equivalent 1972 Rule (14.25(d)) invoked in Marineserve. [20] Leave for appeal is granted but the appeal is dismissed with costs of $750, including disbursements, to the respondent, Waterbury Newton. Bryson, J.A. Concurred in: MacDonald, C.J.N.S.

680,"The reason the Minister whose staff had received maternity alert regarding CB from their Rosetown office did not proceed with the apprehension was that JA’s parents, TK and BA, agreed that one of them would always be present in the parents’ home to supervise their care of WBA.
[3] The concerns expressed in the maternity alert from Rosetown were: 1.
[5] On that date, family support worker Debbie Lapitski went to the farm to get CB to take her to an appointment in Yorkton.
After the baby was taken there, emergency child protection worker Brooke Edel went to TK’s place to complete documentation on the placement.
The issue is whether they are able to provide for this child’s needs and, if not, whether physical or emotional harm to the child is likely to occur to the baby in their care (s. 11(b) of the Act).
(b) Debbie Lapitski [11] Ms. Lapitski has been family support worker employed by SIGN for 23 years.
[12] The situation came to head on November 23, 2015.
Any suggestion as gather is suggested by the parents that she was conspiring with or acting to help TK to get custody of WBA is in my view not supported by the evidence.
(c) Christi Fallows [14] Christi Fallows was the child protection worker in charge of this file on the day WBA was apprehended.
She received cell phone call from Debbie Lapitski and CB, who were in van outside of the house the young parents were living in at BA’s farm.
CB said that JA flipped out and locked her in the porch, then pushed her up against the washer and later kicked her and Debbie out of the house.
In her words, the meeting did not go well as all three of the others were trying to talk over each other.
JA had barricaded the driveway to BA’s farm, and was threatening to kill anyone who entered the yard.
[24] TK clearly believed that these parents were not now prepared and/or able to care for this child as of the date of the hearing.
[29] CB started looking into parenting classes, and began seeing worker named Sandy at Mental Health once week.
[30] Sometime in the summer of 2015 and it was confusing to try to follow the dates of events in this case with any precision CB and JA moved to house in Canora.
She has little recollection of the labour and birth of WBA, during time which she lost considerable amount of blood.
She agreed with the Minister’s employees that either BA or TK would be present to supervise her and JA once they returned home with the baby.
[31] At some point gather after few weeks CB and JA moved to BA’s farm, where it was not as crowded as the house in Canora.
As said in court at the start of the hearing, ultimately must deal with what is in the best interests of WBA.
She acknowledged that both herself and JA have “issues” and she had hoped that he would come with her this day to the appointment.
[34] When Ms. Lapitski arrived, CB said there was yelling and screaming and swearing back and forth between JA and Ms. Lapitski.
[37] CB would also be open to another family support worker, other than Ms. Lapitski.
appreciate that although he did not testify he has seen Bernice Cartwright at SIGN and that she wrote an email (Exhibit D-1) describing him as mature for his age and saying he and CB have shown great improvement in understanding what productive relationship is based on, despite the initial meeting with her being very tense.
[41] Even considering the meeting with Ms. Cartwright and the parenting programming JA has apparently done, based on the certificates filed as Exhibit D-2, it is difficult for me to reach any other conclusion than that this young man has some significant anger management issues that are yet to be dealt with.
But it is to say that am not satisfied on the evidence presented that the care these young parents could as of today provide for this child would result in WBA not being in need of protection.
[46] As stated above, am not satisfied that the care these young parents could as of today provide for this child would result in WBA not being in need of protection.
That period is of shorter duration than the six months suggested by the Minister, but I have considered that: (1) given a variety of reasons, the parents have not had adequate access to their child so as to build a more positive relationship with him; and (2) there was no evidence that either parent abused or mistreated this child.","HELD: The court found that the child was in need of protection under s. 11(b) of The Child and Family Services Act, that his parents were unable to care for him, and that physical or emotional harm was likely to occur to him.
J.A.’s mother was found to be a person of sufficient interest under s. 23 of the Act.
The court ordered that the child should be placed in the custody of J.A.’s mother as a person of sufficient interest for a period of four months pursuant to s. 37(1)(b) of the Act.
The child’s parents should have adequate access to build their relationship with him and to allow them, with the assistance of others, to come up with a plan that would allow them to eventually care for their child.",584,"IN THE PROVINCIAL COURT OF SASKATCHEWAN Citation: 2016 SKPC 086 Date: June 16, 2016 Information: 106/15 Location: Canora IN THE MATTER OF HEARING UNDER THE CHILD AND FAMILY SERVICES ACT AND IN THE MATTER OF WBA, born October 6, 2015 Appearing: Donna Taylor For the Ministry of Social Services Deanna Harris For the parents The parents and child and relatives are identified by initials in order to protect their identities. DECISION AFTER HEARING R. GREEN, I. INTRODUCTION [1] WBA was born on October 6, 2015. His mother is CB, now 19 years of age, and his father is JA, now 16 years of age. [2] This infant was technically apprehended at birth by the Minister of Social Services, but the Minister did not proceed with the application, and CB was allowed to take the baby home with her. The reason the Minister whose staff had received maternity alert regarding CB from their Rosetown office did not proceed with the apprehension was that JA’s parents, TK and BA, agreed that one of them would always be present in the parents’ home to supervise their care of WBA. [3] The concerns expressed in the maternity alert from Rosetown were: 1. CB had diminished cognitive abilities, as she suffers from FASD, and as result she has challenges around understanding and retaining information, despite presenting as though this is not the case; 2. CB has history of being involved in physically abusive domestic relationship; 3. CB has other mental health concerns, including anxiety, depression and cluster personality traits; and 4. CB has addiction issues. [4] While the dates are not clear in the evidence, the young parents and their baby then lived in house in Canora for few weeks, with either grandmother TK or grandfather BA present with them. They then moved to grandfather BA’s farm, and essentially lived there with BA supervising them until November 23, 2015. [5] On that date, family support worker Debbie Lapitski went to the farm to get CB to take her to an appointment in Yorkton. When she arrived, JA was very angry and was yelling. He accused Ms. Lapitski of trying to help his mother (TK) get custody of WBA. JA remained angry and eventually locked both Ms. Lapitski and CB out of the house, where he remained alone with the baby. Ms. Lapitski called the Ministry of Social Services and the RCMP. While waiting outside, CB told Ms. Lapitski that JA and her had fight, JA shoved her into the washer and tried to strangle her, and she then kneed him between the legs. [6] Both the RCMP and child protection workers attended to the farm. WBA was apprehended. The place of safety for the baby was determined to be grandmother TK’s house. After the baby was taken there, emergency child protection worker Brooke Edel went to TK’s place to complete documentation on the placement. JA arrived at TK’s house, and was angry and swearing. TK told her son to leave or she would call the police. He, in turn, told Ms. Edel that if she wasn’t going to let him see the baby, there were two people who wouldn’t be going to work the next day, police officer and her. As result, Ms. Edel called the RCMP for an escort out of the house, and said in the seven to ten apprehensions she had been involved with, she had never asked for back up from the police to get out, nor had she been threatened like this. [7] This is sad case, as most proceedings under The Child and Family Services Act are. We have two very young parents who want to care for WBA. The issue is whether they are able to provide for this child’s needs and, if not, whether physical or emotional harm to the child is likely to occur to the baby in their care (s. 11(b) of the Act). [8] The plan put forward by the parents at this hearing was that return the baby to live with them at grandfather BA’s farm, situation which is in my view very similar to the circumstances existing on November 23, 2015. Further, am asked to do this based on CB’s evidence, an email about programming JA took at the Society for the Involvement of Good Neighbours (SIGN), and certificates showing completion of parenting classes by CB, JA and BA. Quite significantly, am asked to do so without hearing any evidence from JA or BA, two of the three people the baby was living with when apprehended. II. THE CASE FOR THE MINISTER [9] Because only CB testified, much of the Minister’s evidence is uncontradicted. There was no evidence that CB was abusing drugs or alcohol after WBA was born. Nor was there any evidence that this baby was abused by his youthful parents. What is an issue, is the risk of harm to this infant if returned to his parents. The burden in this case is on the Minister to show both that WBA would be in need of protection if returned to live with his parents at BA’s farm, where he was apprehended, and, further, that the order sought six month temporary order or six month order placing the child with TK as person of sufficient interest is appropriate. will now summarise the evidence not already referred to: (a) Erin Heuser [10] Erin Heuser was involved with this baby and the parents, as child protection worker, on behalf of the Minister. She was present at Yorkton Hospital around the time WBA was born, and set up meeting with CB and JA and grandparents TK and BA. At that meeting, safety plan was drawn up, which meant that the Minister did not proceed with the apprehension. That safety plan was that the grandparents who no longer live together would both move in with JA and CB. One grandparent would always be present to provide supervision and guidance. (b) Debbie Lapitski [11] Ms. Lapitski has been family support worker employed by SIGN for 23 years. She worked with CB and JA from September, 2015 until the date of apprehension on November 23, 2015. She initially had two hours per week with the parents and this was increased to six hours per week, as it was clear that these parents needed more support. It was obvious, based on her observations and her conversations with CB, that both parents became frustrated with the tasks around raising this baby. While some frustration is normal with young parents, it was clear that there was level of stress and anger in this household which went well beyond “the normal”. She said CB wanted to parent, but she, however, was not sure CB was capable of doing it full time. JA, while not disinterested in parenting, was less willing to engage with Ms. Lapitski. [12] The situation came to head on November 23, 2015. She described the young people CB and JA as tired parents who were angry with each other and angry with Ms. Lapitski. The situation escalated as earlier described in this decision. Just prior to WBA being apprehended, JA locked CB and Ms. Lapitski out of the house, in fit of anger, and was alone with WBA. BA was nowhere to be seen. The RCMP were called. [13] I, without hesitation, accept that CB told Ms. Lapitski that JA and she had fight and that he shoved her into the washer and tried to strangle her, and that she then kneed him between the legs. Further, having had chance to assess Ms. Lapitski as witness, thought she presented well, in straightforward manner. Any suggestion as gather is suggested by the parents that she was conspiring with or acting to help TK to get custody of WBA is in my view not supported by the evidence. (c) Christi Fallows [14] Christi Fallows was the child protection worker in charge of this file on the day WBA was apprehended. She received cell phone call from Debbie Lapitski and CB, who were in van outside of the house the young parents were living in at BA’s farm. Both were on Ms. Fallow’s speaker phone. CB said that JA flipped out and locked her in the porch, then pushed her up against the washer and later kicked her and Debbie out of the house. [15] Given the involvement of the Ministry to this date, after Ms. Fallows spoke to her supervisor, she directed that the child be apprehended. Ms. Fallows, as well, directed that WBA be placed with grandmother TK and that place of safety designation report be prepared (which was filed at the hearing as Exhibit P-2). [16] Three days after the apprehension, Ms. Fallows met with CB, JA and BA. She tried to discuss the Minister’s concerns with them. In her words, the meeting did not go well as all three of the others were trying to talk over each other. She explained where WBA had been placed, with grandmother TK. Remarkably, the three wanted the RCMP to supervise any access. In Ms. Fallows words, that wasn’t happening, and must say agree with her assessment about what was reasonable at that point. [17] Ms. Fallows continued to have concerns with JA’s anger, especially when CB refused to give statement to the police about what happened on the apprehension date, and later said it was only minor incident. (d) Cst. Cumby [18] Cst. Andrea Cumby, of the Canora RCMP, testified about her involvement with this family. On July 21, 2015, she received call from BA, who said he had been abused by his son JA for couple of years. Another call was received with yelling in the background. JA had barricaded the driveway to BA’s farm, and was threatening to kill anyone who entered the yard. He had gun, which turned out to be pellet gun. [19] The Canora RCMP asked for, and received, backup from the Kamsack RCMP and the Yorkton RCMP. JA was taken in to custody, and then to Yorkton hospital under The Mental Health Services Act. BA, who was highly stressed and had been hiding under table in his house, was taken away by ambulance, as was CB, in fear that she was already in labour which it turned out she was not. [20] For his actions, JA was charged under The Youth Criminal Justice Act. Cst. Cumby was asked about other files the police had regarding JA. She said these involved uttering threats and assaults, and further, said the police had been called about this youth either by someone complaining about him or by him complaining ten to twelve times. (e) Grandmother TK [21] TK described CB and JA, at the time of WBA’s birth, as immature and not ready to parent. Three days after the birth, she and BA met with child protection worker, and agreed that one grandparent would be with the parents to supervise the care of WBA. For the first few weeks, she and BA alternated in supervising the care of the baby. While present, TK said she did most of the care of WBA. She said CB would feed WBA and then get tired. She described CB as tired, frustrated, not ready to parent, and confused. She said JA was working quite bit and, although he tried to feed the baby, he did not interact much with WBA. [22] TK said, after JA and CB moved out to BA’s farm, these parents dropped the child off with her for her to care for WBA from time to time. She said this was for week to week and half on one occasion. [23] After the apprehension, about six months ago, TK reduced her work schedule from five days week to three days week, and made use of daycare centre, all to help her care for the baby. She said JA and CB would visit with WBA at her place, but the visits varied lot from time to time. Because of the irregularity of the visits, she was concerned with the parents’ reluctance to visit WBA, and stopped visits at her house, rather suggesting that the visits be in public place, where others could see them, or that the visits be otherwise supervised by the Ministry staff. [24] TK clearly believed that these parents were not now prepared and/or able to care for this child as of the date of the hearing. It was obvious that her relationship with her son JA was, and is, poor, and that JA harbours anger towards her. [25] Regarding CB, TK admitted she didn’t know her well, but based on what she knows about her history and based on her observations of her with WBA, she doesn’t trust that CB could fully care for WBA. She said she has seen JA’s anger, and CB’s anger, and has seen that anger directed at each other, which is major concern for her. In particular, she says JA’s anger is unpredictable and she is not sure what will set him off. III. THE CASE FOR THE PARENTS [26] CB was the only witness for the parents. She described how she came to give up her first child for adoption, after the child was apprehended by the Minister of Social Services in Alberta. She was in violent relationship with former spouse, disclosed this to child protection worker and was afraid what would happen to the baby if she stayed in that relationship. [27] After her first child was born, she moved to Saskatchewan, where her grandmother lived, and went to school in Rosetown from May to November of 2014. While there, she had parent aid and was doing parenting preparation as she had not yet decided whether to agree to the adoption, which she subsequently did. [28] CB met JA on an internet dating site, and after two months of phone calls, tweets and exchanging pictures, she moved to BA’s farm near Canora and began living with JA. Early in 2015, she learned she was pregnant, and was very happy as this was second chance for her. [29] CB started looking into parenting classes, and began seeing worker named Sandy at Mental Health once week. In August, after the incident with JA and BA and the RCMP in July, she began seeing family support worker Debbie Lapitski. The two discussed such issues as getting the appropriate car seat and baby swing. She admitted to telling Ms. Lapitski she was anxious and worried about the birth of the child. She was worried that her baby would, again, be apprehended. [30] Sometime in the summer of 2015 and it was confusing to try to follow the dates of events in this case with any precision CB and JA moved to house in Canora. She has little recollection of the labour and birth of WBA, during time which she lost considerable amount of blood. She agreed with the Minister’s employees that either BA or TK would be present to supervise her and JA once they returned home with the baby. She said, in the early weeks of the child’s life, she was involved with feeding and bathing her son. [31] At some point gather after few weeks CB and JA moved to BA’s farm, where it was not as crowded as the house in Canora. During the weeks that followed, CB admitted that she and JA did drop the baby off to TK, but claimed TK didn’t cooperate with them regarding when the baby was to be picked up. [32] major part of the evidence in this hearing centred on the poor relationship between JA and CB, on the one hand, and TK, on the other. As said in court at the start of the hearing, ultimately must deal with what is in the best interests of WBA. It was my attempt to keep the focus on the infant and avoid hostilities between the parties. That said, and acknowledging the cognitive challenges CB has, find it difficult not to mention CB’s assessment of TK. She said when she first met her TK was as nice as pie to her, until TK found out that CB was pregnant, and now CB thinks that TK is bitch and there is no positive relationship between them. [33] On November 23, 2015, the appointment CB had was with Bernice Cartwright, family violence counsellor at SIGN. She acknowledged that both herself and JA have “issues” and she had hoped that he would come with her this day to the appointment. He refused and was angry. It is sad, and perhaps telling, that CB blames herself for JA’s anger over this. She summarised the issue by saying when JA is mad, she can’t tell him to calm down, he just has to be alone, and, further, that “he has his moments”. That, in my view, is an understatement. [34] When Ms. Lapitski arrived, CB said there was yelling and screaming and swearing back and forth between JA and Ms. Lapitski. [35] CB doesn’t remember talking to Christi Fallows on the phone that day. am satisfied she did, and that both Ms. Fallows and Ms. Lapitski accurately described what she said to them that day. [36] CB concluded her evidence by saying that, if WBA was returned to her and JA, they would live at BA’s farm or she would look for house in Sturgis or Preeceville (although there was no suggestion she had begun this search). She would make appropriate arrangements such as car seat and crib. JA is working full time at farm in Hazel Dell. Her supports would be friend named Tanya, neighbour named Roy, and grandfather BA, who lives in second house on the farm. No other details were given. [37] CB would also be open to another family support worker, other than Ms. Lapitski. To be clear, though, Ms. Taylor says the family support program is not prepared to provide an employee to work with these parents. IV. IS THIS CHILD IN NEED OF PROTECTION? [38] As said earlier, this sad case. We have very young parents who, each with significant challenges, want to care for their infant. We have grandmother, who is now caring for the child, and has provided not all, but most, of the care for this child since birth. We have all sorts of mistrust between the parents and the grandmother. We, as well, have child protection workers from the Ministry of Social Services who have the difficult job of ensuring this child is not in need of protection. [39] Regarding CB’s FASD assessment, filed as Exhibit P-1, gather there is lack of information about whether her mother drank during her pregnancy. As result, fetal alcohol spectrum disorder cannot be confirmed. That said, it is obvious CB suffers from cognitive disability. The report says: based on the occupational therapy and psychological assessments completed with CB, significant deficits were identified related to broad cognitive abilities, memory skills, communication skills, academic development, social cognition, adaptive/life skills, executive functioning, fine and gross motor skills, and visual-motor-integration skills. Considering that report, and the evidence presented at this hearing, it is obvious to me that CB needs significant amount of support to be able to parent this child. [40] It is as well obvious that JA is sixteen year old father who works hard to provide for his family, and am sure wants to be able to care for his son, but who, nevertheless, has some significant anger issues. appreciate that although he did not testify he has seen Bernice Cartwright at SIGN and that she wrote an email (Exhibit D-1) describing him as mature for his age and saying he and CB have shown great improvement in understanding what productive relationship is based on, despite the initial meeting with her being very tense. The email as well reflects how both JA and CB view grandmother TK as “thorn in their side”. [41] Even considering the meeting with Ms. Cartwright and the parenting programming JA has apparently done, based on the certificates filed as Exhibit D-2, it is difficult for me to reach any other conclusion than that this young man has some significant anger management issues that are yet to be dealt with. He baracaded his father’s farm last July, and threatened to kill anyone who came onto the farm. Police officers from three detachments were required to defuse this situation. After the child was apprehended he made threats directed to both police officer and child protection worker. Cst. Cumby said the Canora detachment had ten to twelve files regarding this sixteen year old. [42] Having heard the Minister’s evidence - the child protection workers, the family support worker, the police officer and grandmother TK, together with having read the FASD assessment - I am satisfied that WBA was in need of protection on November 23, 2015, when apprehended. I conclude that the parents were not, at that time, able to care for WBA and that physical or emotional harm was likely to occur to this six week old baby. [43] Similarly, when I consider the plan put forward by CB - to return the infant to the parents’ care in the same location as on November 23, 2015 with the support of grandfather BA, who was living there on the apprehension date, and a friend and neighbour of her’s - and even considering any programming done by the parents, I remain satisfied that this infant would remain in need of protection. That is not to say it is impossible for these parents to care for this child at some point. But it is to say that am not satisfied on the evidence presented that the care these young parents could as of today provide for this child would result in WBA not being in need of protection. V. WHAT ORDER SHOULD BE MADE? [44] Having found that WBA is in need of protection under s. 11(b), that then leads to the question of what order should be made under s. 37 of the Act. gather that, while in TK’s care, the parents saw the child only about six times. Without getting into the “blame game”, this is obviously not enough visits, and encourage the Ministry staff to encourage as much visitation between the parents and WBA as is reasonably possible. [45] All that said, this baby has been in the care of his grandmother for most of his life, and am satisfied that TK has cared well for WBA. I have no hesitation, considering all of her involvement to date, in finding TK to be a person of sufficient interest, and I so order under s. 23 of the Act. [46] As stated above, am not satisfied that the care these young parents could as of today provide for this child would result in WBA not being in need of protection. While not foreclosing the possibility of placing the child in their custody at a later time, I am satisfied on the evidence at this hearing that WBA should be placed in TK’s custody, as a person of sufficient interest, for a fixed period of four months, pursuant to s. 37(1)(b). That period is of shorter duration than the six months suggested by the Minister, but I have considered that: (1) given a variety of reasons, the parents have not had adequate access to their child so as to build a more positive relationship with him; and (2) there was no evidence that either parent abused or mistreated this child. Given both of these considerations, I view four months as a sufficient time for the parents to begin building a positive relationship with their child through access and, with the assistance of others, to come up with a plan that would allow them to care for their child so that child would not be in need of protection. [47] As result, order, pursuant to ss. 23 and 37(1)(b) of the Act, that the child WBA be placed in the custody of TK, as person of sufficient interest, for four months from today, subject to the conditions that: (a) Both parents will have liberal access to WBA, as arranged by the Minister’s employees; (b) Both parents will participate in any anger management or parenting programming as directed by the Minister’s employees; and (c) Both parents will co-operate in any parenting assessment done by the Minister’s employees, if such an assessment is undertaken during the course of this order.",b_2016skpc86.txt,"HELD: The court found that the child was in need of protection under s. 11(b) of The Child and Family Services Act, that his parents were unable to care for him, and that physical or emotional harm was likely to occur to him.
J.A.’s mother was found to be a person of sufficient interest under s. 23 of the Act.
The court ordered that the child should be placed in the custody of J.A.’s mother as a person of sufficient interest for a period of four months pursuant to s. 37(1)(b) of the Act.
The child’s parents should have adequate access to build their relationship with him and to allow them, with the assistance of others, to come up with a plan that would allow them to eventually care for their child."
688,"[2] In the circumstances of this case, I would allow the appeal and order a new trial.
When he returned, he advised that the next available trial date in the Melfort judicial centre was almost year away.
Mr. Hayter’s counsel suggested another judicial centre and the judge checked to see if an earlier date could be secured elsewhere.
[8] The judge then adjourned the trial for five minutes so Mr. Hayter could speak with his counsel.
[11] Mr. Hayter now challenges the judge’s decision not to grant any of the requested adjournments, but particularly the denial after his counsel had withdrawn mid-trial.
An accused’s entitlement to make full answer and defence is also set out in s. 650(3) of the Criminal Code.
This right of review is especially wide when the consequence of the exercise of discretion is that someone is deprived of his rights, whether in criminal or in civil proceedings.
At glance, have found in the last few years no less than half dozen judgments in civil proceedings where decision depriving litigant of an important right was reversed on account of insufficient reasons given.
), that the exercise of the trial judge’s discretion in refusing an adjournment may be reviewed by an appellate court if it is based upon reasons that are not well founded in law and results in deprivation of the accused’s right to make full answer and defence.
However, it is also clear that such right must be weighed conscientiously and delicately along with the public interest in the orderly administration of justice.
analysis [19] As understand his arguments, Mr. Hayter has framed his claim for relief under error of law and miscarriage of justice.
[20] As Barrette The Queen, Ironchild and Chu indicate, an appeal court’s review of the judge’s decision to decline to grant an adjournment looks first to see whether the decision was based upon reasons that are not well-founded in law.
That is, would first identify the factors that ground the proper exercise of judicial discretion to grant or deny an adjournment where counsel has withdrawn at or shortly before trial.
[25] One important distinction to draw on the facts of Barrette The Queen and of Rak is that the accused in the latter case had had the time to obtain counsel before trial.
On appeal the appellant must show that in refusing the adjournment the trial judge deprived the appellant of his right to make full answer and defence and thus made an error in principle which constituted miscarriage of justice (Barrette v. R. and Manhas v. R., supra).
The decision whether or not to grant an adjournment must be made in the light of the realities of each case consistent with the interests of justice: J.C.G.
added the following qualification: [23] It is not necessary for these factors to be articulated verbatim by judge each time an unrepresented litigant applies for an adjournment.
[30] To summarise and paraphrase all of this, when an accused seeks an adjournment at or shortly before trial for the purposes of obtaining legal counsel, the trial judge will want to examine the evidence and the record and then turn his or her mind to at least four areas of inquiry: (a) Has the accused failed to exercise the right to counsel honestly and diligently?
trial court should not be inclined to grant an adjournment where the accused has failed to act diligently or honestly in attempting to obtain counsel.
(v) Is there evidence that the absence of counsel at trial is part of an orchestrated attempt by the accused to delay the proceedings?
This will be particularly important where judge is sitting with jury, given the additional requirements in trials of that nature.
Without attempting to restate the considerations set forth in Jordan, the following may assist in assessing the delay of the trial and its potential effect on the orderly and expeditious administration of justice: (i) How long has it been since the charges were laid?
(c) Would granting an adjournment potentially affect trial fairness from the Crown’s perspective?
(vi) Is there real risk that physical evidence may be lost or destroyed before trial if the matter were adjourned?
(d) Is the accused reasonably capable of making full answer and defence to the charges without the assistance of legal counsel?
Some of the inquiries under the previous question may be relevant here too, in the sense of ensuring the accused’s right to fair trial is not infringed.
In that respect, the following questions may assist: (i) What is the accused’s level of education and intellectual sophistication?
Is the matter likely to give rise to complex or unusual points of law or of evidence or complicated defence strategies?
[31] To be clear, there is no general duty on trial judge to probe each and every one of the itemized questions in ritualized fashion.
Some of the considerations and questions itemized above may carry more weight than others based on the facts and circumstances in any given situation.
On the other hand, the judge has duty to ensure the orderly and expeditious administration of justice and to prevent the abuse of court processes.
[32] In keeping with this general direction, the trial judge is not required to provide detailed reasons for refusing to grant an adjournment.
On the evidence, the reasons for adjournment advanced by Mr. Hayter were not compelling and the Crown had cogently explained the prejudice that would befall it.
It is relevant to trial fairness in the sentencing hearing, but would not interfere with the decision in the context of this conviction appeal.
The trial involved factual and legal issues relating to Mr. Hayter’s ostensible employment relationship with several different corporations, his health status and the claims documentation he had filed with WCB.
It speaks to the ability of self-represented accused to properly defend him or herself, but it also extends expectations about how quickly the matter ought to come to trial for the purposes of s. 11(b) of the Charter.
Mr. Hayter went on to state that he was stressed about his wife being in the hospital and that “I can’t do nothing by myself.” At one point, Mr. Hayter said his former counsel was “beautiful lady”, suggesting he did not understand appropriate courtroom conduct.
All of this evidence indicates Mr. Hayter lacked the basic skills and disposition necessary to competently run his own defence in this trial.
[42] Fifth, the factual matters at issue in the trial occurred between 2006 and 2011.
As such, Mr. Hayter had what appears to be good reason to ask for an adjournment: he suddenly found himself without counsel in the midst of trial.
[44] That said, there were also number of factors that supported the judge’s refusal to grant the second adjournment.
During argument for the initial adjournment request, the prosecutor had made it clear that this would be significant inconvenience for the Crown’s witnesses.
[45] Second, it is clear the judge was considering the public interest in the orderly and expeditious administration of justice.
... Delay of year is relevant factor and cuts in favour of declining an adjournment request for the reasons identified in Jordan.
[46] Third, the judge appears to have determined judicial assistance with the conduct of trial could ameliorate the consequences of lack of counsel.
Mr. Hayter was not being held in remand, so he had the liberty to avail himself of this and other opportunities to prepare and respond to matters arising in his trial.
Intentional or not, Mr. Hayter put his counsel in an untenable ethical position by questioning her ability to adhere to her duty of loyalty to him.
For this reason, it is quite difficult to say with any degree of certainty that Mr. Hayter had sought to exercise his right to counsel in completely honest and diligent manner.
The judge certainly felt it was open to him to conclude that Mr. Hayter may have connived to cause his counsel to withdraw mid-trial.
[48] The fact is that the judge did not record the reason or reasons he had for denying the mid-trial request for an adjournment.
In making this remark, Pigeon J. noted he had found “in the last few years no less than half dozen judgments in civil proceedings where decision depriving litigant of an important right was reversed on account of insufficient reasons given” (emphasis added).
He then said “there is all the more reason to so regard discretionary decision in criminal proceedings, the effect whereof is to deprive the accused of his right to obtain the assistance of counsel and to summon witnesses in his defence” (at 125).
[51] In that regard, I conclude Mr. Hayter’s poor conduct of his own defence favours intervention in this matter.
[53] Finally, although the evidence of Mr. Hayter’s guilt on the charge of fraud over $5,000 was considerable, am not prepared to find that Mr. Hayter was manifestly guilty on the basis of it or that the outcome of the trial would necessarily have been the same had the judge granted the adjournment and had Mr. Hayter been later represented by counsel at trial.
V. conclusion [54] For the foregoing reasons, I find the verdict must be set aside and a new trial ordered.","HELD: The appeal was allowed and a new trial ordered.
In this case, the court found that the judge had not erred in his decisions regarding the first and the third requests for adjournment but had in the second request by failing to provide sufficient reasons for his denial.
Amongst many factors it considered, the court found that most importantly, the appellant had not caused his counsel to withdraw for the purpose of delaying trial.
It concluded that the error resulted in a miscarriage of justice based upon the appellant’s poor conduct of his own defence and lack of understanding of trial process.",118,"Court of Appeal for Saskatchewan Docket: CACR2965 Citation: Hayter, 2018 SKCA 65 Date: 2018-08-23 Between: Larry Hayter And Her Majesty the Queen Before: Caldwell, Whitmore and Schwann JJ.A. Disposition: Appeal allowed; new trial ordered Written reasons by: The Honourable Mr. Justice Caldwell In concurrence: The Honourable Mr. Justice Whitmore The Honourable Madam Justice Schwann On Appeal From: Crim 12 of 2016, Melfort Appeal Heard: June 12, 2018 Counsel: Jeremy A. Caissie for the Appellant Erin L. Bartsch for the Respondent Caldwell J.A. I. introduction [1] After trial, judge convicted Larry Hayter of one count of fraud over $5,000, contrary to s. 380(1)(a) of the Criminal Code. The judge found Mr. Hayter had defrauded the Saskatchewan Workers’ Compensation Board [WCB] of $137,377.76. But, in the course of the trial, Mr. Hayter’s counsel had justifiably withdrawn, leaving him to conduct his own defence. The issues in this appeal are whether the judge’s refusal to grant an adjournment was based on reasons that are not well-founded in law and whether the decision affected Mr. Hayter’s right to make full answer and defence or his right to fair trial. [2] In the circumstances of this case, I would allow the appeal and order a new trial. [3] Mr. Hayter also appeals against his sentence but, given my conclusion on the conviction appeal, have not addressed the sentence appeal in these reasons. [4] The facts are procedural and may be explained briefly. Mr. Hayter requested adjournments before, during and after his trial. At the commencement of trial, Mr. Hayter’s counsel requested an adjournment because Mr. Hayter’s wife had been hospitalised and could not attend court. His counsel said Mr. Hayter’s “mind is not here in the courtroom” and that it “is very stressful for him with his spouse being in the hospital.” Mr. Hayter was prepared to waive delay if the judge granted an adjournment. There was no mention of Mr. Hayter’s wife testifying or as being material witness. The Crown opposed this first adjournment request because the charge had been laid more than three years previous, the preliminary hearing had been rescheduled four times, and it had scheduled ten out-of-town witnesses to testify. [5] The judge stepped down for ten minutes to consider the request. When he returned, he advised that the next available trial date in the Melfort judicial centre was almost year away. Mr. Hayter’s counsel suggested another judicial centre and the judge checked to see if an earlier date could be secured elsewhere. No other judicial centre could offer an earlier trial date. While expressing sympathy for Mr. Hayter’s situation, the judge denied his adjournment request. [6] Following this, the trial proceeded for the morning session, with the Crown leading witness in examination-in-chief. After returning from the lunch break, Mr. Hayter’s counsel addressed the court and stated that, after speaking to Mr. Hayter, she was seeking leave to withdraw as his counsel. Over lunch, Mr. Hayter had expressed concerns, because his counsel was employed by Legal Aid Saskatchewan and because Mr. Hayter was alleged to have defrauded WCB, that as government employee his counsel had some stake in seeing him prosecuted successfully. His counsel advised the judge she felt, as an officer of the court, that she had an obligation to seek leave to withdraw. As for the reason, she said Mr. Hayter no longer had confidence in her ability to represent him. She also said she had advised Mr. Hayter that her withdrawal did not guarantee the court would grant an adjournment. [7] In response to defence counsel’s application, the judge informed Mr. Hayter that, in his opinion, Mr. Hayter’s counsel was “as good as they get,” and asked if Mr. Hayter needed few minutes to reconsider and apologise to her. Following which, this exchange took place: THE ACCUSED: It’s just I’m so stressed out, Your Honour (sic), with my medical conditions and that, just don’t know what I’m doing. don’t even know what’s going on. THE COURT: Well, then maybe you should take the guidance from Ms. Bodnar [defence counsel]. THE ACCUSED: Pardon? THE COURT: Maybe you should take the guidance from your legal counsel you already have rather than trash it and really have some problems. ‘Cause if you think now you don’t know which way you’re going, just wait until you start acting for your own as your own lawyer. [8] The judge then adjourned the trial for five minutes so Mr. Hayter could speak with his counsel. This exchange then followed: THE COURT: Okay, what is your decision? You realize that we’re going ahead anyway? This isn’t going to get you an adjournment. THE ACCUSED: I’d like I’d like an adjournment for THE COURT: You’re not going to get one. THE ACCUSED: Can’t get one. THE COURT: You’re not going to get one. THE ACCUSED: (INDISCERNIBLE) just just can’t THE COURT: You don’t get to tell the Court what to do. You are going ahead on your own if you don’t have counsel. THE ACCUSED: Yeah and don’t know nothing, so THE COURT: So THE ACCUSED: So that’s the you’re going ahead without THE COURT: I’m going ahead whether you have lawyer or you don’t. THE ACCUSED: can’t fight it by myself, so I’ll have to guess I’ll have to ask her if she’d come back and work for me then. [9] The discussion between the judge and Mr. Hayter continued for some time until the judge again adjourned the trial for five minutes to allow Mr. Hayter to apologise to his counsel. The judge also instructed Mr. Hayter to determine whether his counsel would still represent him. When the matter reconvened, Mr. Hayter’s counsel informed the judge that she remained of the view she could no longer represent Mr. Hayter, reiterating that she did not believe he had confidence in her ability to represent him. The trial then resumed with Mr. Hayter representing himself. The Crown continued with the examination-in-chief of its first witness for the remainder of the afternoon session. The following morning, Mr. Hayter was called upon to cross-examine the Crown witness. [10] Later, following his conviction, Mr. Hayter again sought unsuccessfully an adjournment to obtain counsel for the sentencing hearing. Ultimately, the judge sentenced Mr. Hayter to two-and-a-half years in prison. [11] Mr. Hayter now challenges the judge’s decision not to grant any of the requested adjournments, but particularly the denial after his counsel had withdrawn mid-trial. He does so on the basis that the denials deprived him of his rights to make full answer and defence and to fair trial. He acknowledges the Charter does not afford him right to be represented by counsel at trial. III. standards of review [12] The right to make full answer and defence and the right to fair trial are encompassed within ss. and 11(d) of the Charter: Harrer, 1995 CanLII 70 (SCC), [1995] SCR 562 at para 13; Seaboyer; Gayme, 1991 CanLII 76 (SCC), [1991] SCR 577. An accused’s entitlement to make full answer and defence is also set out in s. 650(3) of the Criminal Code. [13] In Chu, 2016 SKCA 156 (CanLII), 344 CCC (3d) 51, Jackson J.A. observed that, where right is grounded in the Charter, request to adjourn trial on the basis of an infringement of that right is request for remedy under s. 24(1) of the Charter. In such circumstances, it follows that an order denying an adjournment is an order made under s. 24(1). The standard of appellate review of orders made under s. 24(1) is deferential: Bellusci, 2012 SCC 44 (CanLII) at para 17, [2012] [14] However, on the facts of this case, the identified Charter rights could not have been breached at the time the judge denied the adjournment request because the trial had just started. That is, Mr. Hayter’s request for an adjournment was not request for remedy under s. 24(1) of the Charter because there had been no infringement of his right to fair trial or to make full answer and defence to remedy. While his request in this Court for new trial may be seen as request for remedy under s. 24(1) of the Charter, the Charter was not invoked in the decision under appeal. [15] Nonetheless, decision to deny an adjournment request remains appealable to this Court outside of the Charter under and according to the requirements of s. 675(1)(a) of the Criminal Code. An appeal of this nature engages the Court’s powers under ss. 686(1)(a)(ii) or (iii): Chu at para 81; Moosomin, 2008 SKCA 168 (CanLII) at para 27, [2009] WWR 577. If approached as potential error of law under s. 686(1)(a)(ii), the appellate review is that of discretionary decision of trial judge (see Chu; Ironchild (1984), 1984 CanLII 2666 (SK CA), 30 Sask 269 (CA); Barrette The Queen, 1976 CanLII 180 (SCC), [1977] SCR 121). If approached as potential miscarriage of justice under s. 686(1)(a)(iii), the appeal court reviews what occurred in the trial to see whether there was in fact miscarriage of justice or the appearance of one (R Moosomin; Khan, 2001 SCC 86 (CanLII), [2001] [16] In Khan at para 63, Arbour J., who wrote for the majority, recognised there is sometimes “a fine line between what can constitute ‘a wrong decision on question of law’ and ‘miscarriage of justice’” and she declined to draw that line; nonetheless, she did characterise miscarriages of justice as being “akin to procedural irregularities” (at para 61). Whether error of law or miscarriage of justice, Arbour J. noted that both may be cured under s. 686(1)(b) of the Criminal Code, meaning “the circumstances must be considered to see if the error could have played significant role in the legal validity of the verdict or rendered the trial unfair, in reality or in appearance, or was merely peripheral” (at para 66). [17] When approached under s. 686(1)(a)(ii), the standard of appellate review of decision to decline an adjournment is that set out in Barrette The Queen at 125, where the majority wrote: It is true that decision on an application for adjournment is in the judge’s discretion. It is, however, judicial discretion so that his decision may be reviewed on appeal if it is based on reasons which are not well founded in law. This right of review is especially wide when the consequence of the exercise of discretion is that someone is deprived of his rights, whether in criminal or in civil proceedings. At glance, have found in the last few years no less than half dozen judgments in civil proceedings where decision depriving litigant of an important right was reversed on account of insufficient reasons given. (Frank v. Alpert; Basarsky v. Quinlan; Ladouceur v. Howarth; Whitco Chemical Co. v. Oakville; General Foods v. Struthers; Hamel v. Brunelle). This being so in civil proceedings, there is all the more reason to so regard discretionary decision in criminal proceedings, the effect whereof is to deprive the accused of his right to obtain the assistance of counsel and to summon witnesses in his defence. This principle is fully recognized in the English case law which was cited to us. [Footnotes omitted] [18] This Court applied the framework for review from Barrette The Queen in Ironchild, where the accused had argued the trial judge’s refusal to grant an adjournment deprived him of the rights to make full answer and defence under the Criminal Code, to fair hearing pursuant to s. 11(d) of the Charter, and to not be deprived of his liberty unless in accordance with the principles of fundamental justice under s. of the Charter. In that case, Tallis J.A. wrote: [13] It is clear from the majority judgment in Barrette v. The Queen (1976), 1976 CanLII 180 (SCC), 10 N.R. 321; 29 C.C.C.(2d) 189 (S.C.C.), that the exercise of the trial judge’s discretion in refusing an adjournment may be reviewed by an appellate court if it is based upon reasons that are not well founded in law and results in deprivation of the accused’s right to make full answer and defence. However, it is also clear that such right must be weighed conscientiously and delicately along with the public interest in the orderly administration of justice. ... [Emphasis added] IV. analysis [19] As understand his arguments, Mr. Hayter has framed his claim for relief under error of law and miscarriage of justice. will address the matter first under s. 686(1)(a)(ii) as an error of law. [20] As Barrette The Queen, Ironchild and Chu indicate, an appeal court’s review of the judge’s decision to decline to grant an adjournment looks first to see whether the decision was based upon reasons that are not well-founded in law. If so, the appeal court’s focus shifts to determination of whether the error has resulted in deprivation of the accused’s right to make full answer and defence or to fair trial. [21] As the decision in this case was made in the course of the trial, there are no separate, written reasons for it. Rather, as is common, the judge was called upon to make his ruling during the to-and-fro of the trial. For this reason, his decision was understandably oral and brief, but it leaves little to which to refer in appellate review. In Barrette The Queen at 124, Pigeon J., who wrote for the majority, said this about the exercise of judicial discretion: There is nothing in the record which could legally support the presumption that counsel’s absence was premeditated scheme in complicity with the accused. It was the first time the case was being called and there was nothing to justify such inference rather than mere suspicion. The accused has the right “to make full ... defence personally or by counsel” (s. 577(3) Cr. C.). An adjournment necessary for the exercise of this right may be refused only for reason based on established facts. [Underlining in original, italics emphasis added] As such, where the decision itself leaves little to review, the appellate court must have resort to the whole of the record, examining it for evidence that might support as well as impugn the decision to deny the adjournment request. [22] Before turn to the record in this case with that view, would first set out, in non-exhaustive terms, what am looking for. That is, would first identify the factors that ground the proper exercise of judicial discretion to grant or deny an adjournment where counsel has withdrawn at or shortly before trial. In that regard, again turn to the decision in Barrette The Queen. [23] As well as setting out the standard of review, the decision in Barrette The Queen is instructive because, in that case, the trial judge had dismissed an accused’s request for an adjournment after his lawyer had failed to show up for court. The trial judge had reasoned that judges postpone too many cases in similar circumstances, there had already been delay of six months, and the case was simple. Justice Pigeon allowed the appeal, quashed the conviction, and ordered new trial, stating “I cannot find that the accused, who was sentenced to year in prison, had fair trial” (at 127). Of particular importance, given the circumstances of this matter, is the fact that the accused in Barrette The Queen was not at fault for his lawyer’s absence and there was no evidence to suggest it was deliberate plot to delay the trial. [24] In Rak (1999), 1999 CanLII 12229 (SK CA), 172 Sask 301 (CA), this Court approached similar matter from different angle and reached the opposite conclusion but, in doing so, the Court identified several factors for consideration: [7] We are all of the view there is no tenable basis for interfering with the trial judge’s discretion in refusing to grant the adjournment and the consequent verdict. The appellants had ample opportunity to obtain counsel and their refusal to cooperate with counsel led to refusal of Legal Aid. The failure to have counsel did not result in an unfair trial. Gregory Rak handled the defence rather adroitly on his own and his father’s behalf and was effective in his cross-examination. He demonstrated clear ability to understand the documentary evidence. As well the trial judge was extremely helpful to the appellants throughout the course of the trial. We are all of the view the appellants were not deprived of their right to fair trial or their right to make full answer in defence and there was no miscarriage of justice. [25] One important distinction to draw on the facts of Barrette The Queen and of Rak is that the accused in the latter case had had the time to obtain counsel before trial. Moreover, it was the accused’s own failure to co-operate with Legal Aid that had led to the absence of counsel at trial. In those circumstances, this Court nonetheless also examined the effect of counsel’s absence on the trial as it had been conducted by the self-represented accused and on its outcome, concluding the accused’s demonstrated ability and the assistance offered by the trial judge confirmed he had not been deprived of his right to fair trial or to make full answer and defence. As well, in Rak, the trial had been rescheduled twice prior to the trial in question. [26] In Ironchild, Tallis J.A. found the accused had deliberately dismissed his counsel as trial tactic so as to obtain an adjournment. He also observed there was nothing in the record to indicate the accused had lost confidence in his counsel. Justice Tallis stated that, while an accused has the right to dismiss counsel, the appellate court may take into account the circumstances of dismissal when considering an appeal of this nature. [27] Outside Saskatchewan, the Court in Beals, 1993 CanLII 5636 (NS CA), 1993 NSCA 215, 126 NSR (2d) 130, dealt with this issue and helpfully summarised the law as follows: [30] In summary the following propositions emerge from the cases to which have referred: 1. The decision whether to grant or refuse request for an adjournment because an accused is not represented by counsel in criminal trial is discretionary one but one that must be based on reasons well-founded in the law. (Barrette v. R., 1976 CanLII 180 (SCC), [1977] S.C.R. 121). 2. An accused has constitutional right to fair trial. Representation by counsel at trial is generally essential to fair trial if an accused is charged with serious offence and complex trial can be anticipated. (R. v. Rowbotham (1988), 1988 CanLII 147 (ON CA), 41 C.C.C. (3d) 1). 3. The right to counsel at trial is not absolute. (R. v. Richard and Sassano (1992), 55 O.A.C. 43); there is no constitutional right to be represented by state funded counsel at trial. (R. v. Rowbotham, supra, and R. v. Prosper (1992), 1992 CanLII 2476 (NS CA), 113 N.S.R. (2d) 156 N.S.C.A.). 4. The right of an accused to retain counsel to represent the accused at trial must be exercised honestly and diligently so as not to delay scheduled trial. (R. v. Richard and Sassano, supra). 5. Each application for an adjournment on the ground that the accused will not have counsel at trial must be decided on its facts. Relevant facts to be taken into account by the trial judge are: (a) whether or not there have been prior adjournments due to the unavailability of counsel and the accused was warned well in advance of trial that the trial would be proceeding on the scheduled date with or without counsel. (R. v. McGibbon (1988), 1988 CanLII 149 (ON CA), 45 C.C.C. (3d) 334); (b) the accused’s criminal record which reflects on the accused’s degree of familiarity with the criminal justice system and legal aid programmes (R. v. Richard and Sassano, supra); (c) whether the charge against the accused is simple or complex which fact impacts on the critical question whether or not the accused can get fair trial without counsel (Barrette v. R., supra); (d) the public interest in the orderly and expeditious administration of justice (R. v. B. (J.E.) (1990), 1989 CanLII 1495 (NS CA), 52 C.C.C. (3d) 224 and R. v. Richard and Sassano, supra); (e) if the accused has been refused legal aid and when the refusal was communicated to the accused. 6. As general rule an accused should not be refused an adjournment if the fact that he is without counsel on the scheduled trial dates is not his fault but that of his counsel and he had no complicity in the matter (Barrette v. R., supra). 7. As general rule an accused should be refused an adjournment if he has not acted diligently and honestly in attempting to obtain counsel and it can be inferred from the circumstances that he failed to avail himself of the opportunity to do so for the purpose of delaying the proceedings (Manhas v. R. (1980), 1980 CanLII 172 (SCC), 17 C.R. (3d) 331). 8. On an appeal from refusal it would appear that court of appeal will not find the learned trial judge erred notwithstanding his reasons may not be fully articulated if the record discloses evidence from which it can be inferred that the absence of counsel was brought about by the accused for the purpose of delaying the proceedings (Barrette v. R., supra; Manhas v. R, supra; R. v. Richard and Sassano, supra). 9. The scope of review by an appeal court of refusal, notwithstanding it involves the review of the exercise of discretionary power, is wide as the consequences of refusal are to deprive an accused of his right to be represented by counsel. On appeal the appellant must show that in refusing the adjournment the trial judge deprived the appellant of his right to make full answer and defence and thus made an error in principle which constituted miscarriage of justice (Barrette v. R. and Manhas v. R., supra). [28] The appellate courts in White, 2010 ABCA 66 (CanLII), 252 CCC (3d) 248, Tortora, 2010 BCCA 547 (CanLII), 265 CCC (3d) 264, and Le (T.D.), 2011 MBCA 83 (CanLII), 275 CCC (3d) 427, and this Court in Bitternose, 2009 SKCA 54 (CanLII), 244 CCC (3d) 218, have endorsed the foregoing list of propositions from Beals. Further, in White, citing G.(J.C.) (2004), 2004 CanLII 66281 (QC CA), 189 CCC (3d) (Que CA), the Court added the following factors for consideration by trial judge: [16] When asked for postponement, it is appropriate for trial judge to consider relevant circumstances such as the gravity of the charges, the number of previous postponements and the consequences of postponement for the Crown and for the accused: J.C.G. at para. 12. The decision whether or not to grant an adjournment must be made in the light of the realities of each case consistent with the interests of justice: J.C.G. at para. 13. Whether it is just to deny trial adjournment to an unrepresented accused depends upon many different factors, including the personality and skills of the accused. [29] In Tortora, after citing the propositions from Beals, Bennett J.A. added the following qualification: [23] It is not necessary for these factors to be articulated verbatim by judge each time an unrepresented litigant applies for an adjournment. However, where the record shows that judge has refused an adjournment without properly weighing the factors or taking into consideration irrelevant factors, miscarriage of justice may result if the accused is deprived of his right to make full answer and defence. [30] To summarise and paraphrase all of this, when an accused seeks an adjournment at or shortly before trial for the purposes of obtaining legal counsel, the trial judge will want to examine the evidence and the record and then turn his or her mind to at least four areas of inquiry: (a) Has the accused failed to exercise the right to counsel honestly and diligently? trial court may properly consider an accused who, having the means and opportunity to do so, fails to obtain counsel for trial to have chosen to defend himself or herself: Rowbotham (1988), 1988 CanLII 147 (ON CA), 41 CCC (3d) 1; 63 CR (3d) 113 (Ont CA). trial court should not be inclined to grant an adjournment where the accused has failed to act diligently or honestly in attempting to obtain counsel. This is particularly so where there is evidence the accused has not availed himself or herself of the opportunity to do so for the purpose of delaying the proceedings. In that regard, the following inquiries may help assess whether an accused has acted honestly and diligently: (i) Has the accused had an adequate opportunity to obtain counsel? (ii) Has the accused been warned that he or she will have to proceed with trial without counsel? Has the accused been made aware of the potential consequences of that? (iii) Has Legal Aid or private counsel withdrawn or refused to represent the accused? If so, when was the accused advised of this? Keeping in mind the principles discussed in Cunningham, 2010 SCC 10 (CanLII), [2010] SCR 331, does the record disclose why counsel withdrew? (iv) Has the accused acted or failed to act so as to thwart the appointment of counsel? Has the accused acted in any other way to delay the proceedings? (v) Is there evidence that the absence of counsel at trial is part of an orchestrated attempt by the accused to delay the proceedings? (b) Would granting an adjournment inordinately delay the trial? Keeping in mind the policy concerns underlying and reflected in Jordan, 2016 SCC 27 (CanLII), [2016] SCR 631, the object of this question is to determine whether an adjournment would negatively affect the public interest in the orderly and expeditious administration of justice. This will be particularly important where judge is sitting with jury, given the additional requirements in trials of that nature. Without attempting to restate the considerations set forth in Jordan, the following may assist in assessing the delay of the trial and its potential effect on the orderly and expeditious administration of justice: (i) How long has it been since the charges were laid? Is this the first scheduled date for trial? If not, how many times has the matter been postponed or adjourned since the charges were laid? Who was responsible for prior adjournments? Were any of the prior postponements due to unavailability of defence counsel? (ii) Is the accused in custody? If not, what are the terms of interim release? (iii) How serious is the offence with which the accused has been charged? (iv) How long of an adjournment is the accused requesting? Is it reasonable in the circumstances? Would shorter adjournment suffice? (v) When is the next available trial date? Would the accused and the Crown consent to change in venue if that would facilitate an earlier trial date? (vi) Does the accused agree that the delay brought about by the requested adjournment will not count against the s. 11(b) of the Charter right to be tried within reasonable time? (c) Would granting an adjournment potentially affect trial fairness from the Crown’s perspective? Where an accused seeks an adjournment at or shortly before trial for the purposes of obtaining legal counsel, the more serious the prejudice that will befall the Crown by reason of an adjournment, the more likely it is that the court will deny the accused’s request for an adjournment. trial judge will understand that the passage of time typically has some adverse effect on trial fairness through failure of witnesses’ memories, loss or destruction of physical evidence, etc. In that regard, the following inquiries may assist in assessing the effect an adjournment may have on trial fairness from the Crown’s perspective: (i) Are there co-accused? Are they being tried separately? If so, when are their trials scheduled? If not, what is the co-accuseds’ position on an adjournment? (ii) What is the expected duration of the trial? (iii) How many witnesses is the Crown expected to call? What are their characteristics? Are any of them children? Experts? Will any of them require translator? (iv) Was the Crown put to subpoenaing its witnesses? Is there real risk witness may fail or be unable, for any reason, to testify at an adjourned trial? Is there evidence that the accused may be seeking tactical adjournment to see if that risk materialises? (v) Where are the witnesses located? Will it be inordinately difficult for the Crown to arrange for witness attendance at later trial date? (vi) Is there real risk that physical evidence may be lost or destroyed before trial if the matter were adjourned? (vii) What, if anything, can be done to address or mitigate the consequences of an adjournment? (d) Is the accused reasonably capable of making full answer and defence to the charges without the assistance of legal counsel? Some of the inquiries under the previous question may be relevant here too, in the sense of ensuring the accused’s right to fair trial is not infringed. Under this question, the trial judge may more directly assess the personal characteristics of the accused, being alert to the nature of the Crown’s case, the relevant law and possible defences to the charges in question. The trial judge will have to ascertain whether, in the circumstances, the accused reasonably possesses the skills, capacity and experience necessary to proceed without legal counsel at trial with minimum level of competency having regard for the right to fair trial. In that respect, the following questions may assist: (i) What is the accused’s level of education and intellectual sophistication? Is the accused in good physical and mental health? What is the accused’s employment background? What level of family or other support is available to the accused? (ii) Is the accused’s criminal record such that it indicates the accused would be familiar with the criminal justice system and the criminal trial process? (iii) Was there preliminary hearing? If so, what does the transcript indicate about the issues that will arise (where trial is by judge and jury: Asapace, 2011 SKCA 139 (CanLII), 279 CCC (3d) 427)? (iv) Was the matter case managed such that the legal issues have been narrowed before trial? Is there an agreed statement of facts? (v) Will the trial be lengthy, complex or legally complicated? Is the matter likely to give rise to complex or unusual points of law or of evidence or complicated defence strategies? (vi) Is the accused facing multiple charges or charges with multiple lesser-included offences? (vii) Is the accused in jeopardy of serving significant incarceral term if convicted? [31] To be clear, there is no general duty on trial judge to probe each and every one of the itemized questions in ritualized fashion. The foregoing are merely non-exhaustive suggestions. Each request for an adjournment will give rise to its own set of relevant questions and considerations. The scope of the inquiry is best left to the insight and experience of the trial judge. Some of the considerations and questions itemized above may carry more weight than others based on the facts and circumstances in any given situation. Some considerations will overlap and necessarily compete against others. On one hand, the trial judge is bound to see that the accused receives fair and public hearing (Charter, s. 11(d)), which includes the right to fair trial, and that an accused is not deprived of his or her liberty except in accordance with the principles of fundamental justice (Charter, s. 7). On the other hand, the judge has duty to ensure the orderly and expeditious administration of justice and to prevent the abuse of court processes. In this context, the relative weight assigned to each consideration is for the trial judge to assess and to balance, with the balancing exercise largely matter of judicial discretion. At the end of the day, the trial judge must be satisfied, on his or her own inquiry, whether it is in the interests of justice to grant an adjournment. [32] In keeping with this general direction, the trial judge is not required to provide detailed reasons for refusing to grant an adjournment. Indeed, the reasons for the ruling may be obvious from the record itself. That said, in terms of the sufficiency of reasons, trial judges may be guided by the instruction in Barrette The Queen that the reason or reasons for denying an adjournment must be based on established fact and well-founded at law, and by the instructions in Sheppard, 2002 SCC 26 (CanLII), [2002] SCR 869, in terms of sufficiency in the expression of those reasons. [33] On that footing, would turn to examine the record in this appeal. To begin, find no reason to interfere with the trial judge’s refusal to adjourn the trial at its commencement. Even though the trial judge gave no reasons for his decision, the record strongly supports the conclusion that his decision was well-founded at law and based on established fact. On the evidence, the reasons for adjournment advanced by Mr. Hayter were not compelling and the Crown had cogently explained the prejudice that would befall it. I find there is no basis to conclude the judge erred in denying the first requested adjournment. [34] To clear the table for the analysis that follows, I also find that the third request for adjournment—coming as it did after the verdict had been rendered—could have had no bearing on trial fairness or the right to make full answer and defence with respect to the trial proper. It is relevant to trial fairness in the sentencing hearing, but would not interfere with the decision in the context of this conviction appeal. [35] However, find the evidence relevant to the exercise of judicial discretion in the matter of the second request for an adjournment—namely, when Mr. Hayter’s counsel had withdrawn mid-trial—pulled both in favour of granting and of denying the request for an adjournment. [36] Without canvassing the record in ritualized way, note first that this was the first return date for trial and, while there had been three adjournments of the preliminary inquiry, two of those had been at the request of the Crown. [37] Second, Mr. Hayter faced fraud charge, which often results in complex trial. This trial had been scheduled for week. The charge related to allegedly fraudulent activity that had occurred over number of years. There were 22 exhibits entered at trial (16 by the Crown and by Mr. Hayter). The trial involved factual and legal issues relating to Mr. Hayter’s ostensible employment relationship with several different corporations, his health status and the claims documentation he had filed with WCB. The Crown had subpoenaed ten witnesses to testify. During her application to withdraw, Mr. Hayter’s counsel stated, “I don’t want to leave Mr. Hayter in the lurch. mean, it is complicated matter”. All of which suggests Mr. Hayter was facing complex criminal trial. [38] Trial complexity cuts at least two ways in these cases. It speaks to the ability of self-represented accused to properly defend him or herself, but it also extends expectations about how quickly the matter ought to come to trial for the purposes of s. 11(b) of the Charter. For example, the majority of the Supreme Court of Canada had this to say on the issue of trial complexity in Jordan: [77] As indicated, exceptional circumstances also cover second category, namely, cases that are particularly complex. This too requires elaboration. Particularly complex cases are cases that, because of the nature of the evidence or the nature of the issues, require an inordinate amount of trial or preparation time such that the delay is justified. As for the nature of the evidence, hallmarks of particularly complex cases include voluminous disclosure, large number of witnesses, significant requirements for expert evidence, and charges covering long period of time. Particularly complex cases arising from the nature of the issues may be characterized by, among other things, large number of charges and pre-trial applications, novel or complicated legal issues, and large number of significant issues in dispute. Proceeding jointly against multiple co‑accused, so long as it is in the interest of justice to do so, may also impact the complexity of the case. In this case, trial complexity pushed more toward adjournment than not in my assessment. [39] Third, the judge in this case was aware of some of Mr. Hayter’s personal circumstances, which did not lend to an understanding that he could adequately defend himself. For example, before the request for adjournment, Mr. Hayter had stated: It’s just I’m so stressed out, Your Honour (sic), with my medical conditions and that, just don’t know what I’m doing. don’t even know what’s going on. There is no suggestion in the record that the judge disbelieved Mr. Hayter about this or that he understood Mr. Hayter to be exaggerating his state of mind. Mr. Hayter went on to state that he was stressed about his wife being in the hospital and that “I can’t do nothing by myself.” At one point, Mr. Hayter said his former counsel was “beautiful lady”, suggesting he did not understand appropriate courtroom conduct. [40] Further, an accused’s criminal record can show degree of familiarity with the criminal justice system. While Mr. Hayter does have criminal record, his convictions occurred 50 years prior to this trial. This suggests he was unlikely to have familiarity with the criminal justice system such that he could ably manage his own defence. All of this evidence indicates Mr. Hayter lacked the basic skills and disposition necessary to competently run his own defence in this trial. [41] Fourth, as noted, Mr. Hayter had been accused of defrauding WCB of substantial sum but in comparison to violent offences or offences where the public would be in immediate danger, his alleged crime was of less-serious nature. While not impossible, it is unlikely Mr. Hayter would have perpetrated new fraud upon WCB if an adjournment had been granted. That is, there was little risk to the public if the trial were adjourned. [42] Fifth, the factual matters at issue in the trial occurred between 2006 and 2011. At the time of trial in 2017, the witnesses, whether for the Crown or the defence, would have already lacked fresh memory of the events. While this circumstance does not reduce the prejudice to the Crown and to the defence if an adjournment were granted, it indicates state of affairs in which much of the prejudice of memory loss and loss or destruction of evidence might well have already occurred. Notably, the Crown had already sought and received the court’s permission to have two of its witnesses testify via video conference, limiting the prejudice to the Crown in respect of rescheduling these witnesses to give their evidence. [43] Finally, but importantly, Mr. Hayter’s counsel had withdrawn due to breakdown in the solicitor-client relationship. Given the recorded comments of his former counsel, it does not appear Mr. Hayter intentionally brought about a circumstance where his counsel felt—and I might say properly so—compelled to withdraw or that he had done that for the purpose of delaying trial. The transcript suggests Mr. Hayter’s issue with his counsel arose after she had raised the issue of him accepting plea bargain with the Crown, following the Crown’s opening statement, in the midst of the examination-in-chief of the Crown’s first witness. This apparently, but wrongly, caused Mr. Hayter to question his counsel’s loyalty to him. Nonetheless, regardless of its origin, this appears to be genuine breakdown of the solicitor-client relationship, not plan to delay the trial. Indeed, the judge permitted Mr. Hayter’s counsel to withdraw. As such, Mr. Hayter had what appears to be good reason to ask for an adjournment: he suddenly found himself without counsel in the midst of trial. In addition, when his counsel made the first request for an adjournment at the start of trial, she had said Mr. Hayter was willing to waive delay, indicating he was not attempting to delay matters with hopes of bringing successful application under s. 11(b) and Jordan. [44] That said, there were also number of factors that supported the judge’s refusal to grant the second adjournment. First, notwithstanding what have noted above, the potential consequences to the Crown of an adjournment could have been significant. If adjourned, the next available trial date in Melfort was nearly year away. During argument for the initial adjournment request, the prosecutor had made it clear that this would be significant inconvenience for the Crown’s witnesses. majority of the Crown’s witnesses were from places outside of Melfort and they had been required to travel to Melfort for the trial. While two of the Crown’s witnesses had been allowed to testify via video conference, eight others had taken time off work and travelled to testify. [45] Second, it is clear the judge was considering the public interest in the orderly and expeditious administration of justice. In the initial adjournment request, which had been made only hours before the adjournment request at issue here, the judge stated: Ms. Bodnar, have considered your request and sincerely sympathize with your client, but also know how much everything has been adjusted for this and if we adjourn it, the next possible date would be almost year away. ... Delay of year is relevant factor and cuts in favour of declining an adjournment request for the reasons identified in Jordan. [46] Third, the judge appears to have determined judicial assistance with the conduct of trial could ameliorate the consequences of lack of counsel. This is not evident on the record of the adjournment request, but the judge did give considerable assistance to Mr. Hayter during the trial. He explained the required elements of the offence, the definition of reasonable doubt, the presumption of innocence, and the fact that Mr. Hayter was not obligated to testify. In addition, the judge advised Mr. Hayter that he should study his files and materials for the purposes of conducting cross-examination of witnesses, after the Crown had finished its examination-in-chief, and he adjourned the trial for the remainder of the day to allow Mr. Hayter the time to do so. Mr. Hayter was not being held in remand, so he had the liberty to avail himself of this and other opportunities to prepare and respond to matters arising in his trial. [47] Finally, while his counsel may have withdrawn by reason of breakdown of the solicitor-client relationship, that breakdown had apparently resulted from Mr. Hayter’s own misperception of things and his misguided comments about her loyalty to him. Intentional or not, Mr. Hayter put his counsel in an untenable ethical position by questioning her ability to adhere to her duty of loyalty to him. His supposed reason for doing so is unfounded and shows an utter and complete lack of understanding of a lawyer’s ethical duties and professional responsibilities as well as of the paramountcy of a lawyer’s ethical obligations over employment and other obligations. For this reason, it is quite difficult to say with any degree of certainty that Mr. Hayter had sought to exercise his right to counsel in completely honest and diligent manner. The judge certainly felt it was open to him to conclude that Mr. Hayter may have connived to cause his counsel to withdraw mid-trial. Nonetheless, as Pigeon J. cautioned in Barrette The Queen at 124 (cited above), such conclusions must be based on established facts, not speculation. [48] The fact is that the judge did not record the reason or reasons he had for denying the mid-trial request for an adjournment. Where reasons are given, the mere fact there is evidence that weighs against the trial judge’s reasons is not determinative of the matter provided the trial judge took all relevant considerations into account in his or her decision-making. Similarly, where reasons are given, the fact the appellate court might have weighed some of the relevant considerations differently than the trial judge does not give rise to reversible error. That is, had the judge articulated the basis for his decision in this case, might have been hard-pressed to conclude it was not well-founded in law. [49] Where there are no reasons given for decision, the appellate right of review is especially wide because, as Pigeon J. observed in Barrette The Queen, the consequence of that exercise of judicial discretion is that an accused may have been deprived of the right to fair trial or to make full answer and defence. In making this remark, Pigeon J. noted he had found “in the last few years no less than half dozen judgments in civil proceedings where decision depriving litigant of an important right was reversed on account of insufficient reasons given” (emphasis added). He then said “there is all the more reason to so regard discretionary decision in criminal proceedings, the effect whereof is to deprive the accused of his right to obtain the assistance of counsel and to summon witnesses in his defence” (at 125). [50] In the circumstances of this case, I am persuaded to conclude the judge erred in law by failing to provide sufficient reasons for denying Mr. Hayter’s mid-trial request for an adjournment, but that does not mean the conviction must be set aside. Rather, it leads to the second question under the framework in Barrette The Queen, which is whether that denial resulted in deprivation of Mr. Hayter’s right to make full answer and defence or to fair trial. Put in terms of the appellate power under s. 686(1)(b)(iii), having determined that the appeal might be decided in favour of Mr. Hayter under s. 686(1)(a)(ii), must now determine whether the error resulted in no substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice. [51] In that regard, I conclude Mr. Hayter’s poor conduct of his own defence favours intervention in this matter. Throughout the trial, it appears Mr. Hayter had difficult time hearing or understanding what was going on. He mentions this himself several times and is recorded as saying “pardon” many times. Whether an inability to hear or to understand, it speaks negatively to his ability to competently conduct his own defence. [52] The transcript bears out his incompetence. It contains examples of Mr. Hayter making mistakes in carriage of his defence. He did not cross-examine Crown witness after expressing an intention to do so, he believed erroneously that he would not have right of appeal if he did not testify, he attempted to tender exhibits himself instead of through the appropriate witness, and he struggled generally to ask relevant questions of witnesses or questions material to the issues at hand in his cross-examinations of witnesses. Unlike the accused in Rak, cannot safely characterise his self-advocacy as adroit or capable. cannot say he handled his cross-examinations effectively or that he showed clear ability to understand the documentary evidence. As such, conclude the denial of the mid-trial adjournment “could have played significant role in the legal validity of the verdict or rendered the trial unfair, in reality or in appearance” (R Khan at para 66). [53] Finally, although the evidence of Mr. Hayter’s guilt on the charge of fraud over $5,000 was considerable, am not prepared to find that Mr. Hayter was manifestly guilty on the basis of it or that the outcome of the trial would necessarily have been the same had the judge granted the adjournment and had Mr. Hayter been later represented by counsel at trial. V. conclusion [54] For the foregoing reasons, I find the verdict must be set aside and a new trial ordered. “Caldwell J.A.” Caldwell J.A. concur. “Whitmore J.A.” Whitmore J.A. concur. “Schwann J.A.” Schwann J.A.",b_2018skca65.txt,"HELD: The appeal was allowed and a new trial ordered.
In this case, the court found that the judge had not erred in his decisions regarding the first and the third requests for adjournment but had in the second request by failing to provide sufficient reasons for his denial.
Amongst many factors it considered, the court found that most importantly, the appellant had not caused his counsel to withdraw for the purpose of delaying trial.
It concluded that the error resulted in a miscarriage of justice based upon the appellant’s poor conduct of his own defence and lack of understanding of trial process."

It is an error in principle to over-emphasize the personal circumstances of the offender to the exclusion of an examination of other sentencing factors.
[21] We are also of the view that the total sentence imposed in this case failed to give due weight to the aggravating factor that these offences were carried on in furtherance of criminal organization.
[22] Accordingly, the sentences imposed in these cases must be set aside.","The three respondents pled guilty to three offences: trafficking in cocaine for the benefit of, or at the direction of, or in association with a criminal organization contrary to s. 467.12 of the Criminal Code; conspiring together and with others to traffic in cocaine contrary to s. 5(1) of the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act and s. 465(1)(c) of the Criminal Code; and trafficking in cocaine contrary to s. 5(1) of the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act.

On the first count, each was sentenced to serve 1 year, in the community, consecutive to the sentences for the other counts.
They were also subjected to DNA orders and there was an order of forfeiture of a vehicle belonging to a third party.
The Crown appealed these sentences on the grounds that the sentencing judge failed to give proper effect to the gravity of these offences.
The Court weighed all the evidence and circumstances of the accused, and found the sentencing judge was clearly moved by the personal circumstances of the accused and while they are mitigating and would normally justify a sentence at the low end of the range, it was the Court's view that the sentencing judge gave them undue weight in comparison to the principles of denunciation and general deterrence, which must play a significant role in offences of this nature.
The Court further stated the 1 year sentence for the trafficking offence, to be served in the community, was demonstrably unfit given the range of sentences established in other cases of trafficking offences, even after taking into account the mitigating personal circumstances of these offenders.
The Court found the sentences must be set aside.
The Court found that an appropriate sentence for each of the respondents, taking into account the seriousness of the offences, the personal circumstances of the respondents, and the aggravating nature of the offences pursuant to s. 467.12, would be 18 months, concurrent, for each of the last two counts, and 1 year consecutive for the criminal organization offence, for a total of 30 months imprisonment.
HELD: The total sentence in each case is 30 months, 5 months having already been served.",158,"J. THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR SASKATCHEWAN Citation: 2009 SKCA 53 Date: 20090416 Between: Docket: 1605 Her Majesty the Queen and Daniel Aube, Jason Pederson and Dale Kaye Respondents Coram: Cameron, Smith and Hunter JJ.A. Counsel: Douglas G. Curliss for the Crown Dwayne Z. Braun for the Respondents Appeal: From: Provincial Court Heard: April 16, 2009 Disposition: Appeal Allowed (Orally) Written Reasons: May 7, 2009 By: The Honourable Madam Justice Smith In Concurrence: The Honourable Mr. Justice Cameron The Honourable Madam Justice Hunter Smith J.A. [1] The three respondents pled guilty to three offences: trafficking in cocaine for the benefit of, or at the direction of, or in association with a criminal organization contrary to s. 467.12 of the Criminal Code; conspiring together and with others to traffick in cocaine contrary to s. 5(1) of the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act and s. 465(1)(c) of the Criminal Code; and trafficking in cocaine contrary to s. 5(1) of the Controlled Drugs and substances Act. [2] On the last two counts, each was sentenced to one year less a day to be served in the community on each count, to be served concurrently, plus a 10 year fire arms prohibition. On the first count, each was sentenced to serve one year, in the community, consecutive to the sentences for the other counts. They were also made subjects to DNA orders and there was an order of forfeiture of a vehicle belonging to a third party. [3] The Crown appealed these sentences on the grounds that the sentencing judge failed to give proper effect to the gravity of these offences, particularly in light of the volume of trafficking and lengthy period of time over which it had taken place, the highly dangerous nature of the substances sold, which included crack cocaine, the fact that they were working for a criminal organization and the fact that their motivation was financial gain. [4] The panel allowed the appeal from the bench, substituting more lengthy period of incarceration for the conditional sentences originally imposed, with more extensive reasons to follow. These are those reasons. [5] The three respondents all worked as street-level cocaine dealers, selling crack cocaine in gram, gram, and gram (8-ball) amounts for criminal gang based in Edmonton known as the “Crazy Dragons.” The Crazy Dragons expanded into Saskatoon in 2005 to set up business in the crack cocaine trade. The respondents were involved in this activity for at least months, from November 15, 2005 to August 2, 2006, when they were arrested. During the last 60 days of that period the police recorded on wiretap in excess of 600 drug deals made by the respondents. This would have involved minimum of 300 grams and maximum of 2.1 kilograms of cocaine for proceeds of between $36,000 and $180,000. During this period the respondents worked 12 hours day and rotated their shifts so that the “deal” phone and delivery car were being operated twenty four hours per day, seven days per week. [6] The respondents were trained in their techniques by the criminal organization. The noted high volume of sales was made possible by practices defined by the organization and established to ensure that they worked as an efficient team to ensure delivery of cocaine on 24 hour day basis while reducing the risk of discovery. They used code names to conceal their identities and code words to conceal their activities; when shipment of cocaine would arrive in Saskatoon from Edmonton, all would meet at “stash house” in Langham or rent hotel room in Saskatoon to cut up the cocaine into packages for resale, then stash the cocaine packages; the stashes of cocaine were located throughout the city, behind bushes in parks, in back alleys, in cemeteries, and in ditches on the outskirts of town in an effort to avoid detection by police and to reduce their liability should they be arrested; and they carried only small amounts of cocaine at any given time and were directed to secrete the baggies of cocaine in their mouths while in transit. In the event they were stopped by the police, they could simply swallow the baggies and avoid detection. [7] During the time of their involvement in this activity, none of the respondents was employed. Their only source of income was from selling crack cocaine. [8] The circumstances of these offences are very serious and would, in normal circumstances, call for penalty substantially above the bottom of the range of sentences imposed in relation to drug trafficking. say this in light of the length of time the respondents were involved in selling drugs and the high volume of drugs sold, the nature of the drugs sold, the sophistication of the enterprise, and the fact that their motivation was clearly profit. [9] Despite this history, the personal circumstances and conduct of each of these respondents, particularly during the in excess of two year period between his arrest and the sentencing for these offences, is impressive and significantly mitigating. All are relatively young. Both Daniel Aube and Jason Pederson had just turned 18 when they became involved with the Crazy Dragons and are now 21 years old. Dale Kaye, who is now 23 years old, was not yet 20 in the fall of 2005. Neither Mr. Kaye nor Mr. Pederson has prior criminal record. Mr. Aube’s record consisted of two convictions for failing to comply with the conditions of his release in relation to these charges: one for breach of curfew and the other for failing to carry his recognizance with him when outside his residence. All have very strong personal and community support and, after few stumbles, each has performed well under the strict conditions under which he was released, particularly in terms of establishing strong employment record. Each has explicit plans and strong prospects for the future. All expressed remorse and the sentencing judge was persuaded that each had made significant changes in his life and was by all appearances rehabilitated. [10] Dale Kaye grew up in foster home due to his mother’s drug dependency. He is of mixed race (an Aboriginal mother and black father) and has been diagnosed as suffering from fetal alcohol effects. As youth, he had used both marihuana and cocaine, and prior to the offending conduct, had never been gainfully employed. [11] He became involved with the Crazy Dragons in November, 2005. He came to Saskatoon and was homeless and had no means of support. He met gang member at party and was offered place to stay, friendship, food and bit of money if he would work for them. [12] Early in the release period Mr. Kaye violated his release conditions by being unaccounted for in the community, but subsequently was compliant and expressed regret for his criminal activity. He was consistently employed during his release period and at the time of sentencing had been working for construction company for three months. His employer spoke movingly on his behalf at the sentencing hearing and Mr. Kaye himself spoke of his joy in this job. [13] Daniel Aube came from broken home and due to family difficulties left home at the age of 17 without finishing high school. He got involved with the gang with childhood friend. When the charges in this matter were laid, Mr. Aube had left Saskatoon and returned to Edmonton. When he heard of the charges, he turned himself in. His friend, by contrast, fled, and remained at large, still working in the drug trade, for over year, when he was stabbed and killed. This incident has had significant impact on Mr. Aube. [14] Since his release Mr. Aube has been employed in several jobs. Most recently, he started working at restaurant as line cook and rapidly assumed additional responsibility, managing the restaurant in the evenings. His employer provided strong letter of support. He has girl friend who is law student at the University of Alberta. He had explicit plans to obtain his GED and then enter the Northern Alberta Institute of Technology to train as chef. At the sentencing hearing he expressed deep remorse and regret for his involvement and belief that he had changed during the release period. [15] Jason Pederson enjoys very strong family support. In younger years he was an honour student, excelled in sports and had won citizen award. But he seemed to go off the rails in high school, dropping out before completing grade 12. He also got involved with the gang with friend. [16] At the time of arrest he was also charged with obstruction for giving false name to the police. In the early days of his release he was charged with some violations of conditions of his release, including failing to keep the peace and failure to attend the court. Since that time, however, he has committed to completing his GED and to his employment with Home Depot, with whom he expects to have career. He has had girl friend for two years who is supportive of him, as is his family. He has sought counselling to deal with his remorse and shame in relation to his criminal conduct. [17] The sentencing judge was clearly moved by these circumstances. While we agree that they are mitigating, and would justify a sentence at the low end of the range, it is our view that the sentencing judge gave them undue weight in comparison to the principles of denunciation and general deterrence, which must play a significant role in offences of this nature. In the result, the one year sentence for the trafficking offence, to be served in the community, is in our view demonstrably unfit given the range of sentences established in other cases of trafficking offences. [18] As the Crown has pointed out, the gravity of these offences is demonstrated by the maximum sentences set out in the Criminal Code: life imprisonment for trafficking in cocaine and conspiring to traffick in cocaine and 14 years imprisonment, consecutive, for committing those offences for criminal organization. [19] This Court has repeatedly said that the range of sentencing for trafficking in cocaine is 18 months to four years, and that the personal circumstances of an accused, while not to be ignored, are secondary considerations to the issues of deterrence and denunciation. It is an error in principle to over-emphasize the personal circumstances of the offender to the exclusion of an examination of other sentencing factors. See. R. v. Patryluk, 2002 SKCA 33 (CanLII), and especially paragraphs 21-23. This decision, in particular, where the circumstances were much less serious, cannot be reconciled with the sentences imposed in the instant case. See also R. v. Goy (1992), 1992 CanLII 8299 (SK CA), 105 Sask. R. 131 (Sask. C.A.); R. v. Grewal, 2003 SKCA 56 (CanLII); R. v. Dubai, 2008 SKCA 49 (CanLII); and R. v. McCallum, 2007 SKCA 139 (CanLII). [20] Considerations of parity alone would have warranted sentence of years on the trafficking charge alone in the circumstances of this case. In our view, the sentence of one year was demonstrably unfit, in light of the seriousness of these offences, even after taking into account the mitigating personal circumstances of these offenders. [21] We are also of the view that the total sentence imposed in this case failed to give due weight to the aggravating factor that these offences were carried on in furtherance of criminal organization. Section 467.14 of the Criminal Code requires that the sentence imposed for this offence be consecutive to any other sentence imposed for the predicate offence. It is clear that if the sentence imposed for the predicate offence is reduced to take into account the mandatory consecutive penalty for the aggravating offence, the effect is to frustrate the will of parliament through the failure to recognize and impose the mandatory consecutive penalty required by law for the separate, distinct and serious nature of the aggravating offence. See R. v. Brewer (1999), 1999 CanLII 18938 (NL CA), 141 C.C.C. (3d) 290 (Nfld. C.A.) and R. v. St. Amand (1982), 1982 CanLII 3772 (ON CA), 67 C.C.C. (2d) 130 (Ont. C.A.). [22] Accordingly, the sentences imposed in these cases must be set aside. In each case, an appropriate sentence for each of the respondents, taking into account the seriousness of the offences, the personal circumstances of the respondents, and the aggravating nature of the offences pursuant to s. 467.12, would be 18 months, concurrent, for each of the last two counts, and one year consecutive for the criminal organization offence, for a total of 30 months imprisonment. [23] In this case, each of the respondents has already served five months of the conditional sentence imposed by the sentencing judge, for which they should be given credit. Accordingly, the total sentence in each case is 30 months, 5 months having already been served.",c_2009skca53.txt,"The three respondents pled guilty to three offences: trafficking in cocaine for the benefit of, or at the direction of, or in association with a criminal organization contrary to s. 467.12 of the Criminal Code; conspiring together and with others to traffic in cocaine contrary to s. 5(1) of the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act and s. 465(1)(c) of the Criminal Code; and trafficking in cocaine contrary to s. 5(1) of the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act.
On the last two counts, each was sentenced to 1 year less a day to be served in the community on each count, to be served concurrently, plus a 10 year fire arms prohibition.
On the first count, each was sentenced to serve 1 year, in the community, consecutive to the sentences for the other counts.
They were also subjected to DNA orders and there was an order of forfeiture of a vehicle belonging to a third party.

800,"As part of her appearance and presentation, Ms. Rohrke requested leave to cross-examine Mr. Regnier on his financial circumstances as set forth in the application materials prepared on behalf of Mr. Regnier by the Saskatoon CLASSIC (Community Legal Assistance Services for Saskatoon Inner City Inc.) office.
The assertion on his behalf is that his disability income is essentially what has disentitled him from receiving services from Legal Aid Saskatchewan; however, he does not have sufficient resources to hire counsel.
[9] The submission prepared by supervising lawyer Trevor Oleniuk of CLASSIC concludes with the proposition that Mr. Regnier requires court appointed counsel in order to have fair trial pursuant to ss.
[12] Set forth in Mr. Regnier’s affidavit are the following additional relevant facts: He has suffered from serious addiction to methamphetamine for over 10 years.
His estimate of his income, expenses and assets leaves him in position where the cost of retaining legal counsel in the matter would be completely unaffordable to him.
[14] In addition, Ms. Rohrke inquired of Mr. Regnier as to his transportation cost of $300 per month as set forth in his financial information.
It would appear that Mr. Regnier had not by that time consulted any banking institutions regarding loan or line of credit against his property, nor had he apparently looked further into his financial options.
Such an order for six months was made on the understanding that Mr. Regnier would make attempts to sell his motorcycle, vehicle and other assets in addition to inquiring into whether he could obtain bank loan or home equity line of credit.
Judge Whelan determined that the application was premature as her order of August 29, 2013 provided number of conditions which the accused had to complete before she would consider an extension.
In essence, Mr. Regnier comes before this court in the same position as he was on the earlier occasion without having attempted in any way to utilize his personal resources to obtain counsel.
[24] The protocol requires initially that an indigent accused is required to apply for provincially funded Legal Aid under the appropriate authority.
[25] There are two germane criteria which an accused must demonstrate in order to qualify for court appointed counsel.
The second criterion involves consideration of the complexity of the legal issues involved in the charge or charges against the accused, particularly including an assessment of the possible sentence to be imposed.
[27] I am satisfied from the information and material placed before me that Mr. Regnier is probably not capable of conducting his own defence in light of the personal issues which he is facing and his methamphetamine addiction.
[28] The information further satisfied me that Mr. Regnier has demonstrated an inability to closely follow the proceedings in which he is involved, particularly referencing the preliminary inquiry.
A combination of these factors on the second criterion lead me to conclude that it would most certainly be beneficial to Mr. Regnier to have counsel represent him, particularly on the fundamental premise that in my view he is not capable of adequately representing himself.
[30] However, the second criterion practically comes into play only upon the court’s finding of an accused such as Mr. Regnier being indigent.
If no financial institution was prepared to provide him with funding utilizing his equity as security, that might well cast different light upon the question of his indigency.
33 the court addresses indigency in the following fashion: 33 ... indigency is an inability to pay or contribute to legal fees despite best efforts to prioritize payment of those legal fees by saving, borrowing or otherwise raising funds for such payment, and consequently being incapable of retaining counsel in ample time to ensure fair trial.
[40] In considering all of the factors surrounding Mr. Regnier’s financial circumstance and the potential cost of trial, I am of the view that Mr. Regnier has not demonstrated that he is indigent.","The Court dismissed the application.
It found that the accused was not capable of representing himself but that the accused had not shown that he was indigent.",25,"QUEEN’S BENCH FOR SASKATCHEWAN Citation: 2014 SKQB 144 Date: 2014 05 15 Docket: N.J. No. 12 of 2014 Judicial Centre: Saskatoon BETWEEN: HER MAJESTY THE QUEEN and ANTHONY ROBERT REGNIER Counsel: Andrea J. Rohrke for the Attorney General of Canada Anthony R. Regnier on his own behalf Blaine R. Beaven as friend of the court JUDGMENT ALLBRIGHT J. May 15, 2014 [1] Anthony Robert Regnier is charged in an indictment before this court with the offence: 1. THAT he, the said ANTHONY ROBERT REGNIER, on or about the 21st day of March, A.D. 2013, at or near Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, did unlawfully have in his possession controlled substance, to wit: methamphetamine for the purpose of trafficking, contrary to Section 5(2) of the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act [S.C. 1996, c. 19]. [2] Mr. Regnier’s preliminary inquiry was held in Provincial Court in Saskatoon on March 13, 2014, and he was committed to stand trial on the noted offence in the Court of Queen’s Bench for the Province of Saskatchewan with Queen’s Bench justice sitting alone. At the preliminary inquiry, Mr. Regnier was represented by Mr. Blaine Beaven of Scott Beaven Law Office. Mr. Beaven acted for Mr. Regnier as result of court appointment following an appropriate application by Mr. Regnier seeking such counsel. An endorsement on the Provincial Court documentation dated March 13, 2014 notes, “Mr. Beaven’s court appointment has expired after the preliminary hearing.” [3] Prior to the preliminary inquiry, case management conference was held from time to time dealing with Mr. Regnier’s matter, and as part of the case management discussions, the issue of Mr. Regnier being represented by court appointed counsel was canvassed. Ultimately Mr. Beaven agreed to accept such an appointment and as noted representing Mr. Regnier at the preliminary inquiry. [4] Mr. Regnier now applies in this court for court appointed counsel (in essence Rowbotham application, R. v. Rowbotham (1988), 1988 CanLII 147 (ON CA), 41 C.C.C. (3d) 1, 63 C.R. (3d) 113 (Ont. C.A.). The essence of his current application is that he wishes to have lawyer appointed by the court to represent him at his trial. [5] hearing was convened before me for the purposes of canvassing Mr. Regnier’s application, and on that occasion counsel, Andrea J. Rohrke, appeared on behalf of the Attorney General of Canada in opposition to Mr. Regnier’s request. (The remuneration for counsel appointed on behalf of Mr. Regnier following from such an application would be the responsibility of the Attorney General of Canada.) As part of her appearance and presentation, Ms. Rohrke requested leave to cross-examine Mr. Regnier on his financial circumstances as set forth in the application materials prepared on behalf of Mr. Regnier by the Saskatoon CLASSIC (Community Legal Assistance Services for Saskatoon Inner City Inc.) office. Such questioning occurred, and Mr. Regnier provided responses to the court generally dealing with his personal circumstances and his financial circumstances. Mr. Beaven requested the opportunity, as friend of the court, to ask additional questions of Mr. Regnier, and that request was granted. [6] The issue for me then to determine is whether such an appointment should be made by the court at this time, and if so, whether any conditions should be placed upon that appointment. [7] am appreciative of the efforts of the personnel at CLASSIC for the assistance which they have provided to Mr. Regnier in bringing the current application. am also appreciative of the assistance of Mr. Beaven in appearing as courtesy to the court on the occasion of the hearing. [8] The material before me satisfies me that Mr. Regnier has been denied Legal Aid and has failed on the final appeal. The assertion on his behalf is that his disability income is essentially what has disentitled him from receiving services from Legal Aid Saskatchewan; however, he does not have sufficient resources to hire counsel. His disability benefits are received from the Saskatchewan Teachers’ Federation, and they are the entirety of his income. The submission proceeds; that after paying for his mortgage and other related bills, he is left with very little disposable income. Further, it is asserted on behalf of Mr. Regnier that he does not feel capable of representing himself, as he has substance addiction problem which impairs his perception and memory. Finally, the Crown on complex matter is seeking jail sentence ranging from 18 months to years incarceration. [9] The submission prepared by supervising lawyer Trevor Oleniuk of CLASSIC concludes with the proposition that Mr. Regnier requires court appointed counsel in order to have fair trial pursuant to ss. and 11(d) of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms, Part of the Constitution Act, 1982, being Schedule to the Canada Act 1982 (U.K.), 1982 c. 11) (the “Charter”) as set forth in R. v. Rowbotham. [10] Mr. Regnier has filed an affidavit in support of his application, and the contents of that affidavit parallel the grounds set forth in the formal application and the background articulated therein. [11] Mr. Regnier’s monthly income is $2,500 per month, and as he observes, that exceeds the Legal Aid eligibility level of $985 per month. [12] Set forth in Mr. Regnier’s affidavit are the following additional relevant facts: He has suffered from serious addiction to methamphetamine for over 10 years. His addiction is serious, and it has had an immense impact on his everyday life. He is struggling to deal with his addiction and attends counselling and has regular appointments with psychiatrist. His addictions have the practical effect of impairing his memory and his ability to concentrate. He believes this would negatively affect his ability to pay attention during court proceedings and would make it difficult for him to represent himself on the matter. He is nervous to appear in court and finds the process “very overwhelming” and that such impact further impairs his ability to represent himself. He understands the charges against him are serious and their consequences would be severe. He does not feel able to respond to the serious charges which he is facing. He has no knowledge of legal process or training, and in earlier court attendances he has found that he is unable to understand the language used. He is consequently unable to follow what is happening, and, therefore, at the end of the proceedings is also unaware of what took place and is unaware of what consequences that may have for him. If he is unsuccessful with the application for court appointed counsel, he will likely simply plead guilty to his charges to get it over with, as he would not be able to understand the court proceedings in meaningful way to defend himself. His income is entirely from disability benefits from the Saskatchewan Teachers’ Federation, and he receives $2,500 per month total. His estimate of his income, expenses and assets leaves him in position where the cost of retaining legal counsel in the matter would be completely unaffordable to him. Finally, it is his understanding that private lawyer would charge him thousands of dollars up front as retainer, and as he has no savings and very little disposable income, he cannot afford to retain lawyer. [13] On questioning by Ms. Rohrke, it was demonstrated that Mr. Regnier has significant amount of equity in the home which he owns. While there are financial encumbrances against that home, nonetheless there is the equity which is there, and as understand his response to Ms. Rohrke’s questions, there would appear to be no reason why he could not obtain some funds from the equity in his home. [14] In addition, Ms. Rohrke inquired of Mr. Regnier as to his transportation cost of $300 per month as set forth in his financial information. He is apparently not driving vehicle, and it is her view that these are funds which could be made available to him for the purposes of retaining counsel. In addition, his financial information suggests his residence is worth $200,000 with $75,000 mortgage, leaving, as indicated, equity of approximately $125,000. [15] The following background facts are significant as prelude to the formal Rowbotham analysis. [16] In Provincial Court the application for court appointed counsel was first heard on July 31, 2013 before Judge Whelan. The matter was adjourned. The matter was adjourned so that the accused could inquire into whether he could obtain loan through court services to fund his defence and also so the accused could look into mortgage or loans against his home, which has significant amount of equity. [17] The continuation of the original application was heard on August 29, 2013, at which time the matter again came before Her Honour Judge Whelan. At that time Judge Whelan seized herself with the file. It would appear that Mr. Regnier had not by that time consulted any banking institutions regarding loan or line of credit against his property, nor had he apparently looked further into his financial options. At that time Judge Whelan, in any event, concluded that in order for the matter to move forward in timely fashion and in the absence of the accused having any “disposable assets” at that time that it would be appropriate to grant the accused time limited order. Such an order for six months was made on the understanding that Mr. Regnier would make attempts to sell his motorcycle, vehicle and other assets in addition to inquiring into whether he could obtain bank loan or home equity line of credit. [18] The application again came before Judge Whelan on November 19, 2013, at which time Mr. Regnier was seeking an extension of his court appointed counsel. Judge Whelan determined that the application was premature as her order of August 29, 2013 provided number of conditions which the accused had to complete before she would consider an extension. At that time Mr. Regnier had apparently not complied with any of those conditions. [19] The application was again brought before Judge Whelan on February 27, 2014. The accused once again had failed to complete any of the steps outlined by Judge Whelan in her previous order and had not made any attempt to inquire into loan. Counsel for Mr. Regnier advised that Mr. Regnier had an appointment with the bank the next day; however, the judge was unwilling to provide an extension. Ultimately the court appointed counsel order was extended to March 13, 2014 so that the accused would have representation for the preliminary inquiry; however, no further order was granted beyond that. ROWBOTHAM ANALYSIS [20] In this instance is it clear to me that Mr. Regnier has still not undertaken any of the actions required by Judge Whelan during the time when she case managed the matter. In essence, Mr. Regnier comes before this court in the same position as he was on the earlier occasion without having attempted in any way to utilize his personal resources to obtain counsel. Nonetheless, he seeks an order for court appointed counsel for the purposes of conducting his defence on the indictment before this court. [21] The Ontario Court of Appeal in R. v. Rowbotham, supra, set forth protocol for an accused individual to pursue in seeking court appointed counsel in cases not falling within particular provincial Legal Aid plan. Rowbotham references ss. and 11(d) of the Charter, those sections which guarantee an accused fair trial in accordance with the principles of fundamental justice. The court in Rowbotham recognizes that there will be appropriate circumstances which require that funded counsel be provided to an accused; where that accused wishes counsel but is legitimately unable to pay lawyer, and secondarily, where representation of the accused is essential to fair trial. [22] Since the authorship of R. v. Rowbotham, the protocol has widely been adopted throughout Canada in most, if not all, jurisdictions where the particular provincial Legal Aid scheme is not prepared to provide counsel to an accused individual. [23] As key ingredient of the protocol, the Ontario Court of Appeal concluded that in circumstances where an accused’s fair trial interests are impaired for want of legal representation, that an appropriate remedy is stay of proceedings under s. 24(1) of the Charter, in the event the prosecution insists on proceeding with trial in breach of the accused’s Charter right to fair trial. [24] The protocol requires initially that an indigent accused is required to apply for provincially funded Legal Aid under the appropriate authority. Only in the event of the unavailability of Legal Aid as counsel for an accused is the court required to consider whether the court itself should make an order appointing counsel. [25] There are two germane criteria which an accused must demonstrate in order to qualify for court appointed counsel. The first criterion is that the accused is unable to afford counsel, in other words that the accused is indigent. The second criterion involves consideration of the complexity of the legal issues involved in the charge or charges against the accused, particularly including an assessment of the possible sentence to be imposed. [26] In this instance propose to deal firstly out of turn with the second criterion. [27] I am satisfied from the information and material placed before me that Mr. Regnier is probably not capable of conducting his own defence in light of the personal issues which he is facing and his methamphetamine addiction. The subtle but critical issue of the difference between possession of substance for the purposes of trafficking and simple possession are probably key to Mr. Regnier’s defence, and this difference requires legal analysis of the principles differentiating the two potential offences, again those being possession for the purposes or simple possession. [28] The information further satisfied me that Mr. Regnier has demonstrated an inability to closely follow the proceedings in which he is involved, particularly referencing the preliminary inquiry. [29] In addition, on the second criterion, am advised that the Crown will be seeking significant period of incarceration in the event that Mr. Regnier is found guilty of the offence of possession for the purposes. A combination of these factors on the second criterion lead me to conclude that it would most certainly be beneficial to Mr. Regnier to have counsel represent him, particularly on the fundamental premise that in my view he is not capable of adequately representing himself. [30] However, the second criterion practically comes into play only upon the court’s finding of an accused such as Mr. Regnier being indigent. [31] On the point of indigency, am not persuaded that Mr. Regnier has shown that he is indigent as such is contemplated in R. v. Rowbotham. [32] In considering the financial situation of Mr. Regnier, am entitled to consider not only his statement of his income versus his expenses, but am entitled to consider any equity in real property which is available to him. In this instance, Mr. Regnier has monthly income of approximately $2,500 and his demonstrated expenses in essence consume the $2,500. Upon Mr. Regnier being questioned regarding his financial circumstances, am satisfied that there are some smaller items in his monthly expenses, such as transportation, which he either does not consistently incur or which realistically he does not need to incur. In my view, some of these expenditures could be used to make periodic payments to counsel to represent him. Further, am satisfied that Mr. Regnier has significant amount of equity in his home, by his own financial statement that equity being approximately $125,000. observed that throughout the entire process that Mr. Regnier has been before the courts, whether it is Provincial Court or the Court of Queen’s Bench, that he has made no efforts to attempt to secure funding utilizing this significant equity in his home. Judge Whelan during the Provincial Court proceedings had urged this upon Mr. Regnier; however, he failed to undertake what she requested of him during that process, and it was ultimately only as result of Judge Whelan prudently not wishing the matter to be delayed that she made limited appointment of counsel on behalf of Mr. Regnier. [33] At this stage Mr. Regnier comes before the court still having made no such inquiries. If Mr. Regnier had made such substantial inquiries and attempted to secure alternate financing and been met with lack of success, he would have been in position to present these efforts to the court, and would have been in different position in assessing his ability to fund his own defence. If no financial institution was prepared to provide him with funding utilizing his equity as security, that might well cast different light upon the question of his indigency. However, as noted, that has not occurred. [34] The matter of indigency was considered in R. v. Malik, 2003 BCSC 1439 (CanLII), 111 C.R.R. (2d) 40. At para. 33 the court addresses indigency in the following fashion: 33 ... indigency is an inability to pay or contribute to legal fees despite best efforts to prioritize payment of those legal fees by saving, borrowing or otherwise raising funds for such payment, and consequently being incapable of retaining counsel in ample time to ensure fair trial. [35] In addition, the court in Malik noted that the accused’s financial circumstances must be extraordinary, and it is not sufficient to prove simply difficult circumstances. [36] The court in Malik identified items of financial information which are to be presented by an accused, and they include: (a) extraordinary financial circumstances; (b) attempts to obtain funds to retain counsel; (c) prudence with expenses and prioritization of payment of his legal fees; (d) efforts to save for the cost of counsel and to raise funds by earning additional income; (e) he has made all reasonable effort to use his assets to raise funds, for example by obtaining loans; [emphasis added] (f) whether he is in position to pay some of the costs of counsel; (g) the income and assets of his spouse and family. [37] Some of the items in this canvass are not relevant to Mr. Regnier, however, some are. For example, Mr. Regnier’s financial statement does not demonstrate “extraordinary financial circumstances”, nor has he demonstrated “prudence with expenses and prioritization of payment of his legal fees”. [38] am appreciative that Mr. Regnier is unable to earn additional income from other employment; however, significantly he has not demonstrated “that he has made all reasonable effort to use his assets to raise funds, for example by obtaining loans”. [39] In this instance the Attorney General has acknowledged recognition that in assessing financial eligibility, the court is not bound by the Legal Aid financial criteria, and in essence the court may be more flexible in its assessment. An example of this is that in considering financial eligibility, the court can also take into account the complexity of the case which is balanced against the accused’s financial resources. [40] In considering all of the factors surrounding Mr. Regnier’s financial circumstance and the potential cost of trial, I am of the view that Mr. Regnier has not demonstrated that he is indigent. His financial circumstances are significantly in excess of the baseline criterion for Legal Aid in Saskatchewan, and am not persuaded that he has demonstrated the requisite circumstance of being indigent. Accordingly, in applying the Rowbotham protocol to the application before me, while Mr. Regnier meets the second criterion, he does not in my respectful view meet the first criterion. [41] Accordingly, Mr. Regnier’s application for court appointed counsel is dismissed. [42] appreciate that Mr. Regnier will require some time in order to secure counsel or make arrangements to put in place financing arrangements with counsel, and, therefore, it is important to provide reasonable window of time for Mr. Regnier to start to make such arrangements. I, therefore, direct that Mr. Regnier’s pre-trial in this matter is to be scheduled for Friday, July 25, 2014 at 10:00 a.m., and direct that Mr. Regnier is to be personally present on that occasion unless he has retained counsel to represent him, in which case counsel may appear on his behalf. [43] In the normal course, at that pre-trial conference in terms of setting trial date, such trial, with the court’s current scheduling requirements, would be set for some months in the future in any event. The cumulative effect of the time frame from the date of this order through to the date of potential trial will also enable Mr. Regnier, if he so chooses, to attempt to make arrangements with counsel making periodic payments over the ensuing months towards his legal fees.

October 6, 2014 INTRODUCTION [1] There are two applications before the court. The respondent father has applied to reduce his child support obligation and to extinguish arrears of child support as result of him quitting his job and embarking on an apprenticeship program to become an electrician. The petitioner mother has applied to become the sole custodian parent of the parties’ two daughters. Both parties therefore seek to vary the existing court order regarding support and parenting. [2] The order involved is final order granted by Wilson J. at the conclusion of the pre-trial conference in this matter dated March 20, 2012. The claim for support was initially made in the Petition pursuant to The Family Maintenance Act, 1997, S.S. 1997, c. F-6.2. BACKGROUND FACTS [3] The parties have two children who are now eight and nine years of age. The children reside with the petitioner and the respondent is to have reasonable access on reasonable notice. It appears the respondent has not been exercising access and has had little involvement in the lives of the children. [4] At the time the order was granted the respondent was found to be earning $75,000 per year. He was working for Sysco in Regina in Senior Merchandising manager position. At the end of August 2013 he voluntarily terminated his employment. In his affidavit he indicated he left the job due to its high stress level which was causing health difficulties for him. At the initial return date of this motion the respondent was directed by the chambers judge to present appropriate medical evidence that the termination of his employment at Sysco was medically necessary. During oral submissions before me the respondent indicated he did not plan on filing any medical information and stated that he left his employment because he was “fed up”. There was no other explanation provided. [5] Following the termination of employment the respondent commenced work as an apprentice electrician with local electrical company. His hourly wage went from $36.50 to $14.00. He deposed that he was presently earning $29,000 year and any increases would be small for the next period of time. The respondent is presently 43 years of age. He is in excess of $10,000 in arrears of his support obligation. [6] The petitioner seeks sole custody of the two children because she is the only one providing for the children and is the only one parenting the children. She deposes that the respondent has essentially been an absentee father. The respondent provided no response to the petitioner’s allegations and declined to give any further information at the chambers hearing. The respondent did not appear to have any interest in the discussion on parenting. [7] As indicated, this final order for child support is sought to be varied pursuant to s. 10 of The Family Maintenance Act, 1997 in which there must be material change in circumstances to warrant variation of the child support provisions. The preliminary question is therefore whether voluntary change constitutes material change. For voluntary change to be material change it must be reasonable in the circumstances. There are number of decisions confirming this interpretation and refer to Wong v. Wong (1996), 1996 CanLII 7235 (SK QB), 150 Sask.R. 101, [1996] S.J. No. 695 (QL) (Sask.Q.B.); Tice v. Tice (1997), 1997 CanLII 11451 (SK QB), 153 Sask.R. 73, [1997] S.J. No. 32 (QL) (Sask.Q.B.); Kuzub v. Kuzub, 2002 SKQB 259 (CanLII), 220 Sask.R. 192; and McRann v. McRann, 2005 SKQB 207 (CanLII), 263 Sask.R. 139. [8] In Wong, Laing J. considered an application seeking to reduce child support as result of the applicant quitting his job and relocating to operate small auto repair shop. The applicant’s income decreased and he was struggling to build the repair shop business. The court refused to find the reduction in income to be material change in the circumstances as the change in employment was voluntary, was not reasonable and did not accurately reflect the applicant’s ability to earn income. [9] In Tice, Archambault J. dealt with an applicant who was employed as an electrician but voluntarily left his position to start his own business. As is the case here, the applicant in Tice did not apply for any other jobs prior to embarking on his new venture. In refusing to grant the request for variation the court stated: It is now well established law in this province that where parent voluntarily and without sufficient justification ceases his employment to continue education or for some other reason or to engage himself/herself in less lucrative employment, he/she will not be relieved of the obligation to continue supporting dependent children…(cites omitted) [10] In McRann, Wilkinson J. dealt with the father’s decision to change employment voluntarily. At para. she states: There is substantial case law stating that an unreasonable, self-induced income reduction is insufficient justification for varying child support order. [11] Wilkinson J. then goes on to explain the rationale behind the court’s insistence on any change in employment or income being reasonable from an objective viewpoint (at para. 9): Parents are entitled to make employment or career changes that may impact on their ability to pay support so long as the decision is reasonable at the time having regard to relevant considerations such as personal factors (the parent’s age, education, experience, skills, historical earning capacity, health considerations and the motivations behind the change) and external factors (standard of living experienced by the intact family, availability of work, mobility and freedom to relocate) The onus is upon the support payor to prove reasonableness… [12] In the case before me, the respondent was employed in position for considerable period of time and was earning good salary. As indicated, the respondent advised the court he needed to change his employment because he was fed up with the situation. He advised candidly that he did not apply for any other positions to continue earning the same or similar level of income. Instead, he decided to embark upon change in career with significant financial consequences to his children. [13] In the circumstances am unable to determine his decision to just terminate his employment was reasonable. The respondent has financial obligations to his children. While his position at Sysco may not have been working out to his satisfaction, he could have embarked upon job search to find something within the same pay range that would have suited his career aspirations. Failing that, he could have engaged in discussions with his employer to determine if something could be changed or altered to allow him to remain in his position. Failing all of that, he should have simply stayed put to allow him to satisfy his child support obligations. What was not reasonable decision was to just quit and expect the petitioner then to absorb greater financial burden for the children. [14] In the result, the respondent’s voluntary decision to significantly reduce his income is found to be insufficient grounds to vary his child support obligation. It is apparent he is capable of earning considerably higher income and has taken no steps to test the job market. Accordingly, the application to vary child support by the respondent is dismissed. The respondent’s decision was ill-conceived. have considered Tice like suspension of payments to allow the respondent to obtain appropriate remunerative employment. However, this does not appear to be an appropriate case for the court to exercise its discretion in this way. In light of the court’s decision, the respondent will need to take immediate steps to put himself back into position to provide for his child support payments. [15] The petitioner has brought an application to change the custody and access arrangements for the two girls. While it is apparent the respondent is less than an involved father, it does not appear that situation is new development in the relationship between the parties. It appears this application to vary was brought more out of frustration for the respondent’s lack of involvement than as result of any material change that has taken place. As a result, I am unable to find that there has been a material change in circumstances as required to vary the existing order, and the petitioner’s application in this regard is dismissed. [16] While there was an application brought by each of the parties, the application to vary the child support was the significant matter before me. The petitioner has been successful in opposing this application and accordingly is entitled to costs which fix in the amount of $200.00 payable forthwith.",c_2014skqb284.txt,"HELD: The court dismissed both applications.

Following the ""not guilty"" pleas both accused applied for an order pursuant to s. 24(2) of the Charter of Rights and Freedoms for exclusion of evidence consisting of a knapsack and its contents on the grounds that the knapsack and its contents were obtained in contravention of their rights to be secure from unreasonable search and seizure pursuant to s. 8 of the Charter, such that admission of this evidence would contravene their Charter rights.
THE FACTS On the voir dire the Crown called Constable Roger Jones, 1-year veteran in the Royal Canadian Mounted Police who was stationed in Prince Albert.
He testified that in the morning of February 21, 1994 he received radio call from the Rosthern Detachment advising him of theft of approximately $50.00 at Trappers Service in Duck Lake.
His assistance was required to intercept small light blue car with an out-of- province license plate with two native people in it travelling north toward Prince Albert.
He was advised that the driver had tatoos on the back of his hands and the other individual was intoxicated.
James Bell who advised him that he located the vehicle at approximately 9:45 a.m. Cst.
They approached apartment ""B"" and knocked on the door.
Jones said he heard someone say, ""Come in"".
He observed two children in the living room and woman standing at the top of the stairs.
Jones she said she knew the two men to see them only but did not know their names.
conclude therefore that apartment ""B"" was not the home of either of the two accused.
In response to another question the woman said that the two men had just arrived.
He told the accused that he was investigating theft of money from Trappers Service at Duck Lake and asked for their names.
The two officers read Floyd Laliberte his rights and gave him the warning.
went in calling out, ""It is the police"".
Jones said that about the same time when he was making his notes (he was not sure if it was before or after) he made up police report which shows that at 10:05 a.m. on February 21, 1994: arrived and we went to the door.
opened the door and shouted ""police"" when entered.
In the car were two natives who had numerous tatoos on their arms.
Bell located the car bearing British Columbia license number PCL 314.
He observed two natives fitting the descriptions given to him leave the car and enter the four-plex.
Jones arrived they knocked on the door and announced their presence as police.
Bell said that as they started going down the stairs after hand-cuffing the two accused he noticed an open knapsack full of cigarettes in plain view.
He said he had been transferred about year before to Prince Albert from Moosomin where they had been plagued with cigarette thefts.
He also admitted that he did not know if they were investigating theft or break and enter.
THE ISSUES Was there violation of the applicants' s. Charter rights and, if so, should the evidence of the leather knapsack and the cigarettes be excluded pursuant to s. 24(2) of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms?
(1) Anyone whose rights or freedoms, as guaranteed by this Charter, have been infringed or denied may apply to court of competent jurisdiction to obtain such remedy as the court considers appropriate and just in the circumstances.
The pertinent portions of s. 495 of the Criminal [450] (1) peace officer may arrest without warrant (a) person who has committed an indictable offence or who, on reasonable grounds, he believes has committed or is about to commit an indictable offence, (2) peace officer shall not arrest person without warrant for (a) an indictable offence mentioned in section 553, (b) an offence for which the person may be prosecuted by indictment or for which he is punishable on summary conviction, or (c) an offence punishable on summary conviction, in any case where (d) he believes on reasonable grounds that the public interest, having regard to all the circumstances including the need to (i) establish the identity of the person, (ii) secure or preserve evidence of or relating to the offence, or (iii) prevent the continuation or repetition of the offence or the commission of another offence, may be satisfied without so arresting the person, and (e) he has no reasonable grounds to believe that, if he does not so arrest the person, the person will fail to attend court in order to be dealt with according (3) Notwithstanding subsection (2), peace officer acting under subsection (1) is deemed to be acting lawfully and in the execution of his duty for the purposes of (a) any proceedings under this or any other Act of Parliament; and (b) any other proceedings, unless in any such proceedings it is alleged and established by the person making the allegation that the peace officer did not comply with the requirements of subsection (2).
(emphasis added) THE RIGHT TO ENTER PREMISES The accused bear the burden of persuading the Court that their Charter rights or freedoms have been violated or denied, once they have shown that the search was warrantless search.
(Chouinard, Lamer and Wilson J.J. concurring) stated at p. 13: peace officer making an arrest on private premises without warrant is in the execution of his or her duty for the purposes of s. 450(1)(a) of the Criminal Code if the criteria of that section and the standards enunciated in Eccles v. Bourque have been satisfied.
2.Has the person who is the subject of arrest committed the offence in question or does the peace officer, on reasonable and probable grounds, believe he or she has committed or is about to commit the offence in question?
3.Are there reasonable and probable grounds for the belief that the person sought is within the premises?
An affirmative answer to all of these questions will mean that the arrest is lawful.
Jones believed on reasonable grounds that the accused committed theft of approximately $50.00.
The punishment for theft where the value of what is stolen does not exceed five thousand dollars is set out in s. 334(b) of the Criminal Code as follows: [294] Except where otherwise provided by law, every one who commits (a) (b) is guilty (i) of an indictable offence and is liable to imprisonment for term not exceeding two years, or (ii) of an offence punishable on summary conviction, where the value of what is stolen does not exceed five thousand dollars.
dealt with the offence of criminal negligence in the operation of motor vehicle.
The offence of criminal negligence in the operation of motor vehicle may indeed be prosecuted by way of summary conviction.
But until the Crown should elect to proceed by that alternative route something that has not here occurred and indeed may never occur there is no ground for even thinking of the offence or the proceedings as other than indictable.
the court held that hybrid offences are deemed to be indictable until the Crown elects otherwise.
find that the offence of theft not exceeding $5,000.00 ""may"" be prosecuted by way of summary conviction but until the Crown elects to proceed in that manner the offence is deemed to be indictable.
Accordingly, the first question posed in R. v. Landry is answered in the affirmative.
Jones believed on reasonable and probable grounds that the accused had committed the offence in question.
Thus the second question posed in R. v. Landry is answered in the affirmative.
Upon enquiry he learned that they had entered apartment ""B"".
find that he had reasonable and probable grounds for the belief that the persons sought were within the premises.
The third question posed in R. v. Landry is answered in the affirmative.
Bell that before entering they knocked on the door and announced their presence as ""police"".
Jones is somewhat contradictory on the issue of whether anyone inside the premises said ""come in"" in response to the knock on the door, Sgt.
Bell testified that they were admitted into the apartment and the lady in the premises reacted favourably to their presence.
find that the officers made proper announcement before entering the premises.
The fourth question posed in R. v. Landry is answered in the affirmative.
Bell inadvertently found the knapsack and its contents which were in plain view.
He reasonably believed that the knapsack and the contents were evidence of a crime.
In so concluding have referred to number of decisions including R. v. Grenier (1991), 65 C.C.C.
I find that the search was authorized by law and the manner in which it was carried out was reasonable.
(as he then was) set out the three primary factors which should guide the consideration of Court in determining whether evidence should be excluded under s. 24(2) of the Charter.
The manner in which the search was conducted was neither abusive nor excessive.
On the contrary, the evidence was in plain view and was found inadvertently.
The admission of this evidence will not have an adverse effect upon the reputation of the administration of justice.","Following the 'not guilty' pleas, both accused applied for an order pursuant to s. 24(2) of the Charter of Rights and Freedoms for exclusion of evidence consisting of a knapsack and its contents on the grounds that the knapsack and its contents were obtained in contravention of their rights to be secure from unreasonable search and seizure pursuant to s.8 of the Charter.
HELD: The application to exclude evidence is denied.
1)The officers were lawfully present in the premises when Sergeant Bell inadvertently found the knapsack and its contents which were in plain view.
He reasonably believed that the knapsack and the contents were evidence of a crime.
Therefore it was neither unreasonable nor unlawful for him to seize these items.
The search was authorized by law and the manner in which it was carried out was reasonable.
2)Even if the accused's rights under s.8 of the Charter had been violated this would not be a proper case to exclude the evidence under s.24(2) of the Charter.
The fairness of the trial will not be affected by the admission of the evidence.

THE FACTS On the voir dire the Crown called Constable Roger Jones, 1-year veteran in the Royal Canadian Mounted Police who was stationed in Prince Albert. He testified that in the morning of February 21, 1994 he received radio call from the Rosthern Detachment advising him of theft of approximately $50.00 at Trappers Service in Duck Lake. His assistance was required to intercept small light blue car with an out-of- province license plate with two native people in it travelling north toward Prince Albert. He was advised that the driver had tatoos on the back of his hands and the other individual was intoxicated. He drove toward Duck Lake and met the Rosthern R.C.M.P. detachment officers. Assuming that the light blue vehicle had made it into Prince Albert, he radioed Sgt. James Bell who advised him that he located the vehicle at approximately 9:45 a.m. Cst. Jones met Sgt. Bell at 19th Street and 4th Avenue in Prince Albert at four-plex. They approached apartment ""B"" and knocked on the door. On examination-in-chief Cst. Jones said he heard someone say, ""Come in"". He announced that it was the police and walked in followed by Sgt. Bell. He observed two children in the living room and woman standing at the top of the stairs. The woman told them her name was Myrna Johnson and said she lived there. In response to question posed by Cst. Jones she said she knew the two men to see them only but did not know their names. conclude therefore that apartment ""B"" was not the home of either of the two accused. In response to another question the woman said that the two men had just arrived. He asked her if two fellows had come in. She said nothing but looked toward the kitchen at which time he saw the two accused sitting at the table with bottle of liquor and two glasses. Cst. Jones said that they fit the descriptions he had been given. He told the accused that he was investigating theft of money from Trappers Service at Duck Lake and asked for their names. There was no reply. He told them he thought they were responsible for the theft. Floyd Laliberte stood up and Cst. Jones grabbed his wrist. scuffle ensued. He and Sgt. Bell wrestled Floyd Laliberte to the floor. They arrested and hand-cuffed him. Floyd Laliberte refused to divulge his name and refused to willingly accompany the officers outside. During this time Walter Villebrun sat peacefully at the table. He accompanied the officers peacefully and was hand-cuffed. The two officers read Floyd Laliberte his rights and gave him the warning. They also advised him the reason for his arrest. Walter Villebrun was also read his rights and was given the warning. Both accused were searched for weapons. They found one $20.00 bill, two $10.00 bills, one $2.00 bill, one $1.00 bill in Floyd Laliberte's pocket. Walter Villebrun had some cassette tapes, hockey cards, black leather gloves and toque. On cross-examination Cst. Jones admitted that he made notes on the day in question which contain, inter alia, the following: We knocked on the door and rang the No answer. turned knob. It was unlocked. went in calling out, ""It is the police"". Saw couple of kids and Cst. Jones said that about the same time when he was making his notes (he was not sure if it was before or after) he made up police report which shows that at 10:05 a.m. on February 21, 1994: arrived and we went to the door. knocked and rang the door bell. thought heard ""come in"". opened the door and shouted ""police"" when entered. saw couple of kids and woman. went up the stairs to the kitchen. Sgt. Bell went to the basement. Sgt. James Bell, 32-year veteran with the R.C.M.P., testified that he was informed by Cst. Jones that he was going out toward Rosthern to assist the Rosthern Detachment in connection with theft at Trappers Service in Duck Lake. Sgt. Bell left to assist Cst. Jones in intercepting small blue car with an out-of-Province license. In the car were two natives who had numerous tatoos on their arms. When he realized that he missed the car he returned to Prince Albert. He stopped at Shell service station where he learned that car fitting the description with two natives fitting the descriptions had been there. At 395 19th Street and 4th Avenue, Sgt. Bell located the car bearing British Columbia license number PCL 314. He observed two natives fitting the descriptions given to him leave the car and enter the four-plex. Sgt. Bell asked tenant if two individuals had gone into his suite which was suite ""A"". The tenant replied, ""No, into apartment `B' "". When Cst. Jones arrived they knocked on the door and announced their presence as police. Sgt. Bell said that they were admitted into the apartment. According to him the lady reacted favourably to their presence. Sgt. Bell confirmed much of Cst. Jones' testimony. However, Sgt. Bell said that as they started going down the stairs after hand-cuffing the two accused he noticed an open knapsack full of cigarettes in plain view. He said he had been transferred about year before to Prince Albert from Moosomin where they had been plagued with cigarette thefts. Accordingly, he assumed the cigarettes were stolen because of the quantity and because of the various brands: cartons of Export packs of Rothmans King Size packs of Players Filter packs of Players Light packs of Players Extra Light pack of Players King Size Extra Light. Sgt. Bell asked the woman if they were hers and she answered, ""No, or something to that effect"". Sgt. Bell seized the leather knapsack and the cigarettes. On cross-examination Sgt. Bell said he did not hear what was said from inside apartment ""B"" after they rang the doorbell because he has trouble hearing at the best of times. He also admitted that he did not know if they were investigating theft or break and enter. THE ISSUES Was there violation of the applicants' s. Charter rights and, if so, should the evidence of the leather knapsack and the cigarettes be excluded pursuant to s. 24(2) of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms? THE LAW Sections and 24 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms read: 8. Everyone has the right to be secure against unreasonable search or seizure. (1) Anyone whose rights or freedoms, as guaranteed by this Charter, have been infringed or denied may apply to court of competent jurisdiction to obtain such remedy as the court considers appropriate and just in the circumstances. (2) Where, in proceedings under subsection (1), court concludes that evidence was obtained in manner that infringed or denied any rights or freedoms guaranteed by this Charter, the evidence shall be excluded if it is established that, having regard to all the circumstances, the admission of it in the proceedings would bring the administration of justice into disrepute. The pertinent portions of s. 495 of the Criminal [450] (1) peace officer may arrest without warrant (a) person who has committed an indictable offence or who, on reasonable grounds, he believes has committed or is about to commit an indictable offence, (2) peace officer shall not arrest person without warrant for (a) an indictable offence mentioned in section 553, (b) an offence for which the person may be prosecuted by indictment or for which he is punishable on summary conviction, or (c) an offence punishable on summary conviction, in any case where (d) he believes on reasonable grounds that the public interest, having regard to all the circumstances including the need to (i) establish the identity of the person, (ii) secure or preserve evidence of or relating to the offence, or (iii) prevent the continuation or repetition of the offence or the commission of another offence, may be satisfied without so arresting the person, and (e) he has no reasonable grounds to believe that, if he does not so arrest the person, the person will fail to attend court in order to be dealt with according (3) Notwithstanding subsection (2), peace officer acting under subsection (1) is deemed to be acting lawfully and in the execution of his duty for the purposes of (a) any proceedings under this or any other Act of Parliament; and (b) any other proceedings, unless in any such proceedings it is alleged and established by the person making the allegation that the peace officer did not comply with the requirements of subsection (2). (emphasis added) THE RIGHT TO ENTER PREMISES The accused bear the burden of persuading the Court that their Charter rights or freedoms have been violated or denied, once they have shown that the search was warrantless search. The Crown has the burden of showing, on balance of probabilities, that the search was reasonable. See: Collins v. The Queen (1987), 1987 CanLII 84 (SCC), 33 C.C.C. (3d) (S.C.C.). In R. v. Landry (1986), 1986 CanLII 48 (SCC), 25 C.C.C. (3d) (S.C.C.) Dickson C.J.C. (Chouinard, Lamer and Wilson J.J. concurring) stated at p. 13: peace officer making an arrest on private premises without warrant is in the execution of his or her duty for the purposes of s. 450(1)(a) of the Criminal Code if the criteria of that section and the standards enunciated in Eccles v. Bourque have been satisfied. The proper questions to be asked are: 1. Is the offence in question indictable? 2.Has the person who is the subject of arrest committed the offence in question or does the peace officer, on reasonable and probable grounds, believe he or she has committed or is about to commit the offence in question? 3.Are there reasonable and probable grounds for the belief that the person sought is within the premises? 4.Was proper announcement made before entry? An affirmative answer to all of these questions will mean that the arrest is lawful. find that Cst. Jones believed on reasonable grounds that the accused committed theft of approximately $50.00. The punishment for theft where the value of what is stolen does not exceed five thousand dollars is set out in s. 334(b) of the Criminal Code as follows: [294] Except where otherwise provided by law, every one who commits (a) (b) is guilty (i) of an indictable offence and is liable to imprisonment for term not exceeding two years, or (ii) of an offence punishable on summary conviction, where the value of what is stolen does not exceed five thousand dollars. The offence in question may be prosecuted either as an indictable offence or as an offence punishable on summary conviction. Section 34(1)(a) of the Interpretation Act, R.S.C. 1985, c. I-23 reads: (1) Where an enactment creates an offence, (a) the offence is deemed to be an indictable offence if the enactment provides that the offender may be prosecuted for the offence by indictment. (emphasis added) In Re Monkman and The Queen (1975), 26 C.C.C. (2d) 73 (Man. C.A.), Freedman, C.J.M. dealt with the offence of criminal negligence in the operation of motor vehicle. Section 233(1) of the Criminal Code read: 233(1) Every one who is criminally negligent in the operation of motor vehicle is guilty of (a)an indictable offence and is liable to imprisonment for five years, or (b)an offence punishable on summary conviction. Although s. 233(1) did not state that the offence ""may"" be prosecuted by indictment Mr. Justice Freedman held that it fell within s. 27(1)(a) of the Interpretation Act, R.S.C. 1970, c. I-23, which section is identical to s. 34(1)(a). He held that it was an indictable offence and stated at p. 78: We must keep in mind the distinction between the nature of an offence and the nature of the proceedings to enforce an offence. The offence of criminal negligence in the operation of motor vehicle may indeed be prosecuted by way of summary conviction. But until the Crown should elect to proceed by that alternative route something that has not here occurred and indeed may never occur there is no ground for even thinking of the offence or the proceedings as other than indictable. In R. v. Huff (1979), 1979 ABCA 234 (CanLII), 50 C.C.C. (2d) 324 (Alta. C.A.) the court held that hybrid offences are deemed to be indictable until the Crown elects otherwise. See also Regina v. Toor (1973), 1973 CanLII 1376 (BC SC), 11 C.C.C. (2d) 312 (B.C.S.C.). find that the offence of theft not exceeding $5,000.00 ""may"" be prosecuted by way of summary conviction but until the Crown elects to proceed in that manner the offence is deemed to be indictable. Accordingly, the first question posed in R. v. Landry is answered in the affirmative. find that Cst. Jones believed on reasonable and probable grounds that the accused had committed the offence in question. Thus the second question posed in R. v. Landry is answered in the affirmative. Sgt. Bell saw the two accused enter the four-plex. Upon enquiry he learned that they had entered apartment ""B"". find that he had reasonable and probable grounds for the belief that the persons sought were within the premises. The third question posed in R. v. Landry is answered in the affirmative. accept the evidence of Cst. Jones and Sgt. Bell that before entering they knocked on the door and announced their presence as ""police"". Although the evidence of Cst. Jones is somewhat contradictory on the issue of whether anyone inside the premises said ""come in"" in response to the knock on the door, Sgt. Bell testified that they were admitted into the apartment and the lady in the premises reacted favourably to their presence. find that the officers made proper announcement before entering the premises. The fourth question posed in R. v. Landry is answered in the affirmative. I conclude the officers were lawfully present in thepremises when Sgt. Bell inadvertently found the knapsack andits contents which were in plain view. He reasonably believedthat the knapsack and the contents were evidence of a crime. Therefore it was neither unreasonable nor unlawful for him toseize these items. In so concluding have referred to number of decisions including R. v. Grenier (1991), 65 C.C.C. (3d) 76 (Que. C.A.), and R. v. Nielsen (1988), 43 C.C.C. (3d) 548 (Sask. C.A.). I find that the search was authorized by law and themanner in which it was carried out was reasonable. In R. v. Silveira, 1995 CanLII 89 (SCC), [1995] S.C.R. 297, case dealing with warrantless search, Mr. Justice Cory delivered the majority decision. At p. 366 there is the following: Factors to be Taken into Account in Consideration of s. 24(2) of the Charter In Collins, supra, at p. 284 and p. 288, Lamer J. (as he then was) set out the three primary factors which should guide the consideration of Court in determining whether evidence should be excluded under s. 24(2) of the Charter. These are: (a) does the admission of the evidence affect the fairness of the trial, (b) how serious was the Charter breach, and (c) what would be the effect on the system's repute of excluding the evidence. Even if the accused's rights under s. 8 of theCharter had been violated this would not be a proper case toexclude the evidence under s. 24(2) of the Charter. Thefairness of the trial will not be affected by the admission ofthe evidence. The manner in which the search was conductedwas neither abusive nor excessive. On the contrary, theevidence was in plain view and was found inadvertently. The evidence is real and tangible. The admission of this evidencewill not have an adverse effect upon the reputation of theadministration of justice. The application to exclude evidence is denied.",d_1995canlii6019.txt,"Following the 'not guilty' pleas, both accused applied for an order pursuant to s. 24(2) of the Charter of Rights and Freedoms for exclusion of evidence consisting of a knapsack and its contents on the grounds that the knapsack and its contents were obtained in contravention of their rights to be secure from unreasonable search and seizure pursuant to s.8 of the Charter.

831,"ABM sold and serviced cash registers and point of sale equipment which includes device used in many supermarkets and other businesses to scan the price code of an article.
He faxed Shannon the 1988 audited year end financial statements of ABM, together with business plan prepared by Collins Barrow.
The pressure was on the parties to move quickly in view of the fact that Lloyd's Bank expected its outstanding loan of $947,000 to be paid by January 31,1989.
Prior to closing the transaction, he was aware that the company was in some degree of financial difficulty and that about $80,000 was required for inventory purposes to complete various contracts.
However, the company had potential arising out of its customer list and the large amount of point of sale business it carried on in Atlantic Canada.
This would have an impact upon the future payments of the purchase price to be made by Shannon during an earn out period provided for in the agreement.
In addition to the purchase price of the shares, Shannon was immediately obliged to make further payments so that the operation of ABM could continue.
He said he could have considered cutting ABM off and ""taking the hit and trying to recover from financial point of view"".
Collins Barrow continued as auditor for ABM and prepared the audited financial statements for the year ending October 31, 1989.
Although Shannon was successful in turning ABM into profitable operation under his new and restructured management, he claimed that as result of his reliance on the audited statements of Collins Barrow, he suffered loss because of their negligence in preparing the statements knowing that Shannon relied upon the information therein in deciding whether or not to purchase ABM.
Collins Barrow accepts the following findings of fact by the trial judge: (a) The financial statements for the year ending October 31, 1988 were negligently prepared by Collins Barrow.
(b) Shannon relied upon the audited financial statements in making his decision to acquire the shares of ABM.
(c) Shannon would not have purchased the shares of ABM had he known the true state of affairs.
Collins Barrow raises the following issues: (1) Did the trial judge apply the correct test in assessing the direct damages?
The trial judge then addressed what he referred to as ""consequential damages"" suffered by Shannon as result of the misstatement.
at p. 21: The parties agreed at trial that had Mr. Solway told the clients about the option, they would not have purchased the property.
The second approach was on the assumption that it was unlikely that Shannon could have recognized the extent of the difficulties with ABM's balance sheet at the transaction date.
He said: am also satisfied that he did not become aware of the company's real financial situation until several months had elapsed.
By that time he had undertaken significant personal obligations and had used substantial additional funds at considerable risk.
However, they had acquired such confidence in him and in his management teams that he was able to obtain financing for new ventures.
This distinction affects the assessment of damages in the most common case of misrepresentation: namely, where seller represents that the subject-matter of contract has quality which in fact it lacks.
Collins Barrow submits that the proper method of calculating the damages is the purchase price less the market value of the company at the date of acquisition.
I agree with Collins Barrow that the trial judge has measured the loss on the footing that Shannon should be put in the position he would be had the financial statements of ABM been correct.
The trial judge found that Shannon never would have purchased ABM had he known the true financial condition of the company.
have spent four years of my life in wasted endeavour without reward: and it will take me some time to re-establish myself.""
You should look into the future so as to forecast what would have been likely to happen if he had never entered into this contract: and contrast it with his position as it is now as result of entering into it.
It was only in the fall of 1989 that Shannon began to become aware of the extent of the difficulties with ABM and the role played by the financial statements in drawing him into this unwanted bargain.
Keough's second calculation and the evidence on which it is based furnishes basis for assessment of damages by the application of tort principles.
Although this approach is not perfect, am prepared to accept it as establishing on balance of probabilities the loss sustained as result of the misrepresentations which led Shannon to purchase ABM.
The trial judge said that his assessment of $1,800,000 took into account what he referred to as all of the liabilities the respondent was forced to incur in order to maintain the company's operations, the risks to his reputation and the equity, time and energy devoted by him and his senior executives to maintain the company's existence.
Given his successful track record, it was urged that Shannon would have earned reasonable return on such other ventures.
Similarly, when mistaken certificate from local authority led prospective purchaser to believe that the land was zoned for subdivision, his damages were assessed on the basis of its lesser value (plus conveyancing costs) but not including profits from any subdivision.
In case of promise by seller that the property yielded certain return, the promisee's recovery (in contract) will be measured by the expected gains, whereas in tort for misrepresentation it would by the (usually lesser) return of an alternative investment.
When he analyzed the financial information he had received from Collins Barrow and prepared his own calculations, Shannon was satisfied that ABM would give him this type of return.
In addressing what would have been likely to happen had Shannon not purchased ABM, the trial judge accepted Shannon's proposition that he looked for 20% return on his investment in purchasing business.
He thought contingency factor should be applied to reduce Shannon's expectation in as much as in acquiring ABM he was entering into new field of business about which he knew little.
The trial judge continued: The best consideration can give to the evidence suggests that 15 percent per year return would be reasonable yield on the Plaintiff’s investment.
There was no evidence that the effort spent in dealing with ABM deprived him of financial or other resources which would enable him to seize an opportunity.
The failure to put this discovery evidence to Shannon on cross-examination may well be criticized from tactical point of view.
At the very least, such failure would clearly give Shannon's counsel an opportunity to deal with the subject on rebuttal.
Applying the test laid down by Fleming, Shannon has not shown that as result of buying ABM he ""forwent an opportunity to purchase elsewhere"" lucrative business.
Another concern with the trial judge's award is that it compensates for supposed loss of opportunities over seven year period.
Because have concluded that it would have been reasonable for Shannon to cut his losses in the fall of 1989, the amount to be awarded should reflect compensation for wasted efforts prior to that time only.
am prepared to accept the challenge thrown out by Lord Denning of making an estimate ""in similar way as the loss due to personal injury"".
The trial judge found that Shannon was forced to incur greater liabilities than he anticipated in order to maintain the company.
Giving the matter the best consideration can, an award of $50,000 general damages for disruption and inconvenience would be appropriate.
CONTRIBUTORY NEGLIGENCE: Collins Barrow submits that contributory negligence and apportionment may be utilized in negligent misrepresentation cases and cites various authorities for this proposition.
Collins Barrow submits here that the reliance was unreasonable because, ""the plaintiff himself was person who had some degree of expert knowledge or perhaps knows as much as the defendant"".
It is submitted that he was negligent in failing to discover the inventory overstatement and consequently the respondents own conduct contributed to any losses suffered.
It is said that if Eldridge did not possess the requisite skill to carry out due diligence investigation, it was in Shannon's economic interest to retain someone who did.
Shannon's people knew that ABM was in some degree of difficulty in view of the requirement of Lloyd's Bank that it be paid out by the end of January and in view of their knowledge that some $80,000 in inventory purchases were required in order to complete contracts, that the serviceable equipment had no value and that the amount of inventory write-down on monthly basis was not adequate and that there would be cash shortfall of $250,000 to be made up in the immediate future.
am satisfied that every step taken by Eldridge and his people was thorough and appropriate and his due diligence investigation was in no way deficient.
It must be remembered that in testing the conduct of Collins Barrow and that of Eldridge respectively, the former had great advantages in determining what was the true picture of ABM.
MITIGATION: In the course of the argument, counsel for Collins Barrow referred to the finding that Shannon would not have purchased ABM had he known the true picture.
to three rules concerning avoiding the consequences of wrong: (a) The plaintiff must take all reasonable steps to mitigate the loss to him resulting from the defendant's wrong and cannot recover for loss that could have been avoided by taking such steps.
He put the rule thus: ""When in the course of his business he [the plaintiff] has taken action arising out of the transaction, which action has diminished his loss, the effect in actual diminution of the loss he has suffered may be taken into account even though there was no duty on him to act.""
Later in his speech he said similarly: ""Provided the course taken to protect himself by the plaintiff in such an action was one which reasonable and prudent person might in the ordinary conduct of business properly have taken, and in fact did take whether bound to or not, jury or an arbitrator may properly look at the whole of the facts and ascertain the result in estimating the quantum of damage.""
The Andros Springs started on the 7-year charter (at high rate) 100 days earlier than she would have done if there had been no collision.
McGregor states in paragraph 335 with respect to action taken by plaintiff: The matter is not well worked out in the authorities and all that can be done is to sketch what the law probably is.
He says: After the defendant's wrong, the plaintiff continues to engage in the ordinary transactions of business; some of these will turn out to be profitable.
In that altered state of affairs, the plaintiff enters into profitable transaction which could not have been entered into in exactly the same form if events had been unaltered by the defendant's wrong.
profitable purchase of shares or goods would usually be treated as collateral because usually it could have been made even if the wrong had not been done It is clear from these passages that while the rule is easy to state and difficult to apply, it is left to court in making the judgment call whether subsequent profit earned by plaintiff is ""completely collateral"" to the defendant's wrongdoing.
In my view, Shannon's decision to stay with the company and attempt to turn it around was an intervening event which put an end to the chain of causation connecting the negligence of Collins Barrow with the losses suffered by Shannon.
have already measured Shannon's direct loss on the basis of what he would have suffered had he wound up the company at the end of the fiscal period ending October 31, 1989.
The subsequent steps taken by Shannon and his resulting success were intervening or collateral events which should not be credited to Collins Barrow by way of mitigation.
Had Shannon gone on to incur more extensive losses in his attempt to turn the company around, it is unlikely that the expenses so incurred could fall within the second rule of mitigation.
Collins Barrow could probably be heard to say that he should have cut his losses when he saw the situation shortly after October 31, 1989.
Collins Barrow is not entitled to an offset against the damages for the subsequent success attained by Shannon after he had channeled the company into an entirely new operation.
On the basis have adopted, am satisfied that prejudgment interest at the rate of 8% should be applied to the sum of $1,760,000 over period of seven years.
Collins Barrow submitted that the trial judge failed to consider that loans were being repaid thereby reducing the amount upon which prejudgment interest should be awarded.
have taken these uncertainties into account in fixing the sum for consequential damages at $50,000 and for that reason see no need to further reduce prejudgment interest.
Accordingly, prejudgment interest should be allowed at 8% for seven years for an amount of $985,600.
Shannon should also recover his costs at trial fixed by the application of Scale of the Tariffs to the amount involved which fix at $1,760,000.
would delay issuing the order in this matter for two weeks in the event that there are circumstances relevant to the issue of costs of which this Court is not aware.","This was an appeal from an assessment of $5,454,000 in damages resulting from the appellant's liability to the respondent in tort for negligently prepared financial statements upon which the respondent relied in deciding to purchase the shares of a business.
The appellants appealed.
They argued that the trial judge, by measuring the respondent's loss on the basis that he should be put in the position he would have been if the financial statements had been accurate, had applied the wrong test.
Allowing the appeal reducing the damage award to $2,745,600,
that the trial judge erred in the test he applied to the award of damages.
The proper test is to put the respondent as far as possible in the position he would have been in if he had not invested in the company.
The damages are the amount by which the actual value of the company was less than what the respondent paid at the time of purchase.",474,"J. C.A. No. 126716 NOVA SCOTIA COURT OF APPEAL Chipman, Hart and Pugsley, JJ.A. BETWEEN: COLLINS BARROW and 1874000 NOVA SCOTIA LIMITED and JOSEPH P. SHANNON Respondents Steven Stieber and Michael J. Wood for the Appellant George W. MacDonald, Q.C.and Michelle C. Awad for the Respondents Appeal Heard: January 29, 1997 Judgment Delivered: April 21, 1997 THE COURT: The appeal is allowed in part as per reasons for judgment of Chipman, J.A.; Hart and Pugsley, JJ.A., concurring. CHIPMAN, J.A.: This is an appeal from an assessment of damages flowing from the appellant's liability to the respondent in tort for negligently prepared financial statements upon which the respondent relied in deciding to purchase the shares of a business. The appellant is firm of chartered accountants. The respondent Shannon is businessman living in Port Hawkesbury and the respondent numbered company is owned by him and was the vehicle used by him to acquire the shares of Action Business Machines Limited (ABM). will use the name ""Shannon"" to refer to both or either of the respondents as the context requires. ABM sold and serviced cash registers and point of sale equipment which includes device used in many supermarkets and other businesses to scan the price code of an article. The company was incorporated in 1974 by Timothy Adams under the name Maritime Cash Register. It sold equipment and entered into maintenance contracts for such equipment. It required large inventory of parts. As well, it carried out research into, and development of, market software packages for use in its machines. ABM had done very well in the Atlantic Provinces but it fared poorly when it expanded its business into Ontario. By the late 1980's, it was experiencing severe cash flow problems. Collins Barrow was engaged as auditor for ABM in 1987. It prepared audited statements for the years ending October 31, 1987 and 1988. ABM's banker, Lloyds Bank, notified ABM that it must make other banking arrangements by the end of January, 1989, failing which the Bank was prepared to have receiver appointed. In late 1988 and early 1989, William Moore, partner in Collins Barrow, made various unsuccessful attempts to secure new financing for ABM. On January 28, 1989, Moore approached Gordon Neal, senior officer in Shannon's business organization in an effort to interest Shannon in the purchase of ABM. Shannon indicated to Neal that he was not interested and Neal relayed the information to Moore. On January 30, 1989, Moore contacted Shannon directly and provided additional information about ABM. He faxed Shannon the 1988 audited year end financial statements of ABM, together with business plan prepared by Collins Barrow. Moore expressed optimism for the future of ABM. The pressure was on the parties to move quickly in view of the fact that Lloyd's Bank expected its outstanding loan of $947,000 to be paid by January 31,1989. Shannon knew this, and he also knew that ABM's venture in Ontario had been unsuccessful, resulting in large losses. In less than week, Shannon concluded an agreement with Adams whereby Shannon's holding company would purchase the shares of ABM from Adams' holding company. In reaching his decision to buy, Shannon relied on the audited statements provided by ABM's auditor, Collins Barrow. The closing took place on February 16, 1989. Prior to the closing, Shannon arranged to have Keith Eldridge carry out due diligence investigations. Eldridge was registered industrial accountant. He was fully familiar with financial statements and auditor's reports. He reviewed ABM's financial statements and addressed his mind to whether the inventory that had been counted and audited on October 31, 1988, would be useful to Shannon. He was in contact with Shannon on regular basis during his investigations. He prepared checklist of items he reviewed as part of the due diligence process. Prior to closing the transaction, he was aware that the company was in some degree of financial difficulty and that about $80,000 was required for inventory purposes to complete various contracts. Eldridge knew that there would be an expected cash shortfall of $250,000 or thereabouts which Shannon would have to make up shortly after he had acquired the company. However, the company had potential arising out of its customer list and the large amount of point of sale business it carried on in Atlantic Canada. lengthy meeting was held on February 15 and 16 between Adams' team and Shannon's team. Shannon kept in touch with his people. provision was put into the purchase agreement that physical count of inventory would be conducted on or about February 28, 1989 and October 31, 1990. The two counts would be compared and adjustment made to both saleable and serviceable inventory. This would have an impact upon the future payments of the purchase price to be made by Shannon during an earn out period provided for in the agreement. The closing took place on February 16, 1989. Shannon acquired the shares of ABM for $700,000. Of this amount, $200,000 was paid on or before closing and the remaining $500,000 was to be paid out of future cash flow of ABM. No portion of the $500,000 has ever been paid. In addition to the purchase price of the shares, Shannon was immediately obliged to make further payments so that the operation of ABM could continue. He paid out the Lloyd's Bank debt of approximately $947,000, and an overdraft of about $50,000, obtaining the funds by way of loan for which he had to provide personal guarantees to the Bank of Nova Scotia and Roynat Limited, the institutions which had agreed to, provide the financing. Shannon also provided an infusion of cash into ABM, obtained by way of loan from the Bank of Nova Scotia. Cash flow problems were experienced by Shannon and his team in the operation of ABM. In Shannon's words the company ""started to deteriorate"" after he took it over. There were losses. On the plus side, Shannon and his team developed contacts with suppliers and customers. By October, 1989, he had put in far more money than he had planned. He said he could have considered cutting ABM off and ""taking the hit and trying to recover from financial point of view"". While preparing the audit for the October 31, 1989 statements, Collins Barrow wanted to take substantial write down in inventory. They also wanted to be paid before giving Shannon the financial statements. This concerned and irritated Shannon. By February of 1990 he consulted counsel with respect to Collins Barrow's work. Collins Barrow continued as auditor for ABM and prepared the audited financial statements for the year ending October 31, 1989. These are dated January 23, 1990. Deloitte Touche became the auditor for ABM for the year ending October 31, 1990. That firm was also retained to provide advice to Shannon about potential claim against Collins Barrow. Deloitte Touche wrote down inventory by $1,800,000 and determined that most of this should apply back to the October 31, 1987, audited financial statements. Deferred development costs which were also listed as an asset in those statements in the amount of $165,202 were also written off. Rick MacCormick was dismissed by Shannon as General Manager in May of 1990. He was replaced by Brent Smith. By the end of 1991 ABM, under Shannon's able management, had been turned around, and showed net earnings of $755,000. Loans made to ABM by Atlantic Corporation, Shannon's management company, will eventually be paid off, personal guarantees of Shannon and his company will not be called and the money borrowed by ABM from Roynat and the Bank of Nova Scotia which was guaranteed by Shannon is being repaid. Shannon testified that the company is now profitable because it was capitalized and managed properly and the direction was changed. It does not operate as single company but has been fragmented into three separate components, each of which is operated by separate company. Gordon Neal attributes ABM's success to strategic decisions recognizing new markets, developing new products, taking risks, making investments, pumping in large amounts of time and energy. The introduction of the G.S.T. brought about new business opportunities. All of these things had been done by the Shannon organization and have brought about the turn around of the company. Although Shannon was successful in turning ABM into profitable operation under his new and restructured management, he claimed that as result of his reliance on the audited statements of Collins Barrow, he suffered loss because of their negligence in preparing the statements knowing that Shannon relied upon the information therein in deciding whether or not to purchase ABM. Proceedings were brought by Shannon in the Supreme Court against Collins Barrow and Timothy Adams on January 10, 1992. They were continued against Collins Barrow only. The trial was held in Supreme Court for 12 days in October of 1995 and by decision dated January 31, 1996, the trial judge awarded the respondents: Direct damages $200,000 Consequential damages $1,800,000 Damages for lost return on alternate investment of $2,000,000 at 10% per year for years $1,400,000 Prejudgment interest on $3,400,000 at 8% per year for years $1,904,000 Costs 150,000 Total: $5,454,000 Collins Barrow appeals to this Court claiming that the trial judge erred in a number of respects in arriving at his award of damages. Collins Barrow accepts the following findings of fact by the trial judge: (a) The financial statements for the year ending October 31, 1988 were negligently prepared by Collins Barrow. (b) Shannon relied upon the audited financial statements in making his decision to acquire the shares of ABM. (c) Shannon would not have purchased the shares of ABM had he known the true state of affairs. (d) It was reasonable for Shannon to rely upon the audited financial statements. (e) Collins Barrow was aware that Shannon would be relying upon the audited financial statements. Collins Barrow raises the following issues: (1) Did the trial judge apply the correct test in assessing the direct damages? (2) Did the respondents suffer any consequential loss and, if so, was it caused by the over valuation of the inventory of ABM? (3) Were the respondents contributorily negligent? (4) Did Shannon mitigate his damages with the result that Collins Barrow should get credit? (5) Should the respondents be awarded prejudgment interest upon each of the three components of damages awarded, i.e. direct damages, consequential damages and return on lost investment opportunities for seven years? 1. CORRECT TEST IN ASSESSING DIRECT DAMAGES: We must keep in mind the finding of the trial judge, stated by him more than once, that had Shannon known the true state of ABM's financial condition, he never would have bought the company. As to ""direct damages"", the trial judge found that, ""but for the misrepresentation by Collins Barrow, Shannon would never have entered into the contract which resulted in his damages"". He therefore awarded, by way of direct damages, the amount of $200,000 which Shannon paid over to Adams at the closing. The trial judge then addressed what he referred to as ""consequential damages"" suffered by Shannon as result of the misstatement. He accepted the calculation by Deloitte Touche as to the overstatement of the inventory and the deferred development costs. These totaled approximately $2,000,000. The trial judge then continued: Having approved those investigations and actions taken, share Glen Williams' conclusion that while the exact amount of the misstatement at October 31, 1988 is not precisely determinable, it is perfectly reasonable to conclude that the financial statements were misstated by Collins Barrow and the amount of their misstatement was significant. On the witness stand he was prepared to say that it ""approached $1.8 Million"". The bases described by Williams in coming to that opinion were reasonable. The trial judge then said that it would be impossible for Shannon to establish with precision the exact extent of his loss. Any measure of his damages is, he said, admittedly difficult. agree fully with these observations. As Doherty, J.A. said in Toronto Industrial Leaseholds Limited v. Posesorski et al. (1994), 1994 CanLII 7199 (ON CA), 21 O.R. (3d) (Ont. C.A.) at p. 21: The parties agreed at trial that had Mr. Solway told the clients about the option, they would not have purchased the property. Perfect restitution would therefore appear to require notional undoing of the transaction some ten years after it was completed, coupled with an attempt to determine the net benefit or loss suffered by the clients as result of entering into the transaction. Sometimes the evidence permits relatively accurate reconstruction of events on the assumption that certain things would or would not have occurred had there been no breach (see, e.g., Semelhago v. Paramadevan (1994), 1994 CanLII 1194 (ON CA), 19 O. R. (3d) 479, 39 R.P.R. (2d) 215 (C.A.)). In this case, it is impossible to perform that reconstruction. There are too many variables, many of which were not addressed in the evidence, presumably because the parties were satisfied that an attempt to unravel the transaction and establish the clients' position on the assumption that the transaction had not occurred was so complicated as to defy performance. Absent the ability to make perfect restitution, court, in assessing damages, must do the best it can The trial judge referred to the testimony of Brian E. Keough, whose report pegged Shannon's losses at between $1.6 and $1.8 million, excluding prejudgment interest and costs. In addressing Shannon's loss, Mr. Keough adopted two approaches. The first was measurement of his loss on the transaction date, February 16, 1989. By comparing the Collins Barrow financial statements with the adjusted statements prepared by Deloitte Touche he concluded that in the context of ABM as going business, Shannon's loss was approximately $1.8 million. This, he said, was the amount that would have to be restored to ABM to put it (and therefore Shannon's investment) in the same financial position as it would have been, had no adjustments been required to the acquisition day balance sheet. The second approach was on the assumption that it was unlikely that Shannon could have recognized the extent of the difficulties with ABM's balance sheet at the transaction date. Therefore the same valuation analysis should be made at the first fiscal year end subsequent to the purchase. Based on liquidation value at October 31, 1989, Keough determined Shannon's loss on the footing that he then decided to cut his losses and wind up the company. Viewed in the context of liquidation, Keough concluded that Shannon's losses would have been in the range of $1.6 to $1.8 million had he wound up ABM on October 31, 1989. The trial judge did not adopt the second approach. He said: am also satisfied that he did not become aware of the company's real financial situation until several months had elapsed. By that time he had undertaken significant personal obligations and had used substantial additional funds at considerable risk. Consequently he cannot be placed in his original position merely by returning the purchase price. The trial judge concluded that the first approach was to be preferred, as it looked at the company as going concern on the transaction date rather than assuming liquidation at future date. Shannon did not, in fact, liquidate. The trial judge referred to the effort and money Shannon put into ABM. By October of 1989 he had injected $800,000 from his own company, Atlantic Corporation Limited, into ABM. He had made commitments to people. He had made contacts with key suppliers and customers of ABM. His reputation was exceedingly important to him, not only in terms of self-respect, but in his ability to raise funds. Over the years he had diversified in business and at first bankers were reluctant to support him when he entered new field. However, they had acquired such confidence in him and in his management teams that he was able to obtain financing for new ventures. He simply could not walk away. He did not walk away, and after much effort he managed to turn ABM around. As at the end of 1991 the company showed net earnings of $755,000. The trial judge concluded: Having found that the calculations determined by Deloitte Touche in its adjusted balance sheet were accurate, and that the decisions taken by ABM's management in allocating those adjustments to 1990, 1989 and 1988 were appropriate, and after applying the evidence of both Williams and Keough, find that the fairest and most accurate measure of the consequential damages suffered by the Plaintiff as result of the Defendant's negligence is $1.8 Million. This takes into account all of the liabilities he was forced to incur in order to maintain the company's operations, the risks to his reputation, and the equity and time and energy devoted by him and the senior executives to maintain the company's existence. The award of direct damages was $200,000 and that of consequential damages $1,800,000, for total of $2,000,000. Collins Barrow says that the trial judge's approach was erroneous. It was an approach designed to put Shannon in the position in which he would be had the financial statements correctly stated ABM's financial condition the test for measuring damages for breach of contractual warranty. The test to be applied for damages in tort is the amount of the overpayment, that is, the difference between the price paid and the market value of the shares at the time of the purchase. G. H. Treitel, The Law of Contract, Ninth Edition, states the position: Liability for misrepresentation may arise in tort (where the representation is made fraudulently or negligently) or in contract (where the representation has contractual force). This distinction affects the assessment of damages in the most common case of misrepresentation: namely, where seller represents that the subject-matter of contract has quality which in fact it lacks. The general principle is that in tort the plaintiff is entitled to such damages as will put him into the position in which he would have been if the tort had not been committed; while in contract he is entitled to be put into the position in which he would have been if the contract had been performed. It is thought to follow that in tort the plaintiff is entitled to be put into the position in which he would have been if the representation had not been made, while in contract he is entitled to be put into the position in which he would have been if the representation had been true. If the representation induces the plaintiff to buy something which, but for the misrepresentation, he would not have bought at all, it follows that the damages in tort are prima facie the amount by which the actual value of the thing bought is less than the price paid for it. In contract, on the other hand, the damages are prima facie the amount by which the actual value of the thing bought is less than the value which it would have had if the representation had been true. Fleming on Torts, 8th Edition, concisely states at p. 649 the difference between damages in tort for negligent misrepresentation and damages in contract for breach of warranty: As in the case of deceit, damages for negligent misrepresentation are restricted to reliance losses and do not include expectation losses (loss of bargain) as could claim for breach of warranty. Specifically, Collins Barrow says that the approach taken by Keough was to arrive at the amount that would have to be restored to ABM to put it in the position it would have been had no adjustments been required to the acquisition day balance sheet. Collins Barrow submits that the proper method of calculating the damages is the purchase price less the market value of the company at the date of acquisition. It says that Shannon failed to introduce evidence as to the value of the shares or the market value of the company at the time of the purchase. I agree with Collins Barrow that the trial judge has measured the loss on the footing that Shannon should be put in the position he would be had the financial statements of ABM been correct. This, being the test for measuring damages for breach of a contractual warranty, is not the correct test. The principle applicable to the award of damages here is clear. As the trial judge said, it is the application of it that is difficult. The trial judge found that Shannon never would have purchased ABM had he known the true financial condition of the company. The exercise therefore is to fix the damages so as to put Shannon as far as possible in the position he would have been had he not invested in ABM. In particular, the damages are prima facie the amount by which the actual value of ABM was less than what Shannon paid for it. In Esso Petroleum Co. Ltd. v. Marden (1976), Q.B. 801, Denning M.R. in the Court of Appeal of England dealt with the assessment of damages by businessman who, on the basis of negligent misrepresentations respecting potential volume of petroleum sales, purchased service station business. At p. 820, he said: Mr. Mardon is not to be compensated here for ""loss of bargain."" He was given no bargain that the throughput would amount to 200,000 gallons year. He is only to be compensated for having been induced to enter into contract which turned out to be disastrous for him. Whether it be called breach of warranty or negligent misrepresentation, its effect was not to warrant the throughput, but only to induce him to enter the contract. So the damages in either case are to be measured by the loss he suffered. Just as in Doyle v. Olby (Ironmongers) Ltd. [1969] Q.B. 158, 167 he can say: "". would not have entered into this contract at all but for your representation. Owing to it, have lost all the capital put into it. also incurred large overdraft. have spent four years of my life in wasted endeavour without reward: and it will take me some time to re-establish myself."" For all such loss he is entitled to recover damages. It is to be measured in similar way as the loss due to personal injury. You should look into the future so as to forecast what would have been likely to happen if he had never entered into this contract: and contrast it with his position as it is now as result of entering into it. The future is necessarily problematical and can only be rough-and-ready estimate. But it must be done in assessing the loss. It was only in the fall of 1989 that Shannon began to become aware of the extent of the difficulties with ABM and the role played by the financial statements in drawing him into this unwanted bargain. It was at this time or soon thereafter that his losses became measurable, and he could have cut them and left. He did not choose to do so. Keeping in mind, however, what Denning M.R. said in Marden, supra, the best way to assess Shannon's direct loss is to ascertain how much he was out of pocket if he had cut his losses and walked away in late 1989. He had duty to mitigate, to prevent the snowball from rolling further down hill. See Haida Inn Partnership v. Touche Ross and Company (1989), 1989 CanLII 5318 (BC SC), 64 D.L.R. (4th) 305 (B.C.S.C.) at pp. 310-311, 314-316. Mr. Keough's second approach therefore offers better basis on which to assess the loss. He assessed it at figure of between $1,600,000 and $1,800,000 by calculating what Shannon had put into the business, plus the cost of liquidation, less what would have been salvaged on liquidation. He produced Table to this report: LOSS OF INVESTMENT IF ABM WOUND UP ON OCTOBER 31, 1989 (Using Figures from Table 6) Net Book Liquidation Value Assets: Accounts receivable trade 502,636 402,100 452,400 Accounts receivable re: future period maintenance agreements 393,000 Inventory 521,302 173,800 260,700 Prepaids 11,802 5,900 8,900 Goodwill and investment Receivable from associated companies 548,814 548,800 548,800 Deferred development costs 70 Equipment and leaseholds 106,381 53,200 79,800 2,084,006 1,183,800 1,350,600 Less Payout to Secured Creditors: Bank indebtedness 1,046,267 1,046,300 1,046,300 Prime +1 note payable to ICL 106,875 106,900 106,900 15.2% debenture payable to Roynat 734,000 734,000 734,000 Wind up costs 100,000 100,000 100,000 1,987,142 1,987,200 1,987,200 Residual (Shortfall) to secured creditors, guaranteed by Shannon 96,864 (803,400) (636,600) Add: Other non-recoverable investment by Shannon: Note payable to Atlantic Corporation 793,934 793,900 793,900 Original purchase price of shares 190,000 190,000 Loss of Investment, if ABM Liquidated at October 31, 1989 $(1,787,300) $(1,620,500) Say $(1,800,000) $(1,600,000) It will be seen that Keough has allowed substantial amount for wind up costs. He has calculated Shannon's contribution to the business as of October 31, 1989, at $2,681,100, and he has allowed all but $10,000 of the purchase price of $200,000. By this time, Shannon was clearly aware that there were serious problems with the business and he should have, as he did, consider ""pulling the plug"". Keough's second calculation and the evidence on which it is based furnishes basis for assessment of damages by the application of tort principles. Within reasonable limits, it establishes how much Shannon paid to acquire the business on the one hand and how much it was really worth on the other. The difference is the loss of investment had ABM been liquidated on October 31, 1989. Although this approach is not perfect, am prepared to accept it as establishing on balance of probabilities the loss sustained as result of the misrepresentations which led Shannon to purchase ABM. It was impossible to undo the bargain and this liquidation approach comes closest to measuring the loss. At this point, would observe that counsel for the respondent put the position succinctly in his factum when he said: Further, and perhaps more simply, comparison of the price which Shannon paid for ABM and the company's actual negative value results in an award similar to that given by the learned trial judge. The burden is on Shannon to establish his loss. In view of the fact that Keough is only able to provide range with $200,000 spread, it is reasonable to peg that loss in the middle of range and arrive at figure of $1,700,000 to which should be added the balance of the purchase price of $10,000, making an award of $1,710,000 for direct damages. would propose this figure in lieu of the amounts of $200,000 and $1,800,000 respectively fixed by the trial judge. The trial judge said that his assessment of $1,800,000 took into account what he referred to as all of the liabilities the respondent was forced to incur in order to maintain the company's operations, the risks to his reputation and the equity, time and energy devoted by him and his senior executives to maintain the company's existence. On the approach have taken, the award of $1,710,000 does not. It is true that as it turned out, these efforts on the part of Shannon were not lost. Having done all these things, he had company that soon became money maker for him. This has to be addressed as well under the heading of mitigation of damages. Nevertheless, consideration must be given to what, if anything, should be awarded for the additional time, risk and expenditure incurred by Shannon as result of the negligence of Collins Barrow. will deal with this in connection with consequential loss. 2. CONSEQUENTIAL LOSS: This issue deals with the trial judge's award of $1,400,000 representing lost return on alternative investment of $2,000,000 at 10% per annum for seven years. The trial judge recited Shannon's claim that had he not purchased ABM, he would have invested his capital, used available credit and applied his business skills and resources in other profitable ventures. Given his successful track record, it was urged that Shannon would have earned reasonable return on such other ventures. Consequential damages may be awarded to plaintiff who has relied upon the defendant's negligent misrepresentation. repeat and expand upon Fleming, supra, at p. 649: As in the case of deceit, damages for negligent misrepresentation are restricted to reliance losses and do not include expectation losses (loss of bargain) as could claim for breach of warranty. Thus plaintiff who had been misled into buying an insurance in the belief that it contained certain cover in the event of injury, recovered nothing because the policy he purchased was worth (even without that cover) what he paid for it. The court allowed, however, that he would have prevailed if he could have proved that he forwent an opportunity to purchase elsewhere policy containing the extra cover. Similarly, when mistaken certificate from local authority led prospective purchaser to believe that the land was zoned for subdivision, his damages were assessed on the basis of its lesser value (plus conveyancing costs) but not including profits from any subdivision. These would have been recoverable only on proof that he lost an opportunity of buying another property which would have earned profits. While the possibility of recovering opportunity costs moves the tort measure closer to the expectancy measure of contracts, it is not identical with it. In case of promise by seller that the property yielded certain return, the promisee's recovery (in contract) will be measured by the expected gains, whereas in tort for misrepresentation it would by the (usually lesser) return of an alternative investment. (emphasis added) In testifying, Shannon described his approach to business acquisition. He said that he looks for 20% return on his investment. When he analyzed the financial information he had received from Collins Barrow and prepared his own calculations, Shannon was satisfied that ABM would give him this type of return. In addressing what would have been likely to happen had Shannon not purchased ABM, the trial judge accepted Shannon's proposition that he looked for 20% return on his investment in purchasing business. Keeping in mind what Denning M.R. said in Marden, supra, the trial judge said that looking into the future from February 1, 1989 onward was ""necessarily problematical"" and could only be done by rough-and-ready estimate. He thought contingency factor should be applied to reduce Shannon's expectation in as much as in acquiring ABM he was entering into new field of business about which he knew little. The trial judge continued: The best consideration can give to the evidence suggests that 15 percent per year return would be reasonable yield on the Plaintiff’s investment. There should also be discount in that the Plaintiff will be entitled to prejudgment interest. It would be, in effect, double compensation to award Shannon the full amount of his lost investment opportunity plus prejudgment interest. In the result make further reduction of five percent thus leaving the Plaintiff ten percent per year return on his investment. Shannon did not establish that he lost an opportunity to buy another profitable business venture because of the purchase of ABM. True, such damages are ""necessarily problematical"" and involve, as the trial judge said, rough-and-ready estimate. However, it is not realistic to award damages for lost opportunity absent any evidence showing that because of the purchase of ABM and the time spent in turning it around, Shannon was disabled from entering into other more profitable acquisitions. There was no evidence of any acquisition available which he would otherwise have considered but for the purchase of ABM. There was no evidence that the effort spent in dealing with ABM deprived him of financial or other resources which would enable him to seize an opportunity. The discovery evidence of Shannon tendered on behalf of Collins Barrow at the trial sheds considerable light on this: Q. So, really, when we're talking about the non-financial burden on Joe Shannon and his companies, what we're talking about is primarily the devotion of people time to sort out the problems at ABM? A. Well, it was sacrifice to our group of companies. It was Q. I'm not saying it isn't. A. It was freebie for ABM but it was certainly, in our group of companies and me, you know, at the end and on the bottom of the pile, it was it was more of an investment for me because while those people were committing their time to this exercise in trying to get this thing sorted out, mean, we weren't doing something else. We were losing opportunities, you know, of doing something else. Q. Were there any specific opportunities that you were losing that you can think of, or is it just generally the fact that they were spending their time at ABM that, almost by definition, there were opportunities out there A. Yes. Q. that you were missing? A. Yes, of course. Q. So it's not specific? You're not saying here was specific thing we wanted to do that we couldn't do? Are you? A. Again, can't give you time and date but there would have been investment decisions that would have been postponed in our companies as result of this exercise. Q. When you say ""investment decisions"", you mean new businesses that you would have A. Well, either new business or expansions, you know, because we were very deeply, heavily committed to this company and trying to get it sorted out as result of the of the of what we discovered. Q. Are you in position to quantify at all those lost opportunities that you say you weren't able to pursue? A. As just told you, said can't give you time and date on it, but there was, you know, mean, if you look at the history of our companies, they, you know, were always on the acquisition looking for acquisitions, and if we hadn't spent four gruelling years or five years, whatever in the hell it was, on this thing, we would have been doing other things. And there is but can't give you specific company or an opportunity. No, can't give you that. Q. But do you have in your mind value, an amount that you No. Q. that you missed out on? A. No, sir, can't give you that. Q. Is there anyone else that could give us A. No. These extracts from the discovery examination were tendered at the conclusion of the defendant's case. Shannon's counsel urged the trial judge to disregard this evidence. He referred to the so-called rule in Browne v. Dunn, [1893] R. 67 and Sopinka, Lederman and Byrant, The Law of Evidence in Canada (Butterworths: Toronto (1992) at pp. 876-7). He urged that it would be unfair to discredit the plaintiff by the answers he gave at discovery. The trial judge said: agree Shannon was not confronted with this discovery evidence. ""The apparent contradiction"" went unchallenged and unexplained. If the defendant intended to impeach the plaintiff by virtue of this ""apparent"" contradiction, Shannon ought to have been given the opportunity, of testifying, of making any explanation which was open to him. Not having been given that opportunity, it is unfair to ask me to disbelieve what the plaintiff said under oath at trial. therefore accept his evidence that he planned to achieve 20% yield on his investment annually. do not consider that the discovery evidence was contradiction of any evidence given by Shannon. Shannon stated his objective of making acquisitions and getting returns of 20%. The discovery evidence simply establishes that he was unable to point to any specific company or opportunity that he lost. do not take the view that the discovery evidence was only to impeach or discredit Shannon in any event. Collins Barrow had right to tender this discovery evidence at the trial without first having put it to Shannon on cross-examination. Civil Procedure Rule 18.14(1) is clear: 18.14 (1) At trial or upon hearing of an application, any part or all of deposition, so far as admissible under the rules of evidence, may be used against any party who was present or represented at an examination for discovery, or who received due notice thereof, for any of the following purposes, (a) to contradict or impeach the testimony of the deponent as witness; (b) where the deponent was party, or an officer, director or manager of party that is corporation, partnership or association, for any purpose by an adverse party; (emphasis added) Collins Barrow tendered this discovery pursuant to Rule 18.14(1)(b). Indeed, at the time counsel tendered it, he stated that he had added certain portions of Shannon's discovery at the request of Shannon's counsel, presumably in response to Rule 18.14(2): 18.14 (2) If only part of deposition is offered in evidence by party, an adverse party may require the introduction of any other part which is relevant to the part introduced, and the other party may introduce any further part. The failure to put this discovery evidence to Shannon on cross-examination may well be criticized from tactical point of view. At the very least, such failure would clearly give Shannon's counsel an opportunity to deal with the subject on rebuttal. He did not do so. am satisfied that the trial judge erred in not giving effect to this discovery evidence which confirms that however ambitious Mr. Shannon may have been and however willing he was to take advantage of any and all opportunities, he was unable to show that any specific opportunity was lost as result of the purchase of ABM. The case is clearly distinguishable from V. K. Mason Construction Limited v. Bank of Nova Scotia, 1985 CanLII 608 (SCC), [1985] S.C.R. 271 on which the respondent relied. There, on the facts of that case, the court was prepared to assume that contractor induced by the defendant's negligence to enter into contract which turned out to be unprofitable would, but for such negligent inducement, have found profitable means of otherwise employing itself. That case is fact specific in that in its judgment the Supreme Court of Canada referred to finding of the trial judge that but for the misrepresentation, the plaintiff would have ceased work on the project, recovered its expenses for work already done and found another construction project to work on. See [1985], S.C.R. pp. 279-280, 285. Here the evidence fails to disclose anything to support the conclusion that Shannon, would, but for this particular investment, have made other profitable investments. Applying the test laid down by Fleming, Shannon has not shown that as result of buying ABM he ""forwent an opportunity to purchase elsewhere"" lucrative business. Another concern with the trial judge's award is that it compensates for supposed loss of opportunities over seven year period. Shannon himself spoke of ""four gruelling years or five years, whatever the hell it was"". Within two years, Shannon was making money with ABM. There is no evidence that if any opportunity was lost, that it was lost over such long period of time as seven years. am satisfied that this award must be disallowed. The question remains what if any general damages should be awarded to Shannon for extra wasted effort which would not have been wasted had ABM not been acquired. Bearing in mind that it is necessarily problematical and can only be ""rough-and-ready"" estimate it still must, as Denning M.R. has said, be made in assessing the loss. In the case of Marden, supra, the court awarded damages for capital loss representing cash put into the business and overdraft incurred in running the business. Loss of earnings were to be discussed and further argument was called for. We are thus unable to find any guidance there as to what might have been awarded in that case in making the rough-and-ready estimate. Because have concluded that it would have been reasonable for Shannon to cut his losses in the fall of 1989, the amount to be awarded should reflect compensation for wasted efforts prior to that time only. am prepared to accept the challenge thrown out by Lord Denning of making an estimate ""in similar way as the loss due to personal injury"". The trial judge found that Shannon was forced to incur greater liabilities than he anticipated in order to maintain the company. His reputation was at risk. He devoted more time and energy, both of himself and his senior executives, to maintain the company's existence than would have been the case had he not purchased it. The trial judge said: Fortunately, the banks ""kept the faith"" and although Shannon said he ""spit lot of blood"", he managed to turn ABM around, part of that was undoubtedly due to the efforts of Brent Smith. Fortunately, the agonies had happy outcome, but nevertheless they are not to be ignored. There was not only effort and exertion, but money tied up for varying periods of time for which have not yet accounted. It is extremely difficult to estimate. Giving the matter the best consideration can, an award of $50,000 general damages for disruption and inconvenience would be appropriate. 3. CONTRIBUTORY NEGLIGENCE: Collins Barrow submits that contributory negligence and apportionment may be utilized in negligent misrepresentation cases and cites various authorities for this proposition. It submits that there is distinction between reasonable reliance as necessary prerequisite to finding of liability and reliance in the context of contributory negligence as factor going to the extent of damages suffered. It is said that reliance that was unreasonable simply goes to reducing damages recoverable by plaintiff. It does not go to cancelling the prima facie liability of the defendant. Collins Barrow submits here that the reliance was unreasonable because, ""the plaintiff himself was person who had some degree of expert knowledge or perhaps knows as much as the defendant"". Collins Barrow submits that Eldridge, qualified accountant, was the person primarily responsible for the due diligence investigation of ABM on behalf of Shannon. It is submitted that he was negligent in failing to discover the inventory overstatement and consequently the respondents own conduct contributed to any losses suffered. It is said that if Eldridge did not possess the requisite skill to carry out due diligence investigation, it was in Shannon's economic interest to retain someone who did. Collins Barrow also submits that the respondents were, in fact, aware of circumstances that should have alerted them to the economic risks of transaction. Shannon's people knew that ABM was in some degree of difficulty in view of the requirement of Lloyd's Bank that it be paid out by the end of January and in view of their knowledge that some $80,000 in inventory purchases were required in order to complete contracts, that the serviceable equipment had no value and that the amount of inventory write-down on monthly basis was not adequate and that there would be cash shortfall of $250,000 to be made up in the immediate future. It submits that the trial judge erred in failing to find that Shannon was contributorily negligent in these respects. The trial judge addressed the issue of contributory negligence. He found: Eldridge impressed me as being astute, reliable, assiduous and fair. accept all of his evidence. am satisfied that every step taken by Eldridge and his people was thorough and appropriate and his due diligence investigation was in no way deficient. This is very strong finding. It must be remembered that in testing the conduct of Collins Barrow and that of Eldridge respectively, the former had great advantages in determining what was the true picture of ABM. It was engaged by ABM and had the necessary opportunity it required to satisfy itself of the financial condition before certifying the statements. On the other hand, Eldridge's team had only matter of days in which to carry out the due diligence. In my opinion, Collins Barrow has failed to show the trial judge made any palpable or overriding error in his finding which have set out, and in the following finding: While theoretically intriguing, find the defendant's submission to be circular and impractical, when applied to the circumstances of this case. One cannot assess contributory negligence in vacuum. The defendant has failed to demonstrate any negligence on the part of the plaintiff which might be seen to be contributory. If the defendant Collins Barrow failed to recognize their own negligence and breach of professional conduct in the years they served as auditors, how could the plaintiff be expected to detect such negligence in its two weeks work of diligence investigations?... would reject Collins Barrow's submissions on the issue of contributory negligence. 4. MITIGATION: In the course of the argument, counsel for Collins Barrow referred to the finding that Shannon would not have purchased ABM had he known the true picture. The argument was that since he did not cut his losses, but continued his effort to save the business, he had embarked upon program of mitigation. That program was successful. Collins Barrow therefore claims to have the benefits of the successful set off against the loss sustained by Shannon. With respect to mitigation of damages, McGregor on Damages, Fifteenth Edition, refers to, in Ch. 7, para 273, et. seq. to three rules concerning avoiding the consequences of wrong: (a) The plaintiff must take all reasonable steps to mitigate the loss to him resulting from the defendant's wrong and cannot recover for loss that could have been avoided by taking such steps. (b) corollary of the first rule is that where plaintiff does take reasonable steps to mitigate the loss, he can recover for loss sustained in so doing. (c) Where plaintiff does take steps to mitigate the loss, the defendant is entitled to the benefit accruing from such action and is liable only for the loss as lessened. In addressing Collins Barrow's argument on mitigation, we are concerned with the application of the third rule. McGregor, supra, at para 325 said: But the plaintiff may have gone further and by sound action have avoided more consequences than the dictates of the law required of him. In such circumstances the position has been definitively stated by Viscount Haldane L.C. in the leading case of British Westinghouse Co. v. Underground Ry, [1912] A.C. 673. He put the rule thus: ""When in the course of his business he [the plaintiff] has taken action arising out of the transaction, which action has diminished his loss, the effect in actual diminution of the loss he has suffered may be taken into account even though there was no duty on him to act."" Later in his speech he said similarly: ""Provided the course taken to protect himself by the plaintiff in such an action was one which reasonable and prudent person might in the ordinary conduct of business properly have taken, and in fact did take whether bound to or not, jury or an arbitrator may properly look at the whole of the facts and ascertain the result in estimating the quantum of damage."" He emphasised however that ""the subsequent transaction, if to be taken into account, must be one arising out of the consequences of the breach and in the ordinary course of business,"" and the important practical question is therefore what steps taken by the plaintiff satisfy this definition. As McGregor points out, British Westinghouse, supra, was case of breach of contract. He states that wider formulation, which more readily includes tort, is that subsequent event ""completely collateral and merely res inter alios acta"" cannot be used in mitigation of damage. He continues (para 326): This has the great merit of stating the rule at once concisely and completely: but it gives no indication of how the rule operates and of what solutions would be reached when applying it to particular circumstances. Indeed the line between those avoided consequences which are collateral and those which are not is an exceedingly difficult one to draw. It is thought that, in considering the relevant decided cases which are widely dispersed over many fields, Viscount Haldane's formulation is of value, and that assistance is also derived from division into actions taken before breach and actions taken after breach, and from subdivision of the latter group into actions taken by third parties and actions taken by the plaintiff. The author states, referring to The World Beauty (1970), P. 144 that the onus is on the defendant to prove that the steps taken by the plaintiff were not completely collateral to the wrong, and the extent to which the loss has thereby been avoided. In that case, ship was damaged. In assessing damages against the wrongdoer, the latter got credit for increased profit the ship owner made on charter party by reason of being able to find substitute ship. Denning M.R. said at p. 152: The 7-year time charter with Mobil Oil was advanced by three months. The Andros Springs started on the 7-year charter (at high rate) 100 days earlier than she would have done if there had been no collision. She was delivered to Mobil Oil on July 11, whereas if there had been no collision, she would have been on October 19. McGregor states in paragraph 335 with respect to action taken by plaintiff: The matter is not well worked out in the authorities and all that can be done is to sketch what the law probably is. The author discusses number of contract cases. In addition to The World Beauty, supra, the author refers to Bellingham v. Dhillon, [1973] Q.B. 304. There, the plaintiff sustained injuries as result of the defendant's negligence. The plaintiff owned and ran driving school and as result of the injuries, lost the opportunity of buying on hire purchase an expensive driving simulator. Some three and one-half years later, however, he was able to buy the same equipment as liquidated stock for fraction of the original price. In his claim for loss of profits that he would have made with the simulator over three and one-half years it was held that there must also be brought into account the profits in fact earned by the substitute simulator. Waddams on Damages, loose leaf edition, Canada Law Book Inc., has discussion on the subject of avoided loss at Ch. 15 at para. 15.670. He states with respect to the third rule that the simple statement of it conceals very difficult proposition. He says: After the defendant's wrong, the plaintiff continues to engage in the ordinary transactions of business; some of these will turn out to be profitable. The difficulty is to determine when such profits should be taken into account for the benefit of the wrongdoer. The problem is akin to some of the intractable problems of legal causation. After the wrong has been done the plaintiff finds state of affairs that includes the alteration caused by the wrong. In that altered state of affairs, the plaintiff enters into profitable transaction which could not have been entered into in exactly the same form if events had been unaltered by the defendant's wrong. In one sense it can be said that all such profits are attributable to the wrong, for in the absence of the wrong they would not have been made. But this rule would plainly be too generous to the defendant. In another sense it might be said that all such profits are due to the plaintiff’s enterprise, not to the defendant's wrong, but this would be too generous to the plaintiff, for where profit is very closely linked with the defendant's wrong, common sense requires the conclusion that the effect of the profit is to reduce the loss caused by the wrong. Waddams points out that at best phrases such as ""collateral"" or ""res inter alios acta"" state the court's conclusion in particular case rather than provide guidance in the application of the principle. In discussing the case of Apeco of Canada Limited v. Windmill Place, 1978 CanLII 186 (SCC), [1978] S.C.R. 385, to which we were referred, Waddams says at para 15.750: The Supreme Court of Canada quoted from Viscount Haldane's speech in British Westinghouse: ""The subsequent transaction, if to be taken into account, must be one arising out of the consequences of the breach and in the ordinary course of business."" The Supreme Court of Canada held that the rent from the second transaction need not be taken into account, describing it as: ""an independent transaction which in no way arose out of the consequences of the breach by the appellant"". Waddams then concludes, paragraph 15.800: These considerations suggest what seems to be test often applied, that is, whether the plaintiff could, even in the absence of the wrong, have made the disputed profit. If so, it is treated as collateral. If not, it goes to reduce the plaintiff’s loss. profitable purchase of shares or goods would usually be treated as collateral because usually it could have been made even if the wrong had not been done It is clear from these passages that while the rule is easy to state and difficult to apply, it is left to court in making the judgment call whether subsequent profit earned by plaintiff is ""completely collateral"" to the defendant's wrongdoing. In Scott Group Limited v. McFarlane and others (1977), N.Z.L.R. 553 (N.Z.C.A.), Cooke, J. at p. 587 expressed the position this way: In principle it must be so, because the tort measure is the plaintiff’s loss, which cannot be ascertained without taking into account the benefit that the transaction has in fact brought him. do not view Shannon's subsequent turn-around of the company as being analogous to situations such as that dealt with in Bellingham v. Dhillon, supra, and The World Beauty, supra. It is hard to view the subsequent successful operation of the business as being attributable to the negligence of Collins Barrow. In my view, Shannon's decision to stay with the company and attempt to turn it around was an intervening event which put an end to the chain of causation connecting the negligence of Collins Barrow with the losses suffered by Shannon. The misrepresentation of Collins Barrow was but sine qua non and not causa causans of Shannon's subsequent successful reorganization. have already measured Shannon's direct loss on the basis of what he would have suffered had he wound up the company at the end of the fiscal period ending October 31, 1989. It was at that time that the direct damages arising from Collins Barrow's negligence were capable of some degree of measurement. believe it would have been reasonable for Shannon to cut his losses. He could have done that. Instead, largely for reasons of pride and the maintenance of his reputation, Shannon chose to go on with the company. From there on, it was Shannon's game to win or lose. The subsequent steps taken by Shannon and his resulting success were intervening or collateral events which should not be credited to Collins Barrow by way of mitigation. Underlying the success was the complete reorganization and recapitalization of ABM, the development of new products, injection of very large amounts of cash and the advent of the G.S.T. which presented new opportunities. Had Shannon gone on to incur more extensive losses in his attempt to turn the company around, it is unlikely that the expenses so incurred could fall within the second rule of mitigation. Collins Barrow could probably be heard to say that he should have cut his losses when he saw the situation shortly after October 31, 1989. See Haida Inn Partnership, supra, pp. 314, 316. am not satisfied that Collins Barrow has established (as it must), that Shannon would not have made these profits ""even in the absence of the wrong"". Collins Barrow is not entitled to an offset against the damages for the subsequent success attained by Shannon after he had channeled the company into an entirely new operation. 5. PREJUDGMENT INTEREST: Collins Barrow submits that the trial judge erred in awarding prejudgment interest upon each of the three components of damages awarded direct damages, consequential damages and return on lost investment opportunity for seven years. have recalculated the award. On the basis have adopted, am satisfied that prejudgment interest at the rate of 8% should be applied to the sum of $1,760,000 over period of seven years. Collins Barrow submitted that the trial judge failed to consider that loans were being repaid thereby reducing the amount upon which prejudgment interest should be awarded. have taken these uncertainties into account in fixing the sum for consequential damages at $50,000 and for that reason see no need to further reduce prejudgment interest. As have not awarded damages for loss of investment opportunity, the submissions of Collins Barrow respecting that need not be considered. Accordingly, prejudgment interest should be allowed at 8% for seven years for an amount of $985,600. SUMMARY: I would allow the appeal in part by varying the award of damages and substituting the following in place of that awarded by the trial judge:Direct Damages $1,710,000Consequential Damages $ 50,000Prejudgment Interest $ 985,600TOTAL: $2,746,600 The prejudgment interest is calculated to the date of the trial judge's order, March 6, 1996. In addition, Shannon should recover interest from that date to the date of the order of this Court at the rate of 6% per annum: Civil Procedure Rule 62.10(4). Shannon should also recover his costs at trial fixed by the application of Scale of the Tariffs to the amount involved which fix at $1,760,000. This amounts to $93,325, plus disbursements to be taxed. As Collins Barrow has, in the main, succeeded on this appeal, would allow it costs of $37,330, being 40% of the trial costs, plus disbursements, to be off set against Shannon's recovery of costs. would delay issuing the order in this matter for two weeks in the event that there are circumstances relevant to the issue of costs of which this Court is not aware.

The appellants appealed.
They argued that the trial judge, by measuring the respondent's loss on the basis that he should be put in the position he would have been if the financial statements had been accurate, had applied the wrong test.
Allowing the appeal reducing the damage award to $2,745,600,
that the trial judge erred in the test he applied to the award of damages.
The proper test is to put the respondent as far as possible in the position he would have been in if he had not invested in the company.

[2] The application is opposed and have reviewed the affidavits of Earl Spencer Colley and Kelly A. Rowlett, as well as the pre‑hearing memorandum, oral submissions and cases to which have been referred. [3] The originating notice (action) and statement of claim were issued on September 27th, 2000 and judgment was entered against the defendant on October 18th, 2000. An execution order was issued and the defendant's wages garnisheed. 1. Was service of the originating notice (action) and statement of claim effected on the defendant? 2. If the answer to the first issue is yes: (a) Does the defendant have fairly arguable defence or is there substantial issue to be tried between the parties? (b) Does the defendant have reasonable excuse for the delay in filing the defence? [4] The affidavit of Earl Spencer Colley sets out that he is retired Constable from the Dartmouth City Police and Halifax Regional Municipality Police Force. He was police officer for twenty‑five and half years. He was aware statement of claim requires personal service, and that he served the originating notice and statement of claim in this proceeding on the defendant on September 28th, 2000. Mr. Colley acknowledged that service was made on the defendant based on the affidavit of service he swore, but he has no recollection of the particular service on the defendant. He does recall one incident concerning service on Mr. MacLean but, as he served two originating notices on Mr. MacLean, he does not recall which of the services his recollection concerns. [5] The affidavits of Wayne Smith sets out he is co‑worker of Brian MacLean and on September 28th, 2000 at or about 12:30 p.m. person left an envelope with him to deliver to Brian MacLean. Mr. Smith had no knowledge of the contents of the envelope, left it on his manager's desk, got busy and forgot he had received the package. He states approximately three or four days later he remembered the incident, informed Mr. MacLean, who retrieved the package. [6] Having considered the evidence and submissions of counsel, I find that the originating notice (action) and statement of claim were served on Brian MacLean by Earl Spencer Colley on September 28th, 2000. Mr. Colley, an experienced retired police officer, swore an affidavit that he had served the documents on Mr. MacLean. He did not recall the circumstances of the particular service, but that is understandable given the number of documents he serves. [7] The test to be applied in an application to set aside default judgment pursuant to rule 12.06 is well established. In Ives v. Dewar (1948), 1948 CanLII 275 (NS CA), 23 M.P.R. 218 at 221, Parker, J. stated in giving the judgment of the Supreme Court, sitting en banco: Before the interlocutory judgment should have been set aside ..., it was necessary for the appellant to show by affidavit, facts which would indicate clearly that he had good defence to the action on the merits; not necessarily defence that would succeed at the trial because the action was not being tried on that application; but facts which would at least show beyond question that there was substantial issue between the parties to be tried. He must also show by affidavit why his defence was not filed and delivered within the time limited by the Rules. The reasons thus disclosed are immaterial matters which the judge or Court should consider in determining whether the application to set aside the judgment should be granted or refused. [8] This approach has been consistently followed in Nova Scotia. [9] In order to succeed in an application pursuant to Civil Procedure Rule 12.06, the defendant must demonstrate: (a) fairly arguable defence or substantial issue to be tried; (b) reasonable excuse for the delay or failure to file defence within the time requirements. [10] The plaintiff's claim is that Mr. MacLean's dog ran onto the Conrod Settlement Road in front of the plaintiffts motor vehicle forcing the vehicle into the ditch, with resultant damage, and that the accident was caused by Mr. MacLean's negligence in failing to keep his dog under control. [11] Paragraphs 3, and of Brian MacLean's affidavit deal with the issue of his defence to the action. Paragraph is statement that neither Brian MacLean nor his dog were responsible for the car accident. Paragraph is statement that there are several dogs in the general vicinity of his home that go on the road and the police had not laid any charges against him. In paragraph he states when he left for work the dog was on chain, sometimes children in the neighbourhood let his dog off the chain to play. Further his dog may have broken his chain. But to his knowledge the dog had never ventured onto the road. [12] find the defendant's affidavit does not set out acts upon which in the words of Ives v. Dewar would clearly indicate he had good defence to the action on the merits; not necessarily defence which would succeed at the trial because the action was not being tried on the application, but facts which would show beyond question that there was substantial issue between the parties to be tried. REASONS FOR DELAY [13] Mr. MacLean has not given any reasons for not filing a defence in this proceeding, other than his assertion that the originating notice (action) and statement of claim were not served on him. [14] note in paragraph of her affidavit, Kelly A. Rowlett states she and the defendant had discussion in which he stated he was not responsible for the accident and for Ms. Rowlett to go ahead and sue him as he did not have anything in any event. He looked further into the matter once his wages were garnisheed. [15] find Mr. MacLean has not shown by his affidavit why his defence was not filed and delivered within the time limited by the Rules. [16] For all of these reasons, the defendant's application is dismissed. [17] award costs to the plaintiff respondent in the amount of $500.00, payable forthwith. C.

920,"[3] The only appeal provisions in The Psychologists Act are as follows: Interpretation In this Act: (f) “court” means the Court of Queen’s Bench Appeal to court 37 member whose conduct is the subject of an order of the council pursuant to section 36 may appeal that order to judge of the court within 30 days after the order of the council, and section 36 applies with any necessary modification.
It declares when judge of the Court of Queen’s Bench is not sitting as persona designata so as to narrow the circumstances when right of appeal will not exist.
This is why the legislature created the right of appeal found in subsection 7(2)(a), when subject to no legislative limit: To provide parties to proceedings in the Court of Queen’s Bench with the most comprehensive and effective means of redress possible in relation to such failures.
According to the College’s submissions, the starting point for the analysis is s. 7(3).
In further support of its position, the College provided list of statutes dealing with the regulation of the professions, which provides either right of appeal to the Court of Queen’s Bench only or an explicit right of appeal to this Court from decision of the Queen’s Bench.
[16] Since this application presents question of statutory interpretation, it is useful to refer to the analytical framework provided by the Supreme Court of Canada to determine the intention of the legislature.
The legislature could provide that the Court of Appeal has no jurisdiction unless it is specifically granted to the Court by an enactment, or the legislature could spell out the general jurisdiction of the Court, subject to an expression of contrary legislative intention in any enactment.
Only in the circumstance where the legislature intends to exclude or limit right of appeal should it need to turn its mind to the jurisdiction of this Court.
[19] In our view, it is an error to construe s. by asking first whether The Psychologists Act “confers only limited right of appeal” within the meaning of s. 7(3).
[20] Section 7(2)(a) states that “an appeal lies to the court from a decision … of the Court of Queen’s Bench or a judge of that court.” Reading these words grammatically and giving them their ordinary sense, they indicate that whenever the legislature confers jurisdiction on the Court of Queen’s Bench, and is silent with respect to an appeal from that Court, an appeal lies from it.
[22] Clearly, the legislature can convey intent without express words, but if this Court held that the phrase “confers only limited right of appeal” is satisfied when no right of appeal is provided in the other enactment, s. 7(2)(a) would serve no purpose.
right of appeal would have to be found in every other enactment that confers jurisdiction on the Court of Queen’s Bench.
[23] In order to properly interpret s. 7, it is necessary to read ss.
Having regard for the nature of general appellate legislation like The Court of Appeal Act, 2000, the proper meaning of s. 7(2)(a) is that it creates the general jurisdiction of the Court: an appeal lies to the Court from decision of the Court of Queen’s Bench.
Section 7(3) is nothing more than further expression of what would be the law whether the subsection were there or not: the general right of appeal to the Court is subject to an expression of legislative will to the contrary in any other enactment, but it requires more than silence in the other enactment to take away the general right.
[24] With this interpretation of s. 7, it is of little relevance that many of the professional statutes are silent on the question of right of appeal to this Court.
If this Court were to draw distinction when the legislature has not, it would fly in the face of what we have found to be the clear legislative intent proclaimed by s. 7(2).
[28] In conclusion, s. 7(2)(a) of The Court of Appeal Act, 2000 is clear expression of legislative intent establishing the general rule that an appeal lies to the Court of Appeal from decision of the Court of Queen’s Bench or judge of that Court.
Silence alone is not an expression of legislative intent as to whether further appeal lies to this Court from decision of the Court of Queen’s Bench.
[29] Neither of those last two circumstances pertains to the application before us.
[30] For these reasons, the College’s application was dismissed when heard.","HELD: The court dismissed the application.
Section 7(2) indicates that whenever the legislature confers jurisdiction on the Court of Queen’s Bench, and is silent with respect to an appeal from that Court, an appeal lies from it.
The Psychologists Act does not state that there is no appeal from a decision of the Court of Queen’s Bench.",681,"THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR SASKATCHEWAN Citation: 2014 SKCA 116 Date: 2014-10-31 Between: Docket: CACV2544 Saskatchewan College of Psychologists Applicant (Respondent) and Daniel Sydiaha Respondent (Appellant) Before: Jackson, Ottenbreit and Herauf JJ.A. Counsel: Karen Prisciak, QC for the Applicant (Respondent) Jay Watson for the Respondent (Appellant) Application: From: 2014 SKQB 112 (CanLII) Heard: October 31, 2014 Disposition: Application dismissed (orally) Written Reasons: November 14, 2014 By: The Honourable Madam Justice Jackson In Concurrence: The Honourable Mr. Justice Ottenbreit The Honourable Mr. Justice Herauf Jackson J.A. [1] This application concerns the jurisdiction of this Court to hear an appeal from decision of the Court of Queen’s Bench when the latter exercises jurisdiction under statute that is silent as to the right to appeal to this Court. The particular issue is whether ss. 7(2) and 7(3) of The Court of Appeal Act, 2000, SS 2000, C-42.1 permit member of the Saskatchewan College of Psychologists to appeal decision of the Court of Queen’s Bench to this Court when The Psychologists Act, 1997, SS 1997, P-36.01 is silent on the question, providing as it does for right of appeal by the member to the Court of Queen’s Bench only. [2] Dr. Daniel Sydiaha is non-practising psychologist and member of the Saskatchewan College of Psychologists. On April 15, 2014, the Court of Queen’s Bench dismissed his appeal from decision of the council of the Saskatchewan College of Psychologists finding him guilty of professional misconduct for failing to identify his non-practising status (see Sydiaha Saskatchewan College of Psychologists, 2014 SKQB 112 (CanLII)). Shortly thereafter, he filed notice of appeal in this Court. [3] The only appeal provisions in The Psychologists Act are as follows: Interpretation In this Act: (f) “court” means the Court of Queen’s Bench Appeal to court 37 member whose conduct is the subject of an order of the council pursuant to section 36 may appeal that order to judge of the court within 30 days after the order of the council, and section 36 applies with any necessary modification. Reinstatement 40(5) Where, on an application for reinstatement, the council refuses to reinstate the person as member, the applicant may, within 30 days after the date of the order, appeal the order of the council to judge of the court, and the judge may allow or disallow the appeal. [4] On the other hand, The Court of Appeal Act, 2000 provides that “an appeal lies” to this Court from “any judgment, order, decree, verdict or finding” of the Court of Queen’s Bench or judge of that Court unless an enactment “confers only limited right of appeal” (ss. 2, 7(2)(a) and 7(3)). [5] The precise provisions of The Court of Appeal Act, 2000 concerning the right of appeal to this Court and its jurisdiction to hear an appeal read as follows: Interpretation In this Act and the rules of court made pursuant to this Act, except where otherwise provided “court” means the Court of Appeal for Saskatchewan; “decision” includes any judgment, order, decree, verdict or finding; Right of appeal 7(1) In this section and section 9, “enactment” means: (a) an Act; (b) an Act of the Parliament of Canada; or (c) regulation made pursuant to an Act or an Act of the Parliament of Canada; but does not include this Act. (2) Subject to subsection (3) and section 8, an appeal lies to the court from decision: (a) of the Court of Queen’s Bench or judge of that court; and (b) of any other court or tribunal where right of appeal to the court is conferred by an enactment. (3) If an enactment provides that there is no appeal from decision mentioned in subsection (2) or confers only limited right of appeal, that enactment prevails.[1] Appellate jurisdiction 10 The court has appellate jurisdiction in civil and criminal matters where an appeal lies to the court, with any original jurisdiction that is necessary or incidental to the hearing and determination of an appeal. (Emphasis added) [6] Asserting that The Court of Appeal Act, 2000 does not enlarge the rights of appeal contained in The Psychologists Act, the College applied for an order quashing Dr. Sydiaha’s appeal. [7] On the day the College’s application was heard, we dismissed the application from the Bench with brief reasons to follow. These are those reasons. [8] Prior to the enactment of The Court of Appeal Act, 2000, it was necessary for this Court to consider questions of jurisdiction from complex and ambiguous legislative base. This Court had to determine whether it had jurisdiction to hear an appeal by construing s. of The Court of Appeal Act, RSS 1978, C-42, repealed, and s. 33 of The Interpretation Act, RSS 1978, I-11, repealed. [9] Section of The Court of Appeal Act of 1978, and its predecessors dating back to The Court of Appeal Act, SS 1915, 9, grounded its jurisdiction in that of the High Court of Justice or the Court of Appeals in England as of January 1, 1898, “where not specially changed, altered or provided for” by any enactment of the legislature: Nature and extent of jurisdiction The court shall have all the jurisdiction and powers possessed by the Supreme Court of Saskatchewan en banc immediately prior to the first day of March, 1918, and shall have jurisdiction and power, subject to the rules of court, to hear and determine all applications for new trials, all questions or issues of law, all questions or points reserved for the opinion of the court, all appeals or motions in the nature of appeals respecting any judgment, order or decision of any judge of the Court of Queen’s Bench, or respecting any judgment or decision of any judge of court of inferior jurisdiction, sitting in court, where an appeal is given by any Act, all petitions, and all other motions, matters or things whatsoever which might lawfully be brought before any divisional court of the High Court of Justice or the Court of Appeals in England on the first day of January, 1898, where not specially changed, altered or provided for by this or any other Act of Saskatchewan. (The Court of Appeal Act of 1978) [10] Section 33 of The Interpretation Act of 1978, and its predecessors, dating back to The Interpretation Act, SS 1959, 12, only tangentially concern the question of when right of appeal lies from decision of the judge of the Court of Queen’s Bench to this Court. It declares when judge of the Court of Queen’s Bench is not sitting as persona designata so as to narrow the circumstances when right of appeal will not exist. Section 33 (of 1978) provides as follows: Judge or officer not persona designata 33. Notwithstanding section 3, where by any Act judicial or quasi-judicial powers are given to judge or an officer of any court, whether individually or as member of class, the judge or officer shall, in the absence of express provision to the contrary, be deemed to exercise the powers in his capacity as judge or officer of the court, as if the court itself had jurisdiction in respect thereof, and not as persona designata. [11] Without more direct statement as to when right of appeal would lie to this Court, it was necessary to consider on case-by-case basis first, whether the Court had jurisdiction derived from complex matrix of sources and second, whether the legislature had enlarged or diminished that jurisdiction. Notwithstanding the indirect language contained in s. of The Court of Appeal Act of 1978 and s. 33 of The Interpretation Act of 1978, Sherstobitoff J.A., speaking for the Court, declared in Borrowman Wickens (1986), 1986 CanLII 3658 (SK CA), 82 Sask 295 (CA): [6] The issue as to right of appeal and the jurisdiction of this court to hear the appeal, in the absence of specific provision in the Local Government Elections Act for such an appeal, must be taken to have been conclusively settled by the decision of this court in Attorney General of Canada v. Lees, 1977 CanLII 1453 (SK CA), [1977] W.W.R. 505, and the other decisions of this court referred to therein. The right of appeal, as well as the jurisdiction of this court to hear the appeal, is found in s. of the Court of Appeal Act, R.S.S. 1978, c. C-42. (Emphasis added) [12] Similarly, in Attorney General of Canada Lees, 1977 CanLII 1453 (SK CA), [1977] WWR 505 (Sask CA), the Court was called upon to determine whether right of appeal exists from decision of the Court of Queen’s Bench under The Recovery of Possession of Land Act, RSS 1965, 122. That Act provided for right of appeal to judge of the Court of Queen’s Bench, but was silent about whether further appeal lies to the Court of Appeal. This Court held that s. of The Court of Appeal Act of 1978 conferred general right of appeal from decision of the Court of Queen’s Bench and that this right of appeal applied in the circumstances of that case. [13] In other decisions of this Court, the combination of s. of The Court of Appeal Act of 1978 and s. 33 of The Interpretation Act of 1978, and consideration of all relevant principles of statutory interpretation, resulted in determination that this Court had no jurisdiction to hear an appeal from the Court of Queen’s Bench. (See, for example, Swanson Saskatchewan Registered Nurses’ Association (1992), 1992 CanLII 8309 (SK CA), 100 Sask 81 (CA).) [14] When the legislature enacted s. of The Court of Appeal Act, 2000, it ushered in new era of clarity with respect to this Court’s jurisdiction to hear appeals from the Court of Queen’s Bench. Cameron J.A., speaking for the Court in Valley Beef Co-operative Ltd. Farm Credit Corp., 2002 SKCA 100 (CanLII), 223 Sask 236, stated: [50] These, then, are the fundamental components of all judicial decision-making, and the judges of the Court of Queen’s Bench, as highly trained and competent as they are as superior court judges, may on occasion fail in relation to one or more of them, or fail on the whole to pronounce such judgment or make such order as the quelling of the controversy calls for. This is why the legislature created the right of appeal found in subsection 7(2)(a), when subject to no legislative limit: To provide parties to proceedings in the Court of Queen’s Bench with the most comprehensive and effective means of redress possible in relation to such failures. That is the object of the right, the attainment of which we are bound to strive to achieve when construing and interpreting the provisions of the Act concerning the right, bearing in mind the right of appeal is subject to no limit except such as may be justifiably implied in keeping with the canons of construction. (Emphasis added) [15] In the present application, the College has asked this Court to interpret s. of The Court of Appeal Act, 2000 in such manner that s. 7(2) would have no effect, and indeed, would overturn such decisions as Borrowman. According to the College’s submissions, the starting point for the analysis is s. 7(3). Relying on s. 7(3), the College argued that The Psychologists Act “confers only limited right of appeal” because it is silent with respect to further right of appeal to this Court, i.e., the absence of right of appeal to this Court means that the enactment confers limited right of appeal on the member. In that regard, the College relies on Huerto Saskatchewan (Minister of Health) (1995), 1995 CanLII 3917 (SK CA), 128 Sask 208 (CA) and Swanson, which is referred to in Huerto. In further support of its position, the College provided list of statutes dealing with the regulation of the professions, which provides either right of appeal to the Court of Queen’s Bench only or an explicit right of appeal to this Court from decision of the Queen’s Bench. [16] Since this application presents question of statutory interpretation, it is useful to refer to the analytical framework provided by the Supreme Court of Canada to determine the intention of the legislature. According to that framework, court interpreting legislation must read the words of the statute in their entire context, in their grammatical and ordinary sense harmoniously within the scheme of the statute, its objective and the intention of the legislature: Rizzo Rizzo Shoes Ltd. (Re), 1998 CanLII 837 (SCC), [1998] SCR 27 at 41 (quoting E. Driedger, Construction of Statutes, 2d ed (Toronto: Butterworths, 1983) at 87). [17] Faced with determining the exact limits of appellate jurisdiction in legislation like The Court of Appeal Act, 2000, legislature has two choices. The legislature could provide that the Court of Appeal has no jurisdiction unless it is specifically granted to the Court by an enactment, or the legislature could spell out the general jurisdiction of the Court, subject to an expression of contrary legislative intention in any enactment. Whatever route is chosen, the goal must be clarity so as to avoid, as much as possible, litigation that is centered not on the merits of the dispute but on whether this Court has the jurisdiction to resolve it. [18] In this application, this Court’s task is to determine which legislative model the legislature intended when it enacted The Court of Appeal Act, 2000. In this Court’s view, having regard for what preceded The Court of Appeal Act, 2000 and its provisions, the legislature has chosen the second model: the legislature has established general right of appeal unless there is an expression of legislative will to the contrary. When enacting legislation, it should be possible to rely on The Court of Appeal Act, 2000 without having to repeat this Court’s appellate jurisdiction in every statute that confers original or appellate jurisdiction on the Court of Queen’s Bench. Only in the circumstance where the legislature intends to exclude or limit right of appeal should it need to turn its mind to the jurisdiction of this Court. [19] In our view, it is an error to construe s. by asking first whether The Psychologists Act “confers only limited right of appeal” within the meaning of s. 7(3). Section 7(2) begins with the words “subject to subsection (3),” but it is necessary to consider the general provision before considering what is taken from it. [20] Section 7(2)(a) states that “an appeal lies to the court from a decision … of the Court of Queen’s Bench or a judge of that court.” Reading these words grammatically and giving them their ordinary sense, they indicate that whenever the legislature confers jurisdiction on the Court of Queen’s Bench, and is silent with respect to an appeal from that Court, an appeal lies from it. This meaning is supported by the objectives and purposes of The Court of Appeal Act, 2000, which are to establish the jurisdiction, powers and duties of the Court of Appeal and its judges. The meaning is also supported by consideration of what s. replaced: general, albeit ambiguous, right of appeal conferred by s. of The Court of Appeal Act of 1978 and its predecessors. [21] Section 7(2) is subject to s. 7(3). Section 7(3) provides that the legislature can take away the right of appeal conferred in s. 7(2) in an enactment, but that enactment must “provide that there is no right of appeal” or “confer only limited right of appeal.” The College submits that the lack of an express right of appeal to this Court in The Psychologists Act means that it is an enactment that confers only limited right of appeal. [22] Clearly, the legislature can convey intent without express words, but if this Court held that the phrase “confers only limited right of appeal” is satisfied when no right of appeal is provided in the other enactment, s. 7(2)(a) would serve no purpose. right of appeal would have to be found in every other enactment that confers jurisdiction on the Court of Queen’s Bench. [23] In order to properly interpret s. 7, it is necessary to read ss. 7(2) and 7(3) harmoniously together so as to give each provision meaning. Having regard for the nature of general appellate legislation like The Court of Appeal Act, 2000, the proper meaning of s. 7(2)(a) is that it creates the general jurisdiction of the Court: an appeal lies to the Court from decision of the Court of Queen’s Bench. Section 7(3) is nothing more than further expression of what would be the law whether the subsection were there or not: the general right of appeal to the Court is subject to an expression of legislative will to the contrary in any other enactment, but it requires more than silence in the other enactment to take away the general right. [24] With this interpretation of s. 7, it is of little relevance that many of the professional statutes are silent on the question of right of appeal to this Court. When the legislature enacted The Court of Appeal Act, 2000, it drew no distinction between professional statutes and others. If this Court were to draw distinction when the legislature has not, it would fly in the face of what we have found to be the clear legislative intent proclaimed by s. 7(2). [25] Given this interpretation, it is not strictly necessary to consider Swanson[2] and Huerto other than to note that they are distinguishable. In Huerto, s. 49.21(4) of The Saskatchewan Medical Care Insurance Act, RSS 1978, S-29 provided that “[t]here is no appeal from the decision of judge pursuant to this section.” Thus, it concerned an express statement, which would fall into the first part of s. 7(3). [26] We note as well that following this Court’s decision in Swanson, the legislature enacted The Interpretation Act, 1993, SS 1993, c. I-11.1, which added the following: Powers to judges 44(1) Where judicial or quasi-judicial powers are given to judge or officer of court, the judge or officer in exercising the powers does so in his or her official capacity and representing his or her court. (2) Without restricting subsection (1), where an appeal lies from person, board, commission or other body to court or judge, an appeal lies from the decision of the court or judge as in the case of any other proceeding in that court or in the court of which the judge is member. (Emphasis added) [27] Section 44(1) of The Interpretation Act, 1993 is reenactment of s. 33 of The Interpretation Act of 1978. Section 44(2) of The Interpretation Act, 1993, however, is new provision. It provides support for the proposition that where Court of Queen’s Bench judge is acting pursuant to right of appeal to that Court, further appeal lies to this Court. This provision is repeated in The Interpretation Act, 1995, SS 1995, I-11.1 in the exact same terms. [28] In conclusion, s. 7(2)(a) of The Court of Appeal Act, 2000 is clear expression of legislative intent establishing the general rule that an appeal lies to the Court of Appeal from decision of the Court of Queen’s Bench or judge of that Court. Silence alone is not an expression of legislative intent as to whether further appeal lies to this Court from decision of the Court of Queen’s Bench. That is the general rule. Section 7(2)(a) is, of course, subject to the need to obtain leave with respect to interlocutory decisions and to the two exceptions contained in s. 7(3): (i) when another enactment provides that there is no appeal from decision of the Court of Queen’s Bench; and (ii) when another enactment confers only limited right of appeal. In both of these circumstances, the other enactment prevails. [29] Neither of those last two circumstances pertains to the application before us. The Psychologists Act does not state that there is no appeal from a decision of the Court of Queen’s Bench. note that the College does not have right to appeal from the decision of the council to the Court of Queen’s Bench, but that does not limit the member’s right of appeal from that Court to this one. [30] For these reasons, the College’s application was dismissed when heard. The question of costs is left for the panel of the Court hearing Dr. Sydiaha’s appeal.

927,"He did not care for the medical community there, his wife had gone back to Edmonton to practice psychiatry and he was getting tired of commuting to Edmonton every weekend.
[8] On March 1, 2000 an article written by Jason Warick entitled “Botched Surgery Leaves Mom Helpless” appeared in the Saskatoon Star Phoenix newspaper.
[11] Prior to these articles appearing in the Star Phoenix, Dr. Graham had never had any complaints regarding his treatment of patients and was doctor in good standing in both Saskatchewan and Alberta.
The letter stated that the articles caused Dr. Graham irreparable damage both professionally and personally and put the newspaper on notice of his intention to bring an action in libel against them.
[14] The day after her discharge, Ms. Cooke returned to the Dawson Creek Hospital complaining of shortness of breath and pain in her abdomen.
[15] As result of this incident, Dr. Graham voluntarily stopped performing laparoscopic surgeries and decided to take upgrading to assuage any negative public opinion in Dawson Creek.
[16] On March 3, 2003 an article entitled “Local Mother ‘Lucky to be Alive’” appeared in the Peace River Block Daily News.
The College issued written report finding no evidence that Dr. Graham was not providing the appropriate level or standard of care to his patients and he was never disciplined.
[19] The Northern Health Authority also investigated his surgeries but never disciplined Dr. Graham, suspended his hospital privileges or pressured him to resign.
[20] With all the negative media publicity, Dr. Graham’s income began to decline.
She would not often stay for cross-examination because by that time she usually had the salient facts or she had to leave to get story out to meet deadline.
She did however make point of attending Dr. Graham’s examination-in-chief and cross-examination as nobody had as yet heard his side of the story.
The voir dire concerned an application to allow number of people to testify in relation to “informed consent”.
He received call from his counsel advising of the result and was “over the moon” that he was found not negligent and finally exonerated.
[30] After supper, Donald Graham went on the internet to search for any stories about the verdict and he came across Ms. Purdy’s November 28 article.
After reading the November 30 article, Dr. Graham was depressed and felt that the newspaper was making the point that he was negligent and the jury was wrong to have exonerated him.
The article made it sound as if the outcome of the trial would have been different had the jury heard from his other patients, that he should not have been given licence to practice in British Columbia and that he should not have been working as doctor.
[32] On December 3, Dr. Graham’s children prepared letter to the Star Phoenix expressing their concerns and providing some rebuttal as to what was being written about their father.
[33] Over the next number of months, Dr. Graham’s children noticed change in their father.
[34] Eventually Dr. Graham decided to bring lawsuit against the Star Phoenix to get back some of the vindication that was lost as result of Ms. Purdy’s articles.
[35] The defendants filed Statement of Defence on June 7, 2010 denying Dr. Graham’s allegations.
(d) Is Dr. Graham entitled to an injunction requiring the defendants to remove certain content from websites under their control?
[38] Postmedia Network Inc. purchased Canwest Publishing Inc. after their claim was filed but before the trial in this matter commenced and are the current owners of the Star Phoenix newspaper and its websites.
Pursuant to Rules 3-72 and 3‑84 of The Queen’s Bench Rules, counsel for Dr. Graham asks me to exercise my discretion and allow the Statement of Claim to be amended to add Postmedia Network Inc. as defendant.
(3) Parties shall make all amendments to their pleadings that are necessary to determine the real questions in issue between the parties.
There is also an affidavit of Rob McLaughlin filed on the court file sworn November 23, 2012 in which he states that he is the editor of the Star Phoenix and that Postmedia Network Inc. is the owner of the Star Phoenix newspaper.
In the defendants’ written submission, counsel reiterated that these two outstanding issues are being raised with his agreement.
[47] Rule 3-84(2) allows the Court to grant leave to add or substitute party at any stage of the action unless prejudice will result that cannot be compensated for.
[48] Here, there is nothing that leads me to believe that Postmedia Network Inc. would suffer prejudice or an injustice if they were added as a defendant at this time.
[49] The presence of Postmedia Network Inc. as defendant will ultimately promote the convenient administration of justice as it will enable the Court to determine the real questions in issue between the parties and effectively and completely adjudicate on all the issues in the action.
Consequently, the limitation period begins to run each and every time defamatory content on the internet is downloaded and viewed.
[52] It is not necessary for plaintiff in every case to prove directly that the words complained of were brought to the actual knowledge of some third party.
In concluding that there was more than ample evidence to support the drawing of an inference that the material on the website was viewed by third parties, Mew J. held that “[t]o find otherwise would be to ignore the realities of twenty-first century communication…”.
[54] The defendants in the present case acknowledged that the articles in question remain on websites controlled by the Star Phoenix, Canwest Publishing Inc. and/or Postmedia Network Inc.
It was part and parcel of their closing argument that to grant an injunction that the defamatory material be removed from their websites would be akin to erasing history.
That being so, it is reasonable conclusion that anyone with search engine could have accessed that material within the last two years and as result the limitation period would not have expired.
[55] Even if am wrong in this reasoning, s. 20 of The Limitations Act allows the Court to add party even after limitation period has expired.
This section states: 20 Notwithstanding the expiry of limitation period after the commencement of proceeding, judge may allow an amendment to the pleadings that asserts new claim or adds or substitutes parties if: (a) the claim asserted by the amendment, or by or against the new party, arises out of the same transaction or occurrence as the original claim; and (b) the judge is satisfied that no party will suffer actual prejudice as result of the amendment.
[58] Dr. Graham takes issue with seven articles written by Chris Purdy, the Star Phoenix reporter tasked with covering the Baert trial.
[59] The defendants argue that the words complained of in the different articles are not capable of bearing the defamatory meanings, either at all or to the extent alleged by Dr. Graham.
[60] Defamation occurs when words are published to third person that contain an imputation which tends to lower the plaintiff in the estimation of right-thinking members of society generally or to expose him to hatred, contempt or ridicule.
Unless the literal meaning is plain and obvious, the plaintiff must plead what he alleges the words were intended to mean.
29 If the plaintiff proves the required elements, the onus then shifts to the defendant to advance defence in order to escape liability.
27 In executing the first role, the question is whether the words complained of are reasonably capable of being understood in defamatory sense.
(2) Nothing in this section authorizes the publication of blasphemous, seditious or indecent matter.
“It’s clear this case is about young family whose lives were unimaginably changed,” said lawyer Sandra Weber.
But he would not tell patients the consequences of such an injury include septic shock or death, because the event is so rare.
She said Graham further failed Baert by proceeding with the surgery, after another doctor diagnosed her with postpartum depression and prescribed her anti-depressants.
She said Graham also admitted he was “crunched for time,” with three other surgeries scheduled the same morning as Baert’s operation.
Graham’s defence lawyers have argued the nurses obviously gave bad advice over the phone, and Baert should have followed the instructions by returning to the hospital.
Alternatively they rely on the privilege accorded to newspapers reporting on court proceedings pursuant to s. 11 of The Libel and Slander Act and the defence of responsible communication.
An ordinary person reading this would be mindful that this trial is not finished, that no determination has yet been made as to whether Dr. Graham has done anything wrong and that what is being said here are arguments jury is going to have to consider.
[73] Even if am wrong in this conclusion, the words complained of are not actionable by reason of the privilege afforded the defendants under s. 11 of The Libel and Slander Act.
(ii) November 28, 2007 Article [74] This article was only published on the Star Phoenix internet sites.
It read as follows: Gynecologist not negligent in tubal ligation lawsuit The gynecologist found not negligent Wednesday in the case of Lloydminster mother left with devastating injuries after routine tubal ligation recently settled second lawsuit with another patient who nearly died following the same surgery.
The jurors did not have to be unanimous, but five of the six had to agree on each question posed in six-page verdict sheet in order to reach their decision.
She returned to hospital second time, and another doctor discovered she was suffering from septic shock.
But four months later, Dawson Creek media reported 35-year-old Dana McLellan had to be air-lifted to Vancouver after Graham cut her bladder during hysterectomy.
[76] Counsel for the defendants agreed that the italicized portions of this article were defamatory insofar as they implied that Dr. Graham was negligent in his treatment of Gloria Cooke and Dana McLellan.
He acknowledged that the statutory defence of privilege under s. 11 of The Libel and Slander Act was not available as this article was not contemporaneous reporting of court proceedings.
However, am also satisfied that reasonable person would conclude that these words are reasonably capable of being given the extended meaning ascribed to them by Dr. Graham.
[78] The byline references that Dr. Graham was not negligent in the lawsuit but the context of the article as whole and the specific words complained of make it appear that the jury was wrong to find him not at fault for Ms. Baert’s injuries.
[79] The words themselves do not simply point to Dr. Graham being negligent in his treatment of Ms. Cooke and Ms. McLellan but go farther that he caused Ms. Cooke specific injury and nearly death and that he put Ms. McLellan’s life in jeopardy.
[80] There is only one paragraph in the article speaking about Ms. McLellan but by using the words “air-lifted to Vancouver” the meaning is that the cut to her bladder was so serious that she needed to be flown to bigger hospital to be treated.
The first of these articles reads as follows: Gynecologist not negligent Punctured bowel led to brain damage The gynecologist found not negligent Wednesday in the case of Lloydminster mother left with devastating injuries after routine tubal ligation recently settled second lawsuit with another patient who nearly died following the same surgery.
The jurors did not have to be unanimous, but five of the six had to agree on each question posed in six-page verdict sheet in order to reach their decision.
She returned to hospital second time, and another doctor discovered she was suffering from septic shock.
But four months later, Dawson Creek media reported 35-year-old Dana McLellan had to be air-lifted to Vancouver after Graham cut her bladder during hysterectomy.
[85] From my perspective it would be superfluous for me to reiterate my reasoning and comments from the previous article here and see no need to do so.
Her bowel was repaired but because of reduced blood flow and dead tissue, doctors had to amputate her hands at the wrist and her legs below the knees.
The hospital and nurses settled out of court for an undisclosed sum shortly before the trial began in September, leaving Graham the lone defendant.
Graham also argued Baert was partially responsible for her injuries for not returning to the hospital when she experienced increasing pain at home following the surgery.
They claimed Graham used improper technique during the surgery and should have known that he punctured her bowel when equipment in the operating room measured high pressure reading.
[89] The defendants admit that the plain meaning of the words complained of in this article are defamatory insofar as they mean that Dr. Graham was negligent in his treatment of Ms. Baert.
After nine weeks of testimony in the civil trial, the six-member jury all women decided Graham had Lisa’s informed consent to perform the surgery and provided standard level of care both during and after the operation.
Graham’s lawyers argued bowel perforations are rare but recognized risks of tubal ligations, and it was up to the nurses to watch for symptoms of complications after the surgery.
Because Lisa was not mentally capable of testifying in the case, Mark told the jury Lisa and concerned neighbour called the hospital three times about her pain following the surgery.
The majority of damages claimed in the lawsuit $8.7 million were ear-marked for future health-care costs to move Lisa into private group home.
[Italics are mine] [94] It was Dr. Graham’s argument that the italicized words in this article were false, malicious and defamatory and were understood to mean: (a) He negligently performed surgery on Lisa Baert, thereby causing her to suffer devastating injuries; (b) The verdict of the jury exonerating him of negligence in his treatment of Lisa Baert was perverse; (c) He negligently performed surgery on Gloria Cooke, thereby nearly causing her death; (d) He negligently performed surgery on Gloria Cooke, thereby causing her to suffer permanent chronic pain and an incisional hernia in her abdomen; and (e) He is guilty of habitual negligence in his surgical practice and should not be permitted to carry on practice as surgeon because of the unacceptable risk he poses to the life and health of patients.
[96] The defendants agreed that to the extent that the italicized words in this article meant that Dr. Graham negligently performed surgeries on Lisa Baert and Gloria Cooke, they were defamatory.
reasonable person looking at these words would obviously say that Dr. Graham negligently performed surgery on her that nearly caused her death and resulted in her suffering permanent chronic pain and an incisional hernia in her abdomen.
[99] In addition to the article speaking of Dr. Graham’s negligent surgery on Ms. Baert and the injuries she suffered as result of that, the article also speaks of Ms. Baert being upset to learn that the jury’s decision resulted in the dismissal of her lawsuit against Dr. Graham, that Dr. Graham was sued by Gloria Cooke in British Columbia in similar case and he settled with her.
reasonable man would glean that he has already ceased practicing medicine as result of his own medical issues and is not concern anymore.
The article read: Former patient wanted chance to confront doctor Dr. Kenneth Graham made surgical mistakes that led to complications with four other patients before the tubal ligation on Lloydminster mother Lisa Baert in 1999 left her quadriplegic with brain damage.
Although her knee is still numb and has no reflex, her leg has recovered about 85 per cent of its normal functions.
Graham’s lawyers argued bowel perforations are rare but recognized risks of tubal ligations, and it was up to the nurses to watch for symptoms of complications after the surgery.
After three weeks in intensive care, she left with an ileostomy bag that she would need for the rest of her life.
The 52-year-old said when she woke up in the Lloydminster hospital, Graham told her she’d had “complete” hysterectomy but he left one ovary to help her through menopause.
Who did this to you?’” Lynn Laursen said Graham cut the main artery feeding her left leg during hysterectomy in Lloydminster in 1997.
“He would have had to make close call.” Luther said Baert’s lawyers may have grounds for an appeal because there is not much precedent on the issue in the civil courts.
[Italics are mine] [102] Dr. Graham argued that the italicized words in this article contained false, malicious and defamatory words that were understood to mean: (a) He negligently performed surgery on Lisa Baert, thereby causing her to become quadriplegic, to suffer septic shock, severe brain damage and the amputation of her hands and feet; (b) He negligently performed surgery on Sharry Michels, causing her to suffer permanent numbness and the loss of reflex in her right knee; (c) His negligent acts and omissions in his treatment of Sharry Michels warranted severe disciplinary sanction by the College of Physicians and Surgeons of Saskatchewan; (d) He negligently performed surgery on Gloria Cooke nearly causing her death and causing her to suffer chronic pain and an incisional hernia in her abdomen; (e) He negligently performed surgery on Jessie Isabelle Hurlburt nearly causing her immediate death and resulting in her requiring an ileostomy bag for the rest of her life; (f) The complications caused by his negligent surgery resulted in Jessie Isabelle Hurlburt suffering encephalitis, brain infection, which eventually led to her death; (g) His aforesaid conduct concerning Jessie Isabelle Hurlburt warranted severe disciplinary sanction by the College of Physicians and Surgeons of Saskatchewan; (h) He dishonestly and deceitfully misrepresented to Marleen Burgess that he had performed complete hysterectomy on her; (i) He negligently performed surgery on Marleen Burgess creating surgical mess; (j) He negligently performed surgery on Lynn Laursen, nearly causing her death and the loss of her left leg; and (k) He is guilty of habitual negligence in his surgical practice and should not be permitted to carry on practice as surgeon because of the unacceptable risk he poses to the life and health of patients.
[105] Once again, am satisfied that the natural and ordinary meaning of the words complained of go farther than simply that he was negligent in his treatment of these six individuals.
But it is apparent to anyone reading the words that as result of that negligent surgery, she has permanent numbness and no reflex in her right knee.
Ms. Michels is not referenced in any other articles except this one and the words make it clear that she did not pursue either lawsuit or complaint to the College after receiving legal advice.
The construction of these paragraphs does not allow one to draw the conclusion that Dr. Graham’s treatment of her warranted severe disciplinary sanction.
The reasonable person would interpret these words as meaning that based on the legal advice she received, there was no point pursuing complaint about Dr. Graham to the College.
Ms. Cooke almost died after Dr. Graham twice punctured her bowel during tubal ligation in 2002 and after several life-saving surgeries she has chronic pain and an incisional hernia in her abdomen.
[109] There are words in the paragraphs complained of that relate to another of Dr. Graham’s former patients, Jessie Isabelle Hurlburt.
[110] These words though do not leave one believing that she developed encephalitis as complication of Dr. Graham’s negligent surgery on her some four years earlier.
[111] am also not satisfied that looking at these words by themselves, in the context of the article as whole or in light of the previous articles complained of, that reasonable person would take from the words that as result of Dr. Graham’s negligent surgical conduct severe disciplinary sanction by the Saskatchewan College of Physicians and Surgeons was warranted.
Read in this light, reasonable person would understand that these words meant that Dr. Graham’s treatment of Ms. Hurlburt did not warrant disciplinary sanction from the College.
In the context of the article as whole or in relation to the previous articles complained of, there is nothing that would lead person to believe that Dr. Graham made the misrepresentation to Ms. Burgess dishonestly or deceitfully.
The clear meaning of these words to anyone reading them is that Dr. Graham negligently performed surgery on Ms. Laursen nearly causing her death and the loss of her left leg.
[114] Finally, Dr. Graham argues that the words and paragraphs he has identified as problematic lead to the defamatory meaning that he is guilty of habitual negligence and should not be permitted to carry on practice as surgeon because of the unacceptable risk he poses to the life and health of patients.
Looking at all of the words Dr. Graham complains of and the context of the entire article, an ordinary person would reasonably interpret that Dr. Graham was habitually negligent in his surgical practice.
(vii) The January 3, 2008 Article [115] This is the last article that Dr. Graham complains of.
The notice asks the province’s top court to find Dr. Kenneth Graham liable and assess damages or order second trial in Saskatoon.
During the laparoscopic operation, Graham unknowingly punctured Baert’s bowel and the two-millimetre hole allowed toxins to leak into her body.
Baert’s lawyers argued Graham did not get informed consent for the surgery, used improper technique and should have known he punctured her bowel when equipment in the operating room measured high pressure reading.
[Italics are mine] [116] Dr. Graham states that the natural and ordinary meaning of the italicized words in this article are false, malicious and defamatory and were understood to mean: (a) He negligently performed surgery on Lisa Baert, thereby causing her to suffer septic shock, the amputation of her hands and feet and severe brain damage; (b) He performed surgery on Lisa Baert without her informed consent; and (c) He deliberately and deceitfully concealed from Lisa Baert and from her nurses the fact that he had punctured her bowel during surgery thereby unconscionably exposing his patient to the risk of death or severe injury.
[118] Defendants’ counsel argued that the natural and ordinary meaning of the words complained of is non-defamatory.
The plain meaning of these words is that Dr. Graham unknowingly punctured Ms. Baert’s bowel thereby allowing toxins to leak into her body, two days later she returned to the hospital in an ambulance suffering from septic shock and consequently doctors had to amputate her hands and feet and she suffered brain damage.
reasonable person looking at this article in its entirety would understand that Dr. Graham was found not negligent of puncturing Ms. Baert’s bowel and causing her these devastating injuries and the Baerts have appealed this decision.
[123] Even looking at the combined effect of all of the previous articles complained of by Dr. Graham, reasonable person would still not be left with the impression that these words meant that Dr. Graham performed surgery on Ms. Baert without her informed consent and that he deliberately and deceitfully concealed from her and the nurses that he had punctured her bowel thereby unconscionably exposing her to risk of death or severe injury.
[125] Having reached this conclusion, must determine the liability of the remaining defendants.
[133] The defendant, Canwest Publishing Inc. owned the Star Phoenix newspaper and its websites and employed the other named defendants.
He argued that general damages award in defamation case is very subjective determination and one that must be made where there is no tangible injury.
[141] Defendants’ counsel argued that Dr. Graham was only entitled to general damages in an amount not exceeding $25,000.
Compensatory damages are not awarded to punish defendant, nor should they be used to enrich the plaintiff at the expense of the offending party.
[130] General damages for defamation are at large, meaning that the court is entitled to make subjective assessment without requiring proof of specific financial loss.
[146] In Hill Cory J. described aggravated damages, what is required before they can be awarded and some of the factors court can consider in assessing them: 188 Aggravated damages may be awarded in circumstances where the defendants' conduct has been particularly high-handed or oppressive, thereby increasing the plaintiff's humiliation and anxiety arising from the libellous statement.
Their assessment requires consideration by the jury of the entire conduct of the defendant prior to the publication of the libel and continuing through to the conclusion of the trial.
191 There are number of factors that jury may properly take into account in assessing aggravated damages.
If there was, this may go far to establishing that there was no malicious conduct on the part of the defendant warranting an award of aggravated damages.
[147] As to what constitutes malice, it is more expansive than the everyday meaning of desire to harm another.
Court may consider the whole of the defendants’ conduct and the context in which it was made, both current and former.
But indifference to the truth of what he publishes is not to be equated with carelessness, impulsiveness or irrationality in arriving at positive belief that it is true.
[150] Ms. Purdy did not recall attending court on November 27, 2007 to listen to the judge’s charge to the jury.
Ms. Purdy agreed that these were important points in the judge’s charge that reader should or would want to know, however she acknowledged that she did not put them in any of her articles.
[151] Ms. Purdy testified that after the verdict came down on November 28, she wrote an article entitled “Gynecologist not negligent in tubal ligation lawsuit”.
She said that this article does not report solely on the jury’s verdict in the case but includes allegations that Gloria Cooke and Dana McLellan suffered complications as result of the surgery Dr. Graham performed upon them.
She acknowledged that these were serious allegations being made by these two women and as result, she would have spoken to another source to verify their information.
[152] Ms. Purdy said that in her notes from her discussions with Mr. Jordan, she recorded “pressure from maternity ward because baby in distress”.
[153] As well, Ms. Purdy said that all of her information about Dana McLellan came from previous newspaper articles.
[155] In one of the paragraphs in the article she stated that the British Columbia College of Physicians and Surgeons granted licence to Dr. Graham “despite” Baert’s injuries in Saskatchewan.
She said that she chose to use the word “despite” because she felt that the College would have had to have considered the Baert case before giving Dr. Graham licence.
[156] Ms. Purdy did speak to Susan Prins of the College and was advised that the community Dr. Graham was working in did not have appropriate back-up in case of an emergency situation and that “no disciplinary measure is necessary”.
[157] Ms. Purdy acknowledged that she spoke to someone at the Northern Health Authority and was advised that Dr. Graham was “never disciplined so no release of report and no penalty”.
She did not recall whose decision it was to write the second article on November 29 entitled “Routine surgery became health nightmare”.
She agreed that she did not refer to the verdict in the trial in this story and that person reading this article would have no reason to think that Dr. Graham got acquitted in negligence action.
[160] Ms. Purdy testified that she wrote the December 1, 2007 article because number of Dr. Graham’s previous patients were saying that they had suffered complications as result of Dr. Graham performing surgery on them.
[161] According to Ms. Purdy, this article was about mistakes that Dr. Graham had made in relation to five other people besides Lisa Baert.
[164] Ms. Purdy said that she received number of documents from Les Hurlburt about his mother Jessie, including medical records.
Moreover she admitted that she made no effort to contact the doctor who told Ms. Burgess that her insides were “a mess” to confirm whether or not that was indeed the case.
[169] Ms. Purdy did not recall if she made any attempt to contact Dr. Graham regarding any of these five people but she hoped that she would have.
[172] Mr. Miller testified that journalists are expected to follow commonly accepted journalistic legal and ethical standards developed by the Canadian Association of Journalists.
Before journalist publishes criticisms or accusations they must give people, companies or organizations that are being criticized or accused the opportunity to respond.
According to Mr. Miller, the job of these stories was to report the jury’s verdict in complicated legal case that the newspaper had been covering for the last two months.
These stories should have summarized the key testimony presented at the trial and if possible, highlight what evidence may have caused the jury to find Dr. Graham not negligent.
[174] These articles did not meet the journalistic standard of care for two reasons: firstly they were not fair, balanced reporting of the verdict in the Baert trial.
Secondly, the investigative reporting of Dr. Graham’s other patients should have been stand-alone article written after the reporter had the opportunity to do more thorough job of investigating the allegations.
Unfortunately, he felt that they allowed inadmissible material to get in these articles and they never ensured that Ms. Purdy’s information about Ms. Cooke or Ms. McLellan was verified with anyone.
Instead, this was single-sourced and second-hand information from lawyer and newspaper article and there was little differentiation between what was verified as fact and what the sources merely alleged.
[176] It was Mr. Miller’s opinion that the December 1, 2007 article entitled “Former Patient Wanted Chance to Confront Doctor” repeated some of the unverified information that appeared in the November 28 and 29 stories and added more cases.
Again however, there was no attempt to verify the allegations these people were making with doctor or to seek Dr. Graham’s side of the story.
He noted that this material contained detailed explanation written by Dr. Graham of the care that he gave to Jessie Hurlburt and statement from the Saskatchewan College of Physicians and Surgeons about why they found that he had done nothing wrong.
Ms. Purdy chose to use very little of this information in the December article and by choosing to do so, Mr. Miller felt her story became very one sided.
[179] Mr. Miller felt that the reporter did slipshod investigation, the newspaper rushed this to print and by doing so vitiated any claim of responsible reporting.
Nothing like that occurred and as such, reasonably intelligent reader looking at this December story might ask if the newspaper was implying that the jury in the Baert trial was wrong.
[181] In Mr. Miller’s opinion, the November 28, 29 and December articles written by Ms. Purdy fell short of journalism’s recognized professional standards of care and her editors did not exercise ongoing oversight to ensure that her information was verified and her reports were handled responsibly.
She explained that journalists must give people, organizations or companies that are publicly accused or criticized an opportunity to respond before publishing those accusations or criticisms.
In her opinion, this article was not complete and readers were left without enough information to consider whether they thought the jury got it right.
[187] Instead, she felt that Ms. Purdy took the first opportunity after the trial to tell people about the other complaints about Dr. Graham that she became aware of.
[190] Putting aside this problem with her testimony, she does acknowledge that this November 29 article is still missing detail about the judge’s charge to the jury that would allow readers to understand exactly what they were being asked to consider in deciding whether Dr. Graham was negligent or not.
[191] Ms. Bell testified that the December 1, 2007 story was an attempt by the newspaper to bring information to the public that they needed to know.
If reporter did not accurately report on factual or legal issue and left the reader with the wrong impression, this would not meet the standards of journalism.
[192] Although her report was to the contrary, Ms. Bell agreed in cross-examination that the inclusion of these other complaints in this article left the reader thinking that the jury in the Baert case got the decision wrong.
The size of newsrooms is eroding and the opportunities were rare for editors to stop and consider the big picture of how court case might be covered and delivered in substantial and balanced way.
Defendants’ counsel admitted that these five articles contained defamatory comments about Dr. Graham, although not to the extent that eventually determined.
[200] Defamatory comments regarding Dr. Graham’s negligent surgical treatment of Ms. Baert appeared in all five articles written by Ms. Purdy.
The defamatory meaning that Dr. Graham was habitually negligent in his surgical practice and that the jury’s verdict exonerating him was wrong was repeated in two articles.
He felt that the article contained number of factual inaccuracies, that it implied that his medical licence should have been revoked and made it appear that he was lucky to have been exonerated by the jury in the Baert case.
However, this and the fact that he had been found not liable in the Baert case was either not reported in the articles or very little was ever said about it.
Dr. Graham admitted that in 2002 and 2003 after people in Dawson Creek found out about the Baert case, complaints about his treatment of patients began occurring.
Both Mr. Miller and Ms. Bell agreed on number of points including that some of the articles written by Ms. Purdy fell short of meeting journalism’s recognized professional standards of care.
[207] In her written report filed as an exhibit in the proceedings, Ms. Bell goes through the articles in question.
[208] As consider what is an appropriate award for general damages in this case, am also surprised at the lack of editorial oversight of Ms. Purdy’s articles.
This, despite evidence that the editors would get together daily to talk about stories that were being written by their reporters.
[209] Taking all these factors into account I conclude that an award of $50,000 for general damages would be appropriate.
[210] There is no question in this case that the series of articles written by Ms. Purdy increased Dr. Graham’s mental distress.
If aggravated damages are to be awarded in this instance, I must be satisfied that the defendants were motivated by actual or express malice.
[216] Moreover, if this was just follow-up article about the Baerts’ reaction to the verdict then have to wonder why Ms. Purdy felt she had to repeat the Gloria Cooke information in the story.
[217] The December 1, 2007 article reinforces my conclusion that Ms. Purdy felt that the jury was wrong in their verdict.
Both experts again admit that this article did not have to run immediately after the trial and that Ms. Purdy should have taken more time to investigate the allegations made by these five other people properly and to verify their information.
Reading this series of articles culminating in this December article leads to no other conclusion than that the jury was wrong to find Dr. Graham not negligent in his surgical treatment of Ms. Baert.
[220] However, I am additionally led to the inescapable conclusion that Ms. Purdy did not believe that the jury had reached the proper verdict in the Baert case.
Rather than properly reporting on the jury’s verdict, Ms. Purdy deliberately chose to report on other people who had made complaints about the surgical care Dr. Graham provided them.
By writing the articles that she did in the time frame that she did and in the fashion that she did, she could only have had one purpose in mind and that was to tell readers that Dr. Graham was negligent in his surgical practice and that the jury’s verdict was wrong.
[221] Where an employee is acting in the course of his or her employment, any malice motivating his or her behaviour will be attributed to his or her employer.
(d) Is Dr. Graham entitled to an injunction requiring the defendants to remove certain content from websites under their control?
[21] Permanent injunctions have consistently been ordered after findings of defamation where either (1) there is likelihood that the defendant will continue to publish defamatory statements despite the finding that he is liable to the plaintiff for defamation; or (2) there is real possibility that the plaintiff will not receive any compensation, given that enforcement against the defendant of any damage award may not be possible: see Hunter Dickinson Inc. v. Butler, [2010] B.C.J.
[224] In the present case almost years have gone by since the defamatory articles in question were published by the Star Phoenix.
There is no evidence before me that would lead me to conclude that in light of my decision, the defendants will continue to publish defamatory statements about Dr. Graham.","HELD: The action was allowed.
The defendants had defamed the plaintiff and he was entitled to damages in the amount of $100,000.
The court found the following with respect to each issue: 1) it would substitute Postmedia as a defendant pursuant to Queen’s Bench rule 3-84(2) as it was the successor to Canwest and was aware of the plaintiff’s claim when it purchased the Star Phoenix and it would not be prejudiced.
It would not deprive Postmedia of a defence under s. 5 of The Limitations Act because the articles remained on Postmedia’s websites and were republished whenever they were viewed or downloaded; 2) after reviewing each of the articles and assessing the words complained of, it found that the words constituted defamation; 3) all of the defendants were found to be joint tortfeasors with Purdy because they participated in the publication of a libel and were jointly and severally liable in defamation to the plaintiff; and 3) an appropriate award for general damages was $50,000.
The court allowed the claim for aggravated damages as the defendants were found to be motivated by actual or express malice because Purdy did not simply report the jury’s verdict in her articles but indicated that she believed that the jury had not reached the proper verdict in the trial.
She deliberately chose to report the stories of people who had made complaints about the surgical care provided to them by the plaintiff without verifying it or seeking comment from the plaintiff.
As she was acting in the course of her employment, Purdy’s malice was attributed to all the defendants.
The plaintiff was awarded $50,000 in aggravated damages.",823,"QUEEN’S BENCH FOR SASKATCHEWAN Citation: 2017 SKQB 42 Date: 2017 02 07 Docket: QB 827 of 2010 Judicial Centre: Saskatoon BETWEEN: KENNETH GRAHAM and CHRIS PURDY, ROD NICKEL, STEVEN GIBB, CAMERON HUTCHINSON, DALE BRIN, JOHN DOE and CANWEST PUBLISHING INC. Counsel: Alan McConchie for the plaintiff F. William Johnson, Q.C. for the defendants JUDGMENT D.E. LABACH J. February 7, 2017 INTRODUCTION [1] On November 24, 2009, Kenneth Graham commenced libel action against Chris Purdy, Rod Nickel, Steven Gibb, Cameron Hutchinson, Dale Brin, John Doe and Canwest Publishing Inc. [collectively the defendants] alleging that the defendants, acting alone or in concert, had published defamatory comments about him in series of articles in the Star Phoenix newspaper and on websites owned and operated by the newspaper and Canwest Publishing Inc. As result of the publication of these defamatory comments, Dr. Graham said that he suffered loss and damage to his professional and civic reputation and that such loss or damage will continue into the future in light of his professional standing. [2] On June 7, 2010 the defendants filed Statement of Defence to the claim wherein they did not deny publishing the words complained of, in the various articles complained of, but denied that the words were defamatory or that they were made with malice, deliberate calculation or recklessness. According to the defendants, the words complained of formed part of the defendants’ series of fair and accurate contemporaneous reporting of the civil jury proceedings in case involving Dr. Graham in the Saskatchewan Court of Queen’s Bench and that such words fell under the umbrella of “responsible communication”. As such, they have not published any retraction or apology nor does it appear that they have removed the alleged offensive articles from their websites. However, if any one or more of the alleged defamatory meanings are actionable, the defendants believe that Dr. Graham’s reputation was so tarnished at the time of the publications complained of that he did not suffer any damages or loss of reputation at all. [3] On July 14, 1999, Lisa Baert went to the Lloydminster Hospital for tubal ligation. This routine day surgery was performed by Dr. Graham, an obstetrician and gynecologist practicing in Lloydminster. Dr. Graham had done many tubal ligations and Ms. Baert’s surgery appeared to go well. She was discharged later that day and returned home. [4] On July 16, Ms. Baert was rushed back to the hospital in an ambulance, suffering from septic shock. Dr. Graham and general surgeon operated on her and discovered 2-millimetre puncture in her small bowel. The puncture had apparently occurred when Dr. Graham had done the tubal ligation two days earlier. The surgeon removed small portion of Ms. Baert’s bowel. While in surgery she went into cardiac arrest. They stabilized her and made arrangements to air lift her to the Royal Alexandra Hospital in Edmonton, Alberta. [5] In Edmonton, Ms. Baert had to have both her hands and feet amputated. She suffered some brain damage. She spent year in the hospital and at rehabilitation centre before returning to Lloydminster to live in care home. [6] On October 8, 1999 Lisa Baert filed claim in the Saskatchewan Court of Queen’s Bench against Dr. Graham, the Lloydminster Hospital and several nurses alleging negligence. [7] Prior to Baert’s surgery, Dr. Graham had decided to leave Lloydminster. He did not care for the medical community there, his wife had gone back to Edmonton to practice psychiatry and he was getting tired of commuting to Edmonton every weekend. Unfortunately he was unable to find position in Edmonton. Dawson Creek, British Columbia was looking for an obstetrician and gynecologist at this time and they offered him job. He liked the city, the compensation was attractive and in November 1999, he moved to Dawson Creek to practice. [8] On March 1, 2000 an article written by Jason Warick entitled “Botched Surgery Leaves Mom Helpless” appeared in the Saskatoon Star Phoenix newspaper. The article was about Ms. Baert’s surgery. The article came to Dr. Graham’s attention. He was shocked by it. He felt that it was inaccurate, inflammatory and very one-sided. It described Ms. Baert’s bowel as having been “sliced open” when there was only small 2-millimetre puncture in it. The article said that he ignored Mr. Baert when he came out of the operating room but he did not. He spoke to Mr. Baert immediately following the surgery. [9] On March and 3, 2000, two more articles written by Jason Warick appeared in the Star Phoenix. The first, entitled “Mom Longs to be Home with Her Family”, said that Ms. Baert’s bowel had been “slit open” and it described her care as “grossly negligent, malicious, arrogant, and high-handed”. The second article was entitled “Couple Fed Up with Long Wait for Compensation”. This article referred to “botched surgery”, that Ms. Baert’s “intestines were lacerated” and that the surgery was performed in “grossly negligent, malicious, arrogant, and high-handed manner calculated to ignore the rights and objections and complaints of Lisa [Baert]”. Dr. Graham was shocked by these articles and felt they were misleading. [10] On March 9, 2000 an article entitled “Lawsuit News to Hospital that Hired Gynecologist” appeared in the Star Phoenix. This article said that the Dawson Creek Hospital and South Peace Health Council had no clue that Dr. Graham was facing the Baert lawsuit when they hired him. This however was false. The hospital and health council did know about the lawsuit before they hired Dr. Graham because he had told them about it. [11] Prior to these articles appearing in the Star Phoenix, Dr. Graham had never had any complaints regarding his treatment of patients and was doctor in good standing in both Saskatchewan and Alberta. However, the local newspaper in Dawson Creek picked up on these Star Phoenix articles, began reporting on them and started phone line so patients could voice any complaints about Dr. Graham’s treatment of them. In response, and on the advice of the Saskatchewan counsel representing him in the Baert claim, Dr. Graham issued press release and gave press conference in Dawson Creek to counteract what he perceived to be media smear campaign. [12] In conjunction with his press release and press conference, his counsel sent letter dated March 10, 2000 to the editor of the Star Phoenix complaining about the articles written by Jason Warick. The letter stated that the articles caused Dr. Graham irreparable damage both professionally and personally and put the newspaper on notice of his intention to bring an action in libel against them. These articles and the attention they were attracting in the community was giving Dr. Graham bad reputation. [13] In 2002, Dr. Graham performed tubal ligation on Gloria Cooke at the Dawson Creek Hospital. Unbeknownst to the plaintiff, Ms. Cooke had had previous surgery on her bowel and uterus. He noted this at the beginning of the surgery when he inserted camera into her. This made the surgery somewhat more difficult but he continued. In the middle of Ms. Cooke’s surgery, he received an urgent call about pregnant woman in the maternity ward and problems with the baby’s heart rate. He was the only obstetrician and gynecologist in Dawson Creek but finished Ms. Cooke’s surgery before rushing off to deal with this other patient. He kept Ms. Cooke in the hospital overnight for observation. The next day she appeared fine so he discharged her with instructions. [14] The day after her discharge, Ms. Cooke returned to the Dawson Creek Hospital complaining of shortness of breath and pain in her abdomen. Worried she was becoming septic and with no surgeon on call in Dawson Creek, arrangements were made for her to be transferred to Grande Prairie Hospital for immediate surgery. During her surgery in Grande Prairie, she was noted to have small bowel perforation. She was eventually transferred to Edmonton University Hospital for some further surgeries, following which she eventually made full recovery. [15] As result of this incident, Dr. Graham voluntarily stopped performing laparoscopic surgeries and decided to take upgrading to assuage any negative public opinion in Dawson Creek. On December 11, 2002 an article appeared in the Vancouver Sun reporting on Ms. Cooke’s complications and linking the plaintiff’s voluntary suspension of laparoscopic surgeries to this and the Baert case. Similar articles appeared in the Peace River Block Daily News and the Alaska Highway News over the next number of weeks. [16] On March 3, 2003 an article entitled “Local Mother ‘Lucky to be Alive’” appeared in the Peace River Block Daily News. This was story about Dana McLellan. Dr. Graham had performed surgery on her in February 2003 and inserted catheter into her bladder. After surgery there was some blood in her urine. Dr. Graham called specialist and they inserted camera into her bladder. They noticed some blood and clots so they took her back into surgery and repaired small cut in her bladder. Ms. McLellan was stable for few days but eventually was transferred to Vancouver because of nursing requirements. The article made it sound as if Ms. McLellan almost died but that was not the case. [17] On March 5, 2003 another article appeared in the Peace River Block Daily News. The byline in this article read “Third Patient Comes Forward: Complications Followed Surgery to Remove Cyst”. This female patient had been referred to Dr. Graham because of chronic pelvic pain. When he performed surgery on her he noted lot of adhesions and that her ovary was stuck to her bowel. He called surgeon who attended and dissected the ovary off the bowel. In the course of performing the dissection, the surgeon cut the patient’s urator. He brought this to the surgeon’s attention and she stitched it up. Unfortunately the patient developed leakage out of the stitches and had to be transferred to Prince George where urologist fixed the problem. Although the article seemed to blame Dr. Graham for this woman’s problems, he was not responsible for cutting her urator. [18] Complaints were made to the British Columbia College of Physicians and Surgeons following these surgeries and Dr. Graham was investigated. The College issued written report finding no evidence that Dr. Graham was not providing the appropriate level or standard of care to his patients and he was never disciplined. As regards the Gloria Cooke surgery, the College suggested that he should have stopped the surgery when he noted the tissue mass from the undisclosed surgery. Despite this, they did not find that his continuing with the surgery fell below the appropriate standard of patient care. Ms. Cooke eventually started lawsuit against Dr. Graham. It was settled with no liability on his part. [19] The Northern Health Authority also investigated his surgeries but never disciplined Dr. Graham, suspended his hospital privileges or pressured him to resign. [20] With all the negative media publicity, Dr. Graham’s income began to decline. While he was not shunned by colleagues, they made fewer referrals to him. He also began receiving hate mail. In May 2003, Dr. Graham suffered heart attack and at the end of July 2003 had quintuple bypass surgery. He also began suffering some depression. Dr. Graham decided to cease practicing in Dawson Creek and he retired to St. Albert, Alberta. [21] Dr. Graham and his wife had five children. On May 24, 2007, his oldest son committed suicide. On August 19 his wife died of cancer. On September 17 the Baert trial began in Saskatchewan Court of Queen’s Bench. The hospital and the nurses settled out of court but Dr. Graham continued to deny that he was negligent. [22] The trial garnered considerable media interest both in Saskatchewan and across Canada. Chris Purdy, one of the reporters at the Star Phoenix newspaper, was sent to cover the trial. Prior to attending the trial, Ms. Purdy attempted to familiarize herself with the case. In that regard, she read articles that had previously been written about the case, she tried to find other stories the newspaper wrote about the case and she searched other jurisdictions to see if any other articles about the case came up. [23] Ms. Purdy attended the first day of trial but did not attend each and every day of the trial thereafter. She tried to find out when certain witnesses would be testifying and would attend for their examinations-in-chief. She would not often stay for cross-examination because by that time she usually had the salient facts or she had to leave to get story out to meet deadline. She did however make point of attending Dr. Graham’s examination-in-chief and cross-examination as nobody had as yet heard his side of the story. She kept notes of all her attendances at the trial and what occurred when she was there. [24] During the trial, Ms. Purdy observed voir dire. The voir dire concerned an application to allow number of people to testify in relation to “informed consent”. It was during this voir dire that she learned the names of some of Dr. Graham’s former patients or obtained them from Ms. Baert’s counsel. [25] Ms. Purdy attended court on November 22, 2007 to hear the closing arguments of Dr. Graham’s counsel and then again on November 23 to hear the closing arguments of Ms. Baert’s counsel. She next attended court on November 27 to hear the judge’s charge to the jury. She made detailed notes of what she heard on all of these dates. On November 28, 2007, after 51 days of trial, the jury found Dr. Graham not negligent for Ms. Baert’s injuries. [26] Ms. Purdy wrote series of articles about the case during and after the trial. All of these articles were published in the Star Phoenix newspaper and/or on the newspaper’s websites. Following closing submissions, she wrote an article entitled “Final Arguments in Surgery Suit Heard by Court”. This article was published on page A13 of the November 24, 2007 edition of the Star Phoenix and appeared on its websites on that same date. [27] On November 28, 2007, the day the verdict came down, neither Ms. Baert nor Dr. Graham were present in court. After the verdict, Ms. Purdy spoke to Ms. Baert’s counsel regarding the possibility of an appeal. She later spoke to number of people including Les Hurlburt, Lynn Laursen, Sharry Michels and Marleen Burgess. All of these people were either previous patients of Dr. Graham or relatives of his prior patients. She wrote an article entitled “Gynecologist Not Negligent in Tubal Ligation Lawsuit” and it was published on the newspaper’s websites later on November 28. [28] Dr. Graham was at home in St. Albert when the verdict came down. He received call from his counsel advising of the result and was “over the moon” that he was found not negligent and finally exonerated. He organized celebratory supper for him and his children that night at his residence. [29] Donald Graham was living with his father at the time and working on his master’s degree. He described his father as being very excited about the jury’s decision and the case being finished. Another son, Mark, echoed these comments about his father’s reaction to the verdict. Over supper, the Graham family spoke of this being point to move on from given everything their family had recently been through. [30] After supper, Donald Graham went on the internet to search for any stories about the verdict and he came across Ms. Purdy’s November 28 article. They all read the article and the mood changed. Dr. Graham was shocked, mad, dumbfounded, baffled and unhappy that there was nothing in the article about him being vindicated. He felt it was full of untruths and distortions and that it made it appear that he was lucky to have been exonerated in the trial. Nobody from the Star Phoenix had tried to contact him to discuss the verdict or the contents of this article. He felt depressed. [31] Ms. Purdy wrote five more articles: November 29 (two articles), 30, December 1, 2007 and January 3, 2008. Nobody told her to write these articles but she discussed the information she obtained and the articles she wrote with her editors. Dr. Graham and his family read each of these articles and continued to be shocked, mad and dismayed and wondering if and when these articles would stop. After reading the November 30 article, Dr. Graham was depressed and felt that the newspaper was making the point that he was negligent and the jury was wrong to have exonerated him. The article made it sound as if the outcome of the trial would have been different had the jury heard from his other patients, that he should not have been given licence to practice in British Columbia and that he should not have been working as doctor. No one from the Star Phoenix contacted him to speak to him about the article, to ask him about the verdict or to get his view on an appeal. Dr. Graham was particularly upset and appalled after reading the December article as this article was full of untruths. Still, no one from the newspaper tried to contact him to get his comment. [32] On December 3, Dr. Graham’s children prepared letter to the Star Phoenix expressing their concerns and providing some rebuttal as to what was being written about their father. The Star Phoenix published this letter in the editorial section of the paper on December 14, 2007. [33] Over the next number of months, Dr. Graham’s children noticed change in their father. He was not as happy or as talkative as he had been before. He stopped doing things with them and became preoccupied with these articles. The articles bothered him for days and weeks at time. Dr. Graham, by his own admission, was depressed, not eating properly, unable to concentrate and had problems sleeping. He never sent letter or press release to the Star Phoenix as he did not think it was an appropriate thing to do. Over time, the effects lessened but he continued to have problems concentrating and sleeping. [34] Eventually Dr. Graham decided to bring lawsuit against the Star Phoenix to get back some of the vindication that was lost as result of Ms. Purdy’s articles. On November 18, 2009, counsel for Dr. Graham gave notice to Chris Purdy, her editors and publisher at the Star Phoenix and Canwest Publishing Inc., the then owners of the Star Phoenix, of their intention to bring an action for defamation as required by s. 15 of The Libel and Slander Act, RSS 1978, L-14. On November 24, 2009 Dr. Graham filed Statement of Claim in the Saskatchewan Court of Queen’s Bench alleging that the defendants had published series of articles containing defamatory comments about him in the Star Phoenix and on websites owned and operated by the Star Phoenix and Canwest Publishing Inc., between November 24, 2007 and January 3, 2008. [35] The defendants filed Statement of Defence on June 7, 2010 denying Dr. Graham’s allegations. The parties were not able to resolve the claim at mediation or pre-trial settlement conference and eventually the claim was set down for trial. [36] Sometime between the date Dr. Graham’s claim was filed and the commencement of the trial, Canwest Publishing Inc. experienced financial difficulties and eventually its assets, including the Star Phoenix, were purchased by Postmedia Network Inc. [37] The issues in this case are as follows: (a) Should the Statement of Claim be amended to add Postmedia Network Inc. as defendant? (b) Are the defendants, or any of them, liable in defamation to Dr. Graham? (c) What damages, if any, is Dr. Graham entitled to? (d) Is Dr. Graham entitled to an injunction requiring the defendants to remove certain content from websites under their control? (a) Should the Statement of Claim be amended to add Postmedia Network Inc. as defendant? [38] Postmedia Network Inc. purchased Canwest Publishing Inc. after their claim was filed but before the trial in this matter commenced and are the current owners of the Star Phoenix newspaper and its websites. Pursuant to Rules 3-72 and 3‑84 of The Queen’s Bench Rules, counsel for Dr. Graham asks me to exercise my discretion and allow the Statement of Claim to be amended to add Postmedia Network Inc. as defendant. In their view, there is no prejudice to Postmedia Network Inc. if they are added as defendant and in effect, while not formally named as defendant to this point in time, have been defending this claim since purchasing Canwest Publishing Inc. and/or its assets. [39] The defendants oppose this request on the basis that the two-year limitation period set forth in The Limitations Act, SS 2004, L-16.1, in force at the time of the alleged defamation has expired, that there is no evidentiary basis upon which could conclude that no party will suffer actual prejudice as result of the requested amendment and, lastly, that there is no explanation for Dr. Graham’s delay in seeking this amendment until after the conclusion of the evidence in the trial. [40] Rules 3-72, 3-78 and 3-84 are relevant to this issue and specifically: 3-72(1) party may amend the party’s pleading, including an amendment to add, remove, substitute or correct the name of party, as follows: (c) after statement of defence is filed: (i) by agreement of the parties filed with the Court; or (ii) with the Court’s prior permission, in any manner and on any terms that the Court considers just. (3) Parties shall make all amendments to their pleadings that are necessary to determine the real questions in issue between the parties. (8) Unless the Court orders otherwise, if pleading is amended at trial or hearing, the amended pleading does not need to be served and filed. (2) Persons may be joined as defendants or respondents if: (a) remedy is claimed against them, whether jointly or severally or in the alternative, arising out of the same transaction, occurrence or series of transactions or occurrences; (b) common question of law or fact may arise in the proceeding; (c) there is doubt as to the person or persons from whom the plaintiff, petitioner or originating applicant is entitled to remedy; (d) damage or loss has been caused to the same plaintiff, petitioner or originating applicant by more than one person, whether or not: (i) there is any factual connection between the several claims apart from the involvement of the plaintiff, petitioner or originating applicant; and (ii) there is doubt as to the respective amounts for which each may be liable; or (e) their presence in the proceeding may promote the convenient administration of justice. 3-84(1) At any stage of the action, the Court may order that any person be added as party if: (a) that person ought to have been joined as party; or (b) the person’s presence as party is necessary to enable the Court to adjudicate effectively and completely on the issues in the action. (2) At any stage of the action, the Court may grant leave to add, delete or substitute party, or to correct the name of party, and that leave shall be given, on any terms that the Court considers just, unless prejudice will result that cannot be compensated for by costs or an adjournment. [41] In this case, at the time the articles complained of were written, Canwest Publishing Inc. owned the Star Phoenix, the newspaper that employed Chris Purdy, Rod Nickel, Steven Gibb, Cameron Hutchinson and Dale Brin. According to material on the court file, on January 8, 2010 the Ontario Superior Court of Justice made an order pursuant to the Companies’ Creditors Arrangement Act, RSC 1985, C-36, in the matter of plan of compromise or arrangement of Canwest Publishing Inc. and other related companies. Sometime thereafter, but prior to the trial commencing, Postmedia Network Inc. purchased Canwest Publishing Inc. and/or its assets including the Star Phoenix. The evidence does not disclose the specific date this occurred. However, on the court file is statement as to documents of the defendants dated November 22, 2012 wherein defendants’ counsel identifies as being solicitors for Chris Purdy, Rod Nickel, Steven Gibb, Cameron Hutchinson, Dale Brin and Postmedia Network Inc., successor to Canwest Publishing Inc. There is also an affidavit of Rob McLaughlin filed on the court file sworn November 23, 2012 in which he states that he is the editor of the Star Phoenix and that Postmedia Network Inc. is the owner of the Star Phoenix newspaper. Finally, there is letter on the court file dated November 25, 2014 from defendants’ counsel requesting permission from the Court to dispense with the appearance of all the defendants at the December 2014 pre-trial conference. The reasons for this request included the following: (1) The defendants are all insured by the (formerly) Canwest Publishing and (now) Postmedia Network Inc. insurer, Hiscox Insurance, and thus have no personal financial exposure to the plaintiff; (3) None of the defendants is now employed by Postmedia Network Inc., owner of the Star Phoenix Newspaper, at that newspaper; and (4) Only the examination for discovery of the defendant Purdy was an “in-depth” discovery and there was understandably no examination of the proper officer of Postmedia Network Inc. [42] Despite this, Dr. Graham’s counsel neglected to make application to add or substitute Postmedia Network Inc. as defendant prior to the trial commencing, at the conclusion of the plaintiff’s case or at the end of the trial. In closing argument it was agreed that the parties would submit further written submissions on Dr. Graham’s request for an injunction requiring the defendants to remove certain articles from websites under their control if these articles were found to be defamatory. Unfortunately neglected to provide the parties with appropriate direction for submission of any further argument at the end of closing submissions. [43] On October 30, 2015 received correspondence from Dr. Graham’s counsel advising that he was writing on behalf of both counsel and requesting direction as to whether the parties may submit additional written material on two questions: (i) Whether the Statement of Claim should be amended to substitute Postmedia Network Inc. (the current proprietor of the Star Phoenix) for the defendant Canwest Publishing Inc. (former proprietor of the Star Phoenix); and (ii) Whether the plaintiff, if successful in establishing the defendants are liable in defamation, are entitled to an injunction requiring the defendants to remove certain content from websites under their control. [44] On the basis of the request of the parties in closing argument and their mutual desire to provide written submissions to the Court on the aforementioned two questions, instructed the Local Registrar to contact both counsel, advise them that would receive written submissions on these points and gave them deadline by which these submissions should be filed. [45] Both counsel filed written submissions. In the defendants’ written submission, counsel reiterated that these two outstanding issues are being raised with his agreement. [46] I am satisfied that Postmedia Network Inc. was the successor to Canwest Publishing Inc. and at the time of trial, was the owner of the Star Phoenix newspaper. I am also satisfied that Postmedia Network Inc. was aware of the existence of Dr. Graham’s claim including knowledge of the matters in issue. Counsel that had been representing Canwest Publishing Inc. and the other defendants before Postmedia Network Inc. purchased the Star Phoenix continued to represent the defendants after the purchase. In documents filed with the Court, counsel began identifying that he was now representing Postmedia Network Inc. as successor to Canwest Publishing Inc. Counsel ran the trial and must have been receiving some instruction from Postmedia Network Inc. as to how to proceed. [47] Rule 3-84(2) allows the Court to grant leave to add or substitute party at any stage of the action unless prejudice will result that cannot be compensated for. It is clear that trial judge has the discretion to add parties to an action however that discretion should not be exercised when it works an injustice to one of the parties. See Bradford Smith (1989), 1989 CanLII 4442 (SK CA), 74 Sask 193 (CA). While this rule gives the judge the power to add or substitute party, the criteria to be applied by the Court in deciding whether party ought to be joined as defendant is set out in Rule 3-78(2). See Lindsay Lindsay (1981), 1981 CanLII 2318 (SK QB), 15 Sask 29 (QB) at para 4; Scharnagl (Litigation Guardian of) Tomilin, 2005 SKCA 121 (CanLII) at para 18, 269 Sask 259. [48] Here, there is nothing that leads me to believe that Postmedia Network Inc. would suffer prejudice or an injustice if they were added as a defendant at this time. They purchased Canwest Publishing Inc. and/or its assets at least three years prior to trial and they are represented by the same lawyer that represented Canwest Publishing Inc. and the rest of the defendants. Both companies are insured by Hiscox Insurance and it appears that the insurer attended the pre-trial settlement conference on behalf of both companies. Counsel for the defendants admitted in correspondence that understandably no examination of the proper officer of Postmedia Network Inc. occurred as the more important discovery was of Chris Purdy. Postmedia Network Inc. is not being taken by surprise in the action and am not convinced that the case, from the defendants’ perspective, would have been handled differently had Postmedia Network Inc. been added earlier in the action. The evidence remains the evidence; it did not change, become stale or lost simply because Postmedia Network Inc. purchased Canwest Publishing Inc. and/or its assets. [49] The presence of Postmedia Network Inc. as defendant will ultimately promote the convenient administration of justice as it will enable the Court to determine the real questions in issue between the parties and effectively and completely adjudicate on all the issues in the action. Moreover, given that the Court has no evidence as to the specific terms upon which Postmedia Network Inc. purchased Canwest Publishing Inc. and/or its assets, there may be some doubt as to which entity Dr. Graham is entitled to remedy against if he is successful in his claim. For these reasons, Postmedia Network Inc. should be added as a defendant in this action. [50] I am not convinced that adding Postmedia Network Inc. as a defendant deprives them of a defence under s. 5 of The Limitations Act. Section states: Unless otherwise provided in this Act, no proceedings shall be commenced with respect to claim after two years from the day on which the claim is discovered. [51] The articles complained of were published between November 24, 2007 and January 3, 2008, and it would appear that the limitation period expired some time ago. But in cases where it is alleged defamatory material was posted on an internet website, as in this case, “publication” takes place wherever and whenever third party downloads or views the impugned material from the website. See Elfarnawani International Olympic Committee, 2011 ONSC 6784 (CanLII) at para 31. Consequently, the limitation period begins to run each and every time defamatory content on the internet is downloaded and viewed. This was the conclusion reached by the British Columbia Court of Appeal in Carter B.C. Federation of Foster Parents Association, 2005 BCCA 398 (CanLII) at para 20, 257 DLR (4th) 133. [52] It is not necessary for plaintiff in every case to prove directly that the words complained of were brought to the actual knowledge of some third party. If, on the facts proved, it can reasonably be inferred that the words were brought to the knowledge of some third party, prima facie case is established. See Gaskin Retail Credit Co., 1965 CanLII (SCC), [1965] [53] In Bernstein Poon, 2015 ONSC 155 (CanLII), although it was proven that the defamatory material was posted on the defendant’s website for at least one to two years prior to being removed, there was no direct evidence that anyone except the defendant and his legal representatives viewed the material. In concluding that there was more than ample evidence to support the drawing of an inference that the material on the website was viewed by third parties, Mew J. held that “[t]o find otherwise would be to ignore the realities of twenty-first century communication…”. [54] The defendants in the present case acknowledged that the articles in question remain on websites controlled by the Star Phoenix, Canwest Publishing Inc. and/or Postmedia Network Inc. It was part and parcel of their closing argument that to grant an injunction that the defamatory material be removed from their websites would be akin to erasing history. That being so, it is reasonable conclusion that anyone with search engine could have accessed that material within the last two years and as result the limitation period would not have expired. [55] Even if am wrong in this reasoning, s. 20 of The Limitations Act allows the Court to add party even after limitation period has expired. This section states: 20 Notwithstanding the expiry of limitation period after the commencement of proceeding, judge may allow an amendment to the pleadings that asserts new claim or adds or substitutes parties if: (a) the claim asserted by the amendment, or by or against the new party, arises out of the same transaction or occurrence as the original claim; and (b) the judge is satisfied that no party will suffer actual prejudice as result of the amendment. [56] If both of the requirements set forth in the section are found to exist, the Court has an unfettered discretion to grant the application, however such discretion must be exercised judicially. See Stockbrugger Estate Wolfe Estate, 1987 CanLII 4901 (SK CA), [1987] WWR 759 (Sask CA). [57] The claim against Postmedia Network Inc. arises out of the same transactions or occurrences as the original claim against the defendants and for the reasons aforementioned, am satisfied that neither Dr. Graham, the other defendants nor Postmedia Network Inc. will suffer actual prejudice as result of adding Postmedia Network Inc. as defendant. Dr. Graham or his counsel gave no reason why they did not seek to amend their claim earlier, but as stated in Callihoo Lamoureux, 2001 SKQB 392 (CanLII), 211 Sask 36, even if there is negligence that is not necessarily fatal to the application. As result, would exercise my discretion and grant leave to add Postmedia Network Inc. as defendant in this case. (b) Are the defendants, or any of them, liable in defamation to Dr. Graham? [58] Dr. Graham takes issue with seven articles written by Chris Purdy, the Star Phoenix reporter tasked with covering the Baert trial. The dates of these articles were November 24, 28, 29 (two articles), 30, December 1, 2007 and January 3, 2008. He alleges particular defamatory meanings to the words in each of these articles and states that the articles as whole convey defamatory impression of him. He accuses the defendants of being actuated by express malice in the publication of these articles. [59] The defendants argue that the words complained of in the different articles are not capable of bearing the defamatory meanings, either at all or to the extent alleged by Dr. Graham. They admit that five of the articles do contain some defamatory comments or meaning. They raise the defence of privilege set forth in s. 11 of The Libel and Slander Act and the defence of responsible communication in relation to some of the articles and deny that their predominant purpose in publishing the articles was to harm Dr. Graham’s reputation or for any other malicious reason. [60] Defamation occurs when words are published to third person that contain an imputation which tends to lower the plaintiff in the estimation of right-thinking members of society generally or to expose him to hatred, contempt or ridicule. To be actionable, the words must be reasonably understood by others in defamatory sense. Words may be defamatory in their natural and ordinary meaning, they may carry an implied meaning (the true innuendo), and/or an extended meaning (the false innuendo). Unless the literal meaning is plain and obvious, the plaintiff must plead what he alleges the words were intended to mean. See Laufer Bucklaschuk (1999), 1999 CanLII 5073 (MB CA), 145 Man (2d) (CA) at para 23. [61] The basic principles of the law of defamation were succinctly stated by McLachlin C.J. in Grant Torstar Corp., 2009 SCC 61 (CanLII), [2009] SCR 640 [Grant]. There she said: 28 plaintiff in defamation action is required to prove three things to obtain judgment and an award of damages: (1) that the impugned words were defamatory, in the sense that they would tend to lower the plaintiff's reputation in the eyes of reasonable person; (2) that the words in fact referred to the plaintiff; and (3) that the words were published, meaning that they were communicated to at least one person other than the plaintiff. If these elements are established on balance of probabilities, falsity and damage are presumed, though this rule has been subject to strong criticism: see, e.g., R. A. Smolla, “Balancing Freedom of Expression and Protection of Reputation Under Canada’s Charter of Rights and Freedoms”, in D. Schneiderman, ed., Freedom of Expression and the Charter (1991), 272, at p. 282. (The only exception is that slander requires proof of special damages, unless the impugned words were slanderous per se: R. E. Brown, The Law of Defamation in Canada (2nd ed. (loose-leaf)), vol. 3, at pp. 25-2 and 25-3.) The plaintiff is not required to show that the defendant intended to do harm, or even that the defendant was careless. The tort is thus one of strict liability. 29 If the plaintiff proves the required elements, the onus then shifts to the defendant to advance defence in order to escape liability. [62] In this case, the parties agree that the words complained of referred to Dr. Graham and that the words were published. Where they disagree is whether some of the words or articles were defamatory and whether they were defamatory to the extent that Dr. Graham says they were. [63] The role of the trial judge in determining whether or not words are defamatory was described by Hinkson J.A. (as he then was) in Lawson Baines, 2012 BCCA 117 (CanLII) at paras 26 and 27, [2012] WWR 429 [Lawson]: 26 The first task of judge in defamation case is to answer the “threshold question” of “whether the words cited are reasonably capable of defamatory meaning”: Laufer v. Bucklaschuk (1999), 1999 CanLII 5073 (MB CA), [2000] W.W.R. 462 at 470-471 (Man. C.A.). The judge, if sitting alone, then plays second role; as finder of fact, in determining whether the words do, in fact, bear that defamatory meaning. 27 In executing the first role, the question is whether the words complained of are reasonably capable of being understood in defamatory sense. In exercising this gatekeeper role, the judge must keep in mind that the question does not involve finding that the words are in fact defamatory, but concerns only what the words are capable of meaning. When performing this task, the judge must not stray from “common sense construction” of these words (as it was termed in Makow v. Winnipeg Sun, 2003 MBQB 56 (CanLII), [2003] 11 W.W.R. 166, affirmed 2004 MBCA 41 (CanLII)) and seize upon one marginal to that construction. [64] In Botiuk Toronto Free Press Publications Ltd., 1995 CanLII 60 (SCC), [1995] SCR [Botiuk], Cory J. said: 62 For the purposes of these reasons, it is sufficient to observe that publication which tends to lower person in the estimation of right-thinking members of society, or to expose person to hatred, contempt or ridicule, is defamatory and will attract liability. See Cherneskey v. Armadale Publishers Ltd., 1978 CanLII 20 (SCC), [1979] S.C.R. 1067, at p. 1079. What is defamatory may be determined from the ordinary meaning of the published words themselves or from the surrounding circumstances. In The Law of Defamation in Canada (2nd ed. 1994), R. E. Brown stated the following at p. 1-15: [A publication] may be defamatory in its plain and ordinary meaning or by virtue of extrinsic facts or circumstances, known to the listener or reader, which give it defamatory meaning by way of innuendo different from that in which it ordinarily would be understood. In determining its meaning, the court may take into consideration all the circumstances of the case, including any reasonable implications the words may bear, the context in which the words are used, the audience to whom they were published and the manner in which they were presented. [65] As decide whether the words and/or articles in question were defamatory, both parties urge me to consider the context in which the words were published and the context of the articles. Brown on Defamation, loose-leaf (2012-Rel 4) 2d ed, vol (Toronto: Carswell, 1999), stresses that context and circumstances are crucial in determining the defamatory sense of words. At pages 5-82 to 5-83: The defamatory communications must be viewed contextually. In determining whether they are defamatory, the words “must be considered in the context of the matter complained of as whole.” An alleged defamatory statement cannot be considered apart from the circumstances in which it was made. word having different shades of meaning may derive color and significance from the nature of the act to which it is applied. “What is said and what is done always has its proper relation to time, place, conditions, and circumstances.” Therefore, in determining the defamatory sense of language, “reference must be had, not only to the words or expressions themselves, but also to the circumstances under which they were used.” This is particularly true where an innuendo has been pled. [66] Besides arguing that the words were not defamatory, the defendants rely on the defence of privilege afforded newspapers under s. 11 of The Libel and Slander Act and the defence of responsible communication. Section 11 of The Libel and Slander Act reads as follows: 11(1) fair and accurate report in newspaper without comment, of proceedings publicly heard before court of justice, if published contemporaneously with those proceedings, shall be absolutely privileged unless the defendant has refused or neglected to insert in the newspaper in which the report complained of appeared reasonable letter or statement of explanation or contradiction by or on behalf of the plaintiff. (2) Nothing in this section authorizes the publication of blasphemous, seditious or indecent matter. [67] The defence of responsible communication is relatively new defence in Canadian law. Formally accepted by the Supreme Court of Canada in Grant, McLachlin C.J. described the elements of the new defence as follows: 126 The defence of public interest responsible communication is assessed with reference to the broad thrust of the publication in question. It will apply where: A. The publication is on matter of public interest, and B. The publisher was diligent in trying to verify the allegation, having regard to: (a) the seriousness of the allegation; (b) the public importance of the matter; (c) the urgency of the matter; (d) the status and reliability of the source; (e) whether the plaintiff’s side of the story was sought and accurately reported; (f) whether the inclusion of the defamatory statement was justifiable; (g) whether the defamatory statement's public interest lay in the fact that it was made rather than its truth (“reportage”); and (h) any other relevant circumstances. [68] With this background in mind and since each publication is separate cause of action for which an action lies (Lambert Roberts Drug Stores Ltd., 1933 CanLII 289 (MB CA), [1933] DLR 193 (Man CA), at para [Lambert]), will address each of the articles Dr. Graham complains of separately. (i) November 24, 2007 Article [69] This article appeared both in the Star Phoenix newspaper and on internet sites controlled by the newspaper. The article reads as follows: Final arguments in surgery suit heard by court The gynecologist who botched routine tubal ligation operation on Lloydminster mother, leaving her quadriplegic with brain damage, clearly failed to provide her with standard level of care, jury has heard. On Friday, lawyers for Lisa Baert began their closing arguments in the two-month civil trial in Saskatoon’s Court of Queen’s Bench. Because the lawyers need more time Monday to complete their case, Justice Grant Currie told the jury members all women they won’t need to bring their suitcases until Tuesday, when they will be sequestered for their deliberations. “It’s clear this case is about young family whose lives were unimaginably changed,” said lawyer Sandra Weber. Lisa Baert was 21 when she went to the Lloydminster hospital in July 1999 for what is considered by many to be safe, simple sterilization procedure, said Weber. But her bowel was unknowingly punctured during the laparoscopic operation, allowing toxins to leak into her body. She was discharged from hospital but two days later was rushed back suffering from septic shock. Her hands and feet had to be amputated. And she also suffered major brain damage during cardiac arrests. She now lives in Saskatoon’s Parkridge Centre. Baert, her husband Mark and their two young sons are suing Dr. Kenneth Graham for more than $10 million for negligence. The Lloydminster hospital and several nurses originally named in the suit previously settled out of court. “Dr. Graham failed Lisa Baert in number of ways,” said Weber. She said Graham did not get Baert’s informed consent for the surgery. When he met her in his office weeks before the operation, he spent only three minutes discussing the operation. Mark testified when his wife returned home, and he asked her if the doctor had discussed risks of the upcoming surgery, she told him: “I don’t believe he told me of any risks.” Weber also reminded the jury one of Graham’s other patients, who had tubal ligation that same day, testified she was unaware the bowel could be nicked during the surgery. Graham testified it was his routine to briefly mention the risk of bowel perforation. But he would not tell patients the consequences of such an injury include septic shock or death, because the event is so rare. “Even if risk is rare, if the potential consequences are serious, that must be disclosed,” Weber said. She said Graham further failed Baert by proceeding with the surgery, after another doctor diagnosed her with postpartum depression and prescribed her anti-depressants. Graham either didn’t see the update in her chart, said Weber, or he ignored the vital piece of information. She said Graham also admitted he was “crunched for time,” with three other surgeries scheduled the same morning as Baert’s operation. He obviously used “improper technique,” inserting the needle at wrong angle or pushing it too deep into the abdomen, said Weber. Graham was alerted to possible problem when the surgical equipment gave high pressure reading, an indication the needle had met an obstruction, such as the bowel, Weber said. But he completed the surgery and didn’t tell other staff or Baert of the problem so they could watch for symptoms. “The doctor’s responsibility doesn’t end when he puts in the last suture,” Weber said. “Dr. Graham had the missing piece of the puzzle that he failed to communicate, and that started the whole process.” Baert was discharged from hospital and given an instruction sheet from nurse about how she should not take prescription drugs and should call the hospital or her doctor if she experienced more pain. Baert and concerned neighbour allegedly called the hospital three times during the next two days, concerned about her increasing pain. They talked to unknown nurses who said Baert should wait out the pain and gave permission for her to take the neighbour’s prescription pain killers. Graham’s defence lawyers have argued the nurses obviously gave bad advice over the phone, and Baert should have followed the instructions by returning to the hospital. Graham’s defence suggests the hospital and Baert carry about 75 per cent of the responsibility for what happened. Weber said Baert did nothing wrong, and Graham is to blame for 80 per cent of the incident. The hospital is responsible for the remaining 20 per cent. “Dr. Graham’s negligence is by far the biggest factor,” she said. [Italics are mine] [70] Dr. Graham argues that the italicized portions of the article are false, malicious and defamatory and were understood to mean that he botched routine tubal ligation operation on Lisa Baert causing her to become quadriplegic with brain damage. [71] Defendants’ counsel says that this article is Ms. Purdy reporting on the submissions of Ms. Baert’s counsel to the jury and that the natural and ordinary meaning of the words complained of is non-defamatory. Alternatively they rely on the privilege accorded to newspapers reporting on court proceedings pursuant to s. 11 of The Libel and Slander Act and the defence of responsible communication. [72] Looking at the words specifically complained of by Dr. Graham in the context of the article as whole, am not satisfied that these words are reasonably capable of defamatory meaning. An ordinary person reading these words would understand that these are the plaintiff’s lawyer’s arguments at the end of lengthy trial. The impugned portions state as much when they end with “a jury has heard” and “said Weber”. Early in the article it states that lawyers for Ms. Baert began their closing arguments in trial and the different paragraphs are littered with references that Ms. Weber said this or she said that. An ordinary person reading this would be mindful that this trial is not finished, that no determination has yet been made as to whether Dr. Graham has done anything wrong and that what is being said here are arguments jury is going to have to consider. [73] Even if am wrong in this conclusion, the words complained of are not actionable by reason of the privilege afforded the defendants under s. 11 of The Libel and Slander Act. The article was fair and accurate contemporaneous reporting of the closing submissions made by the Baerts’ lawyer to the jury. For both these reasons, the allegation that this November 24, 2007 article is defamatory is dismissed. (ii) November 28, 2007 Article [74] This article was only published on the Star Phoenix internet sites. It read as follows: Gynecologist not negligent in tubal ligation lawsuit The gynecologist found not negligent Wednesday in the case of Lloydminster mother left with devastating injuries after routine tubal ligation recently settled second lawsuit with another patient who nearly died following the same surgery. Dr. Kenneth Graham settled the second suit out of court for an undisclosed sum earlier this month, said lawyer John Jordan of Nanaimo, B.C. Jordan said his client, Gloria Cooke, was referred to Graham for the laparoscopic tubal ligation at Dawson Creek and District Hospital in 2002. He mistakenly punctured her bowel twice during the surgery. “She almost died and struggled to hang on for month,” said Jordan. On Wednesday, after nine weeks of trial, Saskatoon jury determined Graham was not negligent in his care of Lisa Baert when he punctured her bowel during tubal ligation at the Lloydminster hospital in 1999. Baert went into septic shock and doctors had to amputate her hands and feet. She also suffered severe brain damage. Baert and her family were claiming more than $10 million in damages against Graham. Prior to trial, they reached an undisclosed settlement with the Lloydminster hospital and some nurses. One of the six jurors, her bottom lip quivering as the verdict was read, wiped tears from her face and glanced at Baert’s husband, Mark, and his three sons sitting in the courtroom. The jurors did not have to be unanimous, but five of the six had to agree on each question posed in six-page verdict sheet in order to reach their decision. Baert, confined to wheelchair and living at the Parkridge Centre long-term care home, was unable to make it to the courthouse for the verdict. And her husband did not talk to reporters when he left the building. Graham, who no longer works as doctor, also wasn’t at the courthouse. His lawyer, Christine Glazer, said he was busy with personal matters. She said the trial was difficult for her client and obviously the jury. “I realize how difficult it would have been for the jury to reach the conclusion that it did,” said Glazer. “But the jury did what it had to do, and that was set aside its emotion and look at the case objectively.” Baert’s lawyers planned to call about 10 other patients during the trial, some like Cooke suffered complications during surgeries conducted by Graham. But Court of Queen’s Bench Justice Grant Currie ruled the patients couldn’t testify because their stories weren’t relevant to Baert’s case and would prejudice the jury. Graham said Baert was partially responsible for her injuries because she did not return to the hospital when she experienced increasing pain at home. His lawyers also argued bowel perforations are recognized but rare risk of tubal ligations. And instruments inserted into the abdomen mistakenly puncture the bowel in about four of every 10,000 surgeries. Jordan, Cooke’s lawyer, said the risks increase if woman has had prior abdominal surgery, which was the case with Cooke. The 41-year-old mother of three argued she told Graham about her prior surgery, although Graham claimed she did not, said Jordan. Graham, granted licence by the B.C. College of Physicians and Surgeons despite Baert’s injuries in Saskatchewan, went ahead with Cooke’s tubal ligation on Oct. 31, 2002. Graham had to cut through lesions and adhesions formed during Cooke’s prior surgery. When Graham saw the abnormalities, he should have stopped the surgery, said Jordan. “He didn’t have the skill to do the dissection. It’s whole other level of surgery, not what obstetricians and gynecologists should be doing.” But he continued and the operation took 45 minutes, Jordan said, four times as long as Baert’s surgery and what Graham testified was normal. Jordan said Graham kept Cooke in hospital overnight to monitor her condition but she was released the next day. She soon returned to the hospital in pain but Graham diagnosed her with gastrointestinal problem and sent her home. She returned to hospital second time, and another doctor discovered she was suffering from septic shock. She was sent to hospitals in Grand Prairie and Edmonton for life-saving surgeries. Doctors determined two puncture holes in her bowel occurred during the tubal ligation, said Jordan. He said Cooke is still in chronic pain and has an incisional hernia in her abdomen. She has returned to work as medical office assistant. But because she no longer has stomach muscles, she needs to wear girdle each day to hold herself in. Graham voluntarily stopped doing laparoscopic operations after Cooke’s surgery. But four months later, Dawson Creek media reported 35-year-old Dana McLellan had to be air-lifted to Vancouver after Graham cut her bladder during hysterectomy. The hospital, the Northern Health Authority and the B.C. College of Physicians and Surgeons reviewed complaints against Graham but his licence was not revoked. College spokesperson Susan Prins said Graham voluntarily agreed to have his skills assessed at the University of Saskatchewan. And although he passed, he did not return to work. Graham, 55, testified in the Baert case that he was unable to work after heart attack in 2003. He underwent quintuple bypass surgery, then developed depressive illness. He now lives in St. Albert, just north of Edmonton. [Italics are mine] [75] It was Dr. Graham’s position that the italicized portions of this article contained false, malicious and defamatory words that were understood to mean: (a) That he negligently performed surgery on Lisa Baert, thereby causing her to suffer devastating injuries and the jury’s verdict exonerating him of negligence was wrong and should be given no credibility; (b) He negligently performed surgery on Gloria Cooke, thereby nearly causing her death; (c) He negligently failed to address post-surgery complications experienced by Gloria Cooke, thereby nearly causing her death; (d) His negligent treatment of Gloria Cooke caused her to suffer septic shock, permanent chronic pain, an incisional hernia in her abdomen and the permanent loss of her stomach muscles; and (e) He negligently performed surgery on Dana McLellan, placing her health and life in jeopardy. [76] Counsel for the defendants agreed that the italicized portions of this article were defamatory insofar as they implied that Dr. Graham was negligent in his treatment of Gloria Cooke and Dana McLellan. However he denied that the natural and ordinary meaning of the words complained of were defamatory in any other sense as suggested by Dr. Graham. He acknowledged that the statutory defence of privilege under s. 11 of The Libel and Slander Act was not available as this article was not contemporaneous reporting of court proceedings. He also advised that he was not advancing the defence of responsible communication as the evidence did not support it in this instance. [77] The defendants admit that the italicized words are defamatory and agree. The natural and ordinary meaning of these words is reasonably capable of defamatory meaning. reasonable person of ordinary intelligence would believe that, at the very least, these words meant that Dr. Graham negligently treated Gloria Cooke and Dana McLellan. However, am also satisfied that reasonable person would conclude that these words are reasonably capable of being given the extended meaning ascribed to them by Dr. Graham. [78] The byline references that Dr. Graham was not negligent in the lawsuit but the context of the article as whole and the specific words complained of make it appear that the jury was wrong to find him not at fault for Ms. Baert’s injuries. The article does not report solely on the jury’s verdict but includes serious allegations made by two of Dr. Graham’s former patients that he was negligent in his treatment of them. By including discussion of these two patients, and in the case of Ms. Cooke detailed discussion, of their complaints, leads to the inevitable conclusion that Dr. Graham was negligent in their cases and ergo must have been negligent in the Baert case. The only reason he was found not liable was because the jury was not allowed to hear about their cases. [79] The words themselves do not simply point to Dr. Graham being negligent in his treatment of Ms. Cooke and Ms. McLellan but go farther that he caused Ms. Cooke specific injury and nearly death and that he put Ms. McLellan’s life in jeopardy. The words Ms. Purdy used to describe Ms. Cooke’s treatment, or mistreatment, were “she almost died and struggled to hang on for month”, that she was sent for “life-saving surgeries”, she is “still in chronic pain”, has “an incisional hernia in her abdomen”, and “no longer has stomach muscles”. The meaning of these words is clearly more than just that Dr. Graham was negligent in his treatment of her. [80] There is only one paragraph in the article speaking about Ms. McLellan but by using the words “air-lifted to Vancouver” the meaning is that the cut to her bladder was so serious that she needed to be flown to bigger hospital to be treated. Again, the meaning of these words is more than that Dr. Graham was simply negligent in his treatment of Ms. McLellan. [81] The evidence satisfies me that the natural and ordinary meaning of the words complained of and the implied meaning of these words in the context of the article as whole, are that Dr. Graham negligently performed surgery on Ms. Baert causing her devastating injuries and the jury’s verdict exonerating him was wrong, that he negligently performed surgery on Gloria Cooke and negligently failed to address her post-surgery complications thereby causing her specific injuries and nearly causing her death and that he negligently performed surgery on Dana McLellan and placed her life in jeopardy and this is defamatory. (iii) The First November 29, 2007 Article [82] Two separate articles written by Ms. Purdy appeared in the Star Phoenix newspaper and on their websites on November 29, 2007. The first of these articles reads as follows: Gynecologist not negligent Punctured bowel led to brain damage The gynecologist found not negligent Wednesday in the case of Lloydminster mother left with devastating injuries after routine tubal ligation recently settled second lawsuit with another patient who nearly died following the same surgery. Dr. Kenneth Graham settled the second suit out of court for an undisclosed sum earlier this month, said lawyer John Jordan of Nanaimo, B.C.

He now lives in St. Albert, just north of Edmonton. [Italics are mine] [83] This article is identical to the November 28, 2007 article written by Ms. Purdy that was published on the Star Phoenix websites. It appeared on the front page of the November 29, 2007 edition of the Star Phoenix and continued on page A8. The only difference between this article and the previous article is the byline. The byline that appeared on the front page attached to this article was “Gynecologist Not Negligent” and on page A8 attached to the continuation of the story was “Suit: jury not allowed to hear from other patients”. [84] The words in this article that Dr. Graham complains of are the same as the words he complained of in the November 28, 2007 article. His complaints about this article are the same as his complaints about the previous article for all the same reasons set forth previously. Given this article was identical to the previous article, both counsel’s arguments about this article were identical to their arguments on the previous article. [85] From my perspective it would be superfluous for me to reiterate my reasoning and comments from the previous article here and see no need to do so. Suffice it to say that my conclusion remains that the words Dr. Graham complains of are defamatory both on their natural meaning and on their implied meaning in the context of the article as whole. The fact that the byline in this article is somewhat different than in the November 28 article and this article appeared on the front page of the newspaper does not alter my reasoning or conclusions. (iv) The second November 29, 2007 Article [86] second separate article written by Ms. Purdy appeared on page A8 of the Star Phoenix newspaper on November 29, 2007 and on their websites. It read as follows: Routine surgery became health nightmare Lisa Baert was 21 when she went to the Lloydminster hospital on July 14, 1999, to have her “tubes tied.” Lisa Baert was 21 when she went to the Lloydminster hospital on July 14, 1999, to have her “tubes tied.” She and her husband Mark, financially strapped and already parents to two sons, had decided they didn’t want more children. And Mark didn’t want vasectomy. During the routine laparoscopic operation, Graham unknowingly punctured Baert’s bowel, and the two-millimetre hole allowed toxins to leak into her body. But the surgery was completed, clips were placed on her fallopian tubes, and she was stitched up and sent home. Two days later, an ambulance rushed her back to hospital suffering from septic shock. Her bowel was repaired but because of reduced blood flow and dead tissue, doctors had to amputate her hands at the wrist and her legs below the knees. She also suffered severe brain damage, due to cardiac arrests during surgery, leaving her with the mental capacity of child. Now 29, Baert lives in Saskatoon’s Parkridge Centre long-term care home, where staff help with daily tasks such as changing her diapers and putting on her prosthetic limbs. Baert and her family launched multimillion-dollar lawsuit in 2000 against Graham, the hospital and several nurses. The hospital and nurses settled out of court for an undisclosed sum shortly before the trial began in September, leaving Graham the lone defendant. Graham, who no longer practices as doctor, denied any negligence, claiming bowel perforations are recognized, although rare, risk of tubal ligation surgeries. And he said it was up to nurses to monitor Baert for symptoms of complications after the surgery. Graham also argued Baert was partially responsible for her injuries for not returning to the hospital when she experienced increasing pain at home following the surgery. When Baert was discharged from hospital, nurse gave her an instruction sheet stating she should call her doctor or return to the hospital if she experienced more pain. Baert and concerned neighbour allegedly called the hospital three times during the next two days, concerned about her increasing pain. They talked to unknown nurses who said Baert should wait out the pain and gave permission for her to take the neighbour’s prescription pain killers. Baert’s lawyers argued she did what any reasonable patient would have. They claimed Graham used improper technique during the surgery and should have known that he punctured her bowel when equipment in the operating room measured high pressure reading. They said Graham had duty to pass that information on to Baert and the nurses so they would more closely watch for symptoms of complications. They further argued Graham didn’t properly explain to Baert the risks of the surgery or the consequences of bowel puncture, and therefore he didn’t get her informed consent to operate. [Italics are mine] [87] Dr. Graham complains that the italicized words in this article were false, malicious and defamatory and were understood to mean: (a) He negligently performed surgery on Lisa Baert, thereby causing her to suffer septic shock; (b) He negligently performed surgery on Lisa Baert, thereby causing her to suffer cardiac arrests resulting in severe brain damage, leaving her with the mental capacity of child and requiring her to live in long-term care facility; (c) He negligently performed surgery on Lisa Baert, thereby causing her to suffer reduced blood flow and dead tissue, necessitating the amputation of her hands and her legs below the knees; (d) He deliberately and deceitfully did not advise the nurses or Lisa Baert that he had punctured her bowel during surgery, or alternatively, that he negligently failed to do so; and (e) He deliberately concealed from Lisa Baert the risks associated with tubal ligation surgery and therefore did not receive her informed consent to perform such surgery. [88] Counsel for the defendants acknowledged that the meaning of the italicized portions of the article was defamatory in that they meant that Dr. Graham was negligent in his treatment of Ms. Baert, but he denied that the words were defamatory in any other sense as suggested by Dr. Graham. He took specific issue that the words in question could be interpreted to mean that Dr. Graham caused certain things, was deliberately deceitful or deliberately concealed information. He encouraged me to consider the article as whole. He did not advance any other arguments. [89] The defendants admit that the plain meaning of the words complained of in this article are defamatory insofar as they mean that Dr. Graham was negligent in his treatment of Ms. Baert. accept that the plain meaning of these words is defamatory but the meaning goes farther than the defendants’ counsel suggests. [90] The article as whole says nothing about the verdict in the case, nor does it tie in any of the information to the judge’s instructions in the case, the jury’s deliberations or their ultimate verdict. Reading this article, person would have no reason to believe that Dr. Graham was found not negligent in the case. The words complained of in the first five paragraphs of the article outline the cause and the effect: Dr. Graham performed surgery on Ms. Baert, he punctured her bowel in the process, she developed sepsis that eventually led to other complications and as result of that she ended up living in care home. Thus the words are defamatory but the meaning of the words includes more than just that Dr. Graham was negligent; it includes the results of his negligence as well. [91] The last three paragraphs Dr. Graham complains about in the article are Ms. Baert’s lawyer’s comments about what Dr. Graham did wrong. The plain meaning of these words is that Dr. Graham was supposed to do some things and he did not, for example, he did not pass on information to the nurses or properly explain the risks of the surgery to Ms. Baert. Without presenting Dr. Graham’s lawyer’s arguments on these points or indicating that the jury vindicated him of these allegations, the words indicate he was negligent by not doing these things. am not however satisfied that these words were understood to mean that Dr. Graham deliberately did not do these things or that he was, in any way, deceitful. [92] Therefore, on the evidence, the defamatory meaning of the words complained of is that Dr. Graham negligently performed surgery on Ms. Baert causing her septic shock, amputation of her hands and feet, cardiac arrest, severe brain damage leaving her with the mental capacity of child and requiring her to live in long-term care facility and further, that he did not advise the nurses or Ms. Baert that he had punctured her bowel or that he negligently failed to do so and he did not properly advise Ms. Baert of the risks associated with the surgery and did not therefore receive her informed consent to the surgery. (v) November 30, 2007 Article [93] The following article appeared in the Star Phoenix newspaper and on its websites on November 30, 2007: Baert family mulls appeal of suit decision Lisa Baert may have the mental capacity of child, but she can still comprehend the loss of her multimillion-dollar malpractice lawsuit against her former gynecologist. Mark Baert said Thursday that when he told his wife of the jury’s decision and the judge’s dismissal of the suit, she was understandably upset. “It’s lot of hopes and dreams there being crushed,” said Mark. The couple and their two sons were claiming more than $10 million in damages against Dr. Kenneth Graham. Prior to trial, they reached an undisclosed settlement with the Lloydminster hospital and some nurses. Lisa, 29, sat in her wheelchair throughout most of the trial but was not in the courtroom for the decision on Wednesday. Graham unknowingly punctured her bowel, allowing toxins to leak into her body, during routine tubal ligation in July 1999. She was discharged from hospital but two days later was rushed back suffering from septic shock. Doctors had to amputate her hands and feet. She also suffered severe brain damage. After nine weeks of testimony in the civil trial, the six-member jury all women decided Graham had Lisa’s informed consent to perform the surgery and provided standard level of care both during and after the operation. Graham’s lawyers argued bowel perforations are rare but recognized risks of tubal ligations, and it was up to the nurses to watch for symptoms of complications after the surgery. Graham also claimed Lisa was partially at fault for not immediately returning to the hospital when she experienced increasing pain at home. Because Lisa was not mentally capable of testifying in the case, Mark told the jury Lisa and concerned neighbour called the hospital three times about her pain following the surgery. But nurses who answered the calls told them to wait out the pain and gave permission for Lisa to take the neighbour’s prescription pain killers. Graham, 55, recently settled another lawsuit in similar case involving woman from Dawson Creek, B.C. Gloria Cooke almost died after Graham twice punctured her bowel during tubal ligation in 2002. After several life-saving surgeries, she was left with chronic pain and has an incisional hernia in her abdomen. The jury in the Baert trial was not allowed to hear about Graham’s other patients. Mark said he’s glad Graham is no longer working as doctor. After heart attack in 2003, Graham underwent quintuple bypass and then developed depressive illness. Mark said he went public with Lisa’s injuries in 1999 to warn others about Graham. But the doctor moved to B.C. and was granted medical licence there. “I certainly wouldn’t wish harm upon him,” said Mark. “He’s human. He makes mistakes. understand that.” Mark said he’s not sure if his family will appeal the ruling. One of his lawyers, David Risling, said because the Baerts lost the suit, they will likely be on the hook for Graham’s legal fees. The majority of damages claimed in the lawsuit $8.7 million were ear-marked for future health-care costs to move Lisa into private group home. Mark, unable to comment on the amount of the settlement with the hospital, also couldn’t say whether the move is still possible. Lisa currently lives in Saskatoon’s Parkridge Centre, publicly funded and government-subsidized long-term care home. Staff help with daily tasks such as changing her diapers and putting on her prosthetic limbs. Lisa has some movement in her shoulders and elbows but is basically immobile. Her wheelchair has headrest because she can’t hold her head up for long without support. [Italics are mine] [94] It was Dr. Graham’s argument that the italicized words in this article were false, malicious and defamatory and were understood to mean: (a) He negligently performed surgery on Lisa Baert, thereby causing her to suffer devastating injuries; (b) The verdict of the jury exonerating him of negligence in his treatment of Lisa Baert was perverse; (c) He negligently performed surgery on Gloria Cooke, thereby nearly causing her death; (d) He negligently performed surgery on Gloria Cooke, thereby causing her to suffer permanent chronic pain and an incisional hernia in her abdomen; and (e) He is guilty of habitual negligence in his surgical practice and should not be permitted to carry on practice as surgeon because of the unacceptable risk he poses to the life and health of patients. [95] Dr. Graham also argued that in the alternative, these defamatory meanings were conveyed by way of legal innuendo by the combined effect of the November 24, 28, 29 and 30 articles. [96] The defendants agreed that to the extent that the italicized words in this article meant that Dr. Graham negligently performed surgeries on Lisa Baert and Gloria Cooke, they were defamatory. However once again, counsel took issue with any additional meanings attributed to the words by Dr. Graham or that in the context of the first four articles referenced, legal innuendo conveyed the meanings attributed to the words by Dr. Graham. Counsel did not make any other argument in relation to this article. [97] The meaning of the words complained of must be looked at in the context of the entire article. The article says that Dr. Graham unknowingly punctured Ms. Baert’s bowel allowing toxins to leak into her body. Two days later she was rushed back to the hospital with septic shock. Doctors had to amputate her hands and feet, she suffered severe brain damage, she has the mental capacity of child, she is in wheelchair and lives in long-term care home. Thus in my view, when Mark Baert said that he went public with Lisa’s injuries in 1999 to warn others about Graham, an ordinary person would conclude that he believed that people should know that Dr. Graham negligently performed surgery on his spouse and that she suffered devastating injuries as result thereof. [98] The words complained of relating to Ms. Cooke are that Dr. Graham twice punctured her bowel, she almost died, she had several life-saving surgeries, she has chronic pain and an incisional hernia in her abdomen, she sued Dr. Graham and he settled with her. reasonable person looking at these words would obviously say that Dr. Graham negligently performed surgery on her that nearly caused her death and resulted in her suffering permanent chronic pain and an incisional hernia in her abdomen. [99] In addition to the article speaking of Dr. Graham’s negligent surgery on Ms. Baert and the injuries she suffered as result of that, the article also speaks of Ms. Baert being upset to learn that the jury’s decision resulted in the dismissal of her lawsuit against Dr. Graham, that Dr. Graham was sued by Gloria Cooke in British Columbia in similar case and he settled with her. Looking at the words that “the jury in the Baert trial was not allowed to hear about Dr. Graham’s other patients” in the context of the article as whole, reasonable person would think that had the jury been allowed to hear Ms. Cooke and other of Dr. Graham’s patients, it would have been obvious to them that he was habitually negligent in his surgical practice and that the verdict exonerating him would have been different. [100] cannot however agree with Dr. Graham’s contention that the ordinary meaning of the impugned words or the legal innuendo meaning conveyed by the previous articles is that he should not be permitted to practice as surgeon because of the unacceptable risk he poses to the life and health of his patients. The words, even in the context of the article as whole and/or read in concert with the previous articles written by Ms. Purdy, do not lend themselves to this meaning. Dr. Graham, according to the article, stopped practicing as doctor in 2003 after suffering heart attack and later depression. This is point made in the November 28 article and both articles on November 29. These words do not connote the meaning that this man should be prohibited from being doctor going forward. reasonable man would glean that he has already ceased practicing medicine as result of his own medical issues and is not concern anymore. (vi) The December 1, 2007 Article [101] On December 1, 2007 an article written by Chris Purdy appeared on page A4 of the Star Phoenix and on the newspaper’s websites. The article read: Former patient wanted chance to confront doctor Dr. Kenneth Graham made surgical mistakes that led to complications with four other patients before the tubal ligation on Lloydminster mother Lisa Baert in 1999 left her quadriplegic with brain damage. Sharry Michels, 50, said the gynecologist accidentally clamped her femoral artery, nerve and vein during hysterectomy at the Lloydminster hospital in 1998. When she woke up in the recovery room, her right leg was cold and felt like it was asleep. She later learned of the complication and the possibility she might never regain feeling in her leg. “I was terrified,” Michels said Friday. Although her knee is still numb and has no reflex, her leg has recovered about 85 per cent of its normal functions. Michels said lawyer advised her against filing lawsuit, and she chose not to lay complaint about Graham with the College of Physicians and Surgeons of Saskatchewan. But after she learned of Baert’s devastating injuries, she regretted that decision. “There’s guilt thing,” said Michels. “Maybe if I’d said something earlier.” Graham unknowingly punctured Baert’s bowel, allowing toxins to leak into her body, during the routine tubal ligation in July 1999. The 21-year-old was discharged from hospital but two days later was rushed back suffering from septic shock. Doctors had to amputate her hands and feet. She also suffered severe brain damage. Earlier this week, after nine weeks of evidence in civil trial launched by Baert and her family, jury decided Graham was not negligent in the case. Graham’s lawyers argued bowel perforations are rare but recognized risks of tubal ligations, and it was up to the nurses to watch for symptoms of complications after the surgery. Graham also claimed Baert was partially at fault for not immediately returning to the hospital when she experienced increasing pain at home. Michels and other former patients were supposed to testify in the trial, but Court of Queen’s Bench Justice Grant Currie ruled their stories weren’t relevant to Baert’s case and would unfairly prejudice the jury. Among them was Gloria Cooke of Dawson Creek, B.C., who almost died after Graham twice punctured her bowel during tubal ligation there in 2002. After several life-saving surgeries, she was left with chronic pain and an incisional hernia in her abdomen. Cooke recently settled lawsuit with Graham out of court for an undisclosed sum. Michels said she doesn’t hold grudge against Graham, although she’s glad he is no longer practising. Graham stopped working after heart attack in 2003. “My situation is nothing compared to Lisa’s and I’m fine,” she said. “I want to express my own absolute horror that she is not getting justice. It’s absolutely unacceptable.” Jessie Isabelle Hurlburt was 73 when she went into the Lloydminster hospital for hysterectomy in 1996. Graham punctured her bowel during the operation, and she was sent to Saskatoon for life-saving surgery. After three weeks in intensive care, she left with an ileostomy bag that she would need for the rest of her life. “Once she recovered, she was quite angry about what happened to her,” said her son Les. “My mother said, ‘I want you to do something about this because don’t want this to happen to anyone else.’” Hurlburt died four years later from encephalitis, or an infection in the brain. Les said he formally complained to the college of physicians and surgeons about his mother’s surgery. Its investigation found “no medical mismanagement” by Graham. Also in 1996, Marleen Burgess saw Graham for hysterectomy. The 52-year-old said when she woke up in the Lloydminster hospital, Graham told her she’d had “complete” hysterectomy but he left one ovary to help her through menopause. But in 2004, while undergoing surgery to remove grapefruit-sized cyst on the remaining ovary, another doctor told Burgess she’d never had complete hysterectomy. She still had cervix. Burgess said her new doctor said her insides were “mess.” “She said, ‘Oh, my Lord. Who did this to you?’” Lynn Laursen said Graham cut the main artery feeding her left leg during hysterectomy in Lloydminster in 1997. “I was in danger of losing my leg and my life,” said Laursen, now 53. She said another surgeon rushed in to stitch up the artery, and save her life. She later needed two more surgeries. “When Dr. Graham did this to me, he never came and saw my husband and me to explain what happened,” said Laursen. She said she wanted the chance to testify in the Baert case and face him. “I would just ask him why it happened,” she said. Glen Luther, law professor at the University of Saskatchewan, said the judge in the Baert trial would have weighed both the prejudicial and prohibitive values of the testimony of Graham’s other patients. “He would have had to make close call.” Luther said Baert’s lawyers may have grounds for an appeal because there is not much precedent on the issue in the civil courts. [Italics are mine] [102] Dr. Graham argued that the italicized words in this article contained false, malicious and defamatory words that were understood to mean: (a) He negligently performed surgery on Lisa Baert, thereby causing her to become quadriplegic, to suffer septic shock, severe brain damage and the amputation of her hands and feet; (b) He negligently performed surgery on Sharry Michels, causing her to suffer permanent numbness and the loss of reflex in her right knee; (c) His negligent acts and omissions in his treatment of Sharry Michels warranted severe disciplinary sanction by the College of Physicians and Surgeons of Saskatchewan; (d) He negligently performed surgery on Gloria Cooke nearly causing her death and causing her to suffer chronic pain and an incisional hernia in her abdomen; (e) He negligently performed surgery on Jessie Isabelle Hurlburt nearly causing her immediate death and resulting in her requiring an ileostomy bag for the rest of her life; (f) The complications caused by his negligent surgery resulted in Jessie Isabelle Hurlburt suffering encephalitis, brain infection, which eventually led to her death; (g) His aforesaid conduct concerning Jessie Isabelle Hurlburt warranted severe disciplinary sanction by the College of Physicians and Surgeons of Saskatchewan; (h) He dishonestly and deceitfully misrepresented to Marleen Burgess that he had performed complete hysterectomy on her; (i) He negligently performed surgery on Marleen Burgess creating surgical mess; (j) He negligently performed surgery on Lynn Laursen, nearly causing her death and the loss of her left leg; and (k) He is guilty of habitual negligence in his surgical practice and should not be permitted to carry on practice as surgeon because of the unacceptable risk he poses to the life and health of patients. [103] Dr. Graham also argued that alternatively, these defamatory meanings were conveyed by legal innuendo by the combined effect of the articles written by Ms. Purdy on November 24, 28, 29 and 30, 2007 and this December article. [104] The defendants agreed that the italicized portions of this article were defamatory. They agree that the plain meaning of these italicized words was that Dr. Graham was negligent in his treatment of Lisa Baert, Sharry Michels, Gloria Cooke, Jessie Isabelle Hurlburt, Marleen Burgess and Lynn Laursen. They deny that these words have any other meaning. The defendants did not raise any other defences in relation to these words. [105] Once again, am satisfied that the natural and ordinary meaning of the words complained of go farther than simply that he was negligent in his treatment of these six individuals. The paragraphs complained of relating to Lisa Baert, when read together, would lead reasonable person to believe that Dr. Graham made surgical mistakes on four other women before the mistakes he made during Ms. Baert’s tubal ligation and that as result of his mistakes, she suffered septic shock, severe brain damage, doctors had to amputate her hands and feet and she is now quadriplegic. [106] As relates Sharry Michels, the words in the paragraphs complained of should be read together. The gynecologist, who she later identified as Dr. Graham, accidentally clamped her femoral artery, nerve and vein during hysterectomy he was performing on her in 1998. When she woke up in the recovery room her right leg was cold and felt like it was asleep. She later learned that she may never regain feeling in her leg. Her knee is still numb and she has no reflex in it but her leg has recovered about 85 percent of its normal function. She consulted lawyer about suing Dr. Graham but he advised against it and she decided not to lay complaint against him to the Saskatchewan College of Physicians and Surgeons, decision she now regrets. [107] The defendants already admit that these words indicate that Dr. Graham negligently performed surgery on Ms. Michels. But it is apparent to anyone reading the words that as result of that negligent surgery, she has permanent numbness and no reflex in her right knee. cannot however conclude that reasonable person considering these comments complained of, read alone, or in the context of the article as whole, or even read in conjunction with the other articles written by Ms. Purdy, would understand that these words meant that Dr. Graham’s negligent acts and omissions in his treatment of Ms. Michels warranted severe disciplinary action by the College of Physicians and Surgeons of Saskatchewan. Ms. Michels is not referenced in any other articles except this one and the words make it clear that she did not pursue either lawsuit or complaint to the College after receiving legal advice. Having found out about Ms. Baert’s case, she now regrets not making complaint. The construction of these paragraphs does not allow one to draw the conclusion that Dr. Graham’s treatment of her warranted severe disciplinary sanction. The reasonable person would interpret these words as meaning that based on the legal advice she received, there was no point pursuing complaint about Dr. Graham to the College. [108] The words in the paragraphs complained of referencing Gloria Cooke are very clear in their meaning. Ms. Cooke almost died after Dr. Graham twice punctured her bowel during tubal ligation in 2002 and after several life-saving surgeries she has chronic pain and an incisional hernia in her abdomen. Even without considering the comments that she sued Dr. Graham and he settled with her, an ordinary person would understand these words to mean that Dr. Graham negligently performed surgery on Ms. Cooke, that she nearly died as result of that surgery and that she now has chronic pain and an incisional hernia as result of his mistakes. [109] There are words in the paragraphs complained of that relate to another of Dr. Graham’s former patients, Jessie Isabelle Hurlburt. These portions again are quite clear in their meaning. Dr. Graham performed hysterectomy on her in 1996 and in the course of doing so, punctured her bowel. As result of that, she was sent to Saskatoon for life-saving surgery. She was left with an ileostomy bag that she would need for the rest of her life. She was upset about this surgery and asked her son Les to do something about it. He filed formal complaint with the College of Physicians and Surgeons. What is omitted from the words complained of by Dr. Graham, but which appear in the article, is that after an investigation the College found “no medical mismanagement” by him. Four years later Ms. Hurlburt passed on as result of brain infection. Again, the defendants admit that these words indicate that Dr. Graham was negligent in his treatment of Ms. Hurlburt but these words also clearly indicate that as result of this negligence she almost died, had to have life-saving surgery and thereafter required an ileostomy bag for the rest of her life. [110] These words though do not leave one believing that she developed encephalitis as complication of Dr. Graham’s negligent surgery on her some four years earlier. reasonable person looking at these words themselves, in the context of the article as whole or in light of the previous articles complained of written by Ms. Purdy, would conclude brain infection occurring some four years later was separate and apart from any complication resulting from negligent hysterectomy. [111] am also not satisfied that looking at these words by themselves, in the context of the article as whole or in light of the previous articles complained of, that reasonable person would take from the words that as result of Dr. Graham’s negligent surgical conduct severe disciplinary sanction by the Saskatchewan College of Physicians and Surgeons was warranted. This is the only article that speaks about Ms. Hurlburt. As earlier pointed out, Dr. Graham conveniently admitted from the words complained of that the College, after investigating his treatment of Ms. Hurlburt, determined that there was no medical mismanagement on his part. Read in this light, reasonable person would understand that these words meant that Dr. Graham’s treatment of Ms. Hurlburt did not warrant disciplinary sanction from the College. [112] The next person mentioned in the words complained of is Marleen Burgess. The words in these paragraphs in the article advise that in 1996, Dr. Graham saw her for hysterectomy. Reading the paragraphs as whole, it is clear that Dr. Graham was the person who performed the hysterectomy on her. When she woke up after the surgery, Dr. Graham told her she had complete hysterectomy but he had left one ovary inside her. In 2004 she had surgery to remove cyst from that ovary. The doctor who did that surgery told her that she did not previously have complete hysterectomy and that her insides were “a mess”. Bearing in mind that the defendants admit that these words mean that Dr. Graham was negligent in his treatment of Ms. Burgess, the objective, natural and ordinary meaning of these words as whole is that Dr. Graham misrepresented to Ms. Burgess that he had performed complete hysterectomy on her and that as result of his negligent treatment of her, her insides were mess. In the context of the article as whole or in relation to the previous articles complained of, there is nothing that would lead person to believe that Dr. Graham made the misrepresentation to Ms. Burgess dishonestly or deceitfully. [113] The words in the paragraphs complained of referring to Lynn Laursen are short and to the point. Dr. Graham, in the course of performing hysterectomy on her in 1997, cut the main artery feeding her left leg. She almost lost her leg and her life. Another doctor stitched up her artery and saved her life. The clear meaning of these words to anyone reading them is that Dr. Graham negligently performed surgery on Ms. Laursen nearly causing her death and the loss of her left leg. [114] Finally, Dr. Graham argues that the words and paragraphs he has identified as problematic lead to the defamatory meaning that he is guilty of habitual negligence and should not be permitted to carry on practice as surgeon because of the unacceptable risk he poses to the life and health of patients. Looking at all of the words Dr. Graham complains of and the context of the entire article, an ordinary person would reasonably interpret that Dr. Graham was habitually negligent in his surgical practice. But this article, like the other articles written by Ms. Purdy on November 28, 29 and 30, makes it clear that Dr. Graham stopped working after heart attack in 2003 and is no longer practicing medicine. Given this information in light of the article as whole, reasonable person would conclude that thankfully, Dr. Graham has already retired from the practice of medicine for health reasons and is no longer problem. (vii) The January 3, 2008 Article [115] This is the last article that Dr. Graham complains of. It appeared on page A3 of the Star Phoenix on January 3, 2008 and on the newspaper’s websites. This article reads as follows: Baert to appeal tubal ligation ruling Lisa Baert and her family are appealing the decision of civil jury that found her gynecologist not negligent after routine tubal ligation left her brain-damaged quadriplegic. Baert’s lawyers filed the notice with the Saskatchewan Court of Appeal in Regina on Dec. 27. The 12-page document claims mistakes were made by Court of Queen’s Bench Justice Grant Currie, both during the trial and with his instructions to the jury. The notice asks the province’s top court to find Dr. Kenneth Graham liable and assess damages or order second trial in Saskatoon. Baert and her family claimed more than $10 million in damages against Graham. The family reached an undisclosed settlement with the Lloydminster hospital and some of its nurses before the trial began in the fall. In November, after sitting through nine weeks of evidence, an all-female jury determined Graham was not negligent in the case. Baert was 21 when she went to the Lloydminster hospital on July 14, 1999, to have her “tubes tied.” She and her husband, Mark, were financially strapped and already had two children. During the laparoscopic operation, Graham unknowingly punctured Baert’s bowel and the two-millimetre hole allowed toxins to leak into her body. She was discharged from hospital but two days later was rushed back in septic shock. Doctors had to amputate her hands and feet. She also suffered severe brain damage. Baert, now 29, lives in Saskatoon’s Parkridge Centre, long-term care home where staff change her diapers and put on her prosthetic limbs. Graham, who no longer practices as doctor, testified bowel perforations are recognized although rare risk of tubal ligations. The 55-year-old said it was up to nurses to monitor Baert for symptoms of complications after the surgery. Graham also argued Baert was partially responsible for her injuries because she did not return to the hospital when she experienced increasing pain at home. Baert and concerned neighbour allegedly called the hospital three times in the two days following the surgery, concerned about her increasing pain. They talked to unknown nurses who said Baert should wait out the pain and gave permission for her to take the neighbour’s prescription pain killers. Baert’s lawyers argued Graham did not get informed consent for the surgery, used improper technique and should have known he punctured her bowel when equipment in the operating room measured high pressure reading. They said Graham also had duty to pass that information on to Baert and the nurses so they could better watch for symptoms of complications. [Italics are mine] [116] Dr. Graham states that the natural and ordinary meaning of the italicized words in this article are false, malicious and defamatory and were understood to mean: (a) He negligently performed surgery on Lisa Baert, thereby causing her to suffer septic shock, the amputation of her hands and feet and severe brain damage; (b) He performed surgery on Lisa Baert without her informed consent; and (c) He deliberately and deceitfully concealed from Lisa Baert and from her nurses the fact that he had punctured her bowel during surgery thereby unconscionably exposing his patient to the risk of death or severe injury. [117] In the alternative, Dr. Graham stated that the aforesaid defamatory meanings were conveyed by legal innuendo, by the combined effect of all of the other articles written by Chris Purdy that he complained of. [118] Defendants’ counsel argued that the natural and ordinary meaning of the words complained of is non-defamatory. In his view, this article was about the Baert family’s decision to appeal the jury’s determination in the case. The defendants did not raise any other defences in relation to the words Dr. Graham complains of in this article. [119] The first three paragraphs that Dr. Graham complains of are juxtaposed together in the article. Prior to these three paragraphs, the article twice states that Dr. Graham was found not negligent after jury trial and further that notice of appeal has now been filed alleging number of mistakes made by the presiding judge and in his instructions to the jury. The paragraphs following these three paragraphs complained of summarize Dr. Graham’s position at trial and Ms. Baert’s lawyer’s arguments at trial. [120] These first three paragraphs are summary of what happened to Ms. Baert. The plain meaning of these words is that Dr. Graham unknowingly punctured Ms. Baert’s bowel thereby allowing toxins to leak into her body, two days later she returned to the hospital in an ambulance suffering from septic shock and consequently doctors had to amputate her hands and feet and she suffered brain damage. These words are reasonably capable of having the defamatory meaning that Dr. Graham was negligent in his treatment of Ms. Baert and that he caused her catastrophic injuries. [121] However, these paragraphs must be considered in the context of the article as whole. The byline indicates that the Baerts are going to appeal the decision and the article twice states that Dr. Graham was found not negligent in the case. This is an antidote to the defamatory comments in the three paragraphs complained of by Dr. Graham. reasonable person looking at this article in its entirety would understand that Dr. Graham was found not negligent of puncturing Ms. Baert’s bowel and causing her these devastating injuries and the Baerts have appealed this decision. It is inappropriate to consider these three paragraphs separate from the rest of the article. When that is done, the bane is removed by the antidote. [122] The other words complained of by Dr. Graham in the article also do not carry the defamatory meanings that he suggests. The comments that Dr. Graham did not get Ms. Baert’s informed consent for the surgery, that he used an improper technique, that he should have known he punctured her bowel and that he had duty to pass that information on to Ms. Baert and the attendant nurses are attributed to the argument made by Ms. Baert’s lawyers at trial. The two paragraphs in question make that clear. They start with the words “Baerts’ lawyers argued …” and “they said …”. Immediately preceding these two paragraphs are two paragraphs summarizing Dr. Graham’s arguments at the trial. reasonable person reading this article would understand that these were the positions taken by each of the parties at trial, that Dr. Graham’s position was accepted as he was found not to be negligent, that the Baerts’ arguments were not accepted and now the Baerts have appealed. These words do not support the defamatory meaning that Dr. Graham suggests. [123] Even looking at the combined effect of all of the previous articles complained of by Dr. Graham, reasonable person would still not be left with the impression that these words meant that Dr. Graham performed surgery on Ms. Baert without her informed consent and that he deliberately and deceitfully concealed from her and the nurses that he had punctured her bowel thereby unconscionably exposing her to risk of death or severe injury. That person would still understand that these comments are about the Baerts appealing and what they are appealing. The allegations that this January 3, 2008 article is defamatory are dismissed. [124] To summarize, the evidence establishes that Ms. Purdy defamed Dr. Graham in articles she wrote and that were published in the Star Phoenix newspaper and/or on the newspaper’s websites on November 28, 29 (both articles), 30 and December 1, 2007, the defamatory meanings of those words being: (a) He negligently performed surgery on Lisa Baert causing her to suffer devastating injuries and the jury’s verdict exonerating him of negligence was wrong; (b) He negligently performed surgery on Lisa Baert causing her to suffer septic shock, amputation of her hands and her legs below the knees, cardiac arrests resulting in severe brain damage leaving her with the mental capacity of child and requiring her to live in long-term care facility; (c) He negligently performed surgery on Lisa Baert causing her to become quadriplegic; (d) He did not advise the nurses or Lisa Baert that he had punctured her bowel during surgery or alternatively that he negligently failed to do so; (e) He did not advise Lisa Baert of the risks associated with tubal ligation surgery and did not receive her informed consent to perform such surgery; (f) The verdict of the jury exonerating him in his treatment of Lisa Baert was perverse; (g) He negligently performed surgery on Gloria Cooke and negligently failed to address post-surgery complications that led to septic shock, permanent chronic pain, an incisional hernia in her abdomen, the permanent loss of her stomach muscles and nearly caused her death; (h) He negligently performed surgery on Dana McLellan placing her health and life in jeopardy; (i) He negligently performed surgery on Sharry Michels causing her to suffer permanent numbness and the loss of reflex in her right knee; (j) He negligently performed surgery on Jessie Isabelle Hurlburt nearly causing her immediate death and resulting in her requiring an ileostomy bag for the rest of her life; (k) He misrepresented to Marleen Burgess that he had performed complete hysterectomy on her; (l) He negligently performed surgery on Marleen Burgess creating surgical mess; (m) He negligently performed surgery on Lynn Laursen nearly causing her death and the loss of her left leg; and (n) He is guilty of habitual negligence in his surgical practice. [125] Having reached this conclusion, must determine the liability of the remaining defendants. [126] Rod Nickel was the city editor at the Star Phoenix newspaper from September 2007 to January 2008. He assigned Chris Purdy to cover the Baert trial. He does not recall the instructions he gave to her or any particular discussion he had with her prior to the trial. He would have had day-to-day understanding of what Ms. Purdy was reporting on and what articles she was submitting on the trial. He could not explain what investigation he undertook to determine if Ms. Purdy covered the trial in balanced fashion except to say that he was doing his job while she was covering the trial. [127] Mr. Nickel did not recall what input he had on what Ms. Purdy reported on or what days of the trial she attended but normally he would discuss with her what stage the trial was at and what was possibly coming up. [128] He was aware that Ms. Purdy was writing articles about Dr. Graham’s previous patients but he was not sure when he became aware of that. He did not recall if he assigned her to do this or if she came up with this on her own. He did not recall what discussions he had with her about her research efforts or verifying the allegations made by these other patients. He did not recall whether he confirmed with Ms. Purdy whether she spoke to any medical doctors that had treated these patients after Dr. Graham. [129] After reviewing Ms. Purdy’s articles dated November 24, 2007 through to and including the January 3, 2008 article, he could not recall if he performed an editorial function over these articles before they were published nor did he recall having any discussions with Ms. Purdy concerning their content or any revisions or edits. [130] Dale Brin was the publisher and general manager of the Star Phoenix newspaper from 2004 to 2010. He had no involvement in the content or editing of any articles written by the reporter covering the Baert trial, he was not advised about the reporting in the case nor did he have any conversations with anyone about the reporting. [131] Cameron Hutchinson was the managing editor of the Star Phoenix in 2000. In 2007 he was aware that Ms. Purdy was covering the Baert trial but he does not recall having any involvement in the reporting or editing of the stories she wrote. He did not believe that he would have seen the stories until they appeared in the newspaper as at that time he oversaw the newsroom and reported to Steven Gibb and Rod Nickel. He did not recall having any conversations with Mr. Nickel about any of the articles Ms. Purdy wrote prior to publication. He had no recollection about whether concerns were raised or whether they had any discussions about Ms. Purdy’s reporting on other patients of Dr. Graham or about what Ms. Purdy’s investigation of the allegations made by these other patients may have been. [132] Steven Gibb was the editor-in-chief of the Star Phoenix from 1993 to 2010. [133] The defendant, Canwest Publishing Inc. owned the Star Phoenix newspaper and its websites and employed the other named defendants. The Star Phoenix newspaper, Canwest Publishing Inc. and/or its assets were purchased by Postmedia Network Inc. in or around 2012. [134] In case such as this, all persons who aid or participate in the publication of defamatory expression, in furtherance of common design, may be held liable in damages to the plaintiff, whether or not at the time they realized they were committing the tort of defamation. The law regards them as joint tortfeasors. Botiuk at paras. 73 to 77; Hill Church of Scientology of Toronto, 1995 CanLII 59 (SCC), [1995] SCR 1130 at para 176 [Hill]. [135] The publication of libel, composed by one, printed by another and distributed by third, is joint tort, with joint and several liability. Therefore, where it is published in newspaper, the injured person may sue in the same action the editor, the proprietor, the printer and the publisher, and each is liable on the judgment for the whole amount; the publication is the joint act of all. Lambert at para. 6. [136] In this case, and in light of the aforementioned case law, I am satisfied that at the time of the publishing of the defamatory articles, Rod Nickel, being the city editor and Ms. Purdy’s immediate supervising editor, Cameron Hutchinson being the managing editor, Dale Brin being the publisher and general manager of the Star Phoenix and Steven Gibb being the editor-in-chief of the Star Phoenix are all joint tortfeasors of Ms. Purdy’s defamatory comments and as such, jointly and severally liable in defamation to Dr. Graham. [137] I am also satisfied that Canwest Publishing Inc. as the former owner of the Star Phoenix and its websites and Postmedia Network Inc. as the current owner of the Star Phoenix and its websites are also joint tortfeasors with Ms. Purdy and the other defendants noted and as such are jointly and severally liable in defamation to Dr. Graham. (c) What damages, if any, is Dr. Graham entitled to? [138] In the pleadings, Dr. Graham claims against the defendants, jointly and severally, as follows: (a) General damages in the sum of $2,000,000; (b) Aggravated damages in the sum of $1,000,000; (c) Punitive damages in the sum of $1,000,000; (d) Special damages in an amount to be particularized; [139] In closing argument, Dr. Graham’s counsel advised that they were only seeking general and aggravated damages. He argued that general damages award in defamation case is very subjective determination and one that must be made where there is no tangible injury. He reminded me that aggravated damages ought not to be awarded unless malice has been shown but in his view there was considerable evidence of malice in this case. He took issue with any suggestion by the defendants that Dr. Graham had bad reputation when he came to court. In his view, must look at Dr. Graham’s reputation at the time of the defamation. He urged me to approach the issue by asking myself “what is sufficient sum that recognizes that this was bad, unwarranted defamation?” [140] Counsel referred me to number of cases including Hiltz and Seamone Co. Nova Scotia (Attorney General) (1999), 1999 CanLII 13144 (NS CA), 173 NSR (2d) 341 (CA) $200,000 general damages; Universal Weld Overlays Inc.

[Leenen] general damages of $400,000 and aggravated damages of $350,000; and Fiola LeBrun, 2002 MBQB 312 (CanLII), 169 Man (2d) 172 general damages of $250,000 and $100,000 aggravated damages. [141] Defendants’ counsel argued that Dr. Graham was only entitled to general damages in an amount not exceeding $25,000. He stated that while little is to be gained from detailed comparison of libel awards in other cases, the Court should use as an appropriate measure of the upper end of the range of damages, the Saskatchewan Court of Appeal’s decision in Rubin Ross, 2013 SKCA 21 (CanLII), 409 Sask 202 ($100,000 general damages) and the Saskatchewan Court of Queen’s Bench decision in Duke Puts, 2001 SKQB 130 (CanLII), 204 Sask 130 ($100,000 general damages and $150,000 aggravated damages). [142] He suggested that the Court pay particular attention to the factual background in this case and consider that Dr. Graham’s reputation was already previously damaged at the time he brought his claim in the present case. He denied that there was any malice on behalf of the defendants or any of them. [143] Brown on Defamation, vol at 25-33 to 23-36, describes general compensatory damages as follows: The successful plaintiff in defamation action is entitled to recover, as general compensatory damages, such sum as will compensate him for the wrong he has suffered. That sum must compensate him for the damage to his reputation; vindicate his good name; and take account of the distress, hurt and humiliation which the defamatory publication has caused. In assessing the amount, consideration may be given to the damage which may yet accrue to the plaintiff as natural consequence of the publication since in any action for defamation damages must be assessed once and for all. There must be some rational and appropriate relationship between the harm suffered by the plaintiff and the amount of damages awarded. Compensatory damages are not awarded to punish defendant, nor should they be used to enrich the plaintiff at the expense of the offending party. [144] In Mann International Assn. of Machinists and Aerospace Workers, 2012 BCSC 181 (CanLII) [Mann], Masuhara J. discussed the principles governing an award of general damages: [129] General damages for defamation are presumed. The plaintiff does not need to prove injury in order to recover an award for damages. However, damages must be based upon firm factual basis and in sensible manner: Brown on Defamation, vol. 6, ch. 25 at 2, 12; Hill at para. 164; Halls v. Mitchell, 1926 CanLII 357 (ON CA), [1927] D.L.R. 163 (Ont. C.A.), per Riddell J.A. at 175, citing Ratcliffe v. Evans, [1892] Q.B. 524 at 528 (C.A.); Smith (S.C.) at para. 91. [130] General damages for defamation are at large, meaning that the court is entitled to make subjective assessment without requiring proof of specific financial loss. [131] There is no cap placed on damages for defamation: Hill at para. 168: [132] Each case is unique. Accordingly, there is no formula for determining general compensatory damages. However, in Hill at para. 182 the following factors, were identified in determining an award of general damages: (a) the plaintiff's conduct, position and standing; (b) the nature of the defamation; (c) the mode and extent of publication; (d) the absence or refusal of any retraction or apology; and (e) the whole of the defendant's conduct from the time of publication to the end of trial. [145] In Leenen the Court provided the following non-exhaustive list of factors to take into account in the assessment of general damages: [205] (a) the seriousness of the defamatory statement; (b) the identity of the accuser; (c) the breadth of the distribution of the publication of the libel; (d) republication of the libel; (e) the failure to give the audience both sides of the picture and not presenting balanced review; (f) the desire to increase one's professional reputation or to increase ratings of particular program; (g) the conduct of the defendant and defendant's counsel through to the end of trial; (h) the absence or refusal of any retraction or apology; (i) the failure to establish plea of justification. [146] In Hill Cory J. described aggravated damages, what is required before they can be awarded and some of the factors court can consider in assessing them: 188 Aggravated damages may be awarded in circumstances where the defendants' conduct has been particularly high-handed or oppressive, thereby increasing the plaintiff's humiliation and anxiety arising from the libellous statement. The nature of these damages was aptly described by Robins J.A. in Walker v. CFTO Ltd., supra, [(1987), 1987 CanLII 126 (ON CA), 59 OR (2d) 104] in these words at p. 111: Where the defendant is guilty of insulting, high-handed, spiteful, malicious or oppressive conduct which increases the mental distress the humiliation, indignation, anxiety, grief, fear and the like suffered by the plaintiff as result of being defamed, the plaintiff may be entitled to what has come to be known as “aggravated damages”. 189 These damages take into account the additional harm caused to the plaintiff's feelings by the defendant's outrageous and malicious conduct. Like general or special damages, they are compensatory in nature. Their assessment requires consideration by the jury of the entire conduct of the defendant prior to the publication of the libel and continuing through to the conclusion of the trial. They represent the expression of natural indignation of right-thinking people arising from the malicious conduct of the defendant. 190 If aggravated damages are to be awarded, there must be finding that the defendant was motivated by actual malice, which increased the injury to the plaintiff, either by spreading further afield the damage to the reputation of the plaintiff, or by increasing the mental distress and humiliation of the plaintiff. See, for example, Walker v. CFTO Ltd., supra, at p. 111; Vogel, supra, at p. 178 [[1982] WWR 08]; Kerr v. Conlogue (1992), 1992 CanLII 924 (BC SC), 65 B.C.L.R. (2d) 70 (S.C.), at p. 93; and Cassell Co. v. Broome, supra, at pp. 825-26 [[1972] All ER 801]. The malice may be established by intrinsic evidence derived from the libellous statement itself and the circumstances of its publication, or by extrinsic evidence pertaining to the surrounding circumstances which demonstrate that the defendant was motivated by an unjustifiable intention to injure the plaintiff. See Taylor v. Despard, supra, at p. 975 [1956 CanLII 124 (ON CA), [1956] OR 963]. 191 There are number of factors that jury may properly take into account in assessing aggravated damages. For example, was there withdrawal of the libellous statement made by the defendants and an apology tendered? If there was, this may go far to establishing that there was no malicious conduct on the part of the defendant warranting an award of aggravated damages. The jury may also consider whether there was repetition of the libel, conduct that was calculated to deter the plaintiff from proceeding with the libel action, prolonged and hostile cross-examination of the plaintiff or plea of justification which the defendant knew was bound to fail. The general manner in which the defendant presented its case is also relevant. Further, it is appropriate for jury to consider the conduct of the defendant at the time of the publication of the libel. For example, was it clearly aimed at obtaining the widest possible publicity in circumstances that were the most adverse possible to the plaintiff? [147] As to what constitutes malice, it is more expansive than the everyday meaning of desire to harm another. It includes spite or ill-will and relates to any indirect motive which conflicts with the sense of duty created by the occasion. Courts may infer person’s motive for publishing defamatory statements but only from what the person said, did or knew. defendant is actuated by actual or express malice if he or she publishes the words: (i) Knowing them to be false; or (ii) With reckless indifference whether they are true or false; or (iii) For the dominant purpose of injuring the plaintiff because of spite or animosity; or (iv) For some other dominant purpose which is improper or indirect. Court may consider the whole of the defendants’ conduct and the context in which it was made, both current and former. See Palen Dagenais, 2012 SKQB 383 (CanLII) at para 32, 406 Sask 107; Mann at paras 96 to 98. [148] In Botiuk, the Supreme Court of Canada said that the following comment from Lord Diplock in Horrocks Lowe, [1975] AC 135 (HL) is generally representative of the Canadian position on recklessness: 97 what is required on the part of the defamer to entitle him to the protection of the privilege is positive belief in the truth of what he published or, as it is generally though tautologously termed, “honest belief”. If he publishes untrue defamatory matter recklessly, without considering or caring whether it be true or not, he is in this, as in other branches of the law, treated as if he knew it to be false. But indifference to the truth of what he publishes is not to be equated with carelessness, impulsiveness or irrationality in arriving at positive belief that it is true. But despite the imperfection of the mental process by which the belief is arrived at it may still be “honest”, that is, positive belief that the conclusions they have reached are true. The law demands no more. [Emphasis added.] [149] Ms. Purdy testified that as journalist, she was familiar with journalistic best practices and specifically what those practices said about accuracy and fairness. As diligent journalist, it was her practice to keep notebooks and record pertinent facts including leads, sources and their contact information and she did so in the course of covering the Baert trial. [150] Ms. Purdy did not recall attending court on November 27, 2007 to listen to the judge’s charge to the jury. However, she had 13 pages of notes about the charge so she believed that she was there. In her notes she wrote down that the judge told the jury “not every mistake constitutes negligence”, “a bowel perforation sometimes happens with skilled surgeons using proper technique”, “BP happens to even the most skilled surgeon” and “BP is inherent risk of surgery itself”. Ms. Purdy agreed that these were important points in the judge’s charge that reader should or would want to know, however she acknowledged that she did not put them in any of her articles. [151] Ms. Purdy testified that after the verdict came down on November 28, she wrote an article entitled “Gynecologist not negligent in tubal ligation lawsuit”. She said that this article does not report solely on the jury’s verdict in the case but includes allegations that Gloria Cooke and Dana McLellan suffered complications as result of the surgery Dr. Graham performed upon them. She acknowledged that these were serious allegations being made by these two women and as result, she would have spoken to another source to verify their information. She said that she spoke to John Jordan, Ms. Cooke’s lawyer, but did not speak to Ms. Cooke and did not recall speaking to anyone else. She did not ask for or see Ms. Cooke’s medical records and she did not call any of the doctors that treated Ms. Cooke. She did not speak to medical professional about Ms. Cooke’s allegations. [152] Ms. Purdy said that in her notes from her discussions with Mr. Jordan, she recorded “pressure from maternity ward because baby in distress”. She reluctantly admitted that this was some significant context that she did not mention in her article. She also admitted that she did not try contacting Dr. Graham’s lawyer, she cannot say if she tried contacting Dr. Graham or left message for him but agreed that there was nothing in the article about her trying to contact him. [153] As well, Ms. Purdy said that all of her information about Dana McLellan came from previous newspaper articles. She did not recall trying to contact Ms. McLellan or the writer of the previous article. She did not believe that she tried to contact any of Ms. McLellan’s medical doctors or obtain her medical records. She could not say that she tried to contact Dr. Graham to speak to him about Ms. McLellan’s case. [154] Ms. Purdy agreed that as an obstetrician and gynecologist, Dr. Graham would have performed many of the types of surgeries he performed on Ms. Cooke and Ms. McLellan. She acknowledged that she did not try to determine his rate of complication or try to compare his rate of complication to that of the average obstetrician/gynecologist. She indicated that that would have been helpful information to know. [155] In one of the paragraphs in the article she stated that the British Columbia College of Physicians and Surgeons granted licence to Dr. Graham “despite” Baert’s injuries in Saskatchewan. She said that she chose to use the word “despite” because she felt that the College would have had to have considered the Baert case before giving Dr. Graham licence. She admitted that she had not spoken to the College about this nor did she have any information that Dr. Graham had done anything wrong. [156] Ms. Purdy did speak to Susan Prins of the College and was advised that the community Dr. Graham was working in did not have appropriate back-up in case of an emergency situation and that “no disciplinary measure is necessary”. She did not report this in her article but instead chose to simply state that Dr. Graham’s licence was not revoked. She was not sure why she chose those words. [157] Ms. Purdy acknowledged that she spoke to someone at the Northern Health Authority and was advised that Dr. Graham was “never disciplined so no release of report and no penalty”. Despite knowing this information, she did not include this in her article. [158] Ms. Purdy testified that the first November 29 article was just reprint of the website article she had written on November 28. She did not recall whose decision it was to write the second article on November 29 entitled “Routine surgery became health nightmare”. She agreed that she did not refer to the verdict in the trial in this story and that person reading this article would have no reason to think that Dr. Graham got acquitted in negligence action. [159] Ms. Purdy testified that the November 30 article was about the Baert family deciding to appeal the verdict and Mark Baert’s response to the verdict. She acknowledged that there was nothing in the article about Dr. Graham’s reaction to the verdict and admitted that she could not recall asking Dr. Graham for comment, if he was unavailable or if he had no comment. [160] Ms. Purdy testified that she wrote the December 1, 2007 article because number of Dr. Graham’s previous patients were saying that they had suffered complications as result of Dr. Graham performing surgery on them. In light of the Baert case she thought that this was important information to share with the public. [161] According to Ms. Purdy, this article was about mistakes that Dr. Graham had made in relation to five other people besides Lisa Baert. She said that she spoke to Sharry Michels, Marleen Burgess and Lynn Laursen directly. She did not speak to Ms. Cooke directly. She obtained her information about Ms. Cooke from speaking to Ms. Cooke’s lawyer, John Jordan. She was unable to speak to Jessie Hurlburt as she had passed away. Her information about Ms. Hurlburt came from discussion she had with the deceased’s son, Les Hurlburt. She invited all of these people to send her any documents supporting what they had told her. The only person that sent her anything was Les Hurlburt. He forwarded her number of documents prior to December 1. [162] Ms. Purdy said that she spoke to one other woman whose story she did not include in this article. She said that this person seemed to be talking about rumours. She could not trust what this woman was saying and she did not think it appropriate to report on that. [163] Ms. Purdy acknowledged that prior to writing this article she never asked Sharry Michels for her medical or physiotherapy records, she did not recall speaking to any of her doctors, she did not try to contact her physiotherapist and speak to them about Ms. Michels’ case and she did not know what femoral artery was. [164] Ms. Purdy said that she received number of documents from Les Hurlburt about his mother Jessie, including medical records. She did not ask Mr. Hurlburt for any other medical information. She admitted that there were at least five other doctors referenced in these medical records but she took no steps to speak to any of them nor did she speak to any of Ms. Hurlburt’s doctors. According to her, getting consent to speak to other doctors would have been time consuming. She said that she did not speak to medical doctor about interpreting the documents for her. Instead, she relied on the documents and what Les Hurlburt told her. [165] In the material she received from Mr. Hurlburt was correspondence between him and the Saskatchewan College of Physicians and Surgeons. She was aware that Mr. Hurlburt had filed complaint with the College regarding Dr. Graham’s treatment of his mother but she did not read the complaint he sent to the College even though it was one of the documents he sent her. Another of the documents was letter dated October 15, 1997 from Dr. Graham to the College responding to the Hurlburt complaint. She read this letter and in the letter, Dr. Graham referenced that Ms. Hurlburt had had bowel cancer surgery, was treated with chemotherapy and there were post-operative problems with stitches. When asked why she did not report this, she said that it had occurred in 1977 and she did not think it was relevant. However she admitted that she never spoke to medical professional to find out if it was relevant or not. Ms. Purdy also acknowledged that elsewhere in the letter was an indication that the surgery that Dr. Graham had performed on Ms. Hurlburt was not regular hysterectomy. Despite knowing this, she did not report this in her article either. [166] Ms. Purdy also agreed that she read the College’s response to Mr. Hurlburt after they had completed their investigation. After reading the response, she was aware that the investigation had found that Dr. Graham had done nothing wrong, they advised that suturing bowel may inadvertently occur and it may be difficult to diagnose. She did not specifically report this in the article and despite knowing that Dr. Graham was not at fault, she still felt that it was newsworthy to include Ms. Hurlburt’s case in the article. [167] Ms. Purdy said that in terms of the Marleen Burgess information, she just relied on what Ms. Burgess had told her. She said that she only had general understanding of what hysterectomy was and did not believe that “complete hysterectomy” was medical term. However, she did not speak to medical professional or Ms. Burgess’s doctors to find out what that term meant. Moreover she admitted that she made no effort to contact the doctor who told Ms. Burgess that her insides were “a mess” to confirm whether or not that was indeed the case. In her view, she did not have the time to do it and she felt there would have been privacy issues. [168] Ms. Purdy also admitted that she did nothing to confirm the information she received from Lynn Laursen. In their discussions, Ms. Laursen had mentioned Dr. Gupta. Ms. Purdy confirmed that she did not try to contact this doctor even though she admitted that the doctor may have some important information for her story. [169] Ms. Purdy did not recall if she made any attempt to contact Dr. Graham regarding any of these five people but she hoped that she would have. She did not however receive anything from Dr. Graham regarding any of these cases. She did not recall if there was deadline for the story and did not know if she had more time to investigate it. [170] Ms. Purdy denied writing the December article about these other patients because she felt Ms. Baert did not get justice. According to Ms. Purdy, the jury’s verdict in the Baert case was not surprising to her. She thought it was fair given the evidence the jury heard and the questions they had to answer. She said that she agreed with the jury’s finding that Dr. Graham was not negligent. She had no basis to challenge their finding. She felt that she was doing her job and was providing fair and balanced reporting during the trial. She was not out to ruin Dr. Graham despite what he or his children thought. Ms. Purdy confirmed that she has never issued retraction or an apology to Dr. Graham. [171] Both parties called expert witnesses in this case. Dr. Graham called John Miller. Mr. Miller was senior newsroom editor at the Toronto Star Newspaper for 18 years before moving on to be the chair of the School of Journalism at Ryerson University from 1986 to 1996. Thereafter until 2009, he was professor at the School of Journalism and now holds the title of Professor Emeritus. He was qualified with the consent of the defendants’ counsel as an expert in journalism. [172] Mr. Miller testified that journalists are expected to follow commonly accepted journalistic legal and ethical standards developed by the Canadian Association of Journalists. These standards stress, among other things, accuracy and verification. journalist is to make every effort to verify the identities and backgrounds of their sources, seek documentation to support the reliability of those sources and their stories and be careful to distinguish between assertions and fact. The onus is on the journalist to verify all information even when it emerges on deadline. Secondly, fairness. journalist is to respect the rights of people involved in the news. Before journalist publishes criticisms or accusations they must give people, companies or organizations that are being criticized or accused the opportunity to respond. They must make genuine and reasonable effort to contact them and if they decline comment, they must say so. [173] Mr. Miller reviewed the articles written by Ms. Purdy on November 24, 28, 29 (two articles), 30, December 1, 2007 and January 3, 2008. The November 28, 2007 article entitled “Gynecologist Not Negligent in Tubal Ligation Lawsuit” and the November 29, 2007 article entitled “Gynecologist Not Negligent; Punctured Bowel Led to Brain Damage” were identical in content in his view and both fell short of the journalistic standard of care. According to Mr. Miller, the job of these stories was to report the jury’s verdict in complicated legal case that the newspaper had been covering for the last two months. These stories should have summarized the key testimony presented at the trial and if possible, highlight what evidence may have caused the jury to find Dr. Graham not negligent. Instead, large portion of these stories talks about other cases involving Dr. Graham. [174] These articles did not meet the journalistic standard of care for two reasons: firstly they were not fair, balanced reporting of the verdict in the Baert trial. The information about Dr. Graham’s defence was sparse, there was no reaction to the verdict from either Mr. Baert or Dr. Graham, there was no detail on what questions jury was to answer and the reader was left wondering why Dr. Graham was found not negligent. Secondly, the investigative reporting of Dr. Graham’s other patients should have been stand-alone article written after the reporter had the opportunity to do more thorough job of investigating the allegations. [175] Mr. Miller was also of the view that Ms. Purdy’s editors had responsibility to make sure that the verdict in the trial was reported fully, fairly and accurately and that her information about Dr. Graham’s other patients was verified. Unfortunately, he felt that they allowed inadmissible material to get in these articles and they never ensured that Ms. Purdy’s information about Ms. Cooke or Ms. McLellan was verified with anyone. Instead, this was single-sourced and second-hand information from lawyer and newspaper article and there was little differentiation between what was verified as fact and what the sources merely alleged. [176] It was Mr. Miller’s opinion that the December 1, 2007 article entitled “Former Patient Wanted Chance to Confront Doctor” repeated some of the unverified information that appeared in the November 28 and 29 stories and added more cases. Again however, there was no attempt to verify the allegations these people were making with doctor or to seek Dr. Graham’s side of the story. [177] He opined that this story did not need to run right after the Baert trial. There was time to wait until the information from these people could be verified and documentation received and analyzed, if necessary, by medical experts. There was certainly time to wait until Dr. Graham could be interviewed to get his side of the story. [178] Mr. Miller also reviewed the material that Les Hurlburt had sent to Ms. Purdy. He noted that this material contained detailed explanation written by Dr. Graham of the care that he gave to Jessie Hurlburt and statement from the Saskatchewan College of Physicians and Surgeons about why they found that he had done nothing wrong. Ms. Purdy chose to use very little of this information in the December article and by choosing to do so, Mr. Miller felt her story became very one sided. [179] Mr. Miller felt that the reporter did slipshod investigation, the newspaper rushed this to print and by doing so vitiated any claim of responsible reporting. If the paper was going to publish this article they should have spoken to all the people and their doctors, followed up and documented any complaints made to the respective Colleges of Physicians and Surgeons, had medical professionals corroborate or explain the complaints and most importantly, talked to Dr. Graham to get his explanation of these complaints. Nothing like that occurred and as such, reasonably intelligent reader looking at this December story might ask if the newspaper was implying that the jury in the Baert trial was wrong. [180] Mr. Miller was adamant that where there are accusations or implied criticisms of any person or institution, there must always be rigorous attempt to obtain response before publication and the response should be contained in the original story. He noted that not only was there no attempt to get Dr. Graham’s side of the story in the November 28, 29 and December articles aforementioned but there was also no attempt to do so in the second November 29 article and the November 30 article. [181] In Mr. Miller’s opinion, the November 28, 29 and December articles written by Ms. Purdy fell short of journalism’s recognized professional standards of care and her editors did not exercise ongoing oversight to ensure that her information was verified and her reports were handled responsibly. [182] The defendants’ expert, Patricia Bell, was also eminently qualified. Ms. Bell graduated in 1963 with an honour’s degree in journalism from the University of Western Ontario. She worked for the Globe and Mail travelling Asia writing stories about social and medical issues and later as freelance reporter. In 1983, she joined the Ottawa Citizen newspaper, writing education pieces and later moved to their editorial board. In 1999 she moved to Regina and became an assistant professor at the University of Regina, School of Journalism. Later she became the head of the School of Journalism and continues to teach there today. With the consent of Dr. Graham’s counsel, Ms. Bell was qualified as an expert in the area of journalism. [183] Ms. Bell testified that journalist’s professional responsibility is to tell stories that matter. In that regard, they should try to get as complete story as possible, relying on more than one source so the story does not rely on single perspective. Stories need to be verified, balanced and as complete as possible, presented with sufficient facts, details and explanations to allow readers to draw their own conclusions. Where there are accusations or implied criticisms of any person or institution there must always be rigorous attempt to obtain response before publication and the response should be contained in the original story. [184] Ms. Bell was familiar with the Canadian Association of Journalists. The Association has very comprehensive code of ethics that she subscribed to and believed in. She acknowledged that accuracy was the moral imperative of journalists and news organizations and should not be compromised even by deadlines. She said that it was the journalist’s responsibility to seek documentation, to support the reliability of sources and to be careful to distinguish between sources and fact. The onus was on the journalist to verify all information despite deadlines. [185] She also agreed that the code of ethics spoke of fairness. She explained that journalists must give people, organizations or companies that are publicly accused or criticized an opportunity to respond before publishing those accusations or criticisms. Journalists must make genuine and reasonable effort to contact them and if they decline to comment, they must say so. [186] Ms. Bell reviewed Ms. Purdy’s articles in the Baert case dated November 24, 28, 29 (two articles), 30, December 1, 2007 and January 3, 2008 and Ms. Purdy’s notebooks. It was Ms. Bell’s opinion that the November 28, 2007 article took into consideration the seriousness of the allegation, the public importance of the matter, the urgency of the matter and the status and reliability of the source. However, she felt that the main emphasis of this story should have been that the verdict came down and the jury found Dr. Graham not negligent. She said the article did not give sufficient coverage to the jury’s decision that Dr. Graham was not negligent in performing Lisa Baert’s tubal ligation. There was no mention in the story of the particular questions the judge asked the jury to consider and on which they based their decision. There was also no mention about either party’s reaction to the jury’s decision. This was imperative in her view. There was no indication if Ms. Purdy sought these reactions at all or was simply unable to get response. In her opinion, this article was not complete and readers were left without enough information to consider whether they thought the jury got it right. [187] Instead, she felt that Ms. Purdy took the first opportunity after the trial to tell people about the other complaints about Dr. Graham that she became aware of. Ms. Bell found it disturbing that the verdict and these other complaints were not two separate stories. Even then, there was no indication that Ms. Purdy tried to get the other side of the complaints in the article. Ms. Bell felt that she should have been persistent in trying to get Dr. Graham’s version of these complaints. [188] Ms. Bell said that the November 29 article entitled “Gynecologist Not Negligent: Punctured Bowel Led to Brain Damage” was fuller reporting of the November 28, 2007 website article and not simply reprinting of it. By way of example, she said that this story included information that Mark Baert did not speak to reporters after the jury’s verdict and that Dr. Graham was not present in the courtroom and his lawyer said he was busy with personal matters. For these reasons she felt that this story was more useful to readers than the November 28 story. [189] With all due respect to Ms. Bell, have carefully reviewed the copies of the November 28 website article, the November 29 website printout of the article and the November 29 newspaper article entered as exhibits in the trial and they are all identical in content. There is nothing different in any of these three documents with the exception of the byline in the November 28 article. Otherwise, the text of these three documents is the same. That being said, cannot give any weight to her conclusion that the November 29 article is better written and more useful to readers than the November 28 article. [190] Putting aside this problem with her testimony, she does acknowledge that this November 29 article is still missing detail about the judge’s charge to the jury that would allow readers to understand exactly what they were being asked to consider in deciding whether Dr. Graham was negligent or not. She also admits that there is nothing indicating whether or not Dr. Graham’s comments about the decision or about the further allegations being made against him were sought. [191] Ms. Bell testified that the December 1, 2007 story was an attempt by the newspaper to bring information to the public that they needed to know. During the Baert case, Ms. Purdy found out about other complaints involving Dr. Graham and she determined that there was another story to be written. In her report, Ms. Bell said that it appeared that the publisher was diligent in trying to verify these allegations having regard to the seriousness of the allegations, the public importance of the matter, the urgency of the matter and the status and reliability of the sources. However, Ms. Bell then opined that this story did not have to come out this quickly. News is perishable commodity so if story needs to be investigated and checked, you do it as quickly as possible. But here, the information about these stories was not “perishable news”. The perishable element was only how they relate to the Baert case. As result, Ms. Bell said that Ms. Purdy should have done more work and provided more comprehensive story. What is not in this article is an explanation from Dr. Graham about what happened in these other cases. diligent reporter would report on what occurred in court, would seek out professionals to explain things they did not understand, including legal help to assist them to understand legal issues. If reporter did not accurately report on factual or legal issue and left the reader with the wrong impression, this would not meet the standards of journalism. [192] Although her report was to the contrary, Ms. Bell agreed in cross-examination that the inclusion of these other complaints in this article left the reader thinking that the jury in the Baert case got the decision wrong. The article tells readers that the jury was not allowed to hear from these other patients but what it fails to do, according to Ms. Bell, and what Ms. Purdy had duty to tell the reader, was that these other people were only being called to talk about “informed consent” and not about their surgical complications. [193] Ms. Bell ultimately reached number of conclusions. Firstly, that there was not stand-alone news story about the jury’s decision in the Baert case with sufficient information that would allow reader to make their own determination as to whether the jury reached the proper decision. [194] Secondly, there was no response from Dr. Graham in any of the articles dated November 28, 29, 30 and December 1, 2007. The reader was not told whether this was because no attempts were made to obtain his response or whether requests for response were denied. As such, the requirement of responsible communication was not met in any of these articles. [195] Thirdly, while she felt there were some gaps in the overall coverage of the court case and the jury’s decision, it did not appear to her that they were planned in order to subvert objectivity and truth in reporting. The reality of today’s newspapers is that getting stories up on the paper’s website has become the priority before considering how they would appear in the following day’s newspaper. The size of newsrooms is eroding and the opportunities were rare for editors to stop and consider the big picture of how court case might be covered and delivered in substantial and balanced way. Given the strained economies of today’s newspapers, she felt that the overall coverage of the Baert trial was sufficient, objective and balanced and reflected attention paid by Ms. Purdy to the seriousness, public importance and urgency of the issues as well as the status and reliability of the sources. [196] turn now to the issue of general damages. Dr. Graham had been medical doctor specializing in obstetrics and gynecology. In 2003 he had serious heart attack that required quintuple bypass surgery. He was also suffering from some depression. As result of these issues, sometime in the latter part of 2003 he retired from the practice of medicine and settled in St. Albert, Alberta. [197] In 2007, his oldest son committed suicide. Shortly thereafter his wife died of cancer. In September 2007, the Lisa Baert claim against Dr. Graham went to trial. Understandably, at the time of trial he was grieving and depressed. On November 28, 2007 jury found Dr. Graham not negligent for the devastating injuries suffered by Ms. Baert. [198] Ms. Purdy, the Star Phoenix reporter who had been covering the trial, wrote series of five articles between November 28, 2007 and December 1, 2007 containing defamatory comments about Dr. Graham. These articles were published within week of the verdict: November 28, 29 (two articles), 30 and December 1, 2007. Defendants’ counsel admitted that these five articles contained defamatory comments about Dr. Graham, although not to the extent that eventually determined. All of these five articles, save for the November 28 article, appeared in the Star Phoenix newspaper and on the Star Phoenix websites. The November 28 article only appeared on the Star Phoenix websites. [199] Generally speaking, the defamatory meaning of the words complained of in these articles were that Dr. Graham had negligently performed surgery on Lisa Baert, Gloria Cooke, Dana McLellan, Sharry Michels, Jessie Hurlburt, Marleen Burgess and Lynn Laursen and had nearly caused some of them death and all of them some specific injury. In some of the articles, the defamatory meaning of the words complained of were that Dr. Graham had failed to advise Ms. Baert or the attendant nurses that he had punctured Ms. Baert’s bowel, that he did not properly advise Ms. Baert of the risks of tubal ligation surgery thereby not getting her informed consent, that the jury’s verdict exonerating him of negligence for the Lisa Baert injuries was wrong or perverse, that he misrepresented to Marleen Burgess that he had performed complete hysterectomy on her and that he was habitually negligent in his surgical practice. [200] Defamatory comments regarding Dr. Graham’s negligent surgical treatment of Ms. Baert appeared in all five articles written by Ms. Purdy. Defamatory comments regarding his surgical treatment of Gloria Cooke appeared in four of the articles, and of his surgical treatment of the rest of the named individuals, in one of the articles. The defamatory meaning that Dr. Graham was habitually negligent in his surgical practice and that the jury’s verdict exonerating him was wrong was repeated in two articles. No retraction or apology from the Star Phoenix has been published or forthcoming to date. [201] There was no direct evidence before me as to how many households get the Star Phoenix newspaper, the extent of their readership base, how many people visit their websites to read the news or how many people viewed the impugned articles on the websites or downloaded them. was however advised that all five of these articles remain on the Star Phoenix websites and are accessible to whoever wants to view them. [202] From the outset of the Baerts’ claim, Dr. Graham denied liability. The jury’s verdict in the case was vindication for him but the euphoria of that vindication was short lived. While having celebratory supper with his children the night the verdict came down, they came across the November 28 article on the Star Phoenix website. When Dr. Graham read the article, he was shocked, appalled and depressed. The byline referred to the Baert case but the article talked mainly about the complaints Gloria Cooke had made about him. He felt that the article contained number of factual inaccuracies, that it implied that his medical licence should have been revoked and made it appear that he was lucky to have been exonerated by the jury in the Baert case. [203] Every day that new article was published, Dr. Graham read it and continued to be shocked, appalled, dismayed and depressed by them. He was particularly upset after reading the December article as he felt it was full of untruths. What was particularly troubling to him was that at no point in time, either before or after any of these articles were published, did anyone from the Star Phoenix ever try to contact him to get his comment on the verdict or the allegations these other people were making about him. He also found it upsetting that the articles did not report that he had been cleared of any wrongdoing as regards number of these patients. number of these people had made complaints to either the Saskatchewan or British Columbia Colleges of Physicians and Surgeons and in every instance, it was determined that he was not negligent. However, this and the fact that he had been found not liable in the Baert case was either not reported in the articles or very little was ever said about it. [204] Defendants’ counsel made point of arguing that Dr. Graham had bad reputation at the time the defamatory comments were made about him in 2007. Dr. Graham admitted that in 2002 and 2003 after people in Dawson Creek found out about the Baert case, complaints about his treatment of patients began occurring. He said that his reputation in Dawson Creek at this time was bad because of all the media hype. But he was investigated by different professional bodies and it was never determined that he did anything wrong. Then he had his own health issues and retired. In this context, do not accept that Dr. Graham had bad reputation in 2007 when Ms. Purdy wrote her articles defaming him. [205] Dr. Graham’s children noticed change in their father over time. Two of his sons testified that the articles bothered him for days and weeks at time, that he was not himself and he became preoccupied with the articles. Dr. Graham said that he was depressed, not eating or sleeping properly and was having problems concentrating. Over time, these problems lessened but he said that he still has problems sleeping and concentrating today. [206] Both parties called expert witnesses in this case. Both experts were eminently qualified journalists in their own right. Both Mr. Miller and Ms. Bell agreed on number of points including that some of the articles written by Ms. Purdy fell short of meeting journalism’s recognized professional standards of care. However where the experts differ, prefer Mr. Miller’s testimony over that of Ms. Bell. There was an instance where Ms. Bell’s opinion was not based on the evidence before me. She described reading an article written by Ms. Purdy on November 29 that she said was almost identical to the article Ms. Purdy wrote on November 28. She indicated that this November 29 article contained more fulsome facts that affected her view on how well the article was written. However, there was no difference in content between the two articles. have no idea what Ms. Bell reviewed or what she was referring to. [207] In her written report filed as an exhibit in the proceedings, Ms. Bell goes through the articles in question. Despite acknowledging that there was no indication that Ms. Purdy made any attempt to contact Dr. Graham and get his side of the story in any of the articles in question, she still concluded that Ms. Purdy’s overall coverage of the case was sufficient, objective and balanced. cannot accept this. For reasons which will discuss more fully under the heading of aggravated damages, am unable to accept that the articles written by Ms. Purdy between November 28, 2007 and January 3, 2008 were sufficient, objective and balanced. [208] As consider what is an appropriate award for general damages in this case, am also surprised at the lack of editorial oversight of Ms. Purdy’s articles. Ms. Purdy’s immediate editor, the managing editor, the editor-in-chief and the general manager and publisher of the newspaper either disavowed having any role in overseeing Ms. Purdy or had no recollection of discussing these articles with Ms. Purdy or between themselves, reviewing these articles and offering any criticism, direction or instruction about them or authorizing her to pursue the other complaints made about Dr. Graham. This, despite evidence that the editors would get together daily to talk about stories that were being written by their reporters. [209] Taking all these factors into account I conclude that an award of $50,000 for general damages would be appropriate. [210] There is no question in this case that the series of articles written by Ms. Purdy increased Dr. Graham’s mental distress. He had just been vindicated in lengthy trial and that was taken away from him almost immediately. The articles made him mad, dismayed, indignant and depressed. He felt that the reporter was suggesting that the jury was wrong and he was negligent obstetrician/gynecologist. If aggravated damages are to be awarded in this instance, I must be satisfied that the defendants were motivated by actual or express malice. [211] Ms. Purdy testified that she agreed with the jury’s finding that Dr. Graham was not negligent in his treatment of Lisa Baert and that the jury’s verdict was fair. do not accept her testimony in this regard. All of the articles complained of by Dr. Graham were written the day the verdict came down or thereafter. The first two articles he complains of are identical. One was written by Ms. Purdy on November 28, 2007, the day of the jury’s verdict and the other article was written the next day. Both Mr. Miller and Ms. Bell agreed that the purpose of these articles should have been to report the jury’s verdict that Dr. Graham was not negligent in performing Lisa Baert’s tubal ligation. Such story should have summarized the key testimony presented at the trial, what particular questions the judge asked the jury to consider and what evidence or factors may have caused the jury to decide as they did. If Ms. Purdy was satisfied that the jury had reached the correct decision, would have expected that she would have focussed more on the verdict in the trial. [212] These stories did none of that. What these stories did was introduce details about two other cases involving Dr. Graham. The first four paragraphs of the story talk about Gloria Cooke. As Mr. Miller opined, the reporter and/or her editors felt this information was more important than the verdict. So instead of straightforward, contemporaneous and even-handed account of the jury’s verdict, less than half of these articles had to do with information presented at the trial. [213] The stories involving Gloria Cooke and Dana McLellan were legitimate stories but again, both experts agree that these stories should have been undertaken separate from story about the jury’s verdict. Moreover, Ms. Purdy included this information about Ms. Cooke and Ms. McLellan in both these articles without having ever spoken to either of them directly. She obtained her information from speaking to Ms. Cooke’s lawyer and reading dated newspaper article about Ms. McLellan. She did nothing to verify this information, she made no attempt to speak to Ms. Cooke or Ms. McLellan’s medical doctors or get their medical records. Most troublesome was that Ms. Purdy made no attempt to speak to Dr. Graham to get his comment on the verdict or on the allegations made by Ms. Cooke and Ms. McLellan. By focusing on the Cooke and McLellan cases so soon after the verdict, Ms. Purdy is drawing attention to them. By not properly reporting on the verdict, she leaves the impression that the jury got it wrong in both these articles. [214] Every one of the five articles after the verdict contains words whose defamatory meaning was that Dr. Graham negligently performed surgery on Lisa Baert thereby causing her certain injuries that included septic shock, amputation, cardiac arrest, severe brain damage, living in long-term care home and becoming quadriplegic. If Ms. Purdy honestly believed that the jury had made the right decision, then there would be no reason to keep repeating these words, phrases and paragraphs day after day in such way that they were defamatory. [215] The November 30, 2007 article is follow-up reporting. In this article, Ms. Purdy focuses on getting the Baerts’ reaction to the jury’s decision. But neither Ms. Purdy nor any other Star Phoenix reporter did follow-up story on Dr. Graham’s reaction to the jury’s verdict. In Mr. Miller’s view, writing this article increased the newspaper’s obligation to report on Dr. Graham’s reaction otherwise this could be considered an “implied taking of sides”. [216] Moreover, if this was just follow-up article about the Baerts’ reaction to the verdict then have to wonder why Ms. Purdy felt she had to repeat the Gloria Cooke information in the story. That information had nothing to do with the Baerts’ reaction to the verdict. It had everything to do with being critical of Dr. Graham and again suggesting that the jury got it wrong. [217] The December 1, 2007 article reinforces my conclusion that Ms. Purdy felt that the jury was wrong in their verdict. Both experts again admit that this article did not have to run immediately after the trial and that Ms. Purdy should have taken more time to investigate the allegations made by these five other people properly and to verify their information. She did not do that. She did not speak to any medical professionals to verify the information these people gave her. She did not ask for these people’s medical records or for permission to speak to their doctors. She received some documents from Ms. Hurlburt’s son that included letter from Dr. Graham explaining his treatment of Ms. Hurlburt and letter from the Saskatchewan College of Physicians and Surgeons advising that Dr. Graham was not negligent in his treatment of Ms. Hurlburt and the reasons why. Despite having this information, Ms. Purdy never included it in the report. Instead, she simply noted that the investigation found “no medical mismanagement” by Dr. Graham. [218] This particular article contains five people’s complaints about Dr. Graham’s treatment of them in addition to the information about what happened to Ms. Baert. Yet again, Ms. Purdy made absolutely no effort to elicit response or comment from Dr. Graham in relation to these complaints. Reading this series of articles culminating in this December article leads to no other conclusion than that the jury was wrong to find Dr. Graham not negligent in his surgical treatment of Ms. Baert. [219] Ms. Purdy described herself as diligent journalist. She acknowledged being familiar with the journalistic standards of care and specifically those standards referencing accuracy and fairness. Yet she wrote five articles, four of which contained single source, unverified information about complaints made against Dr. Graham by other people and not once did she ever try to contact Dr. Graham to get his side of the story. This is contrary to the concepts of accuracy and fairness which Ms. Purdy said that she was aware of. The very fact that she failed to give Dr. Graham an opportunity to defend himself against these defamatory allegations is, in and of itself, evidence of malice. In Leenen at para. 145, Cunningham J. said: [145] The failure of the defendant to provide the plaintiff with fair opportunity to defend himself against defamatory allegations is evidence of malice: Hodgson v. Canadian Newspaper Co., supra. As Holland J. stated in Munro v. Toronto Sun Publishing Corp. (1982), 1982 CanLII 1758 (ON SC), 39 O.R. (2d) 100 at p. 118, 21 C.C.L.T. 261 (H.C.J.): when the story is prepared and the paper has the ""goods"" on the person targeted in the story it is basic and necessary that that person be confronted with the story so that his reaction be obtained. [220] However, I am additionally led to the inescapable conclusion that Ms. Purdy did not believe that the jury had reached the proper verdict in the Baert case. Rather than properly reporting on the jury’s verdict, Ms. Purdy deliberately chose to report on other people who had made complaints about the surgical care Dr. Graham provided them. She did so without verifying this information or even seeking Dr. Graham’s comment. Given her lack of proper investigation or verification of these complaints, she could not have reasonably believed that these complaints were true. By writing the articles that she did in the time frame that she did and in the fashion that she did, she could only have had one purpose in mind and that was to tell readers that Dr. Graham was negligent in his surgical practice and that the jury’s verdict was wrong. I am satisfied that Ms. Purdy published the words complained of by Dr. Graham with reckless indifference as to their truth and as such, malice has been made out. [221] Where an employee is acting in the course of his or her employment, any malice motivating his or her behaviour will be attributed to his or her employer. See Sun Life Assurance Co. of Canada Dalrymple, 1965 CanLII (SCC), [1965] SCR 302. Ms. Purdy was an employee of the Star Phoenix overseen by Rod Nickel, Cameron Hutchinson, Steven Gibb and Dale Brin and as such, her malice is attributed to all of them. [222] In my view, given these findings, an award of $50,000 for aggravated damages is appropriate. (d) Is Dr. Graham entitled to an injunction requiring the defendants to remove certain content from websites under their control? [223] In Astley Verdun, 2011 ONSC 3651 (CanLII), Chapnik J. said: [20] It is well-settled law that, in appropriate circumstances, court may grant an injunction to prevent defendant from continuing to disseminate defamatory material that affects plaintiff's reputation: see, for example, Barrick Gold Corp. v. Lopehandia (2004), 2004 CanLII 12938 (ON CA), 71 O.R. (3d) 416, [2004] O.J. No. 2329 (C.A.), at paras. [21] Permanent injunctions have consistently been ordered after findings of defamation where either (1) there is likelihood that the defendant will continue to publish defamatory statements despite the finding that he is liable to the plaintiff for defamation; or (2) there is real possibility that the plaintiff will not receive any compensation, given that enforcement against the defendant of any damage award may not be possible: see Hunter Dickinson Inc. v. Butler, [2010] B.C.J. No. 1332, 2010 BCSC 939 (CanLII), at paras. 75-79; Griffin v. Sullivan, [2008] B.C.J. No. 1333, 2008 BCSC 827 (CanLII), at paras. 119-27; Newman v. Halstead, [2006] B.C.J. No. 59, 2006 BCSC 65 (CanLII) at paras. 297-301; Cragg v. Stephens, [2010] B.C.J. No. 1641, 2010 BCSC 1177 (CanLII), at paras. 34-35, 40. [224] In the present case almost years have gone by since the defamatory articles in question were published by the Star Phoenix. Dr. Graham is retired, Ms. Baert has, unfortunately, deceased, none of the individual defendants remain employed with the Star Phoenix and the newspaper has been purchased by Postmedia Network Inc. There is no evidence before me that would lead me to conclude that in light of my decision, the defendants will continue to publish defamatory statements about Dr. Graham. There is also no reason for me to believe that there is real possibility that Dr. Graham will not be able to collect his damage award from the defendants. Injunctive relief is an exceptional remedy that will not be imposed by the courts lightly. As such, am not convinced that it is appropriate to grant an injunction in these circumstances and Dr. Graham’s request in this regard is dismissed. [225] Postmedia Network Inc. will be added as defendant in this case. The defendants have jointly and severally defamed Dr. Graham in series of articles written by Chris Purdy and published in the Star Phoenix newspaper and on its websites between November 28, 2007 and December 1, 2007. Dr. Graham is awarded general damages in the amount of $50,000 and aggravated damages in the amount of $50,000 together with pre-judgment interest pursuant to s. 5(1) of The Pre-judgment Interest Act, SS 1984-85-86, c P-22.2, and costs taxed in the appropriate column. J. D.E. LABACH",d_2017skqb42.txt,"HELD: The action was allowed.
The defendants had defamed the plaintiff and he was entitled to damages in the amount of $100,000.
The court found the following with respect to each issue: 1) it would substitute Postmedia as a defendant pursuant to Queen’s Bench rule 3-84(2) as it was the successor to Canwest and was aware of the plaintiff’s claim when it purchased the Star Phoenix and it would not be prejudiced.
It would not deprive Postmedia of a defence under s. 5 of The Limitations Act because the articles remained on Postmedia’s websites and were republished whenever they were viewed or downloaded; 2) after reviewing each of the articles and assessing the words complained of, it found that the words constituted defamation; 3) all of the defendants were found to be joint tortfeasors with Purdy because they participated in the publication of a libel and were jointly and severally liable in defamation to the plaintiff; and 3) an appropriate award for general damages was $50,000.
The court allowed the claim for aggravated damages as the defendants were found to be motivated by actual or express malice because Purdy did not simply report the jury’s verdict in her articles but indicated that she believed that the jury had not reached the proper verdict in the trial.
She deliberately chose to report the stories of people who had made complaints about the surgical care provided to them by the plaintiff without verifying it or seeking comment from the plaintiff.
As she was acting in the course of her employment, Purdy’s malice was attributed to all the defendants.

No. 2364 PROVINCE OF NOVA SCOTIA IN THE SUPREME COURT OF NOVA SCOTIA TRIAL DIVISION BETWEEN: FARM CREDIT CORPORATION, body corporate and W. BRUCE GILLIS, Barrister and Solicitor nan HEARD BEFORE: The Honourable Mr. Justice K. P. Richard PLACE HEARD: Halifax, Nova Scotia DATES HEARD: December 4, 5, 1989 DECISION DATE: December 5, 1989 COUNSEL: Walter O. Newton, Q.C. and Steven Enman for the Plaintiff Harry E. Wrathall, Q.C. and Alex Cameron for the Defendant CANADA S.K. No. 2364 PROVINCE OF NOVA SCOTIA IN THE SUPREME COURT OF NOVA SCOTIA TRIAL BETWEEN: FARM CREDIT CORPORATION, body corporate and W. BRUCE GILLIS, Barrister and Solicitor Defendant Richard, J. (orally): This is an action by Farm Credit Corporation (FCC) against the defendant, W. Bruce Gillis, a barrister and solicitor practising in Middleton, Nova Scotia. Basically, it is a claim in professional negligence against Mr. Gillis for the losses sustained by FCC as a result of the alleged negligence of Gillis. The matter originated in the late fall of 1978 when the mortgagors, Paul and Eric Langille, farmers in the Middleton area, negotiated loan to be secured by mortgage on real estate known as the ""Phinney farm"". By letter of December 5, FCC confirmed that funds would be available to the Langilles. One of the conditions in paragraph of the letter states: ""That you are willing to supply the Corporation with valid milk assignment to repay your mortgage loan on monthly basis. The exact amount of the monthly payments shall be determined at the time the loan is disbursed and you shall be advised of the amount required."" In addition to that letter, there was also loan offer in which certain other stipulations were made respecting the security for the loan. One such condition was contained in clause D. ""SPECIAL INSTRUCTIONS"" ""Fluid milk quota clause required in the amount of 1237 litres/day."" By copy of the covering letter the Langille brothers purportedly accepted the terms and returned the letter dated December 12, 1978 which is stamped as received by FCC on December 18, 1978. Mr. Gillis had been engaged by the Langilles over the years as their solicitor and he continued his engagement with respect to this transaction. His letter of December 22, 1978 addressed to FCC indicates fairly complete understanding of the matter as well as his instructions to act for the Langilles on their behalf in this transaction. The matter then laid dormant until the 1st of April. On April 3, 1979 D.C. Rogers, Atlantic Assistant Regional Manager of FCC, wrote to their legal agent in the area, R. MacLeod Rogers, with instructions to disburse funds in accordance with the terms of the mortgage loan. In the instructions Mr. Rogers stated in part: ""Would you please carry out sub‑search on this account before releasing the cheque to the Langilles and the Bank. Also have the borrower sign the attached Dairy Order and have their signatures witnessed and return both copies to the Corporation,” Enclosed was the dairy order directed to Twin City Dairies with blank space to be signed by Paul and Eric Langille. Following the receipt of that by solicitor R. MacLeod Rogers he sent letter to Gillis, the defendant, in which he states in part: ""Please find enclosed herewith cheque from Farm Credit Corporation payable to the Imperial Bank of Commerce to pay out the Bank mortgage. Would you please disburse this cheque, after insuring on behalf of Farm Credit Corporation that the fire insurance is in order on the property. Would you also arrange with the Langilles to sign the enclosed Dairy Order in triplicate and return all copies to me, as soon as possible."" The evidence is clear that Mr. Gillis was persuaded by one or the other or both of the Langilles that stipulation No. in the letter of December was no longer in effect because of the new deal which had been worked out between the Langilles and FCC. There is no doubt in my mind that Gillis was lulled into false sense of security by these representations. He disbursed the funds without having first had the dairy order executed by the Langilles. It matters not what assurances the Langilles gave to Mr. Gillis. He had clear and explicit instructions from his principal, R. MacLeod Rogers, to have the dairy orders executed. have no problem finding that Mr. Gillis was negligent and in breach of the trust imposed upon him by R. MacLeod Rogers when he disbursed the funds without having first received the signed dairy orders. In response to Mr. R. MacLeod Rogers, Mr. Gillis wrote on May indicating certain questions with respect to insurance. There was no mention at that time of the dairy order or any agreement that the Langilles had indicated had been concluded between them and FCC. MacLeod Rogers on June 27 sent to FCC what purported to be his final report on this matter in which he enclosed number of documents. Conspicuous by its absence was the dairy order. There are handwritten notes by FCC people indicating that these had not been received and they were strong enough in their opinion that they were prepared to withhold legal fees until such time as the agreements were received. This was confirmed to R. MacLeod Rogers by letter from D.C. Rogers of July 4, 1979. Mr. Gillis on July 9th, presumably after meeting or conversation with R. MacLeod Rogers, indicated that the Langilles had advised him that the dairy orders were no longer required. Following this on July 17, 1979, Mr. R. G. Aumell, Atlantic Region Manager for FCC, wrote to the Langilles indicating the amount outstanding at the time and also requesting payment of the arrears and the signed dairy order. further letter was written to Mr. R. MacLeod Rogers in which it was still the FCC position that the dairy order was required as part of the security for this loan package. On August 14, 1979, Eric and Paul Langille wrote to Farm Credit Corporation protesting that they did not have to submit the dairy orders because of other arrangements which had been made. It is not clear what other arrangements had been made but he did indicate in this letter that the initial conditions outlined were changed somewhat. In direct response to this is the letter of August 28, 1979 from FCC to the Langille brothers and it starts: ""This will acknowledge your letter of August 14, 1979 regarding payment arrangements on your loan."" And then, down two paragraphs, is the following statement: ""Instead of monthly payments, as we had hoped for, we will now follow the payment arrangements as outlined in the loan offer you mentioned.""(emphasis added) The loan offer mentioned is obviously the semi‑annual payment schedule set out in the original loan offer which accompanied the letter of December 5th. The contents of the August 28, 1979 letter was confirmed to R. MacLeod Rogers by telephone conversation and subsequently by letter of September 6th in which Mr. D.C. Rogers stated in part: ""As mentioned to you on the phone, the Corporation does not intend to take this any further and have written the Langilles accordingly. We are disappointed that this error came about and we leave it up to you to advise Mr. Gillis as you see fit, in the hopes that this error will not be repeated in the future in connection with our accounts."" By letter of September 6, R. MacLeod Rogers wrote to the Farm Credit Corporation. On September 11th R. MacLeod Rogers wrote to Gillis, the defendant, which reads in part: ""I enclose copy of letter which have just received from Farm Credit in Moncton indicating that they are not going to proceed any further with respect to the breach of their and my instructions.” Presumably the letter that was sent along with that was the letter of September 6th. At this point new deal was made between the Farm Credit Corporation and the Langilles. The Farm Credit Corporation was no longer insisting on the execution of the dairy order. accept the argument of counsel for the defendant in that this forgiveness or alteration of the deal ended the matter insofar as Mr. Gillis was concerned. As a result, I am firmly of the view that the plaintiffs were then, and are now, estopped from exercising any of their rights against Gillis or R. MacLeod Rogers under the original instructions. Even if had found otherwise, it is clear from the correspondence that the damages at that time were slightly over $7,000.00. These arrears had been subsequently paid by the Langilles. There is no evidence that FCC suffered any losses during the time that the instructions respecting the dairy order were still subsisting. At the risk of being flip, must say that there are so many grounds upon which the plaintiff's action could be dismissed in this matter that am just choosing the most obvious one. am not dealing with the question of laches although there is merit in the argument of defendant's counsel on that point. To determine this case need not go beyond the doctrine of estoppel as annunciated by Lord Denning in Combe v. Combe, [1951] nan All E.R. 767. The following oft quoted passage from that case is particularly appropriate in the present circumstances: ""The principle, as understand it, is that where one party has, by his words or conduct, made to the other promise or assurance which was intended to affect the legal relations between them and to be acted on accordingly, then, once the other party has taken him at his word and acted on it, the one who gave the promise or assurance cannot afterwards be allowed to revert to the previous legal relations as if no such promise or assurance had been made by him, but he must accept their legal relations subject to the qualification which he himself has so introduced, even though it is not supported in point of law by any consideration, but only by his word. (p. 770)."" Even though Gillis in this case was not party he was the legal agent, through R. MacLeod Rogers, for this specific transaction. He must therefore be in the same position as the principal insofar as liability in this transaction. The doctrine of estoppel is doctrine of fairness. It would be patently unfair for FCC to lull Gillis into sense of security by renegotiating the deal with the Langilles and then, several years later, hold Gillis responsible under the original deal. Quite apart from the question of estoppel there are other circumstances which militate against FCC in this case. Between the time the mortgage deal was made in 1979 and the foreclosure action several things occurred. FCC renegotiated new security for the mortgage and gave up the original security. There is serious question that some of the surrendered security was of substantially greater value than that taken up. These actions were taken without any regard to the impact on the legal rights of Gillis. Then there is the matter of FCC making deal with the Langilles to settle the foreclosure action on terms which may have effected Gillis' position vis vis the mortgage security of FCC. The effect of these transactions on the bankruptcy proceedings against the Langilles could also bear on the question of prejudice to Gillis. These matters need not be dealt with since have decided the case in favour of Gillis on the basis of estoppel as already discussed. The plaintiff's action is dismissed with costs to the defendant to be taxed. Judament accordingly. J. Halifax, Nova Scotia December 5, 1989 1. INTRODUCTION 2. NATURE OF CLAIMS 4.

Carruthers for the Appellant William D. Delaney for the Respondent Appeal Heard: March 16, 1993 Judgment Delivered: March 16, 1993 THE COURT: Appeal allowed and sentence for perjury contrary to s. 131(1) of the Criminal Code varied to nine months imprisonment, per oral reasons for judgment of Clarke, C.J.N.S.; Matthews and Pugsley, JJ.A. concurring. The reasons for judgment of the Court were delivered orally by: CLARKE, C.J.N.S.: Leave is sought by the appellant and if granted to appeal from a sentence of two years imprisonment for perjury imposed by His Honour Judge Archibald of the Provincial Court on October 8, 1992. The appellant was charged that he committed perjury at the preliminary hearing of Michael Merlin Fillmore by giving false testimony with intent to mislead the court contrary to section 131(1) of the Criminal Code. He pled guilty to the charge. Mr. Fillmore was co‑accused in break, enter and theft in which the appellant was also involved. The break occurred at garage at which the appellant had been employed. The theft included cigarettes, chips and money. It appears from the record that the false evidence given by the appellant was undoubtedly factor that led to Fillmore's acquittal. The appellant contends the sentence of two years was excessive and too harsh. The Crown agrees and says in its factum that the sentence imposed was manifestly excessive"". It is argued on behalf of the appellant, who is twenty‑five years old, that he felt intimidated, that the perjured evidence was not given for his own benefit and that he had no criminal record other than his own conviction for the break, enter and theft out of which this proceeding is part. These factors, notwithstanding, the trial judge in considered reasons stated the very serious nature of this offence. We agree with his observations that perjured evidence undermines the effective administration of justice and simply cannot be tolerated. People must know that the oath or affirmation to tell the truth in judicial proceeding is solemn commitment to honesty. Parliament has spoken clearly on the seriousness of this matter by providing maximum sentence of fourteen years imprisonment. The opinion of this court was stated in R. v. Crawford (1988), 81 N.S.R. (2d) 88 at page 89, as follows: ""The integrity of our system depends upon the honesty of those who are involved in it and the truthfulness of those who testify in its proceedings. Not only the appellant but the general public must be deterred from committing the offence of perjury."" While we find that the trial judge committed no error in principle, we have concluded after reviewing the sentences imposed by this court and others that the upper end of the range of sentences for this offence does not appear to have reached two years. The aggravating factors here, while serious, appear to fall within a lower classification of time to be served. For this reason our review of the fitness of the sentence imposed upon the appellant persuades us that leave to appeal ought to be granted and the appeal should be allowed. Accordingly we vary the sentence imposed upon the appellant to nine months. Concurred: Matthews, J.A. Pugsley, J.A.

Nova Scotia (Workers’ Compensation Appeals Tribunal), 2009 NSCA 123 Date: 20091204 Docket: CA 309638 Registry: Halifax Between: The Workers’ Compensation Board of Nova Scotia Workers’ Compensation Appeals Tribunal, Attorney General of Nova Scotia and Martin Kaye Respondents Judges: Oland, Hamilton, Fichaud, JJ.A. Appeal Heard: November 25, 2009, in Halifax, Nova Scotia Held: Appeal is dismissed per reasons for judgment of Oland, J.A.; Hamilton and Fichaud, JJ.A. concurring. Counsel: Roderick H. Rogers and Paula Arab, for the appellant Workers’ Compensation Board of Nova Scotia Alexander MacIntosh, for the respondent Workers’ Compensation Appeals Tribunal Jane A. Spurr and D. William MacDonald, for the respondent Martin Kaye Reasons for judgment: [1] On June 19, 1990, while at work, the worker injured his lower back. On February 26, 2008 Board Adjudicator determined that he had chronic pain related to that injury. The worker was awarded three percent pain-related impairment, effective November 26, 1992. [2] In determining that effective date, the Board Adjudicator relied upon s. 228 of the Workers’ Compensation Act, S.N.S. 1994-95, c. 10 (the “Act”) which reads in part: 228 (1) Subject to subsection (2), where worker (a) was injured on or after March 23, 1990, and before the date this Part comes into force; (b) suffered permanent impairment as result of the injury; and (c) at the date this Part comes into force, is receiving or is entitled to receive compensation for permanent partial disability or permanent total disability as result of the injury, the compensation awarded between March 23, 1990, and the date this Part comes into force is deemed to be and always to have been awarded in accordance with the former Act. (2) The Board shall recalculate the amount of compensation payable to the worker in accordance with Sections 34 to 58. (3) Where recalculation made pursuant to subsection (2) entitles the worker to greater award than the award the worker was receiving when this Part comes into force, the Board shall commence payment of the recalculated amount of compensation as of the latest of (a) the date on which the Board determines the worker has permanent impairment, whether pursuant to Section 34 or the former Act; (b) the date on which the worker completes rehabilitation program pursuant to Sections 112 and 113, where the worker is engaged in rehabilitation program on or after the date the Board determines the worker has permanent impairment pursuant to Section 34; or (c) November 26, 1992. (5) For greater certainty, nothing in this Section entitles any person to compensation for period prior to November 26, 1992. [Emphasis added.] [3] The worker’s appeal of the Board Adjudicator’s decision to Hearing Officer was denied. The worker then appealed to the Workers’ Compensation Appeals Tribunal (“WCAT”). [4] In decision dated March 9, 2009 and reported as WCAT #2008-424-AD, WCAT increased the pain-related impairment to six percent. It also determined that s. 228 did not restrict the worker’s entitlement to chronic pain benefits to an effective date of November 26, 1992, and found that the evidence warranted an effective date of October 1, 1990. The Workers’ Compensation Board (the “Board”) appeals. [5] The issue on appeal is narrow: does s. 228 of the Act limit the retroactive payment of chronic pain benefits stemming from injury between March 23, 1990 and February 1, 1996 to November 26, 1992? [6] The issue on appeal involves question of law and the interpretation of statutory provision with no specialized technical meaning, for which the standard of review is correctness. [7] In its decision, WCAT summarized the history of the jurisprudence and legislation which gave rise to the transitional provisions in the Act. These include s. 228 which pertains to injuries which occurred in the so-called window period between March 23, 1990, when this court’s decision in Hayden v. Workers’ Compensation Appeal Board (N.S.) (1990), 1990 CanLII 2423 (NS CA), 96, N.S.R. (2d) 108 was released, and February 1, 1996, when the current Act came into force. Payment of any permanent compensation was suspended after the decision until the Board started compensating workers through an interim loss policy effective November 26, 1992 which was later amended. The policy was temporary with compensation to be recalculated when the final earnings loss policies were adopted. [8] The Chronic Pain Regulations did not come into effect until 2004. Section pertains to chronic pain for injuries during the window period: Original compensable injury on or after March 23, 1990 nan If worker’s original compensable injury occurred on or after March 23, 1990, and the worker is found to have pain-related impairment, (a) the worker’s permanent benefit will be calculated in accordance with Sections 34 to 48 of the Act; and (b) the worker may be eligible to receive an extended earnings-replacement benefit. [9] After reviewing these provisions and submissions on behalf of the worker and the Board, WCAT concluded: agree with the Worker’s Advisor that his benefits should be determined by the Chronic Pain Regulations, and that s. 228 has no bearing on his entitlement to chronic pain compensation. There is no issue of recalculation here, which is the stated purpose of this section. The November 26, 1992 date, chosen by the Board as the effective date of the Worker’s pain-related impairment, is one choices (sic) under that section for when the recalculated award is to take effect. As there is no recalculation in this case, s. 228 does not apply. [10] Having carefully considered the written and oral submissions presented by counsel for the Board and the worker, am of the view that WCAT’s reasoning and determination satisfy the standard of review of correctness. [11] Section 228 as worded sets out recalculation mechanism for addressing how and when payments to workers injured within the window period would be calculated under the new Act. Counsel for the Board acknowledges that in order for its appeal to succeed, it must show that entitlement to chronic pain benefits involves recalculation within the meaning of s. 228. am not persuaded that it does. When the new Act came into effect in February 1996, chronic pain was not compensable. There was no entitlement whatsoever for benefits for chronic pain prior to the Chronic Pain Regulations in 2004. Hence, there could be no benefit which would be recalculated. Section 228 has no application to payment of chronic pain benefits for injuries during the window period. Nor is entitlement under s. 9 of the Chronic Pain Regulations restricted to an effective date of November 26, 1992. There is no authority which prevents the payment of benefits for chronic pain for period prior to that date. [12] I would dismiss the appeal. Oland, J.A. Concurring: Hamilton, J.A.

(Canada) Ltd. Selves For the Plaintiffs Real Faucher For the Defendant JUDGMENT R.D. JACKSON, BACKGROUND [1] The Plaintiffs claim $6,700.77 against the Defendant for water damage sustained to their belongings while in transit from Edmonton to Nipawin, Saskatchewan in a one ton, 17 foot cube van owned by the Defendant. [2] The Defendant denies responsibility relying upon term of the rental contract which stated “... understand that the equipment rented is water resistant and not water proof”, as well as posted disclaimers to this effect situated in several locations inside the truck box. [3] The Defendant states further that even if the goods were transported in heavy rain conditions as the evidence disclosed, the Plaintiffs are nonetheless the authors of their own misfortune by permitting the loaded truck to sit for an additional two days after reaching their destination in steady rain prior to its unloading. The Defendant also questions the quantum of damages sustained and puts mitigation of damages in issue. II ISSUES [4] The following issues arise for determination: a) Whether the Plaintiffs are precluded from recovery against the Defendant by virtue of the contractual term acknowledging the equipment to be water resistant only as well as the posted disclaimers to this effect. b) Apportionment of damages. c) Quantum of damages and mitigation. III ANALYSIS a) Whether the Plaintiffs are precluded from recovery against the Defendant by virtue of the contractual term acknowledging the equipment to be water resistant only as well as the posted disclaimers to this effect. [5] The Plaintiff, Glenn Franklin, testified that he had originally booked 26 foot, ton truck to move his belongings from his acreage near Edmonton to Nipawin, Saskatchewan. Upon the designated pick up date however, he was informed that this truck was not available and that arrangements were being made for him to take the subject one ton, 17 foot cube van instead. This was on Sunday morning and the Haul depot in Edmonton was extremely busy when he arrived necessitating wait in excess of one hour before being attended to. He signed the contract and the truck was delivered to him outside, the exchange taking only moments. No features were shown or explained to him and he simply drove off the lot, no doubt in rush because he was now several hours behind schedule. [6] term of the agreement that he entered into stated “I understand that the equipment rented is water resistant and not waterproof” and the final term read “I acknowledge that have received and agreed to the terms and conditions of this rental contract and the rental contract addendum”. [7] The Plaintiffs together with relatives and friends then loaded this vehicle together with an assortment of other private vehicles and trailers and set out for Nipawin, Saskatchewan where the Plaintiffs were relocating to. Approximately one hour out of Edmonton extremely heavy rain began falling which continued for the entire balance of the trip. Upon arriving in Nipawin some seven hours later, the Plaintiffs parked the Haul truck on flat level surface where it remained for the next two days before being unloaded on the possession date of their new home. Throughout this period it continued to rain heavily. Upon opening the Haul truck, it became apparent that several items at or near the rear door were water damaged. Subsequent investigation determined that the packing blankets utilised to wrap the furniture had become soaked which in turn then caused moisture to seep into the goods. [8] The Plaintiffs took the truck to the local Haul agent in Nipawin, Glenn Verklan, for inspection. Mr. Verklan utilised pressure washer on the back door to test the seams. His report, which was admitted into evidence by consent of the Defendant and marked P-3, is hereafter reproduced: ckd Rear Door for water leak Pressure washer. first sprayed the Top of Door, opend ck’d for signs of leak none. then sprayed sides of door from top to approx. ft. from bottom no leaks. then sprayed bottom of door ck’d for sign of leaks. Water was entering van body each corner of door along bottom. The door was not set flat corners. cleaned out corners set door, was better but did not seal tight. [sic] “Glenn Verklan” Glenn Verklan 10.01.07. [9] Notwithstanding that the Plaintiff, Glenn Franklin, signed the rental contract acknowledging that the equipment was not waterproof and only water resistant, it appears from the last three sentences of Mr. Verklan’s report that water was entering at the corners of the door by virtue of the door not sitting “flat at the corners”. Further, that this appeared remedial to some extent through cleaning. [10] The Court infers from Mr. Verklan’s report that the apparent defect in the inability of the door to sit flat would have permitted excess water to enter prior to being cleaned by Mr. Verklan. Perfection however could not be expected since it was acknowledged that the rental unit was not waterproof and therefore, some seepage may be expected even after the door had been cleaned and remedied. Nonetheless, this existing sealing problem would have taken it beyond the acknowledgment of the unit being only water resistant. This may well have applied to the door seal once cleaned and remedied by Mr. Verklan, but not before. [11] The same rationale applies with respect to the disclaimers posted inside the vehicle. The Court adds, however, that if the Defendant had been relying solely upon the disclaimers i.e. that this wording had not formed part of the contract, the Defendant would not have been able to rely upon them in any event since they were not brought to the attention of the Plaintiffs prior to executing the contract.[1] b) Apportionment of damages. [12] The Plaintiffs acknowledge that the U Haul truck remained parked outside in heavy rainfall for two days and nights prior to being unloaded. This undoubtedly exacerbated the scope of the damage claimed since the water would have continued to seep in unabated for roughly six times as long as the trip itself took. Glenn Franklin acknowledged that he would have seen the decals inside the truck when he loaded it indicating that the unit was not waterproof and therefore he would have had knowledge that this may have been potential problem in leaving it sit for two extra days. Although he may have had little choice due to the inclement weather and the possession date for his property being two days hence, this nonetheless cannot be visited upon the Defendant in terms of assessing the totality of the damages suffered. Although hardly scientific, the Court concludes that in all the circumstances the Defendant to be only 20 responsible for the damages sustained to the Plaintiffs’ possessions. c) Quantum of damages and mitigation. [13] The Plaintiffs identified four specific items to be water damaged: a) Mattress and box spring Glenn Franklin testified that the damage sustained by the mattress and box spring was purely cosmetic with no discernible functional damage whatsoever. Photographs were tendered evidencing faint stain on the mattress, approximately two-thirds along one side together with four rust spots on the box spring. The Plaintiffs attempted to clean the damaged areas with moderate success. No attempt was made to have the items professionally cleaned. In the circumstances the Court assesses damages at $200.00. b) Kitchen/dining room table Photographs indicated that the laminate on the table was raised and swollen to the extent that the table could not close. This item was purchased in August, 2006, as part of five piece dinette suite for the sum of $899.97. The Court assesses damages of $150.00. c) Foosball Table The damage to this item again is with respect to laminate lifting on top and swollen wood on the ends, making the table virtually inoperable since the players are unable to have sufficient clearance to turn at the damaged end. The Plaintiffs produced an invoice of April 1, 2004 indicating that they had purchased the item used for the sum of $2,436.45. The Court estimates the current value of this table, prior to damage, to be $800.00. d) Dresser and mirror According to the photographs tendered and the evidence of the Plaintiff, Glenn Franklin, no damage was sustained to the dresser itself. The mirror, however, is mildewed and swollen to twice its size and the finish ruined. These items were acquired in the early 1990's with the mirror costing $249.00. The Court assesses its current value prior to damage to be $100.00. IV CONCLUSION [14] The Plaintiffs have proven damages totalling $1,250.00. The Court has determined the Defendant, for the reasons stated, to be responsible for 20% of these damages, totalling $1,250.00 x 20% = $250.00. [15] The Plaintiff shall have judgment against the Defendant in the amount of $250.00, plus costs of issuing the claim and service, if any. R.D. Jackson, J. [1] Aurora TV Radio Ltd. v.

P. 610",e_2009skpc9.txt,"The plaintiff claims against the defendant for water damage sustained to their belongings while in transit from Edmonton to Nipawin in a one ton, 17 foot cube van owned by the defendants.
The issues are whether the plaintiffs are precluded from recovery against the defendant by virtue of the contractual term acknowledging the equipment to be water resistant only as well as the posted disclaimers to this effect.
HELD: The plaintiff shall have judgment for $250 plus costs of issuing the claim and service.
1) Notwithstanding that the plaintiff signed the rental contract acknowledging that the equipment was not waterproof and only water resistant, it appears from the last three sentences of the inspection report that water was entering at the corners of the door by virtue of the door not sitting flat at the corners.
This defect would have permitted excess water to enter prior to being cleaned.
Perfection could not be expected since it was acknowledged that the rental unit was not waterproof and some seepage may be expected even after the door had been fixed.
Nonetheless, the sealing problem would have taken it beyond the acknowledgment of the unit being only water resistant.
2) The plaintiff acknowledges that the truck remained parked outside in heavy rainfall for two days and nights prior to being unloaded.
This exacerbated the scope of the damage claimed since the water would have continued to seep in unabated for roughly six times as long as the trip itself took.
The Court concludes that the defendant is only 20% responsible for the damages sustained to the plaintiff's possessions."

THE ACCUSED 5. pre-sentence report was prepared by the probation officer and it provided pertinent background information in respect of Mr. Michelin.
Mr. Michelin indicates that his back problem and his previous criminal record prevent him from gaining employment.
The probation officer conducted two risk assessments in preparing the pre-sentence report.

The court noted the offence was not committed against child and the accused was not in position of trust in relation to the complainant.
The criminal record of the accused was dated, but included over 40 break and enter and theft convictions for which he was sentenced to significant period of incarceration in 1994.
The Court of Appeal held that “the appropriate range for offences of this nature is conditional sentence ranging between three and twelve months” (ibid at para.
The accused grabbed the complainant’s hair to force her head around in an attempt to kiss her.
The respondent used physical force which distinguishes this case from the cases of fleeting touching.
... 12 However, we agree with the trial judge this was case of sexual assault on the lower end of the scale.
Although there was claim of bruising, the testimony of the investigating officer said it was slight and there was more of ""redness.""
This is not to minimize the effect on the complainant who filed victim impact statement stating she was required to take time off work and was afraid of noises or movement when sleeping as such would scare her out of her sleep.
She said she found it extremely hard to leave the house on her own and she feared people around her, all as result of the assault.
R. 51 where the accused, with prior record including two assault convictions, fondled and digitally penetrated the victim and refused to stop until the victim pretended to cooperate was sentenced to 20 months incarceration which sentence took into account the accused having served part of the conditional sentence imposed by the lower court.

The violence used against the complainant was minimal, resulting in “redness” instead of bruising.
R. 90, the accused was found guilty of sexually assaulting his 12 year old adopted daughter.
On third occasion, the accused touched the complainant’s vagina while they were showering together.

BETWEEN: HER MAJESTY THE QUEEN and OAKLEY ARNOLD MICHELIN Counsel: Erin L. Schrol and Maura Landry for the Crown Carson D. Demmans for the accused JUDGMENT DAWSON J. November 21, 2013 1. Oakley Michelin has been found guilty, after trial, of two counts of sexual assault contrary to s. 271 of the Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1985, c. C-46. CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE OFFENCES 2. These two offences occurred on February 25, 2011. There were two victims, J.M. and D.H. 3. Mr. Michelin and one of the victims, J.M., knew each other prior to the commission of the offence. 4. On February 25, 2011, J.M. called Mr. Michelin to ask him for cigarettes. J.M. and her friend, D.H., walked over to Mr. Michelin’s home to borrow some cigarettes from Mr. Michelin. When the two women arrived at Mr. Michelin’s home, they found that Mr. Michelin had been drinking. They thought he was drunk. The two woman stayed at Mr. Michelin’s home between ten and thirty minutes. While the women were there, Mr. Michelin touched J.M.’s breasts and vaginal area, over her clothing. Mr. Michelin also touched D.H.’s breasts and vaginal area, over her clothing. The touching was brief in both cases; matter of few seconds but no longer than minute according to D.H. Mr. Michelin asked both women to have sex with him. Both women told Mr. Michelin to stop the touching. The women left Mr. Michelin’s home shortly after the incident. THE ACCUSED 5. pre-sentence report was prepared by the probation officer and it provided pertinent background information in respect of Mr. Michelin. 6. Mr. Michelin is 61 years of age. He was born in Labrador and lived there until 1980 when he moved to Regina. Mr. Michelin is divorced and lives alone. He has no children. 7. Mr. Michelin indicates he only has one friend in Regina, but he does not see his friend very often. Mr. Michelin currently has 12 cats that keep him company. Mr. Michelin is on social assistance. He indicates he does not have any drinking or alcohol problems. 8. Mr. Michelin’s last employment was in 1992. He has been on social assistance since 1992. He indicates he has back problem. Mr. Michelin indicates that his back problem and his previous criminal record prevent him from gaining employment. 9. Mr. Michelin has previous criminal record. In 1992 he was convicted of sexual interference, contrary to s. 151 of the Criminal Code and sentenced to nine months incarceration, followed by one year probation. In 1999 he was convicted of sexual interference contrary to s. 151 of the Criminal Code, and sentenced to two years less one day incarceration followed by two years probation. Both victims of his previous sexual offences were children. 10. In addition, in 2002, Mr. Michelin was convicted of fail to comply with probation order and received $100.00 fine. In 2004, he was convicted of four charges of fail to comply with recognizance. These four charges relate to single incident where he attended the Calgary Zoo with friends and the friends’ children. Mr. Michelin was sentenced to 40 days incarceration, concurrent on each charge. 11. The probation officer conducted two risk assessments in preparing the pre-sentence report. The probation officer used the Saskatchewan Primary Risk Assessment, which is risk assessment for general criminal recidivism, to assess Mr. Michelin’s risk to re-offend generally. Using this tool, Mr. Michelin was assessed at medium risk for generalized re-offending. This tool is limited in its assistance in respect of sexual offenders, as it is generally recognized that measures used to predict general recidivism are not very effective in predicting sexual recidivism. 12. The Static-99 Risk Assessment was also employed by the probation officer. This is tool used to predict sexual recidivism. Mr. Michelin scored “one” on the Static-99 R, which places him in the low risk category for being charged or convicted of another sexual offence. CROWN AND DEFENCE POSITION ON SENTENCE 13. The Crown submits that sentence of two years incarceration, followed by three years probation would be an appropriate sentence in the circumstances for Mr. Michelin. The Crown filed the case of R. v. Bird, 2008 SKCA 65 (CanLII), 310 Sask.R. 222 in support their position on sentence. 14. Crown counsel, in sentencing submissions, suggested that Mr. Michelin’s criminal record establishes pattern of sexual assaults. Ms. Landry also suggested that an aggravating factor here is the fact that one of the victims, J.M., has severe cognitive impairment. Ms. Landry also suggested that Mr. Michelin’s previous relationship with J.M. established pattern of grooming. 15. Defence counsel acknowledged Mr. Michelin’s criminal record, but suggested that it does not establish pattern of behaviour, as there has been 14 years since Mr. Michelin’s last conviction for sexual interference. Defence counsel suggested that the court should impose sentence of probation. Defence counsel filed the following cases in support of that position: R. v. Ashby, 2011 SKQB 369 (CanLII), 384 Sask.R. 81; R. v. Epp, 2005 SKPC 71 (CanLII), 267 Sask.R. 191; R. v. Hayko, 1998 SKCA (Sent. Dig.) 58; R. v. Iron, 2005 SKCA 84 (CanLII), 269 Sask. R. 51. THE LEGISLATION 16. Section 718 of the Criminal Code sets out the purpose and principles of sentencing as follows: 718. The fundamental purpose of sentencing is to contribute, along with crime prevention initiatives, to respect for the law and the maintenance of just, peaceful and safe society by imposing just sanctions that have one or more of the following objectives: (a) to denounce unlawful conduct; (b) to deter the offender and other persons from committing offences; (c) to separate offenders from society, where necessary; (d) to assist in rehabilitating offenders; (e) to provide reparations for harm done to victims or to the community; and (f) to promote sense of responsibility in offenders, and acknowledgment of the harm done to victims and to the community. 17. As well, s. 718.1 and 718.2 are relevant to sentencing: 718.1 sentence must be proportionate to the gravity of the offence and the degree of responsibility of the offender. 718.2 court that imposes sentence shall also take into consideration the following principles: (a) sentence should be increased or reduced to account for any relevant aggravating or mitigating circumstances relating to the offence or the offender, and, without limiting the generality of the foregoing, ... (ii) evidence that the offender, in committing the offence, abused the offender’s spouse or common-law partner, ... (b) sentence should be similar to sentences imposed on similar offenders for similar offences committed in similar circumstances; ... (d) an offender should not be deprived of liberty, if less restrictive sanctions may be appropriate in the circumstances; and (e) all available sanctions other than imprisonment that are reasonable in the circumstances should be considered for all offenders, with particular attention to the circumstances of aboriginal offenders. 1. Is Mr. Michelin eligible for conditional sentence order? 18. The relevant provisions of the Criminal Code in force at the time of these offences do not allow a conditional sentence. The offence took place on February 25, 2011. The relevant provisions of the Criminal Code in force at that time (for the period between December 15, 2010 and April 14, 2011) read as follows: Imposing of conditional sentence 742.1 If person is convicted of an offence, other than serious personal injury offence as defined in section 752, terrorism offence or criminal organization offence prosecuted by way of indictment for which the maximum term of imprisonment is ten years or more or an offence punishable by minimum term of imprisonment, and the court imposes sentence of imprisonment of less than two years and is satisfied that the service of the sentence in the community would not endanger the safety of the community and would be consistent with the fundamental purpose and principles of sentencing set out in sections 718 to 718.2, the court may, for the purpose of supervising the offender's behaviour in the community, order that the offender serve the sentence in the community, subject to the offender's compliance with the conditions imposed under section 742.3. 19. Section 752 provided this definition of ""serious personal injury offence"": 752. In this Part, nan ""serious personal injury offence"" means ... (b) an offence or attempt to commit an offence mentioned in section 271 (sexual assault), 272 (sexual assault with weapon, threats to third party or causing bodily harm) or 273 (aggravated sexual assault). 20. Section 271, at the time of these offences, provided: 271. (1) Every one who commits sexual assault is guilty of (a) an indictable offence and is liable to imprisonment for term not exceeding ten years; ... 21. As stated, at the time that Mr. Michelin committed these offences, s. 742.1 of the Criminal Code precluded the use of a conditional sentence order for a “serious personal injury offence” which carried a maximum penalty of 10 years, when that offence was prosecuted by indictment. Sexual assault was defined as “serious personal injury offence” in s. 752. The offence of sexual assault under s. 271 carries maximum penalty of 10 years. Mr. Michelin was prosecuted by indictment here. conditional sentence order is not available in this case. (Also see R. v. Tuffs, 2011 SKQB 441 (CanLII), 381 Sask. R. 151, at para. 6, [varied 2012 SKCA (CanLII), 385 Sask. R. 178]). 2. What is the appropriate range of sentence? 22. The Crown and defence both filed cases setting out various sentences. In addition to these cases have considered other sentencing decisions to determine the range of sentence for sexual assaults similar to the facts in this case. 23. The Saskatchewan Court of Appeal in R. v. Revet, 2010 SKCA 71 (CanLII), 350 Sask. R. 292, said the following about sentencing in relation to major sexual assault: [24] This Court has repeatedly held that in major sexual assaults involving adult offenders and victims, three years would be considered starting point from which sentencing judge should start, increasing or decreasing the term according the aggravating and mitigating factors: R. v. A.W.C.,2007 SKCA 87 (CanLII), 304 Sask. R. 224, and the cases cited therein. [25] In this case, useful comparison may be made with sentences for sexual assaults upon women who were incapable of giving consent at the time of assault due to being under the influence of alcohol, drugs or sleep, or combinations thereof. These have been treated by this Court as sexual assaults drawing the same starting point sentences as those in all other major sexual assaults: R. v. A.W.C. [26] There is no reason why the same starting point should not be used in case such as this. Sexual assaults upon children are at least as high in terms of gravity, if not higher, than sexual assaults upon adult persons. 24. Other cases also provide guidance. In R. v. Hayko, supra, (a somewhat dated case) the accused was 26 year old single male suffering from epilepsy. He had Grade to education level and drinking problem. He was employed at low level position in his father’s company. During the course of his employment, the accused sexually assaulted and harassed four female employees over period of two years. This involved touching the complainants’ breasts and buttocks, kissing them, and brushing against their bodies. The accused used his status as the boss’ son to intimidate the complainants. The accused did not appear to have prior record. The accused entered guilty plea at the preliminary hearing. The original sentence of $2,000.00 fine and 18 months probation was upheld on his appeal, with the Court of Appeal noting that “certain leniency” had already been granted to the accused. 25. In R. v. Iron, supra, the complainant was hosting joint stag/stagette party for the accused and his fiancé. The accused had 20 drinks over the course of the evening. The complainant awoke to find the accused on top of her. The accused kissed the complainant. He fondled her breasts and digitally penetrated her vagina. The accused had two prior convictions for assault, and persistent problem with alcohol. The trial judge imposed conditional sentence of two years less day. The Court of Appeal set aside the sentence and imposed 20 month sentence of imprisonment. Aggravating factors included lack of remorse, sleeping complainant, and small degree of violence. 26. In R. L.T.W., 2006 SKQB (CanLII), 280 Sask. R. 254, the 13 year old complainant and her sister were approached by the accused in his store. The accused told the complainant’s sister to leave the premises. The accused grabbed the complainant’s breasts from behind and squeezed them. He asked her if she would “like to go downstairs to make some money.” The Queen’s Bench Justice overturned the initial three month custodial sentence and imposed three month conditional sentence. 27. In R. v. Bird, supra, the Crown appealed sentence of 12 months imprisonment and two years probation. The 14 year old complainant was babysitting at the accused’s home at the time of the offence. She was sleeping with the infant in the room and woke to find that the accused had removed her clothing. He fondled and kissed her breasts, stomach, and neck for 30 minutes. He threatened to kill her if she told anyone what had happened. The accused had 16 prior convictions, including convictions for sexual assault and indecent assault. The Court of Appeal held that the crime was serious with many aggravating factors. The Court of Appeal commented that sexual assault on minor will be treated with the utmost seriousness and must be subject to substantial periods of imprisonment, even where the accused is without criminal record. sentence of 30 months imprisonment was imposed. 28. R. v. Clark, 2008 SKQB 443 (CanLII), 326 Sask. R. 294 concerned an appeal from summary conviction. The accused was convicted on number of offences, including three convictions for sexually assaulting 14 year old children. global sentence of two years less day served in the community was imposed. The sentence was upheld on appeal from the Crown. The assaults did not involve penetration, but the accused was in position of trust. 29. R. v. Chrispen, 2009 SKCA 63 (CanLII), 331 Sask. R. 212, is instructive for cases involving brief sexual contact over clothing. The accused was initially sentenced to nine months incarceration. The accused’s appeal against sentence was allowed, with the Court of Appeal imposing nine month conditional sentence. 30. In Chrispen, the 18 year old complainant had advertised her vehicle for sale. The accused contacted her and arranged test drive. During the test drive, the accused braked suddenly on two occasions, putting his arm across the front of the complainant’s body, ostensibly in an effort to protect her. On both occasions, his arm touched the complainant’s upper chest. When the test drive was finished, the complainant sat in the drivers seat. The accused told the complainant that he had forgotten his phone in the vehicle. The accused reached across the complainant to retrieve the phone. In doing so the accused squeezed both of the complainant’s breasts over her T-shirt. The Court of Appeal noted that the offence was “at the lower end of the spectrum with respect to sexual offences that involve inappropriate touching. There was no violence and the touching was brief and took place over clothing” (ibid at para. 26). The court noted the offence was not committed against child and the accused was not in position of trust in relation to the complainant. The offence was singular incident, and the parties had no previous relationship. There was no historical or ongoing abuse. The criminal record of the accused was dated, but included over 40 break and enter and theft convictions for which he was sentenced to significant period of incarceration in 1994. He had no prior record for sexual offences. The court found that this was single incident of sexual touching that occurred over few seconds. The accused was assessed as low risk to re-offend. The Court of Appeal held that “the appropriate range for offences of this nature is conditional sentence ranging between three and twelve months” (ibid at para. 42). 31. In R. v. Tuffs, 2012 SKCA (CanLII), 385 Sask. R. 178, the Saskatchewan Court of Appeal spoke of the difference between sentence involving fleeting touching and one involving the use of physical force. In Tuffs, the complainant was an off-duty R.C.M.P. officer and the accused was local businessmen. Both attended house party. The complainant was sleeping in the basement when the accused moved onto the bed behind her, placed his hands down her pants, and touched her vagina. The accused grabbed the complainant’s hair to force her head around in an attempt to kiss her. There was no penetration. The incident took between thirty seconds to few minutes. The trial judge ordered suspended sentence and 18 months probation. The Court of Appeal varied the sentence, with Lane J.A. noting: 10 We are all of the view that sexual assaults of this nature should draw period of incarceration and, therefore, the sentence imposed was demonstrably unfit. The respondent used physical force which distinguishes this case from the cases of fleeting touching. (See, for example, R. v. Chrispen, 2009 SKCA 63 (CanLII), 331 Sask. R. 212 where conditional sentence was imposed.) ... 12 However, we agree with the trial judge this was case of sexual assault on the lower end of the scale. Although there was claim of bruising, the testimony of the investigating officer said it was slight and there was more of ""redness."" The duration of the incident was very brief, perhaps as little as 30 seconds and, after the complainant pushed off the respondent and told him to go upstairs, he said he was sorry and left. This is not to minimize the effect on the complainant who filed victim impact statement stating she was required to take time off work and was afraid of noises or movement when sleeping as such would scare her out of her sleep. She said she was forced to see psychologist and hated being left alone in the house. She said she found it extremely hard to leave the house on her own and she feared people around her, all as result of the assault. 13 We are satisfied in the circumstances of this case and, in particular, the limited force, the short duration, the lack of penetration and the immediate reaction of the respondent that he had gone too far, sentence of one year incarceration satisfies the sentencing principles and, in particular, does not offend the principle of parity. See, for example, R. v. Iron, 2005 SKCA 84 (CanLII), 269 Sask. R. 51 where the accused, with prior record including two assault convictions, fondled and digitally penetrated the victim and refused to stop until the victim pretended to cooperate was sentenced to 20 months incarceration which sentence took into account the accused having served part of the conditional sentence imposed by the lower court. The Court of Appeal in Tuffs noted the assault was still on the lower end of the spectrum, and was of short duration. The violence used against the complainant was minimal, resulting in “redness” instead of bruising. The Court of Appeal imposed sentence of one year incarceration. 32. In R. v. S.G.T., 2011 SKCA (CanLII), 366 Sask. R. 90, the accused was found guilty of sexually assaulting his 12 year old adopted daughter. The complainant awoke on two occasions to find the accused touching her vagina. On third occasion, the accused touched the complainant’s vagina while they were showering together. The trial judge’s sentence of 18 months imprisonment was upheld by the Court of Appeal. 33. In R. v. Ashby, supra, the accused appealed from conviction and sentence for charge of sexual assault. The sexual assault involved the touching of the complainant’s thigh. This was accompanied by suggestive comments that sex could be exchanged in lieu of payment for damage to the building in which the complainant had lived. Justice Schwann upheld the initial sentence of fine of $1,000.00 and nine month probation order. 34. R. T.T.L., 2012 SKPC 143 (CanLII), 407 Sask. R. 12 involved 29 year old accused who pled guilty to sexually assaulting 10 year old girl. The Crown proceeded summarily. The accused had spread the legs of the complainant and rubbed her vagina over her night clothes for few minutes. The complainant was the friend of the accused’s step-daughter. She was spending the night for sleepover. The accused claimed to have been disciplining the complainant, as he had noticed her engaging in sexually suggestive contact with his step-daughter about an hour earlier. The accused presented low risk to re-offend, either generally or sexually. However, the accused minimized his actions by claiming they were of disciplinary nature. Furthermore, he had no empathy for the effect of the offence on the complainant. Aggravating factors included the abuse of person under 18. However, there was no abuse of trust. The Provincial Court sentenced the accused to six month custodial sentence and one year probation. 35. R. v. Martell, 2012 SKPC 47 (CanLII), 392 Sask. R. 131 involved an accused with no prior record. The sexual assault was against an adult female. The Crown proceeded by indictment. The accused and complainant had attended wedding at Elk Ridge Resort where they, among others, had shared rented cabin. The accused had 15 alcoholic drinks during the evening. The complainant went to bed around 3:00 a.m. and fell asleep naked beside her boyfriend. The accused came into the bedroom, fondled the complainant’s breasts, removed his pants, and positioned himself on top of her. When the complainant awoke she participated briefly until she became aware that the accused was not her boyfriend. The assault lasted 20 seconds. The accused stopped immediately when the complainant indicated her lack of consent. The accused was chased out of the room by the complainant’s boyfriend, who proceeded to render beating unto the accused. There was no evidence of penetration or physical injury. The accused was sentenced to nine month incarceration, coupled with two years probation. 36. In R. v. R.L., 2013 SKPC 80 (CanLII), [2013] S.J. No 370 (QL), the accused pled guilty to assault under s. 266, prosecuted by way of indictment. Although charged with assault, the accused’s conduct was of distinctly sexual nature. The complainant was two months shy of her eighteenth birthday. The accused was her 58 year old uncle. She looked to him as father figure. At his home, the accused pushed the complainant onto his couch, and attempted to take off her clothes. The complainant began crying, but soon stopped as she felt helpless. The accused got on top of the complainant and attempted to undo her pants. The accused touched the complainant’s breasts and vaginal area over her clothing while touching himself under his pants. The accused denied the offence, and blamed the complainant. The accused was self-employed as carpenter. He was medium risk for re-offending generally, and high risk to re-offend sexually. The accused had lengthy, although dated, record for assault, gross indecency, indecent assault, sexual assault, and assault causing bodily harm. There was 17 year gap between offences; and the last sexual assault charge was 26 years prior. The accused was sentenced to 14 months incarceration followed by 12 months probation. 37. In R. v. A.B., 2013 SKQB 56 (CanLII), 413 Sask. R. 185, the accused was charged with sexual interference for touching, rubbing, and hugging 12 year old complainant over blanket. He later kissed her. The accused had criminal record for spousal assault. He was assessed as very high risk to re-offend, both sexually and violently. The accused was sentenced to nine months imprisonment and one year probation. 38. As can be seen from the cases, sentences for sexual assaults, at the lower end of the spectrum, that involve inappropriate touching range from sentence of fine up to sentence of 30 months incarceration. Many of the cases referred to involved the imposition of conditional sentence, which sentence is no longer available. However, those cases are still relevant as they suggest the appropriate period of custodial sentence, albeit at the time of those cases, the sentence was to be served in the community. The Saskatchewan Court of Appeal has indicated, however, that sexual assaults, even assaults on the lower end of the scale should draw period of incarceration. 3. What is the appropriate sentence for Mr. Michelin? 39. will deal firstly with the positions taken by the Crown on sentencing. The Crown bears the onus of proving any fact not admitted. It is the position of the Crown that the record of Mr. Michelin establishes pattern of sexual assaults. The defence counsel takes issue with this characterization. The Crown called no evidence other than the accused’s record on this issue. Mr. Michelin has two previous convictions of sexual interference on children. The most recent of these convictions was 14 years ago. am not satisfied that Mr. Michelin’s record establishes such pattern. 40. Crown counsel also took the position that it is an aggravating factor that J.M. is severely cognitively impaired. Ms. Landry argued, in oral argument, that J.M. was severely impaired. In written argument, the Crown asserted J.M. had noticeable cognitive impairment. J.M. testified at the trial. At the trial, both Crown counsel and defence counsel identified that J.M. had some cognitive impairment. However, neither suggested that J.M. was severely cognitively impaired. Neither counsel had any concern as to J.M.’s capacity to testify and did not suggest that it was necessary for the court to make any inquiry into her capacity or ability to testify. Having heard J.M.’s evidence, it was evident that she had some cognitive issues, but she was not, in my view, severely cognitively impaired. 41. Crown counsel also asserted that Mr. Michelin’s conduct established pattern of grooming in relation to J.M. The only evidence in respect of Mr. Michelin’s relationship with J.M. was from the trial. The evidence did not bear out this position taken by the Crown. There was evidence that J.M. had been involved previously in short relationship with Mr. Michelin. However, the evidence from J.M. appeared to indicate that it was consensual relationship and that the relationship ended consensually. After the relationship ended, J.M. and the accused continued to be acquaintances, such that J.M. sought out Mr. Michelin to get cigarettes and went to Mr. Michelin’s home to borrow cigarettes. The evidence did not indicate that D.H. had any prior acquaintance with Mr. Michelin. am not satisfied there was evidence of grooming. 42. In addition, Crown counsel, Ms. Landry, also challenged the probation officer’s assessment that Mr. Michelin was low risk to re-offend. However, Crown counsel, Ms. Schrol, acknowledged that the Crown was accepting that risk assessment. 43. The case filed by the Crown in support of its position on sentences is the case of R. v. Bird. The circumstances of Bird are far more egregious than the circumstances here. In Bird, the accused assaulted his 14 year old babysitter, who was babysitting in his home. The accused came home and found the victim sleeping with the accused’s infant. The accused removed the victim’s clothing, fondled her breasts, stomach and neck for 30 minutes. This was skin to skin touching. The accused threatened to kill the victim if she told anyone. The accused was in position of trust and the victim was child. The accused had 16 prior convictions, including convictions for sexual assault. Mr. Bird was sentenced to 30 months. 44. The circumstances of the offences here fall on the low end of the sexual assault spectrum. Mr. Michelin was found guilty of touching the breast and vaginal areas of the two complainants. The touching occurred over the complainants’ clothing. There was no skin to skin contact. The incident occurred over a very brief period of time, being a matter of seconds, but no longer than a minute. The touching was fleeting, to use the terminology used by the Court of Appeal in Tuffs. However, unlike the facts in Tuffs, there was no physical force used. In this case, Mr. Michelin did not use violence. Mr. Michelin did not threaten either complainant. Neither complainant was physically harmed. The offence was simply touching. In Tuffs, there was skin to skin touching and physical force used, resulting in redness. The offence also had significant impact on the victim in Tuffs. 45. Mr. Michelin was not in position of trust or authority in relation to either of these complainants. Both complainants were adults at the time of the offence. It was the complainants’ idea to come to Mr. Michelin’s home. Both complainants left Mr. Michelin’s home after the incident, at time of their choosing. 46. Only J.M. filed Victim Impact Statement. J.M. said she simply wants to be away from Mr. Michelin. 47. The mitigating factors here include the fact that Mr. Michelin has been released for two and one-half years on his own recognizance and has abided by all conditions. It is mitigating that Mr. Michelin was assessed as low risk to re-offend. It is also mitigating that the facts of the offence are on the low end of the spectrum. 48. The aggravating factors here include that Mr. Michelin has two previous convictions for sexual offences. It is also aggravating that there were two victims, one of whom had some cognitive disability. 49. The Saskatchewan Court of Appeal has been clear that sexual assaults, even those on the low end of the spectrum, attract custodial sentence. Taking into consideration both the aggravating and mitigating circumstances, the principles of sentencing, the facts, the circumstances of Mr. Michelin, the jurisprudence and the principle of totality, I am satisfied a sentence of one year on each count, to be served concurrently, followed by two years of probation, with conditions, is appropriate. 50. As such, I sentence you, Oakley Michelin, to a sentence of one year on each count, to be served concurrently, followed by two years probation with the following conditions: (a) to keep the peace and be of good behaviour; (b) to appear before court when required to do so by the court; (c) to notify the court or the probation officer in advance of any change of name or address and promptly notify the court or the probation officer of any change of employment or occupation; (d) to report to probation officer within two working days after release from custody and thereafter when required by the probation officer and in the manner directed by the probation officer; (e) to remain within the jurisdiction of the court unless written permission to go outside the jurisdiction is obtained from the court or the probation officer; and (f) subject to the program director’s acceptance of Mr. Michelin, participate actively in and not cause to be discharged from sex offender treatment program approved by the province. 51. The Crown has asked that make an order under s. 487.051 of the Criminal Code for the taking of DNA samples. Pursuant to s. 487.051(2), the court shall make such an order unless Mr. Michelin has established that the impact of such an order on his privacy and security would be grossly disproportionate to the public interest. Mr. Michelin, here, did not seek such an exemption. There will be an order pursuant to s.487.051 authorizing the taking of samples of bodily substances that is reasonably required for the purpose of forensic DNA in accordance with that section. 52. There will also be an order pursuant to s. 109 of the Criminal Code prohibiting Mr. Michelin from possessing any firearm, crossbow or prohibited weapon and restricted weapon, prohibited device, prohibited ammunition and explosive substances for period of ten years. 53. The Crown also seeks an order pursuant to s. 490.012(1) requiring Mr. Michelin to comply with the Sex Offender Information Registration Act, S.C. 2004, c.10. Mr. Michelin has not suggested that such an order would impact his privacy or liberty or would be grossly disproportionate to the public interest. As such make an order in respect of Mr. Michelin under s. 490.012(1) for period of 20 years. J. C.L. DAWSON",e_2013skqb390.txt,"HELD: The Court sentenced the accused pursuant to s. 742.1 of the Criminal Code in force at the time of the offence that precluded the use of conditional sentence order for a serious personal injury offence, which included sexual assault.
The Court found that the offences fell on the low end of the sexual assault spectrum as there was no skin to skin contact, the contact was brief and without violence or threats.
The aggravating factors were that the accused had two previous convictions for sexual offences and that one of the victims had some cognitive disability.
The accused was sentenced to a term of one year imprisonment for each count, followed by a term of probation of two years.
The sentences were to be served concurrently."
1034,"[3] Negotiations proceeded to the point where the parties began the necessary approval process for Laura Holgate to operate the personal care home.
11 of her affidavit: 11. indicated that if their property was not sold by the time of the possession date for the prospective purchase of Mrs. Pearce-Ell’s property, which date was informed had been chosen so as to permit Mr. and Mrs. Holgate’s children to start the new school year in September, that Tenancy at Will document would be required.
[11] The next interaction between the Holgates and members of Phillips Co. occurred on August 22, 2011 when Laura Holgate received an email from Ms. Phillips.
Draft offer to purchase and tenancy agreements were attached along with this e-mail note: ...please review and advise if ok to send to your lawyer Jeff Reimer or if you have any questions/revisions.
[15] The Holgates took possession of the personal care home around the same time they executed the agreements.
[16] While the central issue is whether Mr.Phillips and the lawyers from the Phillips Co. law firm should be disqualified from acting for Pearce-Ell because of conflict of interest, the parties agree the issues on this application reduce down to the following: (a) Did solicitor-client relationship exist between Laura and Keith Holgate and Phillips Co.?
(c) If solicitor-client relationship existed, did Laura and Keith Holgate waive their ability to raise this issue by reason of delay?
The latter arises as soon as the potential client has his first dealings with the lawyer's office in order to obtain legal advice.
He said: 34 ... the test to be applied is that solicitor‑client relationship arises once legal consultation occurs and the timing of that depends upon whether the client believes he is dealing with solicitor in professional capacity.
It does not stand for the proposition that all or even most of the referenced indicia need be present before solicitor-client relationship arises as matter of law.
In fact, the court in Calico took care to clarify this point and to articulate reasonable person test: 8.
By her own affidavit, Ms. Phillips concedes she discussed complications with their desired possession date in the event their farm property was not sold in timely way.
might add this conclusion is consistent with the definition of “client” adopted by the Law Society of Saskatchewan which defines “client” to mean person who: ...having consulted the lawyer, reasonably concludes that the lawyer has agreed to render legal services on his or her behalf.
wish to be clear that in reaching my conclusion about the existence of solicitor-client relationship, am not calling into question the truthfulness of the lawyers’ affidavits.
Lawyers are subject to strict ethical rules which find expression in codes of professional conduct adopted by the self-governing body in each jurisdiction.
It has been repeatedly stated that lawyer’s main duty to former client is to refrain from misusing confidential information.
(4th) 249 (“Martin”) has long been recognized as the seminal case in Canada with respect to fiduciary duties owed by lawyers, and of particular relevance to this case, the confidentiality obligations owed to past clients.
The first broad interest is the desire to maintain the high standards of the legal profession and the integrity of the justice system.
... [29] With those principles in mind, turn to the application of that test in the present circumstances.
In my opinion, once it is shown by the client that there existed previous relationship which is sufficiently related to the retainer from which it is sought to remove the solicitor, the court should infer that confidential information was imparted unless the solicitor satisfies the court that no information was imparted which could be relevant.
If the lawyer's new retainer is ""sufficiently related"" to the matters on which he or she worked for the former client, rebuttable presumption arises that the lawyer possesses confidential information that raises risk of prejudice: [31] Both parties agree that if previous solicitor-client relationship is found to exist, that relationship or retainer is sufficiently related to the action commenced in these proceedings.
This concession is self evident given the direct factual connectiveness between the sale and tenancy discussions with the parties and the gravamen of the action brought by Pearce-Ell against the Holgates.
In other words, he contends that he has adequately discharged the onus borne in these circumstances and it now falls to the Holgates to explain how this information could possibly be characterized as confidential.
12 of Ms. Phillips’ affidavit describes the type of information in benign way, it is far too generalized to rebut the presumption.
[43] Rule 2.04(10) is directly on point to the matter before this Court and its application is clear: Mr. Phillips is prohibited from acting against the Holgates.
While this Court is not bound by nor required to apply the Code, it nonetheless stands as an expression and clear one at that of the professional and ethical standards expected of lawyers in Saskatchewan in relation to former clients.
In practice, Rule 2.04(10) operates to prevent situations from arising which carry heightened risk of breach of confidentiality.
[45] Mr. Phillips and the lawyers within his law firm are ethically bound by the Rules of the Law Society of Saskatchewan to refrain from acting against former clients in the same or any related matter.
As Mr. Phillips possessed relevant confidential information from former client which could prejudice them in the within action, disqualification is generally automatic.
(c) If solicitor-client relationship existed, did Laura and Keith Holgate waive their ability to raise this issue by reason of delay?
[49] While it is true the defendants failed to raise conflict of interest concerns prior to issuance of the plaintiff’s statement of claim and that the within action was preceded by writ of possession application and analogous proceedings involving Mr. Phillips, the fact remains the Holgates’ seek an order disqualifying plaintiff counsel in this action.
[50] Even if the defendants’ failure to raise the conflict issue in earlier proceedings is relevant to their motion in the present action, delay alone is not determinative.
The two lines of argument are not isolated from each other, as the court must take into consideration all relevant facts and circumstances including any procedural delay.
[52] Second, to give effect to the delay argument requires me to turn blind eye to the exacting standards imposed by the Law Society.
[53] Finally, Mr. Phillips submits the Holgates waived the confidential flavour of any information imparted to his law firm by their mere attendance at the July 2011 meeting.
The ethical rule is wider, and applies without regard to the nature or source of the information or whether others may share the knowledge.","HELD: The Court granted the application.
It held that: 1) a solicitor-client relationship was created between the applicants and the defendants based on the evidence; and 2) that the applicants had not rebutted the presumption that they had received confidential information during the meeting that was relevant to the plaintiff’s action against the defendants.
That finding was sufficient to disqualify them for acting for the plaintiff.",506,"nan QUEEN’S BENCH FOR SASKATCHEWAN Citation: 2013 SKQB 434 Date: 2013 12 11 Docket: Q.B.G. 1001 of 2013 Judicial Centre: Regina BETWEEN: HELEN THERESA PEARCE-ELL and KEITH HOLGATE and LAURA HOLGATE Counsel: Merrilee Rasmussen, Q.C. for the plaintiffs Reginald E. Sauer for the defendants JUDGMENT SCHWANN J. December 11, 2013 [1] The sole issue presented by this application is whether Mervin C. Phillips and the lawyers with Phillips Co. should be disqualified from continuing to act for the plaintiff, Helen Theresa Pearce-Ell, because of conflict of interest. [2] In early 2011 Helen Pearce-Ell and Keith and Laura Holgate began discussions about the possible purchase and sale of Pearce-Ell’s personal care home located at 133 Dalgleish Drive, Regina, Saskatchewan. [3] Negotiations proceeded to the point where the parties began the necessary approval process for Laura Holgate to operate the personal care home. According to Laura Holgate, Pearce-Ell suggested they have the sale agreements drawn up by her lawyer and that both sides use the same lawyer to save costs. To that end, Pearce-Ell scheduled meeting with Mr. Phillips of the Phillips Co. law firm, with whom she had had long-standing solicitor-client relationship. Pearce-Ell invited the Holgates to the meeting. [4] On July 26, 2011, Pearce-Ell, along with Keith and Laura Holgate, met with Mr. Phillips and Leane Phillips at the offices of Phillips Co. Laura Holgate’s recollection of that meeting is set out in para. of her affidavit: 7. The meeting at Mr. Phillips’ office lasted approximately one hour. During this meeting Keith and along with Helen and Robert explained to Mr. Phillips the terms that we wanted to have included in the Agreement for Purchase and Sale. Mr. Phillips informed us collectively that he would draft the Agreements and contact us when they were ready to be signed. At no time during this meeting did Mr. Phillips or anyone else at the meeting explain to Keith or that we needed to obtain our own lawyer to review or sign the Agreements. Keith and were left with the understanding that Mr. Phillips was preparing the Agreements on our behalf as well as on behalf of Helen. [5] Mr. Phillips has different recollection of the events on July 26th. At paras. and of his affidavit, he deposes: 8. After being briefly introduced and while in the waiting room of my law firm and in the presence of Mrs. Pearce-Ell and Leane Phillips, expressly advised Mr. and Mrs. Holgate that my law firm acts for Mrs. Pearce-Ell and as result that my law firm could not act for them and therefore they would have to retain different lawyer. 9. Subsequently, accompanied Mrs. Pearce-Ell, Leane Phillips and Mr. and Mrs. Holgate to the office of Leane Phillips, and thereafter summarized that Leane Phillips should prepare the contracts requested by my client, Mrs. Pearce-Ell. Thereafter, again expressly advised Mr. and Mrs. Holgate that my law firm acts for Mrs. Pearce-Ell and as result that my law firm could not at for them and therefore they would have to retain different lawyer. [6] Ms. Phillips has similar recollection of events. She says at paras. and of her affidavit: 6. Mervin Phillips accompanied Mrs. Pearce-Ell and myself to my office. However, on the way to my office, the presence of Mr. and Mrs. Holgate in my law firm’s waiting room was noted by Mrs. Pearce-Ell. We were briefly introduced to Mr. and Mrs. Holgate. Thereafter, Mervin Phillips expressly advised Mr. and Mrs. Holgate that my law firm acts for Mrs. Pearce-Ell and as result that my law firm could not act for them and therefore they would have to retain different lawyer. 7. Thereafter, Mervin Phillips, Mrs. Pearce-Ell, Mr. and Mrs. Holgate, and all went to my office. Thereafter, Mervin Phillips summarized that should prepare the contracts requested by my client, Mrs. Pearce-Ell. Mervin Phillips again expressly advised Mr. and Mrs. Holgate that my law firm acts for Mrs. Pearce-Ell and as result that my law firm could not act for them and therefore they would have to retain different lawyer. [7] Laura Holgate takes exception to Mr. Phillips’ affidavit. She claims he never expressed an inability to act for her and her husband or that separate legal representation was required. [8] It is Mr. Phillips’ position the Holgates disclosed no confidential information to any lawyer within his law firm apart from the nominal information described in para. 12 of Ms. Phillips’ affidavit, that is: 12. For the remainder of the meeting, obtained from Mrs. Pearce-Ell and the Offer to Purchase form the information necessary to complete the draft Offer to Purchase document attached as Schedule “B” to the Affidavit of Laura Holgate sworn August 9, 2013. The information that was inserted mostly consisted of the information Mrs. Pearce-Ell placed in the blank Offer to Purchase form herself, however checked the legal description of title with ISC, inserted the email addresses for both the vendor and purchaser, inserted the purchase price and deposit price, left the amount for mortgage approval blank (as did not know the information as to what mortgage approval Mr. and Mrs. Holgate required), and inserted dates by which the possession, removal of conditions and acceptance of offer was to occur. [9] Ms. Phillips, however, also describes discussion she had with Keith and Laura Holgate about their desire to leave their farm and move into Regina, the difficulty they encountered selling their farm property and the fact it had been listed for period of time (para. 10). She then says at para. 11 of her affidavit: 11. indicated that if their property was not sold by the time of the possession date for the prospective purchase of Mrs. Pearce-Ell’s property, which date was informed had been chosen so as to permit Mr. and Mrs. Holgate’s children to start the new school year in September, that Tenancy at Will document would be required. [10] Ms. Phillips prepared the tenancy agreement referenced in para. [11] The next interaction between the Holgates and members of Phillips Co. occurred on August 22, 2011 when Laura Holgate received an email from Ms. Phillips. Draft offer to purchase and tenancy agreements were attached along with this e-mail note: ...please review and advise if ok to send to your lawyer Jeff Reimer or if you have any questions/revisions. [Emphasis added] [12] According to Laura Holgate, it was at this point she first realized the Phillips Co. law firm was not acting for her. At para. of her affidavit she says: 8. Sometime after the meeting at Mr. Phillips’ office was contacted by Leane Phillips to inform me that the draft Agreements were ready for signing. It was at this point that Leane Phillips informed me that Keith and needed an independent lawyer to witness the Agreements. was confused because thought we would all sign the Agreements at Mr. Phillips’ office since he drafted them for us. told Leane Phillips that Keith and would probably use Jeff Reimer because he was the lawyer we used on our last real estate transaction. Mr. Reimer was not consulted by Keith or regarding this Agreement prior to my discussion with Leane Phillips. [13] Laura Holgate immediately contacted Jeff Reimer for legal advice in connection with the agreements. Laura Holgate instructed Mr. Reimer to ensure purchase of the personal care home was conditional upon the sale of their farm. Mr. Reimer suggested couple of additions to the agreement to address these concerns and these revisions were entered by hand to the draft documents. [14] Both Keith and Laura Holgate signed the amended agreements on September 7, 2011, backdating them to September 1st to coincide with the change in possession. The parties disagree about whether the signed agreements were returned to Mr. Phillips’ law firm. In any event, neither version of the documents was executed by Pearce-Ell. [15] The Holgates took possession of the personal care home around the same time they executed the agreements. Relations between the parties deteriorated thereafter and in May 2012 Mr. Phillips wrote to Keith and Laura Holgate demanding payment in full for the property. His letter was followed by an application for writ of possession and ultimately issuance of statement of claim on behalf of Pearce-Ell. The Holgates are alleged to have occupied the plaintiff’s land (personal care home) without legal justification and that their continued occupation constitutes trespass to land. The Holgate’s defence to this claim is based on their understanding of the agreed terms of sale with particular focus on the parties’ mutual agreement that payment of the purchase price was conditional upon the sale of their farm. [16] While the central issue is whether Mr.Phillips and the lawyers from the Phillips Co. law firm should be disqualified from acting for Pearce-Ell because of conflict of interest, the parties agree the issues on this application reduce down to the following: (a) Did solicitor-client relationship exist between Laura and Keith Holgate and Phillips Co.? (b) If so, should Phillips Co. be disqualified from acting on behalf of Ms. Pearce-Ell by reason of conflict of interest? (c) If solicitor-client relationship existed, did Laura and Keith Holgate waive their ability to raise this issue by reason of delay? (a) Did solicitor-client relationship exist between Laura and Keith Holgate and Phillips Co.? [17] The Supreme Court of Canada’s decision in Descôteaux v. Mierzwinski, 1982 CanLII 22 (SCC), [1982] S.C.R. 860, at p. 876 offers the following broad guidance on when solicitor-client relationship is said to arise: When dealing with the right to confidentiality it is necessary, in my view, to distinguish between the moment when the retainer is established and the moment when the solicitor‑client relationship arises. The latter arises as soon as the potential client has his first dealings with the lawyer's office in order to obtain legal advice. [Emphasis added] [18] In Popowich v. Saskatchewan, 1995 CanLII 5956 (SK QB), [1995] W.W.R. 314, 132 Sask. R. 48 (Sask. Q.B.) Barclay J. expanded upon the test and clarified that it was to be viewed from the vantage point of the client not the lawyer. He said: 34 ... the test to be applied is that solicitor‑client relationship arises once legal consultation occurs and the timing of that depends upon whether the client believes he is dealing with solicitor in professional capacity. 35 It has long been settled that there need not be formal retainer in order for the solicitor‑client relationship to be constituted. [19] Mr. Phillips submits no solicitor-client relationship arose between his law firm and the Holgates. He points to the fact there was no retainer, no file was opened on behalf of the Holgates, no meeting took place apart from the July 26th meeting with Ms. Pearce-Ell, and no bill was rendered or paid by the Holgates. He places reliance upon the Alberta case of Jeffers v. Calico Compression Systems, 2002 ABQB 72 (CanLII), Alta. L.R. (4th) 147 where numerous indicia of solicitor-client relationship were discussed. [20] The Calico decision, in my opinion, does not meaningfully assist Mr. Phillips. It does not stand for the proposition that all or even most of the referenced indicia need be present before solicitor-client relationship arises as matter of law. The listed indicia, rather, are merely touchstones designed to assist in assessing this issue. In fact, the court in Calico took care to clarify this point and to articulate reasonable person test: 8. ... Not all indicia need to be present. As Madam Justice Romaine stated in Guardian Insurance, supra, the question appears to be whether reasonable person in the position of party with knowledge of all the facts would reasonably form the belief that the lawyer was acting for particular party. [21] With that, turn to the indicia which are present. The Holgates met with Ms. Phillips on July 26th for approximately one hour. The Holgates went to the meeting under the impression they and Pearce-Ell were using the same lawyer for the purposes of saving money. Laura Holgate says she imparted information to Ms. Phillips about the transaction. By her own affidavit, Ms. Phillips concedes she discussed complications with their desired possession date in the event their farm property was not sold in timely way. Ms. Phillips herself suggested tenancy type agreement to address this concern. As mentioned, the meeting lasted roughly one hour. meeting of this length seems unnecessarily long if the purpose of the meeting was simply to obtain non-contentious, basic facts or contact information to fill in form-based document. [22] Moreover, the August 22nd email from Ms. Phillips to Laura Holgate, albeit ambiguously worded, is also relevant to this issue. On the one hand, she asked Ms. Holgate to “review and advise” and to get back to her “if you have any questions/revisions”. Yet on the other hand she inquired if she should send the documents to Mr. Reimer. One wonders why she would communicate directly with the Holgates in the first place if she thought they were represented by legal counsel, but more importantly why she would bother to ask for their comments and revisions if she wasn’t acting for them. [23] Based on the whole of the evidence, viewed objectively through the eyes of a reasonable person, I am satisfied the interaction between the Holgates and the lawyers from Phillips & Co. constituted a solicitor-client relationship. might add this conclusion is consistent with the definition of “client” adopted by the Law Society of Saskatchewan which defines “client” to mean person who: ...having consulted the lawyer, reasonably concludes that the lawyer has agreed to render legal services on his or her behalf. [24] The solicitor-client relationship existed until August 22 or 23 when the Holgates referred the sale documents to Mr. Reimer. [25] In reaching this conclusion, am not unmindful of the content of the affidavits sworn by both Mr. Phillips and Ms. Phillips. wish to be clear that in reaching my conclusion about the existence of solicitor-client relationship, am not calling into question the truthfulness of the lawyers’ affidavits. However, the evidence is controverted. In assessing the matter and having regard to the whole of the facts, am satisfied the Holgates were left with the impression and expectation that the Phillips Co. law firm was acting for both sides, and that their impression was reasonably held. (b) If so, should Phillips Co. be disqualified from acting on behalf of Ms. Pearce-Ell by reason of conflict of interest? [26] The relationship between solicitor and client is fiduciary one. Lawyers are subject to strict ethical rules which find expression in codes of professional conduct adopted by the self-governing body in each jurisdiction. The obligation owed to former clients is one dimension of this duty. It has been repeatedly stated that lawyer’s main duty to former client is to refrain from misusing confidential information. [27] The Supreme Court of Canada’s decision in MacDonald Estate v. Martin, 1990 CanLII 32 (SCC), [1990] S.C.R. 1235, 77 D.L.R. (4th) 249 (“Martin”) has long been recognized as the seminal case in Canada with respect to fiduciary duties owed by lawyers, and of particular relevance to this case, the confidentiality obligations owed to past clients. The Supreme Court began its analysis with recognition of the legitimate, yet competing interests at play. The first broad interest is the desire to maintain the high standards of the legal profession and the integrity of the justice system. The second, often countervailing interest, is not to deprive person of his or her choice of counsel. And the third concern is to permit reasonable mobility in the legal profession. (Martin, supra, p. 1243) [28] The Supreme Court had opportunity to revisit Martin in Canadian National Railway Co. v. McKercher LLP, 2013 SCC 39 (CanLII), [2013] S.C.J. No. 39 (QL) (“C.N.R.”). That decision succinctly reaffirmed the duty owed to former clients: “The lawyer’s main duty to former client is to refrain from misusing confidential information.” (para 23). Adopting Martin, the Supreme Court, in C.N.R., re-affirmed the two-part conflict of interest test with regard to former clients: 24 ........ two‑part test is applied to determine whether the new matter will place the lawyer in conflict of interest: (1) Did the lawyer receive confidential information attributable to solicitor and client relationship relevant to the matter at hand? (2) Is there risk that it will be used to the prejudice of that client?: Martin, at p. 1260. ... [29] With those principles in mind, turn to the application of that test in the present circumstances. i) did the lawyer receive confidential information relevant to the matter at hand? [30] To assist in addressing the first part of the test, Sopinka J., in Martin, supra, at p. 1260, made these observations in relation to former clients .. In my opinion, once it is shown by the client that there existed previous relationship which is sufficiently related to the retainer from which it is sought to remove the solicitor, the court should infer that confidential information was imparted unless the solicitor satisfies the court that no information was imparted which could be relevant. ... Similarly, in C.N.R., supra, at para. ... If the lawyer's new retainer is ""sufficiently related"" to the matters on which he or she worked for the former client, rebuttable presumption arises that the lawyer possesses confidential information that raises risk of prejudice: [31] Both parties agree that if previous solicitor-client relationship is found to exist, that relationship or retainer is sufficiently related to the action commenced in these proceedings. This concession is self evident given the direct factual connectiveness between the sale and tenancy discussions with the parties and the gravamen of the action brought by Pearce-Ell against the Holgates. Simply put, the Phillips Co. law firm commenced an action on behalf of Pearce-Ell in relation to the very matter they discussed with the Holgates. [32] Having found solicitor-client relationship arose and that the new retainer for Pearce-Ell was sufficiently related to the matters involving the Holgates, both Martin and C.N.R., indicate that, as matter of law, it must be presumed the lawyers at the Phillips Co. law firm possessed confidential information. [33] This legal presumption is not irrebutable. However, as Martin, supra, instructs (at p. 1260) discharging that burden is not simple matter because the evidence must pass the scrutiny of the “reasonable person test” without actually revealing the specifics of the privileged communication: .. This will be difficult burden to discharge. Not only must the court's degree of satisfaction be such that it would withstand the scrutiny of the reasonably informed member of the public that no such information passed, but the burden must be discharged without revealing the specifics of the privileged communication. Nonetheless, am of the opinion that the door should not be shut completely on solicitor who wishes to discharge this heavy burden. [34] Paragraph 12 of Ms. Phillips’ affidavit alludes to the type of information gathered from the Holgates. Mr. Phillips contends the nature of this information was nothing more than mere garden variety conveyancing information. He doesn’t perceive it to be confidential, and in any event, he argues the Holgates have failed to demonstrate how such benign information could be used against them. In other words, he contends that he has adequately discharged the onus borne in these circumstances and it now falls to the Holgates to explain how this information could possibly be characterized as confidential. [35] With regard to the matter of onus, the law is clear. “In making this evaluation, court should not require client to disclose what information or types of information it seeks to protect or to explain how such information may be relevant to proceedings....” (Halsbury’s Laws of Canada, Legal Profession, 1st ed. (Markham,ON:LexisNexis,Canada, 2013) at p. 336) The former client need only satisfy the court of its broad relevance to the proceedings at hand and of the risk posed if it passed into the hands of the other party. In fact, requiring them to do so defeats the very purpose the protection was intended to convey. [36] While it is true we don’t know precisely what the Holgates said at the July 26th meeting, the pleadings clearly reflect sharp disagreement between the parties over the terms of their agreement and in particular whether the Holgates’ legal position was protected pending sale of their farm land. Given the nature of the ensuing lawsuit, its hard to fathom that information imparted to Ms. Phillips was purely procedural and benign in nature and not ultimately relevant to the suit commenced one year later by Mr. Phillips. [37] The next question is whether Ms. Phillips’ affidavit was sufficient to rebut the presumption. think not. In circumstances where lawyer purports to conduct litigation adverse to the former client in relation to matter connected to the first retainer, simple affidavit contesting the client’s assertions will rarely suffice. (Celanese Canada Inc. v. Murray Demolition Corp., 2006 SCC 36 (CanLII), [2006] S.C.R. 189 at para. 42) While para. 12 of Ms. Phillips’ affidavit describes the type of information in benign way, it is far too generalized to rebut the presumption. [38] To summarize, where solicitor-client relationship is found to exist, as have so found in this instance, the lawyer’s duty is to refrain from misusing confidential information received from the former client. Once that former relationship has been established, and once it can be shown that the relationship is sufficiently related to the retainer under challenge, rebuttable presumption arises in favour of the former client that confidential information was imparted. As the Phillips & Co. law firm have failed to rebut that presumption, I must presume the Holgates imparted confidential information to the lawyers in that law firm. ii) is there risk the confidential information will be used to the prejudice of the Holgates? [39] The second part of the Martin, supra, test is whether the confidential information imparted to Phillips Co. will be misused. Martin takes strict approach to the application of this part of the test. At p. 1261: ... lawyer who has relevant confidential information cannot act against his client or former client. In such case the disqualification is automatic. ... [40] Sopinka J. explained the rationale for this approach: ... No assurances or undertakings not to use the information will avail. The lawyer cannot compartmentalize his or her mind so as to screen out what has been gleaned from the client and what was acquired elsewhere. Furthermore, there would be danger that the lawyer would avoid use of information acquired legitimately because it might be perceived to have come from the client. This would prevent the lawyer from adequately representing the new client. Moreover, the former client would feel at disadvantage. Questions put in cross‑examination about personal matters, for example, would create the uneasy feeling that they had their genesis in the previous relationship. [41] This brings me to the ethical codes of the legal profession which are taken as an expression of the collective views of the profession on the standards to which the profession should adhere. It is common knowledge that the underlying purpose of self-governance, as expressed through codes of professional behavior, is the protection of the public and preservation of the repute of the profession. (C.N.R., supra, paras. 13-14) [42] The Law Society of Saskatchewan brought in revised Code of Professional Conduct (the “Code”) effective of July 1, 2012. Rule 2.04(10) addresses the circumstance of lawyer acting against former client: 2.04(10) Unless the former client consents, lawyer must not act against former client in: (a) the same matter, (b) any related matter, or (c) any other matter if the lawyer has relevant confidential information arising from the representation of the former client that may prejudice that client. [43] Rule 2.04(10) is directly on point to the matter before this Court and its application is clear: Mr. Phillips is prohibited from acting against the Holgates. While this Court is not bound by nor required to apply the Code, it nonetheless stands as an expression and clear one at that of the professional and ethical standards expected of lawyers in Saskatchewan in relation to former clients. It must be recalled that the duty to avoid conflicts is simply an adjunct to lawyer’s underlying duty to refrain from using confidential information received from former clients. In practice, Rule 2.04(10) operates to prevent situations from arising which carry heightened risk of breach of confidentiality. (C.N.R., supra, para. 24) [44] To be clear, it is not the job of this Court to pass upon lawyer’s adherence to the Code, nor to punish or discipline lawyers. Nonetheless, where matter of conflict is brought to the Court’s attention, the Court must consider the matter with an eye to and concern for the administration of justice and any appearance of impropriety. [45] Mr. Phillips and the lawyers within his law firm are ethically bound by the Rules of the Law Society of Saskatchewan to refrain from acting against former clients in the same or any related matter. At its core, the action between Pearce-Ell and the Holgates pertains to the terms of the agreement for sale, which is the same matter, or at the very least, a related matter to the original retainer. That alone is sufficient to justify their disqualification. [46] The same result is achieved by applying the Martin principles and presumptions. As Mr. Phillips possessed relevant confidential information from former client which could prejudice them in the within action, disqualification is generally automatic. While one can understand Pearce-Ell’s desire to continue on with Mr. Phillips given her long-standing relationship with him and his familiarity with this file, viewed from the perspective of reasonably informed objective person, an obvious conflict of interest exists which requires court intervention in the interests of the broader administration of justice. (c) If solicitor-client relationship existed, did Laura and Keith Holgate waive their ability to raise this issue by reason of delay? [47] Even if the Martin, supra, test is met, Mr. Phillips contends the Holgates waived their right of objection either though delay in raising the conflict issue in timely way, or by waiver of any confidentiality which would have attached to the discussions at the July 2011 meeting. [48] The first issue is readily disposed of on the facts. The statement of claim was issued on June 3, 2013. The Holgates’ legal counsel first broached the conflict of interest concern with Mr. Phillips in early July 2013. Their application followed on August 13th when negotiated approach failed. Simply put, there was no delay. [49] While it is true the defendants failed to raise conflict of interest concerns prior to issuance of the plaintiff’s statement of claim and that the within action was preceded by writ of possession application and analogous proceedings involving Mr. Phillips, the fact remains the Holgates’ seek an order disqualifying plaintiff counsel in this action. [50] Even if the defendants’ failure to raise the conflict issue in earlier proceedings is relevant to their motion in the present action, delay alone is not determinative. “Delay” is but one factor considered when applying the Martin, supra, test. The two lines of argument are not isolated from each other, as the court must take into consideration all relevant facts and circumstances including any procedural delay. J. T. Miller Construction Ltd. v. South Calgary Properties Ltd., 1995 ABCA 213 (CanLII), [1995] W.W.R. 146, 29 Alta. L.R. (3d) 393 (Alta. C.A.), for instance, demonstrates how delay fits within the Martin matrix. At para. 11 the Court said: 11 The degree of apparent conflict of interest here, and the likely harm, are of course relevant when weighing prejudice under the doctrine of delay (under procedural principles or as equitable laches). If the conflict were large, or serious harm were likely, we would likely disqualify the firm despite the time interval. Or we might disqualify the firm on condition that the party complaining pay costs to remedy its delay. Of course, we do not have that discretion when the case fits squarely within Martin v. Gray, supra, and the complaint of the conflict is made promptly. Then we must disqualify the law firm even if the conflict or likely harm is small. [51] There are two other considerations which undermine the strength of any delay argument. First, as mentioned above, Mr. Phillips proceeded with an action on behalf of Pearce-Ell in relation to the very agreements his law firm prepared following an all party meeting in July 2011 at his office. Moreover, the conditional nature of the transaction, which was crucial to the defendants and which appears to have been impressed upon Ms. Phillips at that meeting, features prominently in the pleadings. As noted above, disqualification in such circumstances is automatic. [52] Second, to give effect to the delay argument requires me to turn blind eye to the exacting standards imposed by the Law Society. am unable to see how clearly expressed Rule should be excused by pointing the equitable finger of delay at the Holgates. [53] Finally, Mr. Phillips submits the Holgates waived the confidential flavour of any information imparted to his law firm by their mere attendance at the July 2011 meeting. Again, two problems are evident from this line of argument. Mr. Phillips appears to confuse the ethical obligations imposed upon lawyers with evidentiary rules. The C.E.D. Western, 4th, Title 16: Barristers and Solicitors, explains the significance of this distinction at p. 279: §235 The ethical rule respecting confidentiality is distinguished from the evidentiary rule of solicitor-client privilege with respect to oral or documentary communications passing between client and lawyer. The ethical rule is wider, and applies without regard to the nature or source of the information or whether others may share the knowledge. (footnotes omitted) [54] Second, in order to waive the privilege which attaches to confidential information, “the waiver must be made clearly and the client must be fully informed.” (C.E.D. Western, supra, p. 286) There is no evidence before this Court of an informed waiver. DECISION [55] For the aforementioned reasons, the application is granted. There will be an order disqualifying Mervin Phillips and Leane Phillips from acting for the plaintiff, Helen Theresa Pearce-Ell, in this action. [56] Keith and Laura Holgate shall have their costs of this application fixed at $1,500.00, payable by Mervin C. Phillips. J. L. M. SCHWANN",e_2013skqb434.txt,"HELD: The Court granted the application.
It held that: 1) a solicitor-client relationship was created between the applicants and the defendants based on the evidence; and 2) that the applicants had not rebutted the presumption that they had received confidential information during the meeting that was relevant to the plaintiff’s action against the defendants.
That finding was sufficient to disqualify them for acting for the plaintiff."
1038,"[2] The plaintiff applied for an order nisi for judicial sale of the property owned by the defendants.
However, judicial sale is required so that the plaintiff may apply to have the amount of deficiency in the judgment set by the court.
[3] The plaintiff applied by notice of application for the order nisi for judicial sale, with service upon both defendants.
[5] As stated by Wright J. in Farm Credit Canada Lundback, 2002 SKQB 376 (CanLII), 225 Sask 315 [Lundback] as follows: nan The applicant applied for an order for judicial sale following the service of statement of claim on the respondents in which it sought foreclosure or alternative relief.
To be fair, Mr. Hesje indicated he was perfectly willing to have another member of the Law Society unconnected to the proceedings appointed as selling officer.
Since the judge did not fix reserve bid and since this case must be remitted to the Court below for up-to-date evidence as to present value of the property, prevailing market conditions and all other relevant factors before reserve bid can be fixed, it is inappropriate to attempt any more than very general statement of principle.
[10] From this partial appraisal and with no information on the condition of the premises, setting the reserve bid at $100,000 may not reflect the best possible price that can be attained.
Under the terms of this proposed order nisi for judicial sale, the realtor is permitted to reduce the list price to the amount of the reserve bid without further direction from the court.
THE PAYMENT OF PURCHASE MONIES INTO COURT [11] The draft order sets out the following proposal for disbursing the purchase monies: AND IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that the purchase monies shall be applied disbursed as follows: (a) firstly, to the property taxes outstanding on the mortgaged premises to the date of sale; (b) secondly, to any real estate commission payable; (c) thirdly, to the reasonable and actual property maintenance and utility costs incurred by the Plaintiff to the date of sale; (d) fourthly, to costs incurred by the Plaintiff in this action on solicitor and client basis to be taxed; (e) fifthly, to the Plaintiff for application toward the amounts owing to the Plaintiff herein as directed by this Honourable Court on application to confirm the sale; and (f) lastly, if any sale funds remain that the funds be paid into this Honourable Court and disbursed by further order of the Court on application by any of the remaining interested parties.
While it may be permissible to have the outstanding property taxes and real estate commission paid out of the proceeds of sale, the determination of reasonable costs allowed under the mortgage is matter for the court to determine upon further application.
[16] Monies owed under the mortgage are to be set by the court on further application; the plaintiff does not receive those funds in advance.
DIRECTIONS TO PLAINTIFF’S COUNSEL [19] Counsel for the plaintiff has leave to file an amended draft order nisi for judicial sale which incorporates the rulings herein, and to direct it to my attention for review.
Because some of the terms of the draft proposed order nisi for judicial sale are matters that have cautioned the plaintiff’s counsel about on previous applications, it is appropriate that assess solicitor-client costs.","The court gave leave to counsel for the plaintiff to file an amended draft order nisi.
It made the following recommendations regarding the draft order: 1) the sale should be held under the direction of a solicitor other than the plaintiff’s solicitor; 2) that relying upon a partial appraisal and in the absence of information on the condition of the property, setting the reserve bid at $100,000 might not reflect the best price.
Fairness demanded the reserve bid be set at $125,000 but the court set the bid at $115,000.
If the property could not be sold at that price, the plaintiff was given leave to apply to the court for a lower reserve bid; and 3) Queen’s Bench rule 10-47(2) required that purchase monies are to be paid into court to the credit of the cause to be applied as directed by the court, including costs.
Only after an application and service upon the defendant and after the court had assessed solicitor client costs could monies be disbursed to the plaintiff.
Monies owed under the mortgage must be set out by the court on application.
All of these matters may be addressed in one final proceeding, in the application to confirm the sale, if the judicial sale proved successful.",824,"nan QUEEN’S BENCH FOR SASKATCHEWAN Citation: 2014 SKQB 344 Date: 2014 10 23 Docket: QB 148 of 2014 Judicial Centre: Saskatoon BETWEEN: TORONTO-DOMINION BANK and DAVID GARRY SCHELL and CORINNE LAVOIE Counsel: L. Zerajic for the plaintiff No one representing the defendants FIAT ROTHERY J. October 23, 2014 [1] This fiat is in response to certain deficiencies in draft order nisi for judicial sale provided by plaintiff’s counsel. The court’s direction on various aspects of the proposed order will assist both plaintiff’s counsel and the bar in general. [2] The plaintiff applied for an order nisi for judicial sale of the property owned by the defendants. The Limitation of Civil Rights Act, RSS 1978, L-16 [LCRA] does not preclude the plaintiff from suing on the covenant because this is not purchase-money mortgage. However, judicial sale is required so that the plaintiff may apply to have the amount of deficiency in the judgment set by the court. Otherwise, as provided by s. of the LCRA, foreclosure of the mortgage operates as full satisfaction of that debt. [3] The plaintiff applied by notice of application for the order nisi for judicial sale, with service upon both defendants. Neither defendant appeared in court. The plaintiff filed draft order nisi for judicial sale in support of its application. It is from this draft order that certain rulings and directions are now provided. THE APPROPRIATE SELLING OFFICER [4] The draft order proposes that after the end of the redemption period, the mortgaged land be sold under the direction of the plaintiff’s lawyers, by way of listing the property for period of ninety days with licenced real estate agent. While the assistance of real estate agent is beneficial in obtaining the best price for residential property such as this, it has long been decided by this court that another solicitor other than the plaintiff’s own solicitor must direct the sale. [5] As stated by Wright J. in Farm Credit Canada Lundback, 2002 SKQB 376 (CanLII), 225 Sask 315 [Lundback] as follows: nan The applicant applied for an order for judicial sale following the service of statement of claim on the respondents in which it sought foreclosure or alternative relief. In so doing, it asked that its solicitor, Mr. Hesje, be appointed as selling officer to conduct the sale and report to the Court. nan expressed my concern to Mr. Hesje during the course of his submissions as to the propriety of the applicant solicitor serving in such dual function. He informed me that some members of our Court have allowed this to be done, others have declined. nan In my respectful view, it is not appropriate for the Court to appoint, as selling officer, the solicitor for the applicant creditor. There are obvious difficulties with conflict of interest. Who does the selling officer serve: the Court, from which his or her authority originates; or the client? nan The matter is of sufficient importance that concluded should reduce my thoughts to fiat and direct that it be distributed to other members of the Court. To be fair, Mr. Hesje indicated he was perfectly willing to have another member of the Law Society unconnected to the proceedings appointed as selling officer. understand that Grant Richards of Cuelenaere Kendall Katzman Watson Hagen will serve in this role as opposed to Mr. Hesje. [6] agree with the reasoning set out in Lundback. The proposed selling officer ought not to be the plaintiff’s own counsel. SETTING THE RESERVE BID [7] The setting of the reserve bid in judicial sale is requirement of s. of LCRA which states: Where, in an action upon or relating to mortgage of real property, the mortgagee, or person claiming through or under him, seeks to have the property sold, and the proceeds of sale applied in satisfaction of the mortgage indebtedness in whole or in part, the court or judge shall not order sale of the property except subject to such upset price or reserve bid as the court or judge deems proper having regard to all the circumstances. [8] As stated in Saskatoon Credit Union Ltd. Goertz, (1989), 1989 CanLII 4446 (SK CA), 73 Sask 81 (CA) at para 34: The general principle governing the upset price or reserve bid under s. has been touched on above: the amount fixed by the judge must be reasonable price, that is, as near the fair market value as is possible to be obtained at forced sale. Since the judge did not fix reserve bid and since this case must be remitted to the Court below for up-to-date evidence as to present value of the property, prevailing market conditions and all other relevant factors before reserve bid can be fixed, it is inappropriate to attempt any more than very general statement of principle. Since s. applies only to sales at the request of the mortgagee, it was obviously enacted to protect the interest of the mortgagor. Whether the land is worth more or less than the amount owing, it will always be in the best interest of the mortgagor that the land not be sold at price far below its real value, always possibility at forced sale. Thus, the primary responsibility of the judge must be to ensure that the best possible price will be obtained for the land…the judge must use the substantial discretion vested in him to ensure reasonable price on the one hand and to ensure that the sale not be abortive on the other. [Emphasis added] [9] Setting the reserve bid is an exercise of judicial discretion. The only information before the court as to the value of this mortgaged land is “residential desktop report” appraisal completed January 8, 2014, which appraises the mortgaged land at market value of $85,000 to $125,000. Plaintiff’s counsel states that the plaintiff does not know the condition of the house because no one has inspected it. Counsel suggests that setting the reserve bid at $100,000, which is 80% of the upper range of the value, is appropriate in the circumstances. [10] From this partial appraisal and with no information on the condition of the premises, setting the reserve bid at $100,000 may not reflect the best possible price that can be attained. Under the terms of this proposed order nisi for judicial sale, the realtor is permitted to reduce the list price to the amount of the reserve bid without further direction from the court. It would be more fair to set the reserve bid at an amount closer to $125,000. If the mortgaged land cannot be sold at that amount, the plaintiff has leave to return the matter to court to seek a lower reserve bid, based upon evidence to support its position. Therefore, I set the reserve bid (or minimum selling price) at $115,000. THE PAYMENT OF PURCHASE MONIES INTO COURT [11] The draft order sets out the following proposal for disbursing the purchase monies: AND IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that the purchase monies shall be applied disbursed as follows: (a) firstly, to the property taxes outstanding on the mortgaged premises to the date of sale; (b) secondly, to any real estate commission payable; (c) thirdly, to the reasonable and actual property maintenance and utility costs incurred by the Plaintiff to the date of sale; (d) fourthly, to costs incurred by the Plaintiff in this action on solicitor and client basis to be taxed; (e) fifthly, to the Plaintiff for application toward the amounts owing to the Plaintiff herein as directed by this Honourable Court on application to confirm the sale; and (f) lastly, if any sale funds remain that the funds be paid into this Honourable Court and disbursed by further order of the Court on application by any of the remaining interested parties. [12] This proposed order is not in accordance with Rule 10-47(2). This proposed order contemplates the plaintiff paying itself costs it may be entitled to under the mortgage, paying itself the amounts owing under the mortgage, and paying itself the costs on solicitor client basis “to be taxed”. [13] Rule 10-47(2) of the Queen’s Bench Rules states: (2) Any moneys resulting from the sale, mortgage, partition or exchange must be paid into Court or to trustees, or otherwise dealt with as the judge in chambers may order. [14] Rule 10-47(2) and the corresponding form 10-45A make it clear that the purchase monies are to be paid into court to the credit of the cause to be applied as directed by the court. While it may be permissible to have the outstanding property taxes and real estate commission paid out of the proceeds of sale, the determination of reasonable costs allowed under the mortgage is matter for the court to determine upon further application. [15] Solicitor-client costs must be assessed by the court, upon application with service upon the defendants. The monies cannot be disbursed to the plaintiff until that assessment has been made. See: CIBC Roberts, 2006 SKQB 44 (CanLII). [16] Monies owed under the mortgage are to be set by the court on further application; the plaintiff does not receive those funds in advance. There may be accounting issues that the defendants may wish to address and the application to confirm the sale allows for this relief. The proper forum to disburse funds is the application to confirm the sale, if the judicial sale process has proved successful. THE CONFIRMATION OF SALE APPLICATION [17] The application to confirm the sale must be brought in timely manner. Form 10-45A refers to that application being made within one month of the sale. This proposed order provides for two months prior to the confirmation application, which creates uncertainty for the proposed purchaser and unnecessary delay for both the plaintiff and the defendants. [18] Because solicitor-client costs must be assessed by the court on notice of application, it follows that the application for the order confirming sale must also be brought by notice of application. This is the stage in the foreclosure proceeding to not only seek confirmation of the sale, but also to seek the court’s direction on the payment of the purchase monies, including costs. It is the stage to set the deficiency amount of the judgment, if any. All these outstanding matters ought to be addressed in one final proceeding. DIRECTIONS TO PLAINTIFF’S COUNSEL [19] Counsel for the plaintiff has leave to file an amended draft order nisi for judicial sale which incorporates the rulings herein, and to direct it to my attention for review. [20] will maintain carriage of this file, including the application to confirm the sale. Because some of the terms of the draft proposed order nisi for judicial sale are matters that have cautioned the plaintiff’s counsel about on previous applications, it is appropriate that assess solicitor-client costs. Plaintiff’s counsel may obtain date for the next court proceeding from the local registrar. J. A. R. ROTHERY",e_2014skqb344.txt,"The court gave leave to counsel for the plaintiff to file an amended draft order nisi.

1042,"She is also charged that on the same date she breached probation order by failing to keep the peace and be of good behaviour.
The defence also argues that the complainant and police subjected the accused to an unlawful and unreasonable search and seizure, and infringed her rights contrary to section of the Charter.
The defence asks that the evidence that was obtained following the unlawful entry into the accused’s home be excluded.
[4] The complainant, Jennifer Buchanan testified that she is child protection worker employed by the Saskatchewan Ministry of Social Services.
[7] Ms. Buchanan testified that shortly prior to her initial involvement with Ms. Bigsky in January 2015, the children were returned to Ms. Bigsky’s care and that at that time Ms. Bigsky executed parental services agreement.
Under the parental services agreement, Ms. Bigsky gave permission to officers of the Ministry to enter her home.
believe and conclude in this case that Ms. Buchanan and other workers directed Ms. Bigsky that Mr. Lerat was not to be in the home, but that this direction was not made part of any parental services agreement or other court order applicable to Ms. Bigsky.
[10] Ms. Buchanan testified that she went to the apartment block, and was waiting outside.
[11] Ms. Buchanan testified that she and Corporal Mickleborough of the Moose Jaw Police Service approached the patio door of Ms. Bigsky’s suite.
[14] Under cross-examination Ms. Buchanan testified that she went to the house hoping to arrest Mr. Lerat, not to apprehend the children.
She was specifically asked whether she had a warrant under section 13.1 of The Child and Family Services Act, allowing her to enter the home.
She also agreed that she went into the kitchen area and searched cupboards, the refrigerator and pantry.
At one time, the complainant came into the room and she and the accused immediately began to exchange words.
He stepped between the two women and at that moment Ms. Bigsky tried kind of round house swing that may have made contact with Ms. Buchanan’s arm.
[21] Under cross-examination, he stated that he has fairly regularly attended to assist with child apprehensions.
He could not say if he advised they would force their way in, if Ms. Bigsky did not open the door.
He was specifically asked if he recalled Ms. Bigsky telling Ms. Buchanan “don’t touch my kids stuff”.
[26] She testified that the police and Buchanan entered the suite and Ms. Buchanan immediately advised that she would apprehend the children.
She said that Ms. Buchanan went all over in the apartment, including searching in the bedrooms and in the kitchen cupboard and refrigerator.
[28] She indicated that at some point Ms. Buchanan asked her to get jackets and boots for her children, and she did that.
She stated: “he wasn’t out there.” [30] She was cross-examined on her contact with Ms. Buchanan for the month prior to this incident.
When we resumed, advised Mr. Wiebe that would allow him to re-open his case in order that he might present any additional evidence he required to meet the Charter arguments.
[33] There was some debate between counsel as to whom was entering Ms. Bigsky’s apartment, and actually conducting the search.
Ms. Buchanan seemed to believe that the Parental Service Agreement gave her authority to enter the home, and she could do that without warrant.
In order to allow that, would have to interpret the Parental Service Agreement as providing continuing and indeterminate waiver of constitutional rights.
[35] Both Ms. Buchanan and Ms. Bigsky testified that the Police informed Ms. Bigsky that she had to open the door and allow them entrance, or they would force their way in.
[37] begin by observing that Mr. Wiebe argued that Corporal Mickleborough had the lawful authority to enter the suite in order to arrest Justin Lerat.
The exception to this rule is if an officer is in hot pursuit of an individual, and attempting to make the arrest.
In that case, his Honour Judge Morgan concluded that the police officer unlawfully entered the dwelling house to effect the arrest of Mr. Meier.
[39] The result is that I must conclude that Corporal Mickleborough did not have any lawful authority to enter Ms. Bigsky’s apartment suite to effect and arrest of Justin Lerat.
Rather, the worker or workers involved determined that it might be harmful to the children if Mr. Lerat had contact with them.
[43] But what is the status of simple directive from the worker, when no order is made.
would suggest that as matter of common sense, directive cannot have the same force of law as court order.
[44] Section 13.1 of The Child and Family Services Act reads as follows: 13.1(1) justice of the peace or judge may issue warrant pursuant to this section where the justice or judge is satisfied by information on the oath of an officer or peace officer that: (a) there are reasonable grounds to believe that child may be in need of protection; (b) person refuses to give the officer or peace officer access to the child; and (c) access to the child is necessary to determine if the child is in need of protection.
(5) An application for warrant may be made in person, by telephone or by any other means of electronic communication.
However, no attempt was made to utilize this section or obtain authorization to enter the home.
[48] Were exigent circumstances present here, thus allowing Ms. Buchanan to enter the home without warrant?
[49] From the evidence, I conclude that the preferrable or good option was that Mr. Lerat not be in the home.
The mere belief that Justin Lerat was there could not and did not provide exigent circumstances allowing entry of the home without warrant.
In fact, the trial judge specifically commented that “the accused was not conscripted to provide incriminating evidence” am now required to do Grant analysis.
In Grant, the Court said: “When faced with an application for exclusion under s. 24(2), court must assess and balance the effect of admitting the evidence on society’s confidence in the justice system having regard to: (1) the seriousness of the Charter-infringing state conduct, (2) the impact of the breach on the Charter-protected interests of the accused, and (3) society’s interest in the adjudication of the case on its merits.” [51] The Court elaborated that the first stage involved consideration of the Police or State conduct that infringed the Charter.
In other cases, the Courts have said that the privacy interest in private dwelling or home is high.
The Charter breach here is severe in that officers entered and searched the accused’s home without any authority to do so.
[52] The Court elaborated that the second stage involved focus on the accused and how his or her interests were impacted by the breach.
[53] The Court elaborated that the third stage “asks whether the truth seeking function of the criminal trial process would be better served by admission of the evidence or by its exclusion.” The accused’s offence was a reaction to a very significant and provocative breach of her Charter rights.
When I look at all of these factors, I come to the conclusion that all the evidence obtained from and after the unlawful entry of the accused’s home should be excluded.
[55] For all of the above mentioned reason, would exclude the evidence obtained after the unlawful entry into the accused’s apartment suite.
[56] express my thanks to both counsel for their excellent presentation of very interesting case.","HELD: The accused was found not guilty.
The court found that the accused’s s. 8 Charter rights were breached.
Pursuant to a Grant analysis, the court excluded the evidence obtained after the illegal entry of the accused’s home.
The court found that the accused had not consented to the entry by the officer and the complainant and it was therefore a warrantless search.
The officer did not have the lawful authority to enter the home on the basis of arresting the father as he was not in hot pursuit.
The complainant had not obtained a warrant under s. 13.1 of The Child and Family Services Act to enter the accused’s home and therefore had no lawful authority to enter the home.
There were no exigent circumstances to justify the search such as preventing the destruction of evidence as they already established that the person they sought was not in the house.
The unlawful entry and search of the accused’s home was a severe breach of the accused’s Charter rights.
The impact upon her was severe as the complainant gathered evidence and apprehended her children.
The accused’s assault on the complainant was minor in nature and although not excusable, her offence was a reaction to a significant breach of her rights.
The administration of justice was served by excluding the evidence.",44,"nan IN THE PROVINCIAL COURT OF SASKATCHEWAN Citation: 2016 SKPC 106 Date: August 31, 2016 Information: 37253347 Location: Moose Jaw Between: Her Majesty the Queen and Christine Jasmine Leigh Bigsky Appearing: Curtis Wiebe For the Crown Suzanne Jeanson For the Accused JUDGMENT D. KOVATCH, [1] The accused, Christine Jasmine Leigh Bigsky is charged that on March 23, 2015, she committed an assault on Jennifer Buchanan, contrary to section 266 of the Criminal Code. She is also charged that on the same date she breached probation order by failing to keep the peace and be of good behaviour. [2] The complainant Jennifer Buchanan is child protection worker employed by the Saskatchewan Ministry of Social Services. On the date in question, she enlisted the assistance of the Moose Jaw Police Service so that she could enter the accused’s home, to investigate whether the accused’s children were in need of protection, and if necessary to apprehend those children. After the complainant and police entered the accused’s apartment suite, the accused kicked and hit the complainant. There is no doubt that Ms. Bigsky’s actions could legally constitute an assault. The defence argued that her actions were justified under the common law and provisions of the Criminal Code, on the basis of her defence of property and defence of third person. The defence also argues that the complainant and police subjected the accused to an unlawful and unreasonable search and seizure, and infringed her rights contrary to section of the Charter. The defence asks that the evidence that was obtained following the unlawful entry into the accused’s home be excluded. THE EVIDENCE [3] The defence admitted the identity of the accused and the jurisdiction of the court. It also admitted that on March 23, 2015, the accused was under probation order that required her to keep the peace and be of good behaviour. [4] The complainant, Jennifer Buchanan testified that she is child protection worker employed by the Saskatchewan Ministry of Social Services. She is also an officer appointed by the Minister under section 57(b) of The Child and Family Services Act. Between October, 2014 and June, 2015, she was working in Moose Jaw. Her duties included investigating concerns regarding children, apprehending children when necessary, making case plans and working with families within those case plans. In January, 2015, she began working with the complainant. [5] Ms. Buchanan testified that the accused has three children. Further, that the father of those children is one Justin Lerat. [6] Ms. Buchanan testified that at sometime prior to her initial involvement with Ms. Bigsky in January 2015, that Ms. Bigsky’s children were apprehended and were, for period of time, in the care of the Minister of Social Services. She testified that according to the file history, this apprehension of the children and their placement in care was at least partly based on Mr. Lerat having assaulted Ms. Bigsky, and the children having been exposed to domestic violence. She further testified that Mr. Lerat was charged with an assault upon Ms. Bigsky, and that prior to March 23, 2015, he was released on bail with respect to that assault charge. Further, that one of his conditions of bail was that he was to have no contact with Ms. Bigsky. [7] Ms. Buchanan testified that shortly prior to her initial involvement with Ms. Bigsky in January 2015, the children were returned to Ms. Bigsky’s care and that at that time Ms. Bigsky executed parental services agreement. Under the parental services agreement, Ms. Bigsky gave permission to officers of the Ministry to enter her home. She also testified that the children were returned to Ms. Bigsky’s care on the basis that Justin Lerat would not be there with her in the home. The parental services agreement was not filed with the Court, and Ms. Buchanan did not testify that it was condition of the parental services agreement that Mr. Lerat not be in the home. believe and conclude in this case that Ms. Buchanan and other workers directed Ms. Bigsky that Mr. Lerat was not to be in the home, but that this direction was not made part of any parental services agreement or other court order applicable to Ms. Bigsky. will return to the significance of this in due course. [8] Ms. Buchanan testified that following the return of the children to Ms. Bigsky, the Ministry still had ongoing concerns regarding Ms. Bigsky’s care of the children. Officers of the Ministry continued to monitor Ms. Bigsky the children, and the children’s care. She testified that in March 2015, the Ministry interviewed one of the children at the school, and obtained information that Mr. Lerat was in the home. She testified that as of March 23, 2015, she had never met Mr. Lerat. She only had description of him. [9] She testified that on March 23, 2015, she discussed matters with her superiors, and it was decided that she would go to Ms. Bigsky’s apartment suite to investigate. If Mr. Lerat was there, she would have him arrested. She testified that she was not going to the apartment suite to apprehend the children. In order to accomplish all of this, she would follow the common practice. That is, she would take another worker with her, and would enlist the support and assistance of the Moose Jaw Police Service, to conduct the investigation and possible apprehension. [10] Ms. Buchanan testified that she went to the apartment block, and was waiting outside. At this time she saw Justin Lerat on the balcony of Ms. Bigsky’s suite. She said he was smoking. Ms. Buchanan has said that she told the officers that this was Mr. Lerat, and they called to him. Mr. Lerat made no response, but immediately went inside the suite. [11] Ms. Buchanan testified that she and Corporal Mickleborough of the Moose Jaw Police Service approached the patio door of Ms. Bigsky’s suite. They knocked. She could see Ms. Bigsky on the other side of the patio door. However, Ms. Bigsky refused to allow them in. She testified that the police told Ms. Bigsky that she had to allow them in to investigate regarding the children. Further, that if she did not allow them in, they would force their way in. Ms. Bigsky opened the door and allowed them in. They searched for Mr. Lerat but he was not there. She further testified that neither she nor the police had any warrant to enter the home. [12] Ms. Buchanan testified that she then called her superiors to seek further directions. She advised them what had happened. Presumably, this included her belief that Justin Lerat was present but that they did not locate him or arrest him. She was directed to apprehend the children. [13] She then advised Ms. Bigsky that she would be apprehending the children. She asked Ms. Bigsky to dress the children appropriately and supply them with sufficient clothing. Ms. Bigsky became agitated and argumentative. Ms. Buchanan said that she was looking through stack of clothes for children’s clothing when Ms. Bigsky said something like don’t touch my kids things. She said Ms. Bigsky hit her on the shoulder with closed fist. Officer Mickleborough stepped between the two of them, and Ms. Bigsky then kicked Ms. Buchanan in the leg. She said she suffered no injuries from the assault. [14] Under cross-examination Ms. Buchanan testified that she went to the house hoping to arrest Mr. Lerat, not to apprehend the children. She was specifically asked whether she had a warrant under section 13.1 of The Child and Family Services Act, allowing her to enter the home. She said she had no such warrant, and had never utilized a warrant before. She stated that Ms. Bigsky had given them permission to enter the home under the parental services agreement. [15] Ms. Buchanan testified under cross-examination that she looked for clothes in both bedrooms. She also agreed that she went into the kitchen area and searched cupboards, the refrigerator and pantry. She admitted that she did this to see if there were additional reasons to apprehend the children. She also agreed that when she was struck by Ms. Bigsky, she told Constable Mickleborough that she wanted the accused charged. She doubted that she stated she wanted the accused in jail. [16] The next witness called was Corporal Taylor Mickleborough of the Moose Jaw Police Service. He testified that he has been with the force for 16 years. On March 23, 2015, he was called for assistance with child apprehension. He later testified that it was fairly typical or standard practice for police to attend with child protection officers to assist with child apprehensions. He was in full uniform and was accompanied by Constable Scheske. [17] Corporal Mickleborough testified that he parked his police vehicle near the apartment block on the 500 block of Laurier Street West. He was immediately approached by the complainant, Jennifer Buchanan. She advised of her concerns, and that she believed Justin Lerat was present at Ms. Bigsky’s apartment suite. [18] He stated that he went to the door and spoke to the accused, Christine Bigsky. She was reluctant to let him in, but did let him in. He stated she was cooperative, “but not happy”. He said that he did not force his way in. He believed that when they entered the suite Ms. Bigsky was there with one small child and baby. He asked if Justin Lerat was there, and was told that he was not there. They asked to search for Mr. Lerat, and search was conducted. Mr. Lerat was not present and not seen. [19] He stated that he then spoke to Ms. Bigsky, and advised her of the apprehension order. She was quite upset and emotional about this. He spoke to her at some length, attempting to calm her down. At one time, the complainant came into the room and she and the accused immediately began to exchange words. This was upsetting Ms. Bigsky, and causing the situation to escalate. As result, he asked the complainant to leave. [20] Later, the complainant, Ms. Buchanan came back into the room. Ms. Bigsky tried to reach her. Ms. Bigsky tried “an off balance kick”. He stepped between the two women and at that moment Ms. Bigsky tried kind of round house swing that may have made contact with Ms. Buchanan’s arm. He could not say whether this was slap or closed fist. Ms. Buchanan then said that she wanted Ms. Bigsky charged. He asked Ms. Buchanan to leave. He then spoke to Ms. Bigsky, attempting to calm her. He asked her to get some clothes together for the children, and she did that. [21] Under cross-examination, he stated that he has fairly regularly attended to assist with child apprehensions. He indicated that there was no warrant to enter Mr. Bigsky’s apartment suite. He also stated that at no time did he see Justin Lerat. [22] He admitted that Ms. Bigsky did not immediately grant him entry. She was reluctant to let him in. He advised that he said they wanted in and had authority to come in. He stated they needed to come in to ensure the welfare and the safety of the children. However, he could not remember his exact words. He could not say if he advised they would force their way in, if Ms. Bigsky did not open the door. [23] He stated that Ms. Bigsky was very upset, understandably so. He stated that she was questionning the legitimacy of the apprehension, and was frustrated by the fact of the apprehension. In the exchanges between the complainant and the accused, Ms. Buchanan was persistent in saying that she was apprehending, and giving some reasons for the apprehension. Ms. Bigsky was persistent in saying there was no reason for the apprehension, and that should not occur. The argument between the two women was escalating, and he was attempting to keep the peace. He was specifically asked if he recalled Ms. Bigsky telling Ms. Buchanan “don’t touch my kids stuff”. He said he did not recall Ms. Bigsky saying that. [24] Ms. Bigsky then testified in her defence. She stated that on March 23, 2015, she was living in an apartment suite on Laurier Street. On that day police came to her sliding glass doors with the complainant, Jennifer Buchanan. At first, she did not let them in. The police officer asked her to open the door or they would have to forcefully open it. She opened the door for the safety of her children, and allowed them entrance. [25] She stated that she was there with two of her children. Her other child was in school. No one else was there. She further stated that Justin Lerat is her ex, and is the father of her children. He was at the apartment during that day but not when this incident occurred. [26] She testified that the police and Buchanan entered the suite and Ms. Buchanan immediately advised that she would apprehend the children. Ms. Bigsky had said she was very offended by this, as there was no reason for an apprehension. No one had warrant to enter the suite, and she was never presented with any warrant. [27] Ms. Bigsky testified that she was yelling at Ms. Buchanan as she told Ms. Buchanan there was “no reason to apprehend”; “don’t touch my kids things”; and “don’t go in my bedroom”. She said that Ms. Buchanan went all over in the apartment, including searching in the bedrooms and in the kitchen cupboard and refrigerator. She emphatically stated that they weren’t there to search just for Justin Lerat. They were there to apprehend her kids. [28] She indicated that at some point Ms. Buchanan asked her to get jackets and boots for her children, and she did that. Further, there was pile of clothes in the living room. Ms. Buchanan was looking through these clothes, and throwing things around bit. She asked Ms. Buchanan not to dig through these clothes. Ms. Buchanan said something offensive to her, but she could not recall the specific comment. At that time she hit and kicked Ms. Buchanan, but did not hurt her. Ms. Buchanan then immediately said “I’m charging you”. The police officer (Corporal Mickleborough) stated he wouldn’t let Ms. Buchanan press charges. [29] Under cross-examination, Ms. Bigsky said that Justin Lerat was under an order that he was to have no contact with her. Further, that he left just before they came. She stated: “he wasn’t out there.” [30] She was cross-examined on her contact with Ms. Buchanan for the month prior to this incident. She admitted that she and Ms. Buchanan did not get along. She stated that Ms. Buchanan did not listen to her, and was looking for excuses to take the children. She agreed with Mr. Wiebe that Corporal Mickleborough was helpful, and helped her calm down and remain calm. She wasn’t angry with Corporal Michelborough, rather her anger was directed at Ms. Buchanan, because she was apprehending. She admitted that when she hit and kicked Ms. Buchanan, she did so out of anger. She stated she was not thinking about it. [31] Mr. Wiebe suggested to her that Corporal Mickleborough did not tell her that she had to let them in for the safety of the children. She agreed with that. She agreed that at that time she thought she was letting them in to search for Justin. [32] The defence case was closed. Counsel in the court then discussed date for arguments. Defence counsel, Ms. Jeanson had not served any Charter notice. suggested that she may want to consider serving notice and arguing Charter issues. The matter was adjourned and Ms. Jeanson did serve and file Charter notice. When we resumed, advised Mr. Wiebe that would allow him to re-open his case in order that he might present any additional evidence he required to meet the Charter arguments. Counsel advised that they had discussed the matter, and both were of the view that no additional evidence would be presented, and they would simply argue the Charter issues together with the other trial issues. Each side filed some cases and made fairly extensive and very helpful arguments. [33] There was some debate between counsel as to whom was entering Ms. Bigsky’s apartment, and actually conducting the search. In my view, this issue is somewhat relevant to some factual findings to be made by the Court, but not of large legal significance. Ms. Buchanan is an officer appointed by The Child and Family Services Act, and as such has certain powers under that Act. She requested and obtained the assistance of Moose Jaw City Police. Corporal Mickleborough assisted. He is peace officer who has certain powers under the Criminal Code. These two individuals acted together. Very often numerous individuals will be involved in search. One officer is required to have legal authority to conduct the search, and to be the operating mind and directing mind of that search. The others derive their authority from that individual, and act under the instructions of that individual. As result, the most fundamental question here isn’t which officer did what, but whether any officer had the legal authority to conduct the search and take the steps that they did at Ms. Bigsky’s apartment. ISSUE ONE DID THE POLICE HAVE LEGAL BASIS TO ENTER MS. BIGSKY’S HOME UNDER THE CRIMINAL CODE? WAS THE ACCUSED SUBJECTED TO AN UNLAWFUL SEARCH AND SEIZURE CONTRARY TO SECTION OF THE CHARTER? [34] Section of the Charter says: “Everyone has the right to be secure against unreasonable search and seizure.” An individual can agree and consent to search of his private property. consensual search is not generally contrary to this Charter Right. Ms. Buchanan seemed to believe that the Parental Service Agreement gave her authority to enter the home, and she could do that without warrant. In order to allow that, would have to interpret the Parental Service Agreement as providing continuing and indeterminate waiver of constitutional rights. waiver of constitutional rights must be informed and narrowly construed. The Parental Service Agreement could not give Ms. Buchanan an open ended authority to enter the home without permission. [35] Both Ms. Buchanan and Ms. Bigsky testified that the Police informed Ms. Bigsky that she had to open the door and allow them entrance, or they would force their way in. Corporal Mickleborough testified he informed Ms. Bigsky they had authority to enter and that they needed to ensure the welfare and safety of the children. He could not recall his exact words or whether he said they would force their way in. conclude that, at first, Ms. Bigsky was not opening the door and allowing them entrance. It was communicated to her that they had lawful authority to enter, and she had to let them in. She reluctantly opened the door and allowed them to enter. This was a forced consent. It was not a free and willing or informed consent. It was no consent in law. It is clear it was a warrantless search. [36] In the case of Collins, (1987) 1987 CanLII 84 (SCC), SCR 265, Chief Justice Lemaire stated that warrantless search is presumed to be unreasonable and the Crown must establish the search was reasonable on balance of probabilities. He further stated that search will be reasonable if it is authorized by law, if the law itself is reasonable and if the manner in which the search was carried out is reasonable. [37] begin by observing that Mr. Wiebe argued that Corporal Mickleborough had the lawful authority to enter the suite in order to arrest Justin Lerat. However, Ms. Jeanson pointed out that Corporal Mickleborough did not testify to that effect. Rather, the Corporal said that he was there to assist Ms. Buchanan with the apprehension. This evidence doesn’t conclusively determine or preclude the Court from determining that Corporal Mickleborough was lawfully exercising Criminal Code power. However, it is certainly indicative that Corporal Mickleborough did not believe he had authority under the Criminal Code to act, and that he wasn’t attempting to act under the Criminal Code. [38] More importantly, even if Corporal Mickleborough believed he could enter the suite to arrest Justin Lerat, in my view he would be wrong in that assessment. The case of Feeney, (1997) 1997 CanLII 342 (SCC), SCR 13 establishes that even if an officer had warrant for the arrest of an individual, he would not be entitled to enter private dwelling house to search for that individual and make an arrest. warrant and judicial authorization to enter the premises would be required. The exception to this rule is if an officer is in hot pursuit of an individual, and attempting to make the arrest. However, in this case, Corporal Mickleborough was not in hot pursuit He had not seen Justin Lerat at all that day and had not pursued him to this residence. In my view, this case is very similar to Meier, 2009 SKPC 30 (CanLII). In that case, his Honour Judge Morgan concluded that the police officer unlawfully entered the dwelling house to effect the arrest of Mr. Meier. [39] The result is that I must conclude that Corporal Mickleborough did not have any lawful authority to enter Ms. Bigsky’s apartment suite to effect and arrest of Justin Lerat. He was not exercising criminal law power and his entrance to that suite will be contrary to her section rights, unless that entrance and search is determined to be lawful under some other legal authority. ISSUE TWO WAS THE CHILD PROTECTION WORKER, JENNIFER BUCHANAN, ENTITLED TO ENTER THE ACCUSED’S HOME (WITH THE ASSISTANCE OF POLICE) UNDER THE SASKATCHEWAN CHILD AND FAMILY SERVICES ACT? (A) WHAT IS THE STATUS OR VALIDITY OF THE WORKER’S DIRECTION THAT THE ACCUSED’S COMMON LAW AND FATHER OF THE CHILDREN NOT BE AT THE ACCUSED’S HOME OR WITH THE CHILDREN? [40] begin the discussion under this heading by referring to section 16 of The Child and Family Services Act. The heading for that section is “Protective Intervention Orders”. Section 16(1), (3) and (4) read as follows: 16(1) Subject to subsection (2), where an officer has reasonable grounds to believe that contact between child and another person would cause the child to be in need of protection, the officer may apply to the court for protective intervention order directed to that person. (3) Where, on an application pursuant to subsection (1), the court is of the opinion that contact between child and another person would cause the child to be in need of protection, the court may make protective intervention order containing any terms and conditions that the court considers to be in the best interests of the child, including, without limiting the generality of the foregoing, direction to person named in the order to refrain from any contact or association with the child. (4) Subject to subsections (5) and (6), protective intervention order is effective for any period specified in the order that does not exceed six months. As understand it the situation, no protective intervention order was obtained by the Ministry or any of its workers against Justin Lerat. Rather, the worker or workers involved determined that it might be harmful to the children if Mr. Lerat had contact with them. As result, they counselled Ms. Bigsky to this effect and advised that if Mr. Lerat was involved with them, they could consider the children to be in need of protection and make an apprehension. [41] Clearly, this was the situation and the basis of the concern on March 23, 2015. Ms. Buchanan testified to the effect that she went to the suite on that day to ascertain if Justin Lerat was there, and if so, to have him arrested or to apprehend the children. [42] Under section 16, where the court is satisfied that contact between the child and another person would cause the child to be in need of protection, the court makes an order. It would seem to me that where such an order was made, and where the order is breached in any fashion, the worker would instantly have grounds to believe the child was in need of protection, and apprehension would be justified. [43] But what is the status of simple directive from the worker, when no order is made. would suggest that as matter of common sense, directive cannot have the same force of law as court order. As result, mere breach of directive from the Ministry or its worker does not, ipso facto, establish grounds for apprehension. This need not be fatal and necessarily lead court to conclude that there are no grounds for apprehension. In this case, it was open to the Crown and the Ministry to establish that any contact of the children with Justin Lerat was harmful to the children, and they were immediately in need of protection. But was this established here? In my view it was not. The totality of the evidence is to the effect that Justin Lerat was charged with an assault upon Ms. Bigsky. He was released on conditions of bail that included that he was to have no contact with Ms. Bigsky. On March 23, 2015, Ms. Buchanan believed that he had contact with Ms. Bigsky and in fact was at her apartment suite. father has right of access to his children, and children have right of access to their father. The mere fact that the father had contact with Ms. Bigsky on this date is not sufficient to allow me to conclude that the children were in need of protection or that apprehension was justified on that date merely by reason of him having contact with Ms. Bigsky. The fact that worker had directed that Mr. Lerat was not to have contact with Ms. Bigsky or the children, does not alter that situation. (B) WAS THE CHILD PROTECTION WORKER, ASSISTED BY POLICE, ENTITLED OR EMPOWERED TO ENTER THE ACCUSED’S HOME TO INVESTIGATE THE WELFARE OF THE ACCUSED’S CHILDREN AND APPREHEND THOSE CHILDREN? [44] Section 13.1 of The Child and Family Services Act reads as follows: 13.1(1) justice of the peace or judge may issue warrant pursuant to this section where the justice or judge is satisfied by information on the oath of an officer or peace officer that: (a) there are reasonable grounds to believe that child may be in need of protection; (b) person refuses to give the officer or peace officer access to the child; and (c) access to the child is necessary to determine if the child is in need of protection. (2) In warrant issued pursuant to subsection (1), the justice of the peace or judge may do one or more of the following: (a) authorize an officer or peace officer named in the warrant to enter premises specified in the warrant and to search for the child; (b) require person to disclose the location of the child; (c) require person to allow the officer or peace officer to interview or to visually examine the child or to do both; (d) authorize the officer or peace officer to take the child away from the premises for an interview or medical examination; (e) authorize duly qualified medical practitioner or other health care provider to examine the child. (3) Where an officer is authorized by warrant to enter premises pursuant to clause (2)(a), the officer may be assisted by peace officer in carrying out the powers conferred by the warrant. (4) If child is taken away from premises for an interview or medical examination pursuant to warrant, the officer or peace officer must return the child to person who has right to custody of the child when the interview or medical examination is completed unless the officer or peace officer proceeds pursuant to section 17. (5) An application for warrant may be made in person, by telephone or by any other means of electronic communication. (6) No person shall obstruct any person who is authorized to make an entry pursuant to this section. [45] The complainant, Ms. Buchanan, testified that she did not have warrant to enter Ms. Bigsky’s home, and that she had never before obtained warrant under this section to enter home. [46] What is the purpose and effect of section 13.1? begin by noting that the Feeney decision was decided in 1997, and section 13.1 was enacted in 1999, approximately two years after that decision. In my view, there was realization that the Feeney decision would apply to child protection workers, and prevent them from entering home without warrant to investigate child protection matters and to conduct apprehensions. The Provincial Legislature followed the Feeney decision and the expanded provisions following section 529 of the Criminal Code, by enacting similar provisions allowing for judicial authorization to child protection worker to enter home. Simply stated, section 13.1 was enacted to allow Ms. Buchanan to address the very situation that she was confronted with on March 23, 2015. However, no attempt was made to utilize this section or obtain authorization to enter the home. conclude that Ms. Buchanan had no lawful authority under The Child and Family Services Act to enter the accused’s home. (C) COULD THE WORKER ENTER THE HOME UNDER EXIGENT CIRCUMSTANCES? WERE EXIGENT CIRCUMSTANCES PRESENT HERE? [47] Section 13.1 of the Act makes no mention of exigent circumstances. However, am of the view that under exigent circumstances child protection worker could lawfully enter home without warrant to investigate the welfare of children and apprehend children. It cannot possibly be the state of our law that if children were being actively abused and in need of protection, and workers and police were outside the home, that they could not enter to investigate and apprehend the children. In Silveira, (1995) 1995 CanLII 89 (SCC), SCR 297, the court dealt with search for drugs and the charges under The Narcotic Control Act. In part, the court stated that exigent circumstances have been regarded, both under the common law and the Charter to permit warrantless search of home. am of the view that this exemption must apply to this provincial legislation. [48] Were exigent circumstances present here, thus allowing Ms. Buchanan to enter the home without warrant? Mr. Wiebe argued that exigent circumstances were present. He said that there was a necessity to enter to prevent the destruction of evidence. immediately questioned that. The evidence they were seeking was evidence that Mr. Lerat was present in the home. don’t now how that evidence could simply be destroyed. [49] From the evidence, I conclude that the preferrable or good option was that Mr. Lerat not be in the home. If he was not in the home, there was no particular problem and certainly no exigent circumstances to enter the home. The mere belief that Justin Lerat was there could not and did not provide exigent circumstances allowing entry of the home without warrant. ISSUE THREE IF THE ACCUSED’S CHARTER RIGHTS HAVE BEEN INFRINGED, WHAT IS THE APPROPRIATE REMEDY? SHOULD THE EVIDENCE OF ASSAULT BE EXCLUDED? [50] Mr. Wiebe argued that the assault upon Ms. Buchanan occurred after the breach by the unlawful entry and that there was no nexus between the Charter breach and the assault. On this basis he suggested that should admit the evidence, even if concluded that there was Charter breach. He relied upon the case of Krzychowiec, 2004 NSPC 60 (CanLII). This decision is good authority for his argument. However, it is note worthy that this decision was decided prior to Grant, 2009 SCC 32 (CanLII), when Stillman, (1997) 1997 CanLII 384 (SCC), SCR 607 represented the law. In fact, the trial judge specifically commented that “the accused was not conscripted to provide incriminating evidence” am now required to do Grant analysis. In Grant, the Court said: “When faced with an application for exclusion under s. 24(2), court must assess and balance the effect of admitting the evidence on society’s confidence in the justice system having regard to: (1) the seriousness of the Charter-infringing state conduct, (2) the impact of the breach on the Charter-protected interests of the accused, and (3) society’s interest in the adjudication of the case on its merits.” [51] The Court elaborated that the first stage involved consideration of the Police or State conduct that infringed the Charter. In other cases, the Courts have said that the privacy interest in private dwelling or home is high. The Charter breach here is severe in that officers entered and searched the accused’s home without any authority to do so. [52] The Court elaborated that the second stage involved focus on the accused and how his or her interests were impacted by the breach. Again, the impact is large. Following their unlawful entrance, the worker gathered evidence, then apprehended and removed her children. [53] The Court elaborated that the third stage “asks whether the truth seeking function of the criminal trial process would be better served by admission of the evidence or by its exclusion.” The accused’s offence was a reaction to a very significant and provocative breach of her Charter rights. Her actions, in assaulting the Child Protection Worker, were not excusable or justifiable. However, the assault was minor in nature with no injury. As a result, in my view, the truth seeking function and the administration of justice are better served by exclusion of the evidence. When I look at all of these factors, I come to the conclusion that all the evidence obtained from and after the unlawful entry of the accused’s home should be excluded. ISSUE FOUR THE ACCUSED ACTIONS IN KICKING AT AND STRIKING JENNIFER BUCHANAN CONSTITUTED AN ASSAULT. WERE THESE ACTIONS JUSTIFIED ON THE BASIS OF DEFENCE OF PROPERTY OR DEFENCE OF THIRD PERSON? [54] Given my decision on the Charter issues, need not decide this issue. However, note that in the Krzychowiec decision, referred to by Mr. Wiebe, the Honourable Judge Gibson acquitted the accused on the basis that his use of force was justified defence of property and person. He noted that the actual force utilized by the accused was minimal. For these same reasons, would conclude that Ms. Bigsky used minimal force and the use of that minimal force was justified. [55] For all of the above mentioned reason, would exclude the evidence obtained after the unlawful entry into the accused’s apartment suite. Having done that, there is no evidence against the accused and I find her not guilty of both charges. [56] express my thanks to both counsel for their excellent presentation of very interesting case. Dated at the City of Moose Jaw, in the Province of Saskatchewan this 31 day of August 2016.",e_2016skpc106.txt,"HELD: The accused was found not guilty.
The court found that the accused’s s. 8 Charter rights were breached.
Pursuant to a Grant analysis, the court excluded the evidence obtained after the illegal entry of the accused’s home.
The court found that the accused had not consented to the entry by the officer and the complainant and it was therefore a warrantless search.
The officer did not have the lawful authority to enter the home on the basis of arresting the father as he was not in hot pursuit.
The complainant had not obtained a warrant under s. 13.1 of The Child and Family Services Act to enter the accused’s home and therefore had no lawful authority to enter the home.
There were no exigent circumstances to justify the search such as preventing the destruction of evidence as they already established that the person they sought was not in the house.
The unlawful entry and search of the accused’s home was a severe breach of the accused’s Charter rights.
The impact upon her was severe as the complainant gathered evidence and apprehended her children.
The accused’s assault on the complainant was minor in nature and although not excusable, her offence was a reaction to a significant breach of her rights.
The administration of justice was served by excluding the evidence."
