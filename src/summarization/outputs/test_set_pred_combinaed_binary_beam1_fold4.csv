3_2003skqb93.txt,"The company applied for an order granting court approval of a proposal made by its creditor pursuant to Part III of the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act. A former 28-year employee objected on the grounds pension plan members should be treated as a different class of creditor rather than under the unsecured creditor classification ascribed to them by the proposal; the indemnification of past directors under the terms of the proposal was inappropriately wide. He submitted the unfunded pension liabilities constitute trust funds pursuant to provincial pension legislation (the Pension Benefits Act s.43(3)) and as such the pension fund claimants are entitled to preferred or secured creditor status. HELD: The Proposal was accepted.  1)Provincially created statutory trusts such as the one created by the Pensions Benefits Act are not recognized in bankruptcy including Proposals submitted under the BIA. The Trustee and the company acted appropriately in identifying the nature and status of the pensioners' claims. Although it might have reflected the status of his claim against the employer outside the BIA, the specific objection did not constitute a valid ground of legal objection to the Proposal. 2)The Proposal met the statutory and judicial criteria for acceptance by the Court. The Court takes into account the interests of the debtor, general body of creditors and the public at large in maintaining the integrity of the bankruptcy legislation. Of the 15 employees in the same position, 12 voted in favour of the proposal, 2 failed to file proofs of their claims; 89 percent of all creditors voted in favour of acceptance.  3)Each party was to assume their own costs of the hearing.","The applicant obtained an order granting court approval of a proposal made by it to its creditor pursuant to Part III of Division I of the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act. The applicant opposed the court approval on the basis that members of the employee pension plan who have been classified unsecured creditors (by virtue of the Company's indebtedness for the unfunded portion of their pension plans) should be reclassified in some other category of creditor. The Trustee made an application to the Registrar in Bankrupty for court approval. The defendant brought this application on behalf of an employee who had proven claims against the proposal. At the December meeting of creditors, approximately 93 percent of the creditors who had shown claims voted in favour of accepting the proposal; 12 voted in favor of the proposal, 2 opposed it, 1 opposed it and 1 opposed its application. The proposed amended para. 9.1 of the proposed proposed was consistent with the provisions of ss. 50(13) of the BIA and it was ordered accordingly. The plaintiff's objections were raised primarily on the ground that the proposal was too widely cast and inappropriate. The court was of the view that an employer's indebtednesses to an employee pension plans does give the pensioners preferred creditor status by virtue of s. 43(3) of The Pension Benefits Act, 1992. Absent the application of the provisions in the provisions the provisions for the Bia to an employer, it is clear that an employers' indebtedness to an employees pension plan does give them preferred creditorstatus by virtue OF s.43(3). The plaintiff has raised these concerns and submitted his proposal to the court. The Court authorized the amendment of the proposal as set out in the revised para. of the draft order filed upon this application pursuant to Rule 92 of the Board of Inquiry. The draft order was amended to reflect the amendment to para.9.1. The proposal was also ordered to be consistent with ss.50(13). HELD: The court ordered the amendment in the proposed to para 9. 1 of the Proposal to be inconsistent with ss 50(12) of BIA. 1) The court is of the opinion that the terms of the applicant's proposal are not reasonable or are not calculated to benefit the general body of creditors. The creditor classifications ascribed to them by the applicant are described as trust funds pursuant to provincial pensions legislation (s. 43/3) and the Pension Benefits act as a 'trust fund'), and 2) that the indemnification of past directors and"

The trial judge concluded on the evidence that the blood alcohol level at the time of the offence was different from the time of the offence, and found that the Crown could not rely on the presumption of identity. He ruled, however, that they could rely on the presumption of accuracy, and placed an onus on the appellant to raise a reasonable doubt on the whole of the evidence. The appellant appealed. Allowing the appeal and ordering a new trial, that the trial judge committed a fundamental error of law by ruling that when the Crown is forced to rely on the balance of the evidence, the accused must raise a reasonable doubt, a burden that clearly remains on the Crown.","This was an application for leave to appeal from a decision in the Supreme Court of Canada dismissing an appeal from the appellant's conviction under s. 253(b) of the Criminal Code. The Crown adduced evidence of breathalyzer readings of 110 and 120 milligrams. The appellant testified that he consumed five pints of beer during the course of the afternoon, the last shortly before being stopped by the police. In cross-examination the expert was asked to relate the readings shown by the tests to the alcohol consumed by the appellant. He stated that the readings were not consistent with the evidence of consumption given by the accused. The trial judge concluded that the blood alcohol level at the time of the test was different from the time the offence took place. The appeal was allowed and a new trial ordered."
c_2009skpc31.txt,"The accused, Chisum Log Homes and its sole director Gary Varga, are charged with operating a processing facility without a licence contrary to s. 18.1(1) of The Forest Resources Management Act. The accused corporation assembles log home packages. The packages are sold to customers across Canada. The accused corporation buys wood from area operators such as L&amp;M to be used in its packages. L&amp;M through its contractor P&amp;E, harvest wood from the forest and sell the wood to pulp mills, saw mills and other customers such as the accused. These area operators and their contractors have Forest Management Agreements and Forest Product Processing Facility Licences. In August and September 2007, the area operator L&amp;M delivered logs to the accused. The accused took additional steps to prepare the logs for inclusion in their log home packages which they sold. The accused does not have a Forest Product Processing Facility Licence. The issue in this case is whether the Crown has shown that the accused requires such a licence. HELD: 1) The definition of 'manufacture' in the Act is extremely broad as it says, 'means any step taken'. Given this definition is not difficult to find based on the evidence presented that the steps taken by the contractor in cutting the logs is more than simply harvesting as it is defined in the legislation. See R. v. Provincial Forest Products, 2000 SKQB 371. 2) The Court is satisfied that the accused corporation, Chisum, took steps to manufacture the forest product for the log home market. Steps such as debarking were steps taken in the manufacture of a forest product for market.  3) Given the wide definition it is the Court's view that many facilities, including a retail lumberyard, could be captured within the definition. Given the stated purpose of the Act, it is appropriate that the requirement for a Processing Facility Licence be restricted so that it does not apply to every entity that manufactures a forest product. 4) The processes Chisum is involved in encompass the substantial conversion of the forest product into logs to be used in the log home industry. The process is not insignificant, nor is it a process which is removed from the sustainable use of forest lands and the need to maintain and enhance the health of forest lands. The Court concludes that Chisum was required to have a Processing Facility Licence. 5) Pursuant to s. 81 of the Act, Gary Varga, as President of Chisum, is also guilty of violating s. 18.1 of the Act.","The defendant, Chisum Log Homes and Lumber Ltd., was charged with operating a processing facility without a licence contrary to s. 18.1(1) of The Forest Resources Management Act, F-19.1. The defendant was the President and sole Director of Chisums. The logs were harvested from the forest in the Weyakwin district north of Prince Albert. The wood is harvested from Provincial Crown lands. The logging is then processed into logs to be used in the log home industry. The defence argued that the logs were from the Forest Resources management Act and not from private land. The issue in this case was whether the Crown has shown that ChisUM requires a Forest Product Processing Facility Licence. HELD: 1) The defendant had a processing Facility LicENCE issued by the Ministry of Environment pursuant to The Forest Resource Management Act. 2) The Court found that Chisesum Log did not require a processing licence. 3) The evidence was conclusive that the defendant was involved in the manufacture of forest product for the loghome industry. 4) The court found that the defendants were found guilty of violating s. 17.1 of TheForest Resources Management act, F19.2. 5) The requirement for a processing license was restricted so that it did not apply to every entity that manufactures forest product. The process used by the defendant in P-1 encompassed the substantial conversion of the forest product into logs that were used in log home production. The Process was not an insignificant process, nor was it removed from the sustainable use of forest lands and the need to maintain and enhance the health of forest land."

He applied under the Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy Act for certain information concerning these allegations. The FOIPOP Privacy Coordinator denied access and the applicant appealed. Appeal allowed; in all cases where the claimants had signed release forms the applicant is to be supplied with information as to the number and nature of allegations made against him and the names of the complainants; the specific dates and times of all allegations made against him; the evidence collected in relation to the investigations undertaken as a result of the allegations; the number and dollar amount of payouts made for actions attributable only to the applicant; and information as to whether any of the allegations leveled were dismissed or unproven. The appeal should proceed as an appeal de novo. The applicant was not seeking information from R.C.M.P. files and the release of information which the police had passed on to the Department of Justice would not harm law enforcement as the information was compiled by the Province for its own purposes. The complainants had been required to execute releases whereby the information supplied could be used for various specified purposes, all of which potentially involved public disclosure or disclosure to the applicant. Law enforcement protection was lost when a release was obtained from the complainants and the information was passed to the Province. There was no unreasonable invasion of the claimants' privacy. The applicant was entitled to know what he had been accused of and should have the right to correct the record.","The appellant had made an application pursuant to the provisions of the Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy Act for information on the Department of Justice's counter-terrorism program. The Justice Minister had announced an investigation into institutional abuse in youth institutions. The report of the Stratton report in 1995 was highly publicized and the public interest was highly concentrated. The Department of justice had extensive information about the alleged abuse and had retained Facts-Probe Inc., which had obtained statements from former residents of the institutions. In 1998, the Departmentof Justice retained the defendant's company, Facts-probe Inc. to conduct further interviews to obtain information for employee discipline, possible criminal prosecution and ultimately to process insurance claims. In 1996, the defendant was named as and accused of being an abuser. In 1997, the Justice Minister appointed a review officer, who was responsible for overseeing the creation and management of the Nova Scotia Sexual and Sexual Abuse Compensation Program. In 1999, the former Chief Superintendent of the school for boys, who had been involved in the investigation of the allegations of abuse, was appointed as the ADR coordinator. In the course of the investigation, the officer was given specific recommendations regarding the way the applicants should be compensated, the type of abuse alleged, the frequency of the abuse alleged and the identity of those accused were all changed. In 2001, the Acting Chief Superintendent was appointed under the direction of the Attorney General. In his role as ADR Coordinator, the degree to which the various roles of the Department had been meshed and interchangeable was clearly set forth in paras. 11-33 of the affidavit of the Acting Director of the Justice Department. The degree towhich the various functions of the Departments of Justice and the Department were meshed, including the creation, management and monitoring of the ADRs, became clear in 1998 with the appointment of the first ADR director. In 2002, the second ADR Director was appointed by the Attorney-General. In October of 1998, he was appointed the director of the Enforcement and Protection Services Office. In January of 1999, he appointed the Acting Superintendent of Education, who would oversee the creation of the new ADR process. In May of 1999 he was reappointed as the director. He was given the task of developing the new process which would allow the ADDR director to review and modify the existing process. He reviewed the entire process and made recommendations to the inspector general, the Attorney general and the Nova Scotian Attorney General, among others.

b_2013skqb407.txt,"HELD: The Court held that the cause of the damage was high humidity in the building caused by water leaking into it from the roof. The failure of the tenant to maintain the floor caused approximately 25 percent of the damage to the floor. The estimated span for the flooring was 20 years. As the lease was in good standing at present and would expire in 2018, the age of the floor at that time would be 17 years. The Court awarded to the landlord the amount of $836, which was 25 percent of 3/20 of the damages claimed. The business loss claimed by the tenant was $4,800. Thus the net setoff owing by the landlord to the tenant was $4,800 less $836. The defendant tenant was awarded costs of the three-day trial of $2,500.","The tenant sued its landlord for damages for failing to clean, wax and polish the vinyl tile floor in the building, thereby permitting moisture to penetrate between and underneath the tiles resulting in lifting and cracking. The tenant also claimed economic interference. HELD: The tenant was awarded judgment against the landlord in the amount of $6,464 plus $2,500 for arrears of costs. 1)The floor had a history of cracking and had been extensively mowed down in recent years. The tiles on the ceiling and floor had been removed for years. 2)The ceiling had a grade of cracking which could be explained by normal wear and tear. 3)The paint job was not properly installed. The floor was not sufficiently polished to prevent water from entering the building. 4)The tenant was contributorily negligent to the extent of 25% of the damage. The evidence showed excessive moisture and high humidity in the buildings, causing instability and cracking of the vinyl floor tiles. The tenants never expressed any concern about the floor tiles at that time. The landlord waxed and polished the floor on two occasions only in October 2011. 5)The evidence does show that a part, but only a part of the moisture entering into the subfloor was due to the negligence of the tenant in failing to properly maintain the floor. Leaking of water through the ceiling, ceiling, exterior walls and into the basement did necessitate closure of the restaurant for several days. 6)The tenants gave Notice of Intention to Renew the Lease to the landlord. The tenancy is entitled to renew the lease for another term for another year. 7)The landlord is responsible for 17% of all the damage resulting from the tenant's negligence. The lease is valid for five years. Both the landlord and tenant have a common law right to make reasonable repairs. Both parties have common sense and common sense. 8)The tenancy is also entitled to costs for the three day trial of $2.500 inclusive of taxable costs. 9)The lease is not valid for three years. 10)The liability is not proven by the landlord to the tenant. 11)The damage is $22,281 and the tenant is contributorily responsible to the amount. 12)The non-compliance with the lease is a tortious inference by the tenant which is not supported by the lease.

He applied to vary the order to correspond to the alleged agreement. The Wife denied any agreement to reduce the original order and sought judgment for arrears in the amount of $55,000.00. HELD: On a review of all material filed, the Court concluded that it was not possible to resolve the matter summarily. The Court directed a trial of the issues between the parties.","FIAT. The applicant applied for an order varying the support provisions of a 1989 judgment. He sought an order requiring a total payment of $570.75 per month for both children. The wife had recently taken full time employment and the applicant sought to have her employment terminated. An agreement was reached in 1989 in accordance with paragraph 2(c) of the 1989 judgment reducing maintenance from $1,200 per month to $500 per month. Further agreement was made increasing the monthly maintenance to $554.13 and further increasing the maintenance in 1994. The husband sought to increase the monthly hockey expenses and an annual return air fare of approximately $2,200 in order to exercise his right to exercise access to his children. HELD: 1)The husband was to pay $50 per month directly to the children as allowance, contributes approximately $1 per month direct to the boys as allowance and pays annual return fares of approximately$2,600 in order that he may exercise access with his children for free. 2)The wife was to retain all medical, dental, drug and other health benefit plans currently available through his employment with General Motors. 3)The court ordered a trial of the issue."
b_2000skqb420.txt,"FIAT. An application for summary judgment under Part Forty. In issue was whether a solicitor is bound by an undertaking to protect an expert witness for its professional fees. The defendant solicitor, who represented several farmers and farming companies in suits brought against Saskatchewan Crop Insurance Corporation on a contingency fee basis, confirmed in writing in 1993 that his office would undertake to protect the plaintiff consultants for their fees and disbursements and to pay interest at a rate of 12% per annum. The plaintiff was hired to provide technical evidence as to crop losses and damages the farmers claimed as a result of actions of SCIC. When all of the claims were dismissed at trial, the solicitor rejected the plaintiff's demand for payment arguing he had no obligation to pay as the farmers' actions had not resulted in the recovery of any monies. The plaintiff sued the solicitor in 1997 for professional fees of $37,604.33. The plaintiff objected to certain portions of the defendant's affidavit. HELD: The plaintiff was awarded $37,604.33 plus interest at 12% per annum as provided for in the undertaking, and costs of the action.  1)The plaintiff commenced its action under the general rules but amended its claim without objection to continue under the Simplified Procedure. 2)Portions of the defendant's affidavit were struck as being hearsay and opinion or related to matters immaterial to the proceeding.  3)The applicant's admissions at discovery did not confirm the interpretation of the undertaking set out in the statement of defence. It was obvious the plaintiff's officer recognized the farmers were intending to fund their costs from a settlement or judgment and that disbursements, including the costs of any expert's reports commissioned by them or the defendant, would be paid by his clients regardless of the outcome of the suits. 4)The only conclusion that could be drawn was that defendant guaranteed payment of the applicant's account regardless of the outcome of their mutual client's actions. A solicitor is presumed to know the cannons of the Law Society including c.XVI, comm.10 of the Code of Professional Conduct with respect to undertakings. The solicitor's undertaking in 1993 was absolutely clear. The addition of the word 'protect' put the question beyond doubt. His inquiry in 1997 made it clear the defendant recognized his responsibility and was hoping for some resolution of the applicant's account.","FIAT. The plaintiff was hired to provide technical evidence as to crop losses and damages the plaintiffs claimed resulted from the actions of the defendant. The defendant was employed by the farmers on contingency basis, the understanding being that the clients would pay the defendant's disbursements in any event. The plaintiffs' action did not settle. They proceeded, finally, to trial and dismissed all of the claims dismissed. The court held that a solicitor bound by an undertaking to protect an expert witness for its professional fees would receive commission on any outstanding claim. The portions of the affidavit that were objected to were portions of an action dated March 5, 1993. The judge reviewed the history of the examination for discovery and determined that the respondent guaranteed the payment of the applicant's account regardless of the outcome of their mutual client's actions. The only conclusion that can be drawn from the facts is that the defendant guaranteed the Payment of the Applicant's account Regardless of the outcomes of their Mutual Client's actions, the trial will not likely occupy more than a day and the parties will have to utilize all of their General Rules including any interim steps."

Damages were set as follows: impairment to hearing in left ear assessed at $8500, damage to left knee assessed at $2500. Exacerbation of a pre-existing back condition which produced consequences in the severe range was assessed at $31,500.","The plaintiff suffered a concussion, hearing loss, neck injury and knee injury when he was hit by a motor vehicle.

The impact of the children’s deaths was devastating on their families. The accused was a professional driver and capable of exercising more skill and vigilance, especially when he was operating a semi-trailer truck in a construction zone.

His victims' names were seared seared in the brain as he drove through a construction zone. The Court was satisfied that his offences were the result of his inattention for whatever reason. The defendant's unlawful conduct must be denounced. The evidence showed that the defendant failed to recognize stopped vehicles, recognize stopped motor vehicles, allow sufficient distance to bring his vehicle to a safe stop and did not allow sufficient time to bring the vehicle to safe stop before colliding with the third vehicle. The impact on the third victim was severe and his injuries were survivable.

The 1997 interim order awarded joint custody with the primary residence with the mother and reasonable access to the father including alternating weekends, reasonable telephone access and equal sharing of holidays. The father initially failed to pay child support as ordered then paid $250 per month rather than the $424.72 ordered. The parties no longer communicated directly with each other except by e-mail so that there was a record. HELD: 1)It was in the best interests of the children that their primary residence be with their mother. She had demonstrated greater flexibility and sensitivity to their needs. The father was granted access two weekends out of every three and additional time as they may agree upon. Although both were very good parents the parties had not demonstrated an ability to co-parent effectively as illustrated by their communication problems. The father's access initially went beyond the minimum required by the interim order. He failed to make support payments as ordered. The father was to pay child support of $449. Pursuant to s.7 of the Federal Child Support Guidelines he was to pay 54% of the net cost of child care expenses incurred as a result of the mother's employment and for health related expenses in excess of $100 of the insurance reimbursement upon production of receipts.  2)The automobile constituted matrimonial property and was valued at $200. 3)Either could speak to costs.","The parties were married for seven years and had two children, aged six and seven years. During their married life the petitioner was employed outside of the home and played a substantial role in the day-to-day care of the children.

The paternal grandparents were to care for the children for one day each week. 4)The parties had been very good parents. It was unfortunate that they could not demonstrate an ability to co-parent more effectively.

The plaintiff discovered that one of the defendants had shares being held at the defendants' solicitor's office and instructions were given to the sheriff to seize and sell the shares. The sheriff attended to seize the shares but the defendants' lawyer objected. At issue was whether the legal office could refuse to hand over the shares to the sheriff pursuant to a solicitor's lien and whether the shares were exempt from seizure pursuant to the Saskatchewan Farm Security Act. HELD: The law firm was ordered to produce and deliver to the sheriff the shares of the defendant in the third corporation; costs were fixed at $750. 1) The right of the law office to refuse to produce and deliver the shares to the sheriff had not been made out and court process was thwarted. There was no evidence to determine the amount owing from the defendant or the third corporation for legal work; a valid solicitor's lien was not demonstrated. 2) There is a difference between the seizure and sale of shares in a company and the seizure and sale of a piece of farmland and the argument that the Executions Act or the Saskatchewan Farm Security Act restricts the seizure fails.,"FIAT: The applicant seeks an order from the court requiring the legal office of the sheriff to produce to the sheriff of the Judicial Centre of Prince Albert, the shares owned by Jensen in Jen-Sim Cattle Co. Ltd. pursuant to the June 5, 2001 writ of execution. The solicitor's lien arises out of s. 66(3) of The Legal Profession Act. The applicant claims a solicitor's Lien against the shares in question. The sheriff has the power to seize shares pursuant to The Executions Act. Upon seizure, the plaintiff has the right to sell the shares that he holds in the company. HELD: 1) The sheriff is unable to enforce the writ due to the position taken by the applicants. The court ordered the law firm to produce and deliver the shares to the court.  2) The court found that the end result of the seizure and sale of the shares will be sale of farm lands. That leave of the court must be obtained. 3) The applicant's claim against the solicitor's share is not valid. The application to compel the sheriff's production of the documents is dismissed. 4) The application for a lien is not made out. The general rule that a solicitor’s lien can be raised against all persons claiming through the client must be qualified by consideration of whom the rights accruing from the lien are claimed. There is no such restriction in The Execution Act nor in The Saskatchewan Farm Security Act. There are two Alberta decisions that suggest that a lawyer’ll voluntarily give up his shares to a sheriff to obtain production and delivery of documents. 5) The portion of the affidavit that the applicant gave to the Sheriff that was uncontroverted indicates that the solicitor was not the owner of the common shares in issue and that he was not required to deliver the documents. The affidavit was silent in that regard. 6) The judge concluded that the application to force the sheriff not to produce the shares was not valid and that the only claim against his shares within the company was the solicitor”s liens. The defendant was granted the costs of this application."
c_2002nssc30.txt,"The borrower in a mortgage foreclosure action counterclaimed against the lender and joined the insurer of the mortgage and experts he had retained for advice in the development on the basis of negligent misrepresentation. During discovery of the borrower's former solicitor it was revealed that the solicitor may have given the borrower a warning that the financing arranged was inadequate. No privilege was claimed during the discovery process. The defendant brought an application for production of the solicitor's files and a copy of the borrower's employer and bank records intended to show his familiarity with business and financial affairs. Application allowed in part; solicitor's files with respect to terms of solicitor's retainer and non-legal advice or services are to be produced; employer's and banker's records not to be produced. The claim of negligent misrepresentation raised the question of reliance; evidence of knowledge would go to the borrower's state of mind and the solicitor's warning, if timely, would be relevant. The conduct of the borrower's present counsel in making no objection at the discovery amounted to waiver. There were no special circumstances existing with respect to the employer's and bank's records; the applicant made no effort to obtain the records until too late and the documents would have little, if any, relevance.","The plaintiff was a party to a mortgage foreclosure commenced against the defendants. The defendants had planned to insure the mortgage with the federal government through its mortgage insurance program and retained the services of a Kentville lawyer. When the plaintiff fell into arrears during construction of the complex, the defendants made an application for further disclosure. The plaintiff counterclaimed for breach of contract, breach of fiduciary duty and for negligence. The defendant defended the action on various grounds, counterclaimed against the plaintiff for breach and for breachof contract, and counterclaimed in various other circumstances. The parties appeared before Associate Chief Justice MacDonald at an appearance day and the discovery evidence was obtained. The documents sought were found to be of the plaintiff's legal representation. The plaintiffs counterclaim alleged negligence by the defendants in approving the calculations of the mortgage. The court found that the plaintiff had expressly not waived the privilege. The pleadings submitted to the court were found not to be privileged. The applicant's counterclaim raised the question of whether the defendants had ever relied upon the plaintiff as a neighbour. The respondent's counter claim alleged negligence based upon the decisions of the defendants regarding the mortgage and the fact that the calculations were made in secret. The Court concluded that the applicant had not waived his privilege by making the application for the documents. The claim was not based on negligence but rather on a claim by the plaintiff that the defendants were negligent in failing to disclose certain information about the plaintiff. The admission of the documents would not have been grounds to exclude the plaintiff from the defence and counterclaim."

HELD: The chamber's judge was in error in striking out portions of the statement of defence and counter-claim. The error consists of a failure to address the merits of the application. The Court of Appeal opted to deal with the merits of the application themselves, rather than remitting the matter back to Queen's Bench. While the allegation of fraud might have been pleaded more explicitly, the pleading is nevertheless sufficient to answer the requirements of QB Rule 173. The appellants should have been given an opportunity to amend their pleadings. The appeal was allowed and the application to strike was dismissed without prejudice to respondent's right to seek further particulars.",The court held that the order made by the chamber judge striking major portions of the statement of defence and counterclaim was in error. The error consisted of a failure to address the merits of the application brought by the applicant to strike the impugned portions of these pleadings. HELD: Appeal allowed. The application to strike was dismissed without order for costs in favour of the applicant.

The appellant's loss consisted of its inability to continue to obtain Mato products and sell them to its customers at a profit.

The requested relief cannot be granted unless the court has authority to order that a subdivision of land be effected outside the requirements of The Planning and Development Act. HELD: 1) Even if this was a proper case for the making of a vesting order, there is a further difficulty presented by the fact that the applicant school division is asking the court to order that a subdivision be effected, as a pre-condition to the vesting order. Whether under the former legislation or the present, the court is not free to subvert the statutory requirements in the exercise of its authority to make vesting orders. The court reviewed the relevant caselaw. 2) While the court is precluded from directing the Registrar to effect a subdivision that is prohibited by the legislation, a resolution of the matter could be achieved if, for example, after adjudicating on all the rights and obligations at issue, the Court was prepared to direct that the pre-conditions to subdivision approval be met by a party to the proceedings. Once the proposed subdivision meets the required standards and is approved, then a vesting order can be made in the appropriate circumstances under the provisions of s. 6.5 of The Land Titles Conversion Facilitation Regulations, or under The Improvements Under Mistake of Title Act. The court reviewed the applicable caselaw. 3) The court requested that further written submissions be provided by the parties on the matter of directing a trial of the issues.","The applicant school division asks for a vesting order regarding a presently unsubdivided parcel of land owned by the respondent. The respondent argues that the School Division sold the land to the applicants in the belief it was selling an existing parcel of property which purported to be the old St. Mary's School site. The property never legally existed as a separate parcel, and was in fact located within a quarter section owned by one of the respondent's former landowners. The applicant argues that under the former legislation, the Court was not free to subvert the statutory requirements in the exercise of its authority to make vesting orders. HELD: The application is allowed. The vesting agreement is lapse and the matter is directed to the Court. 1) Even if the applicant's application was a proper case for the making of a vestencing order, there are some distinguishing features. The original transaction appeared to have been concluded in an effort to avoid compliance with the provisions of the Planning and Development Act, 1983 where such is a precondition to the making thereof. The application was tantamount to a judicially ordered partition of land to avoid the effect of legislation. The Court was obliged to prevent such wholesale frustration of the legislature's objects. 2) While the Court is precluded from directing the Registrar to effect a subdivision that is prohibited by the legislation, resolution of the matter could be achieved if, for example, after adjudicating on all the rights and obligations in issue, the court could was asked to order the Registrar not to exercise the duty imposed by the Act. 3) The application for a conditional vesting of order is dismissed. 4) The Court is not free from subverting the statutory rules in the exercising of its delegated authority to grant a vestuating order. The applications are allowed within the meaning of s. 87 of the Act and s. 134 of the PDA. The Planning and development Act,1983 requires a certificate of approval from the approving authority respecting the subdivision. The provisions of an agreement must, of necessity, be considered merged in conveyance. This decision was overturned on appeal at (1993), 113 Sask. R. 151 (C.A.) (Q.B.) (which was a review of the provisions in the Act). 5) The School Division is not responsible for ordering the issuance of a subdivision order.

At issue was whether the Section D provisions of the deceased's insurance policy extended to cover the plaintiff. The deceased's insurance policy does not provide coverage to the plaintiff as the emotional harm suffered by her was simply too remote from the obligations contemplated by the contracting parties.","The plaintiff was killed when her automobile was struck from behind by a vehicle. She commenced this action to recover damages for nervous shock, arguing that since she was not physically injured, she was entitled to recover for nervous shocks. The defendant denied this claim, arguing on the basis that since the plaintiff was not a person insured under the contract, she wasn't entitled to the benefit of nervous shock. The plaintiff settled her claim for nervous stress and claimed Section D benefits. The Facility Association defended the policy, claiming that since it was an uninsured policy, the plaintiff's claim was not the result. The Court concluded that such was not The plaintiff's result, as the emotional harm suffered was simply too remote from the obligations contemplated by the contracting parties. Section D is not an insurance policy designed to protect a person from the physical injury or death of a motor vehicle or driver.

HELD: It is in the interest of justice to order an assessment. The bills were issued in two separate matters. In the first matter, the final bill was rendered and the applicant had a lengthy opportunity to raise the issue. There will be no extension of time for the first bill. The second bill is different in that the applicant disputed the amount of the bill when he first received it. He was advised that the bill would be adjusted. An initial adjustment was made and when still not satisfied, ongoing discussions about the bill continued. The Court held that the last document received by the applicant was not the final bill as it was still subject to change. In this case, the lawyer has been paid from monies held in trust for the client, the time being abridged is relatively short and neither party has alleged that any prejudice would result.","HELD: The court found that the application was dismissed. The court ordered an order pursuant to s. 67 of The Legal Profession Act, 1990 for an assessment of the applicant’s legal bills for services rendered to him by the respondent.

The evidence before the Court was that the last bill rendered by the applicant was from September 2006 and the last one was May 2007. The defendant did not state that the bill was final but rather stated that it could be subject to further adjustments. The outstanding amount on the BASF account was $9,088.56. The applicant received settlement proceeds of $15,000. The Court was not satisfied that the defendant’ s. 5 bill was inappropriate and excessive.

b_2011nsca39.txt,"The police responded to a call from a woman identified as the defendant's girlfriend's mother to the effect that her daughter was being abused. Initially unable to locate the residence, they spoke to the girlfriend on the phone, who advised them that she was fine and did not require the police. They nevertheless continued to the residence, where they heard a scream from inside. Knowing that the defendant was a suspected drug dealer and potentially violent, they demanded entry into the home. The daughter opened the door and told them everything was fine, there had been no assault and she had simply wanted a ride home. From where they entered, the officers could see a person lying down in the bedroom. They approached the man, searched him for officer safety and then conducted a warrantless search to locate any other occupants. During the search, certain items were noted that caused them to obtain a search warrant, following which drugs were found. The defendant's argument that the search was illegal was unsuccessful as the court found that, in these particular circumstances, the police had a responsibility to enter the home without a warrant, do a pat down search of the accused and search for other occupants. Once drugs were seen in plain view, they proceeded to obtain a search warrant. Judicial notice was taken of the fact that complainants in domestic situations often recant due to threats of coercion by their partners. The defendant appealed. Appeal allowed; conviction set aside; although a violation of the defendant's Charter rights had occurred, the record was insufficient for this court to engage in a s. 24(2) analysis. Although it was reasonable, in the circumstances, for the police to search for the girl, go to the defendant's home and not simply leave once she told them she was fine, the trial judge erred in failing to consider alternatives short of police entry (such as conferring with the girl after they had her step outside and close the door) and the search of the home, without a warrant. Police authority to investigate such a call includes locating the alleged victim and determining if their assistance is required, but, without more, does not extend to the entry or search of the premises.","The accused was convicted of drug offences after he and his girlfriend were in a fight. The police entered the accused's home and found a person lying on the bed and in a small room with a door that was not open. The accused was later charged with possession of marijuana. The evidence heard on his Charter application was considered in the trial proper along with additional evidence obtained pursuant to the warrant. The Court found that the warrantless entry and search of the accused’s home by the police was justified. The trial judge found that police were justified in checking the home and finding that there was no problem inside. The issue was whether the warrantlessness entry and searching by the RCMP was a violation of s. 8 Charter rights. HELD: The Court held that the police were acting in the course of their duty to protect life and prevent injury when they forcibly entered the residence. The unauthorized presence of state agents such as the police constitutes an invasion of that privacy. The court concluded that the accused was guilty of several drug offences, including possession of a weapon. The search of his home was justified, as it was within the police’S 8 Charter right against unreasonable search and seizure. The fact that the call which triggered the police response was not made by the alleged victim or from his home is not material."

The tenant received notice of the hearing late on Friday when the hearing was set for Tuesday morning. She immediately requested an adjournment as she was unable to attend personally. The tenant also submits that the notice failed to disclose a significant aspect of the complaint, namely the conduct of her boyfriend. HELD: Appeal allowed and the matter returned to the Director to schedule a new hearing with at least 7 days clear notice to be given of the date. The decision to grant an adjournment is inherently discretionary and should be made with a view to what is necessary to ensure justice is done between the parties. This should include consideration of the complexity of the issues, the tenant's personal circumstances affecting her ability to attend in person on short notice and any prejudice to the landlord if the request is granted. There is no evidence that any of this was considered by the Hearing Officer. Three days (including a weekend) is not sufficient time to make arrangements and prepare for any hearing. It is clear that the tenant took the matter seriously and spent considerable time preparing written responses to the landlord's claim as she knew it to be. On the issue of sufficiency of the Notice, the Court found that while the Notice outlined many issues, it failed to disclose issues relating to her boyfriend. Since these issues were only discussed at the hearing the tenant was unable to attend she was not able to advise in person or in writing that her boyfriend was now incarcerated and the issue resolved. The Hearing Officer, in accepting evidence from the landlord about the boyfriend when neither the Hearing notice nor the landlord's complaint contained notice of it, breached the rule of natural justice and due process. The reasonableness standard of review applies here.","The tenant appeals from the decision of the Hearing Officer granting the landlord possession of her rental premises.

HELD: The tenant's request for an adjournment was not properly considered by the Hearing officer. The tenant was not advised of the reasons for the short notice she received and there was no other evidence that the Hearing Office considered the tenant's application for adjournment or dealt with it fairly or reasonably in the circumstances. The failure to properly consider and consider the tenant’s request for adjournments was unreasonable and inconsistent with the principle of access to justice that must guide judges and administrative tribunals alike in the conduct of their hearings.

Awarding the plaintiff $285,000 out of the $3 million estate, that under the Testator's Family Maintenance Act the claimant need not show actual or urgent need or true dependency in order to succeed. To justify interference with a will a court must find a failure to provide proper maintenance and support and a moral claim to entitlement. The court must consider the magnitude of the estate, the circumstances of the claimant, the strength of his or her moral claim to a share in the estate, and the situation of others having claims upon the testator. This involves a very broad judicial discretion. Here, the plaintiff had established a strong moral claim and a failure to provide proper maintenance.","The plaintiff and his wife, who claimed to be the deceased's only surviving child, had been living in India for 14 years.

The parties had each made a separate claim for relief under the Testators' Family Maintenance Act and the Matrimonial Property Act. The cause of death was mixed drug overdose. The evidence led in both respects to the continuing claims for relief sought by the plaintiff. The present-day testamentary capacity of the deceased was in no way affected by the defendant's claim.

4_2004skqb19.txt,"The applicant applied by originating motion for a declaration that the respondents, Zurich and Sovereign, were obligated to pay a proportionate share of defence costs to defend a claim brought against the applicant. The underlying action claims damages from the applicant with respect to the construction of a hog barn. The applicant was the general contractor. Each of the respondents issued a comprehensive general liability policy to the applicant. The law is clear that the pleadings determine whether or not the respondents have a duty to defend. If the claim alleges a state of facts, which would fall within the coverage provided by the policy, the obligation of the insurer to defend is triggered. The Court reviewed the claim and concluded that the true nature of the claim was that the applicant failed in its contractual duty to construct and deliver a hog barn suitable for the purposes intended. HELD: The application was dismissed with costs.  1) It is a fundamental principle of insurance law that a comprehensive general liability policy is not intended to be a means for a contractor to cover the expenses to correct its own faulty or defective workmanship. They are not performance bonds. 2) The claims in negligence are inseparable from the claims in contract and do not exist but for the contractual relationship. 3) The insuring agreement provided for the payment of all sums the applicant might become legally obligated to pay as compensatory damages because of property damage caused by an occurrence, which was defined to mean an accident. What is alleged in the underlying action was not an accident or occurrence. Further, the work/product exclusion clauses in the policies relieve the respondents from any duty to defend.","The applicant applies by originating a motion for a declaration that the respondents are obligated to pay a proportionate share of defence costs to defend a claim brought against them by Genex Swine Group Inc. (the 'underlying action'). The applicant takes the position that under the policies they issued they are not obligated to defend and to pay defence costs for the claims brought against the applicant in the underlying action. HELD: 1) The first premise for assessing whether an insurer's duty to defend has been triggered rests in the traditional 'pleadings rule'. Whether an insurer is bound to defend rests in a traditional 'pleadings' rule. Whether a claim could trigger indemnity is a three step process. 2) The mere fact that Genex alleges both negligence and breach of contract is of no moment sufficient to change the insurer's mind. 3) The second premise is to determine whether an insurers' duty to defence has been activated. The onus of establishing that the terms of the policy obligate the insurer to defend lies with the applicant. The applicant cannot change an intentional tort into a negligent one simply by choice of words or vice versa. 4) The third premise is that the pleadings determine whether or not the insurer has a duty to defending. It matters not whether Genex may or may not succeed in the action. 5) The on-going process is a 3 step one. The plaintiff cannot change the non-intentional torts of negligence and contract. The only requirement is to establish that the claim is not covered by reason of an exclusion under the policy. The fourth principle is summarized by the Supreme Court of Canada in Monenco Ltd. v. Commonwealth Insurance Co., 2001 SCC 49. 6) The starting premise for determining whether an insurance's duty is triggered rests on the traditional “pleadnings rule”. Whether an individual’s legal allegations are properly pleaded will not be determined simply by virtue of that onus shifts to the insurer. The liability is only where there is genuine ambiguity or doubt that the duty to protect must be resolved in favour of the insured."
1998canlii13585.txt,FIAT. Exclusive possesson and ownership of the matrimonial home was granted to the petitioner in May 1998. At the time of the trial they were leading separate lives but under one roof as neither would vacate the home. Given the respondent's age (77) the court did not want to specify a date that he had to move from the home. He had not left the home and the matter was scheduled to be heard June19/98. In the meantime a notice of appeal of the judgment was filed on behalf of the respondent. At issue was the interpretation of ss(1) and (4) of s15 of the Court of Appeal Rules. The respondent's counsel took the position that with the filing of the notice of appeal this court became functus. The petitioner argued the order for exclusive possession is an injunction and therefore is not stayed by the notice of appeal. Alternatively that the giving of directions as contemplated by the judgment itself would not constitute the taking of any 'execution of the judgment' or the taking of any 'further proceedings in the action' and therefore would not contravene Rule 15. HELD: All applications should be made to the Court of Appeal as the matter was now before that court. No case law could be found in support of either party. It was unnecessary to decide the issue as to whether Rule 15 operates to stay an order of exclusive possession.,"FIAT. The parties were married for over 25 years and were now senior citizens. The petitioner sought an order for exclusive possession of the matrimonial home. The court did not specify a date for the petitioner to move from the matrononial home; it was hoped that satisfactory alternate arrangements could be made within reasonable time to avoid the potential of the petitioner having to make an interim move to satisfy the time limit in a court order when his preferred accommodations might be available shortly thereafter. HELD: The application was dismissed. The respondent was given exclusive possession. 1)The issue resolved around the interpretation of two conflicting rules (1) and (4) of Rule 15 of the Court of Appeal. The issue as whether Rule 15 operates to stay an order of exclusive possession was raised in Young v. Young, 1986 CanLII 3216 (SK CA), R.F.L. (3d) 314, but not decided. Also found unnecessary to decide the issue. Although it may be arguable that in the circumstances of this case the giving of the requested directions would not be sufficient to ensure the petitioner was entitled to exclusive possession, it was expected that counsel would assist the parties in determining a reasonable time period for the respondent to move. 2)All applications to be made in the Court's Court of appeal should be directed to the petitioner. 3)All rules respecting the appeal of a judgment, whether it operates to remain an order in exclusive possession were raised inYoung v.Young, 1986CanLII 3316 ( SK CA), but not commented on. 4)The Court of Appeals issued a statement that it would continue to serve as a court of appeal until further proceedings were heard. 5)The application to quash the Rule 15 restraining order and to prevent the issuance of duplicate applications was dismissed as a result of the failure to act quickly enough. 6)The court could still proceed to provide the requested instructions."

That order had been made pursuant to s. 242 of The Planning and Development Act and required the respondent to comply with the zoning bylaw by desisting from operating an equipment storage yard on a parcel of land owned by him and to restore it to the condition it was in prior to his use of it. The respondent had purchased the land in 2009 and immediately began storing equipment and leaving junk cars and other materials on it. The applicant had tried to encourage the respondent’s voluntary cooperation with the bylaw but eventually issued the order. After the court granted the order, the respondent took no steps to comply with it and in August 2014, the applicant applied for an order declaring the respondent to be in contempt of court. The application was heard in September at which time the respondent submitted by affidavit that he had removed the old cars but believed that he was allowed to keep his equipment. He requested that he receive additional time. The respondent was given until December 2014 to comply with the order. At the hearing he deposed that he had spent a significant amount of time and money removing materials from the land and that he had found out from his counsel that his belief regarding the permitted use of the land was incorrect. Based on the appearance of the site, the applicant was not satisfied but agreed to adjourn the matter until May 2015 as nothing could be done during the winter. When the matter was reviewed in May, the respondent had removed more equipment but said that he was not able to move it all as he had no place to put the rest of it. The applicant requested that the court find the respondent in contempt and to impose appropriate penalties, authorize it to remove any remaining machinery and to add the costs of this removal and disposal to the taxes on the land and to make an order for solicitor-client costs in its favour. HELD: The respondent was found to be in contempt of court pursuant to Queen’s Bench rule 11-16(3) for his failure, without reasonable excuse, to comply with the terms of the May 2014 court order. The court authorized the applicant to remove and dispose of the equipment if the respondent had not done so within 30 days of the order issued. The court awarded solicitor-client costs to the applicant in the amount of $15,000 because of the respondent’s continued and unjustified failure to comply with the zoning bylaw. As the applicant might incur additional costs to remove the equipment, those costs would be added to the tax rolls of the property and become payable by the respondent if he had not purged his contempt within the allotted time.","The respondent was granted an order pursuant to s. 242 of The Planning and Development Act requiring him to comply with the orders made pursuant to the February 3, 2014 order. The respondent failed to comply and, despite significant efforts to comply, remained in contempt. The court requested further fines and costs be imposed, as well as solicitor/client costs. The applicant requested further adjournments to allow him additional time to comply. The Respondent applied for an order declaring him in contempt of court. HELD: The Court was satisfied that the respondent was in contempt and ordered to pay solicitor and client costs of $15,000.00. The Court ordered the respondent to pay the fines and solicitor/ client costs and provided an appropriate period of time to resolve the impure situation. The contempt application was adjourned to February 2, 2015, being the next closest date to comply the order. It is not unusual for there to be a genuine issue between the parties as to whether there has been substantial compliance with any given order. This is not such case. The choices made by the respondent have had significant financial implications for all ratepayers of the Rural Municipality. The RM has had to make a contempt application both to enforce the law and to vindicate the authority of the Court. The Chamber judge erred in interpreting the Siemens case as being a highhanded manner. The fact that the defendant had been in contempt proceedings for five years already did not disqualify him from being in contempt, but rather served a contempt order and caused a hardship on him. The defendant's conduct prior to the commencement of these proceedings may not generally warrant an award of solicitor and clients costs but, given the length of the proceedings and the fact that he had not participated in any serious compliance efforts, the Court was concerned that any additional financial sanction may be more akin to punishment and may cause severe hardship to the respondent."

In issue was the jurisdiction of the Deputy Rentalsman to impose an award on the appellant who was acting as a representative for the landlord and not in his own right and who had not received notice that he was to be a named party at a hearing where an award could be made against him and who was unable to prepare and present a defence on his own behalf.

8_2012skqb249.txt,"The accused was convicted of aggravated assault after stabbing another person several times in the mid-section. The Crown brought a dangerous offender application. The accused was 22 years old at the time of sentencing. His prior criminal record consisted of mostly youth convictions. The offender was a known member of an aboriginal gang. The evidence suggested he was somewhere in the middle of the gang hierarchy. The accused had professed some desire to leave the gang. He had written an article directed at other youth warning them of the pitfalls of gang affiliation. The article was published in a book distributed to at risk youth. The accused had looked into getting help to leave the gang, but admitted on the stand that he was not prepared to take steps to leave because he might need protection from the gang in the penitentiary. While incarcerated, he had gang drawings confiscated from him and he had been jumped by members of a rival gang while in custody. The accused had shown some initiative in taking anger management courses and had completed his GED while incarcerated. HELD: The offence was a serious personal injury offence within the meaning of s. 752 of the Criminal Code. The criminal record together with the evidence heard at the hearing establishes that when the accused has committed violent offences he has been under the influence of alcohol or drugs, under supervision by court orders in the community, has used a knife or had one in his possession and most of the offences were a result of the accused's affiliation with the Indian Posse gang. The Crown has established a pattern of repetitive behaviour within the meaning of s. 753(1)(a)(i). Dr. Holden assessed the accused and found him to be a high risk to re-offend violently. The Crown has also proven that the accused constitutes a threat to the life, safety, and physical or mental well-being of other persons as set out in s. 753(1)(a)(ii). The accused was declared a dangerous offender. However, the Court found that given the accused's youth, the fact that he had not had any of the intensive programming that is available in a federal institution and the fact that there was some chance the accused might leave the gang, a determinate sentence and long term supervision order would adequately protect the public. In imposing a determinate sentence, the Court also considered that the accused's acts of violence, with the exception of the predicate offence, had generally resulted in less than severe injuries to the victim and the accused had voluntarily taken some steps to address his issues while incarcerated. The accused was sentenced 6 years or 72 months in custody, less credit for remand, to be followed by a 9 year supervision order under s. 753.4(b).",The accused was found guilty of aggravated assault contrary to s. 268 of the Criminal Code and breach of an undertaking contrary to S. 145(3) of the Code. The Crown applied to have the accused declared a dangerous offender. The accused was convicted of aggravated sexual assault contraryto s. 267(1) and breach an undertaking (S. 145) of Code. HELD: The Court found the accused was a dangerous person and ordered him remanded for an assessment pursuant to s752.1 of the criminal Code. There was insufficient evidence to determine that the predicate offence was a serious personal injury offence within the meaning of s. 752 of the code. The Court ordered that the accused be sentenced to an indeterminate sentence. The evidence did not meet the statutory requirements of a dangerous offenders designation and the long-term offender designation was the appropriate finding. The offences were found to be substantially or pathologically intractable.

It also applied for an order giving directions respecting the exercise of the rights of the secured party with the prior interest. At issue is what is meant by 'possession' in s.34(2)(a) and when Lake Air obtained possession or constructive possession of the trailers. HELD: The application was allowed with costs from Humboldt.  1)The parties filed an agreed statement of facts and focused on the priority issue as if the application had been brought under s.66. 2)'Constructive possession' means possession of the collateral by 'another person at the request of the debtor' as set out in s.34(2)(a). What constitutes 'possession' of collateral by the debtor within s.34(2)(a) was in dispute. Unless the property qualifies as 'collateral' a person cannot possess it as a 'debtor' within the meaning of the priority section. 3)The case law in Saskatchewan has interpreted 'possession' to constitute more than mere physical possession. Sections 22 and 34(2) of the new Act are essentially unchanged except for the addition of the constructive possession. S.22(2) restricts the scope of constructive possession somewhat but it applies only to s.22 not to s.34. 4)A person is not in constructive possession of collateral within s.34(2)(a) unless that person is a 'debtor' as defined, unless the collateral is 'collateral' as defined and unless another person 'obtained physical possession of the colateral at the request of that debtor'. 5)The first term of each lease agreement contained an acknowledgement by Lake Air that the trailer was delivered by Associates at the date and location set out in the lease. Such a clause is inconsistent with Lake Air having actual or constructive possession at an earlier date. Lake Air did not have constructive possession prior to December 1997 through either Bell or Mid-Canada. Neither was in possession of the trailers at the request of Lake Air.  6)The protection the Act gives to purchase-money security holders should be interpreted broadly. To deny Associates priority over Humboldt would provide Humboldt with an unmerited windfall at the sole expense of Associates who gave full value for the purchase-money security interest it obtained from Lake Air.","The respondent applied under s.63 of the Personal Property Security Act for an order declaring the priority of competing security interests held by the respondent and Humboldt priority over that of Associates who had acquired possession of the trailers by way of a security agreement with Lake Air. Humboldingt argued that the security interests were acquired pursuant to its leases of the trailer units and were originally in possession of it by Lake Air prior to the date of the security agreement. Associates argued that Lake Air had verbally arranged the acquisition of the equipment from GJ Bell International Ltd. (GJ Bell). Humboldedt's position was that the respondent perfected its purchase money security interests in the two reefer trailers within the 15 days prescribed by s.34(1)(a) of the Act and that Associates could not rely on s. 34(2) for priority because its purchase-money security interests did not perfected within the fifteen days of that date as required by the section. HELD: The application was allowed. It was ordered that its purchase and security interests on the two trailers have priority to Humbornt's security interests within the meaning of s.33(2)(a). The respondent was entitled to its costs from Humboltt.  1)The respondent did not become debtor in possession by the time the terms of the lease were met and the security agreements between the parties were executed. 2)The use of the term 'possession' in the context of possession in the Uniform Commercial Code is similar to that of s34(2). However, the wording of the provisions respecting possession and constructive possession are similar to those in the Saskatchewan and Manitoba Personal Property security Acts. 3)The application was denied. The respondent did have possession of a trailer prior to December 22, 1997 and it was not clear that the appellant had actual possession prior to that date. The evidence did not support the contention that the parties had a prior verbal agreement. 4)The applicant was awarded its costs."

5_2018skqb209.txt,"Contract Law – Sale of Land – FormationReal Property – Sale of Land – Oral Contract The plaintiff brought an action against the defendant for specific performance and damages. The plaintiff claimed that the defendant agreed to sell him three quarters of land. The defendant’s position was that there was no agreement and if there was, it was not in writing as required by The Statute of Frauds. The plaintiff made this application for a resolution of the initial question of liability as to whether an agreement was created and if it was, then proof of damages would follow. The plaintiff argued that a contract was created and that it complied with the statute because he made his offer in writing, via an internet-based land auction program, and the acceptance was orally communicated by a telephone conversation. Therefore, all the requisite elements of a valid land sale were present. The defendant had used a website to list 17 quarters of land for sale, including six quarters of relevance to the action. The website was intended to connect sellers of farmland with interested buyers in a type of “non-binding auction” to permit sellers to gauge interest in their land, find the best possible price and avoid realtor’s commissions if a sale were completed. The listing showed three groups of the farmland for sale, described as 1) three adjoining quarters (the subject quarters); 2) two quarters (the adjacent quarters) and 3) one quarter (unsold quarter). In his online comments to the defendant during the auction, the plaintiff said that he wanted all five quarters (the subject and adjacent quarters). The plaintiff bid on each of the above parcels and had the highest bid on the subject quarters, but that in itself did not guarantee the purchase under the terms of the online auction program. He stopped bidding on the adjacent quarters because he thought they were becoming overpriced. After the auction, the plaintiff consulted with family members regarding whether to pursue negotiations with any of the bidders. They discussed the problems that would occur if the subject quarters were separated from the adjacent quarters because the two blocks were owned by different individuals. The defendant then telephoned the plaintiff and gave him two package options for the sale, both of which resolved the identified problem by including the purchase of the adjacent quarters. The package options were to purchase the subject and the adjacent quarters for $1,050,000 (which was 5 percent more than the $625,000 the plaintiff offered for the subject quarters and his last bid of $375,000 on the adjacent quarters) or the subject quarters and one of the adjacent quarters for $840,000. At the end of the conversation, the plaintiff testified that he wanted to be sure that regardless of his response to the package option offers, he would be able to buy the subject quarters for $625,000. The plaintiff did not have concerns about the purchase because he said that the defendant told him that “we had them”. He believed that this indicated the defendant’s willingness to accept his bid on the subject quarters and that if he accepted either of the two options, then either of the newly accepted offers would replace the agreement respecting the subject quarters. The defendant’s interpretation of the conversation was that he declined to accept the offer on the subject quarters until he heard back from the plaintiff respecting the package options and then he would decide whether or not he would sell the subject quarters. He either misheard or misunderstood the plaintiff’s question about the subject quarters and denied that he gave any assurance that he would sell them to him regardless of his response to the package offers. The plaintiff called the defendant shortly after the first conversation and advised that he would not accept either of the package option offers but would immediately bring the deposit for the purchase of the subject quarters. The defendant told him to “hold off”. The plaintiff interpreted that to mean that there was no urgency regarding the deposit rather than that no agreement existed respecting the subject quarters. The defendant testified that he said he was not prepared to accept the deposit at this time, which meant that he was not prepared to accept the plaintiff’s bid on the subject quarters. Three days later, the defendant emailed the plaintiff and said that he would not be accepting the bid. The issues were: 1) whether a contract was formed; 2) if so, did the Statute of Frauds apply.  HELD: The plaintiff’s action was dismissed. He had not established on a balance of probabilities that he and the defendant were parties to a valid and enforceable agreement of sale regarding the subject quarters. The court found with respect to each issue that: 1) there was no contract. In interpreting the words of the first telephone conversation and the context of the bidding process, using the standard of the reasonable bystander, there was no consensus ad idem between the parties. The second telephone conversation had done nothing to alter that finding. Both the plaintiff and the defendant reasonably believed different things; and 2) the Statute did not apply as there was no contract.","The plaintiff and defendant were involved in a lawsuit regarding a sale of three quarters of land in the Rural Municipality of Hazel Dell. The plaintiff and prospective buyer had each made out packages of land for sale on an online auction platform. The defendant and plaintiff had each listed his farmland for sale as an open bidding system to allow farmers to explore the market but not necessarily conclude with sale of the land. The issue was whether the packages were in writing or whether the agreement was in the form of an oral agreement. HELD: The plaintiff must prove on a balance of probabilities that a contract was created between the defendant and the plaintiff respecting the Subject Quarters and that the formalities of the Statute of Frauds have been satisfied. The first telephone conversation was only brief and the judge was not required to look at the surrounding circumstances of the bidding process and the two telephone conversations in order to conclude that a contractual contract was formed. The second telephone conversation, which lasted less than five minutes, was all that could be said about the essential elements of a valid contract. The issues were whether the package offer was enforceable, whether the plaintiff was prepared to accept the bid, whether there was urgency to the bidding, whether it was necessary to meet the deadline for the bid to be made, if the bid was reasonable, if acceptable, and whether the parties were able to agree on the identical terms. The Court accepted that the defendant was truthful and credible."
9_2009nsca91.txt,"The young person appealed his sentence on an aggravated assault conviction following a drive-by shooting and applied for release pending appeal. Although he alleged that he would suffer unnecessary hardship if kept in custody because he would fall behind in his schoolwork, prior to being remanded the youth had been asked to leave his high school as a result of safety concerns in the school. Application for release pending appeal dismissed. The young person would not suffer unnecessary hardship as he was able to attend high school classes several times per week in the youth facility while he awaited his appeal and, even if his appeal was successful, he would only have served four months custody before it was heard. Given the circumstances of the aggravated assault and his record of violent offences and numerous breaches of court orders, the court was not persuaded that the youth's release would be in the public interest.","The accused, a young person, pleaded guilty to aggravated assault contrary to s. 268(1) of the Criminal Code. He was sentenced to 365 days, comprised of 243 days custody followed by 122 days supervision in the community. The accused appealed his sentence, arguing that his release would cause unnecessary hardship. Application for release pending appeal dismissed; the accused will be released pending appeal on the balance of probabilities. Although the accused has served more than what is determined to be a fit sentence, he will likely already have served morethan what is ultimately determined to being a fit sentenced, and thereby suffer undue hardship if he is not released. The Court found that the onus on an appellant under s. 679(4)(a) ofthe Criminal Code is'much more stringent' than for an appeal against conviction. However, given the circumstances of the aggravated assault offence, his record of violent offences, and the numerous breaches of court orders, I am not persuaded that his released would be in the public interest. The young person's release so soon after being sentenced, in order for him to attend school in the Community, would tend to undermine public confidence in the administration of justice."
e_2009nssc318.txt,"The mother applied for retroactive support (table amounts and s. 7 expenses) for two adult children. The father resisted the application in relation to the oldest son on the basis that he was no longer a dependant child when it was filed. The evidence showed the son finished university before the application was filed. His graduation took place after, at which time he was already working full time and living with his girlfriend. He lived with his mother for few months because of relationship problems, but later moved back in with the girlfriend. He also received some assistance from his parents when he took time off work to retrain. The father felt the mother's application in relation to the younger son should be limited because of her unreasonable delay in making it. He argued retroactivity should be limited to three years from the date he received the application (months after it was filed). The mother argued formal notice was given when her lawyer sent a letter requesting additional support several years earlier. She asked the court for support retroactive to three years before that date, or longer (based on what she alleged was blameworthy conduct on the father's part). The evidence showed the mother was slow in responding to the father's request for particulars. Despite threatening legal action several times, it took her years to file the application. The wife's application for retroactive support in relation to the oldest son dismissed. He was no longer a child of the marriage when it was filed. He became independent when his schooling finished and he started working and living with his girlfriend. While his parents provided assistance during his relationship troubles and retraining, they did so voluntarily and not out of any legal obligation. Support for the younger son to be reassessed retroactive to three years from the date the application was filed (as opposed to received). The mother unreasonably delayed her claim by allowing it to languish for years. While normally the letter from her lawyer would be said to constitute effective notice, the notice here was voided by the mother's failure to prosecute the matter. The father did not engage in blameworthy conduct: he made efforts to respond to and settle the mother's claims; he paid a significant level of support; and he reasonably believed he was meeting his obligations. Here, the need for certainty for a payor parent weighs in favour of the father.","The parties were married for 22 years and had two children (ages 12 and 13). The respondent applied to vary the period of retroactive child support to reflect his increased support obligation. The younger child, who had recently graduated from high school, continued to live independently with his partner. The respondent argued that retroactive support should be retroactive to July 2004, when he received effective notice of his intention to seek an increase in support. The mother had made no formal notice of her son's application until August 2009. The father had since moved out of the residence where he and his girlfriend had taken up residence. The parties' corollary relief judgment provided for a shared parenting arrangement and equal sharing of all special and extraordinary expenses for the parties' children. The issues were determined in D.B.S. v. Niles and the Ontario Court of Appeal. HELD: 1)The Court did not have jurisdiction to consider the application of the mother for retroactive variation of child support and a readjustment of the claim for section 7 expenses for her older child. 2)The evidence established that the respondent's son clearly left the charge of his parents in April 2008. He established an independent household without the consent, agreement, approval or financial support of his father. He did not seek any of these from his parents when doing so. There was no arbitrary cut-off point based on age or scholastic attainment. The trial judge could not be blind to prevailing social and economic conditions; bachelor's degree no longer assures self-sufficiency. 3)The issues were decided primarily on jurisdiction and not the result. The court held that jurisdiction to make retroactive orders for child support awarded should be prerequisite. The Court held that it would be appropriate to apply the Farden Factors to the determination of post-secondary education expenses to be paid by each of the parties. 4)The court did not find that the parties had engaged in blameworthy conduct which would move the presumptive date of retroactivity back to the time when circumstances changed materially. The evidence was speculative and conjecture. 5)The respondent did not disclose any material change in circumstances which would have affected the period for which it was to be recalculated. The proper approach is to ask the father what he thinks he is doing wrong. The fact that he did not provide any other significant financial support to his son since April 2008 and could not tell the court how he was meeting his support obligations could have a material effect of the retroactive award. The conduct of the respondent could not"

4_2006nssc88.txt,"The parties were married for thirteen years and had four children, who resided with the mother immediately following the divorce. The father paid one monthly sum ($6,000) comprised of both spousal and child support. Over a ten year period, all of the children had graduated from high school; two of the children had moved in with the father and he provided support directly to the other two children while they continued their education. After the first two children moved out of the mother's home, the parties orally agreed to reduce the child support payments. The parties were unable to negotiate a further reduction in the combined child and spousal support after the third child moved out of the mother's home. Since the parties' separation and divorce, the mother had not seriously pursued any educational retraining or furthered her education in her field of expertise; since the children had become independent, she occupied herself with volunteer work. The father now applied to terminate spousal support. The father shall continue to pay the sum of $3,000 per month as spousal support for one year; for the following year, the support will be reduced to $2,500 per month; in the following year, support shall be reduced to $2,000 per month, after which support will cease completely; the father shall continue his direct support of the children remaining dependant as they complete their current courses. Although the mother's effort in looking after four children and her absence from the workplace during the children's early years were significant factors, she had ignored her responsibility to move towards some sort of self sufficiency; given the number of children, the court extended the formula under the Spousal Support Guidelines beyond the maximum 13 year period; however, the mother must develop a reasonable strategy immediately to ensure that she either begins work in an area with better employment prospects or immediately attends courses to upgrade, refresh or enhance her ability to support herself.","The mother, who had been the primary caregiver of the four children for 14 years, and the father, who was the primary financial advisor, made regular payments of $2,000 per month to the mother, $25,000 to the father when the children left the mother's care, and $1,000 in arrears when the parties entered into an oral agreement. The father continued to pay the full child and spousal support and the mother destroyed any cheques she received in the previous $2k. The mother claimed she had no difficulty dealing with the father directly to obtain support. The evidence showed that she paid $52,000 as spousals, $15,000 for the children's education, and an additional $2500 to the husband, who paid $25000 in spous and child support. Monthly child and child spousum payments of approximately $52k were made to the wife, $20,000 were deducted from the husband's ongoing support payments and $25k was garnisheed against the father.

The trial judge fixed a provisional award of $25,000. The appellant's grounds of appeal were that the trial judge erred in finding that the defence applied and by assessing damages at $25,000. The respondents cross-appealed on the ground that the trial judge had erred in denying them costs. HELD: The Court held that the trial judge had erred in finding that the defence of qualified privilege applied. Although she correctly identified the law, she had not correctly applied it because she had not given sufficient effect to 1) the wording of the defamatory expressions; 2) the circumstances in which they were published and, in particular, the chronology of events and the separate instances of publication; 3) the persons to whom the words were published; and 4) whether what was published on each occasion was germane and reasonably appropriate to the specific occasion. In general, the Court noted that the respondents could have fulfilled their duty to notify its membership of the grievance filed by the member who alleged the harassment and made its effort to find witnesses to support the member's grievance by sending out a general notice. It did not need to name the appellant and make the allegations it did to achieve its goal. The respondent overreached, thereby placing the statement that the appellant had participated in the harassment of the employee outside the ambit of the defence of qualified privilege. The Court awarded general damages in the amount of $100,000. It held that the trial judge's assessment of damages was erroneous and founded upon mistaken principles of law. The Court was not bound by the range of damages mentioned by the Supreme Court in the Church of Scientology decision but only to apply the principles established in it to the context of this case. The provisional award of $25,000 for general damages was erroneous because the respondents published the documents by mailing them and placing them on the Union's website, over the strong objections of the employer. The respondents left the documents on the website for 6 months after the employer demanded that they be removed. The respondents had never offered an apology and appeared not to have recognized the harm that had been caused to the appellant. An award of aggravated damages was subsumed in the general award and the Court agreed with the trial judge that punitive damages were not warranted because the respondent had not been motivated by malice. The respondent's cross-appeal was dismissed without costs. However, their position was clearly correct in the circumstances: it was not appropriate for the trial judge to decline to order costs in their favour on the basis of 'mixed results', because in defamation cases, the results are invariably mixed.","HELD: The court allowed the appeal and fixed general damages at $100,000. The court found that the trial judge erred by finding the defamatory statements were protected by qualified privilege. The words expressed in the grievance were defamatories and constituted defamation. The Union and the Canadian Union of Public Employees had each filed statements of defence arguing that the words were defamed and that their publication would tend to lower the plaintiff's reputation in the eyes of a reasonable person. The plaintiff had been returned to work after a previous harassment complaint was upheld by the university and following a period of difficult employment, but was forced to return to the work force when her new position was terminated. The union and the union appealed. The Court found that both the plaintiff and the Union's statements were defaming and that they constituted defamation, but that the defence of qualified privilege did not apply in this case. The trial judge correctly referred to the grievance as the Grievance Report and not the Griezance Report as the publications which had been published at the hospital and on the Union’s website. The latter document indicated that the statements were simply allegations with which the plaintiff strongly disagreed. The statements were found to be defamative and had no merit in the context of the grievance. The plaintiffs’ claim for damages was dismissed. The general damages were fixed at $25,000 (with provisional damages at another $25k)."

The accused was grossly lacking in mental abilities, had limited and basic comprehension, had the mental capacity of a young child and these facts were not likely to change anytime soon. The accused had extreme difficulty paying attention to the court proceedings and appeared incapable of doing so. He played with toys in the prisoner's box, paced around and pestered the deputy sheriff sitting with him for much of the proceeding.HELD: The accused was incapable of paying attention to the court proceeding or participating in a meaningful way because of his mental disability. The accused said that his lawyer was the judge, could not answer when asked what the judge's role was and he had limited insight into why he was in Court. The accused met the portion of the limited cognitive capacity test which requires an understanding of the nature of the proceedings and their possible consequences and the accused is capable of communicating his version of the events surrounding the allegations, but there is no possibility he could participate in a meaningful way in the trial. According to R. v. Jobb, the limited cognitive capacity test does not require that an accused be able to make rational decisions beneficial to himself, the Court's inquiry is limited to whether an accused can recount to their counsel the necessary facts of the offence to present a defence. The accused in this case was found fit to stand trial because he had a memory of what happened during the alleged offence despite having virtually no ability to participate in the proceeding.","The accused was charged with a variety of offences. The Court found that he was grossly lacking in mental abilities and that he did not have the ability to participate in his trial. The court found that his inability to testify as to the events of the alleged shooting did not make him unfit to stand trial. However, it was found that, in a calm and controlled environment, he was able to participate effectively. The accused displayed no symptoms of the mental difficulties that may accompany a fitness test. The only thing that made it clear that he had some difficulty with regard to his fitness to stand was his inability on an information overload basis to which he was not privy to information at the time of the hearing. Deficiencies were found in the test and the manner in which it was determined that testimonial competence was pre-condition to fitness to be tried."
b_2009nsca127.txt,"A couple signed a separation agreement which included a provision whereby they agreed to renounce and waive any claim in the estate of the other and any right to share in the estate of the other, which terms were incorporated into a corollary relief judgment. When he died, the former husband had not changed his will, which left the residue of his estate to his former wife. The Chambers judge held that the separation agreement had not revoked the will and the former wife was entitled to the testamentary gift. The mother of the deceased appealed. Appeal dismissed; although the Chambers judge's reasoning was flawed, the appellant had failed to produce any legal authority that a contractual promise to renounce, given for consideration before the death of a former spouse, binds a person to renounce a testamentary gift after his death. Even if the former spouse were so bound, there did not appear to be any privity of contract which would allow the appellant, who was not a party to the separation agreement, to enforce it.","The testator had left his wife, the residue of his estate, a few years later. They subsequently divorced and he died intestate. Upon his death, the executrix of his Estate applied for an interpretation of the will and separation agreement. The executrix applied for a review of the Will and separation agreements. The purpose of the trial judge was to determine whether the wife had renounced any claim against the estate under the previous will and, accordingly, was entitled to the gift under the new will. The deceased had made a separation agreement in which he left the residue to his wife. Upon the death of the testator, the wife signed a separation judgment which held that the separation agreement did not revoke the will; however, she was entitled at the time of her death to renounce any interest in the estate of the deceased. The chambers judge found that the wife could not and did not immediately renounce the right to share in the new estate and that she was also entitled to an intestacy. The gift to the appellant was found to stand. Both cases are distinguishable. The separation agreement and the separation agreements have a binding obligation to renounced anything which might be construed as a gift to another. The fact that the gift was made before the death and was bound by the will, and only after the death, does not provide a compelling reason to override the testatory's intentions. The language of the separation judgment was limited by the qualifier 'can at most take effect' and the phrase 'can take effect'. The phrase 'willful promise to renunciation' was not used in the judgment. The parties had signed two separate separation agreements prior to their separation and they subsequently divorced. The first was bound and binding by the separation contract. The second was bound only by the terms of the second will. There was no evidence that the parties had entered into a contractual agreement to renouncing any claim for the estate or that they had contractedually bound themselves to renout any inheritance after the deceased had died. The third was not binding and the parties did not have any claim to the estate at the date of the death. The evidence that a contractual promise to never renounce an interest in something to which he or she has no legal interest was not supported by the wording of the first two agreements."

The other personal representative of the estate, who was the intestate's spouse, was in receipt of survivor benefits under the pension and, as such, was opposed to the intended court action. The biological child applied to have his stepmother removed as a personal representative of the estate. Application dismissed; the removal of the personal representative would only be in the best interests of those persons interested in the estate if the intended lawsuit was feasible, which it was not. The estate was bound by the terms of the pension plan, which provided that the respondent was clearly entitled, as the spouse of the intestate, to survivor benefits and the payment of a lump sum into her estate if she died within five years of the intestate's retirement.","The deceased was employed by the respondent Marine Atlantic Inc. for thirty-one years. During that period he contributed to a pension plan valued at two hundred eighty-three thousand two hundred thirty-seven dollars ($283,237.77).

Her appeal was allowed in part, the court holding the judge erred in ruling inadmissible certain evidence about the value of scallop licences. The matter was remitted to Supreme Court for determination on evidence to be adduced by the parties of the value of the respondent's fishing operation. In preparation, the appellant applied to the Supreme Court for an order to inspect the respondent's bank records pursuant to s. 21(1) of the Evidence Act. The respondent argued he had limited involvement in the enterprise being discovered. The judge granted the order with limitations: the examination was to be limited to income received by the respondent and covering the period from the trial date forward. The appellant appealed, arguing the limitations disallowed full disclosure. In the interim, the respondent went into bankruptcy and argued the examination would be fully conducted by the trustee. Allowing the appeal, that a possible duplication was no reason to limit full disclosure.","This was an appeal from a decision of the Supreme Court in Chambers granting an application under s. 21(4) of the Nova Scotia Evidence Act ordering inspection of banking records to the appellant but imposing two limitations. The appellant appealed the decision of this Court which allowed the wife's appeal in part holding that the judge erred in ruling inadmissible certain evidence about the value of scallop licenses. This Court remitted the matter to the Supreme for determination on evidence to be adduced by the parties of the value inter alia of the fishing licenses and boats of the respondent. The respondent has since gone bankrupt. He contends that the examination ordered by the Chambers judge is nothing but a duplication of the detailed and searching examinations that will be made of his assets by the trustee in the bankruptcy proceedings.

c_2006skqb87.txt,"The appellant appeals its conviction of selling tobacco to a minor contrary to s. 8(1) of the Tobacco Act. The appellant argues that the learned trial judge erred in law by applying an unreasonably high standard of due diligence to the facts of the case. HELD: The appeal is allowed, the conviction is quashed and a verdict of acquittal is entered.  1) The court reviewed in detail the steps the appellant had in place. 2) The court was of the view that the trial judge erred in applying an unreasonably high standard for this defence. The trial judge applied a standard of due diligence that required the appellant to be able to prove that there were no other possible precautions or action that could have been taken to prevent the company's cashiers from selling cigarettes. This standard exceeds the requirements of a reasonable person. By applying a higher standard of due diligence, the trial judge erred in law. Had the appropriate standard of due diligence been applied to the facts of this case, the appellant would have succeeded.","The defendant was convicted of carrying out an unlawfully in conveying a tobacco product contrary to s. 8(1) of the Tobacco Act. The defendant applied a standard of due diligence that was not warranted by the law: an unreasonably high standard of diligence for a strict liability offence, which is not to be confused with the offence of supplying tobacco to minors. The trial judge erred in applying a standard for correctness which is the same as the one used in the case of R. v. Westfair Foods Ltd. and Roy H. Friesen, S.C.C.(3d) 138. HELD: The defendant was found guilty of the strict liability offences and a $3,000 fine was imposed as sentence. 1) The trial Judge erred by applying an unre unreasonable high standard for defence of due due diligence. Prior to the incident, prior to the defendant having an established system to prevent the commission of the offence, the defendant had an established one to prevent them from selling tobacco to children. This standard exceeds the requirements of a reasonable person. The defence will be available if the accused reasonably believed in a mistaken set of facts which, if true, would render the act or omission innocent, or if he took all reasonable steps to avoid the particular event. 2) The evidence tendered at the trial suggests that prior to August 25, 2003, prior the defendant has had an existing system created to prevent their cashiers from selling cigarettes to minors, which was essentially the same procedure as that used by Westfair in R.v. Westfarms Ltd. (R.v.). 3) The defendant received a written Tobacco Sales Policy when they were hired. The policy generally states that tobacco cannot be sold to anyone under the age of 18. If person looks as though there are under 25 years of age or if there is any doubt about the customer's age, then the customer should be required to provide identification to the cashier before they can purchase tobacco. If the customer refuses to provide ID, the sale should be refused or the manager or supervisor should be called. This burden is consistent with standard of perfection and essentially implies zero tolerance. The evidence showed that prior before the incident on August 25/2003, the trial judge applied a high standard to the facts of the case, which required that the defendant have established a proper system to preventing the sale of tobacco to a young person in a public place, and that they took reasonable steps (e.g. by establishing a system to ensure the sale"
e_2009skca138.txt,"This appeal concerns the assessment for municipal purposes of a building located in the City of Regina and used commercially as an enclosed shopping mall. The building was assessed in each of the years 2003 and 2004 on the basis of its 'fair value' as determined by the City Assessor. The owner of the building, the corporate appellant, was dissatisfied with the Assessor's determination of fair value and appealed the assessment to the local Board of Revision, then to the Assessment Appeals Committee of the Saskatchewan Municipal board. The appeals were allowed in part, but the corporate appellant remained dissatisfied. It applied for leave to appeal to this Court pursuant to s. 33.1 of The Municipal Board Act. The issues on appeal all relate to the determination of the fair value of the building and, more particularly, to the market adjustment factor used in that determination. The grounds take issue one way or another with the inclusion of the sales of the Southland and Victoria Square Malls in the array of sales from which the MAF was derived, or alternatively, with the adjustment of the sale price of these properties. HELD: Appeal dismissed. The appeal in relation to the treatment of the sale of the Victoria Square Mall fails, as does the appeal concerning the sale of the Southland Mall. The Court notes that other companies, owning or operating similar malls, also took issue with their 2003 and 2004 assessments. They, too, appealed to the Board of Revision and then to the Assessment Appeals Committee. They too were granted leave to appeal to this Court on the same grounds as the appellant in this case. Counsel for the companies agreed to treat this appeal as representative of the other appeals and to be bound by the result of this appeal. These other appeals are also dismissed.","The company appealed the assessment of a building located in the City of Regina and used commercially as an enclosed shopping mall. The building was owned by the appellant company. The company was dissatisfied with the City Assessor's determination of its fair value and appealed the decision to the Assessment Appeals Committee. The Committee found that the Assessor could not use the sale of the Northgate Mall as a 'portfolio sale' because it was not a'mall'. The Committee also found that it could not rely upon the sale price of the Victoria Square Mall as being a'sale price' because the sale involved only 50% interest. The committee found that there was no material error on the part of the Committee as it did not reach the conclusion that the sale was an 'arm's length sale' as determined by the Assessors. The Court awarded the company leave to appeal. The appeal against the Committee was dismissed. The court found that, while the Committee erred in law in upholding the Assision's decision that the mall qualified for inclusion in the determination of an appropriate MAF, it did so in a fashion that did not defy the fact that the assessment was made on the basis of a sale price determined by them. The sale price did not require any adjustments to the sales price of either mall."
c_2003skqb519.txt,"The Court was presented with a consent judgment. The respondent was unrepresented. The Court found the terms of the consent judgment were so unfair as to be unconscionable. HELD: The Court refused to issue the order on the grounds that the Court must not be seen as legitimatizing, condoning, acquiescing or approving of an unconscionable bargain.","The parties presented a form of a consent judgment bearing the consents of both. At first blush, the Court should grant the parties the relief they appear to jointly be seeking. However, the terms of the proposed judgment were unconscionable. There was not equality in the bargaining positions of the parties and the petitioner was prepared to forfeit her right to spousal support and the rights she had thereunder. The proposed judgment provided that the petitioner would receive assets mainly in the value of her car, which represents her receiving about 13% of the net value of the family property estate, leaving the remaining 87% of said property to be the petitioner's share. The parties did not need Court order nor judgment to attain their apparent goals and there was not been equality in bargaining positions. HELD: The application was dismissed. 1)When the terms appear to be patently unfair or unconscionsable to one of the Parties, it is the Court's job to refuse the application. No reasonable person would conclude that the proposed judgement was anything but unconscionalable and would speculate that at some point in the future, the petitioner will come to realize how patently cruel the proposed judge was to her. 2)The parties did nothing wrong and had not sought legal advice or advice. The court could not urge the petitioner to seek legal advice but would urge her to seek counsel and advice from counsel who would be clearly encouraged and appreciated by the petitioner. 3)The court was unable to urge the counsel who had been urged to do so to intervene and provide guidance. The petitioner was not encouraged to seek advice or counsel but was encouraged to do it. The terms of this proposed judgment appeared to be improvident. No legal advice could be given nor was advice sought. 4)The Court was unable or unwilling to grant legal advice and guidance."

5_2016skqb384.txt,"Criminal Law – Motor Vehicle Offences – Driving with Blood Alcohol Exceeding .08 – Conviction – AppealConstitutional Law – Charter of Rights, Section 10(b) – Appeal The accused appealed her conviction under s. 253(1)(b) of the Criminal Code of driving with a blood alcohol content over .08 on the grounds that the trial judge erred in law finding that there was no breach of her s. 8 Charter rights or of a breach of her s. 10(b) Charter rights. The first ground pertained to the defence’s contention that the officer who stopped the accused and made the breath demand did not have sufficient evidence of impaired driving. The officer testified that he was patrolling for impaired drivers on the night in question and observed the accused make a very tight right-hand turn, entering the untraveled portion of the road where the snow was soft. He noticed that her eyes were glassy and she was slurring her speech. She had just lit a cigarette, which suspects often do to mask the smell of alcohol. When she did put the cigarette out, he smelled alcohol on her breath. He asked her to step out of the vehicle and noticed that she swayed while standing still. She walked with a wide stance to the police cruiser and had to lean against it to maintain her balance. When he first asked the appellant if she had had anything to drink, she said that she’d had three but later said that she’d had five. He arrested her and made the breath demand. The defence argued that the trial judge erred in failing to consider other evidence that other vehicles had made similar turns and that the appellant did not require any assistance in leaving her vehicle and walking to the police cruiser, among other things. With respect to the second ground, the appellant advised the officer that she wanted to speak to a specific lawyer after being arrested. At the detachment, the appellant located the lawyer’s number and the officer dialed it. A voice message was left on the lawyer’s telephone but no return call was received. The officer advised the appellant she could call another lawyer, and initially she responded that she did not want to but wished to provide a breath sample. The officer was about to read her a waiver of her right when the appellant indicated that she wanted to call another lawyer. The officer called the number but received an after-hours message. He asked the appellant if she wanted to try another lawyer and she declined, stating that she was satisfied with leaving a message. She then provided her first breath sample. The defence argued at trial that the officer failed to advise the appellant of the availability of Legal Aid and failed to provide the Prosper warning, thereby breaching s. 10(b) of the Charter.  HELD: The appeal was dismissed. The court found that the trial judge had not erred: 1) by finding there was no s. 8 breach. The judge had not made any findings of fact that were not supported by the evidence nor did he fail to consider relevant evidence when he found that the officer had sufficient evidence that objectively supported his belief that the appellant’s ability to drive was impaired; and 2) by finding that there had been no breach of s. 10(b). The appellant had failed to act diligently in pursuing her right to speak with a lawyer and provided a clear and unequivocal indication that she had abandoned her right to counsel when she said she was happy leaving a message.","HELD: The appeal was dismissed. The court found that the trial judge erred in law in finding that there was no breach of s. 8 Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms (Criminal Code s. 10(b) on the following grounds: 1) The appellant challenged the officer's subjective belief that he had personally and honestly formed the opinion that the appellant had driven while impaired or over.08. The officer was not required to have overwhelming evidence of impairment. The appellant did not challenge the officer’s subjective belief in that he personally and objectively formed the belief that there had been a breach of the appellant’S right to be free and informed counsel.  2) The trial judge properly found that there were sufficient evidence, when viewed objectively, to support the officers contention that the accused was impaired by alcohol. The standard of review on a summary conviction appeals is set out in R. v. Shepherd. The appeal court reviewed the Alberta Court of Appeal decision and found that it was entitled to more deference than it would have otherwise. The trial court found the following: 1). The appellant”s position that she did not require assistance to exit the vehicle and walk to the police cruiser was not supported by the officer. The police officer was aware that there would be other vehicle tracks in the soft snow and that would not have been the first person to make a similar turn. The evidence on the basis of which the officer had personally held a belief that the individual could walk and enter a motor vehicle without assistance did not establish that the Trial Judge erred. 2) On the whole of the evidence, the court found there was sufficient evidence to support a breach pursuant to s. 9(b). The standard required for an effective waiver of counsel is high. 3) The court noted that the errors of fact were not found on the part of the trial court that led it to conclude that there could be no breach. The error was not found in the trial decision but in the determination of the error by the trial judges. 4) The appeal judge properly considered the factors articulated by the officers as forming the factual basis for making the breath demand. The factors articulated in the officer as forming a factual basis were reliable and capable of supporting the officer to make the finding of fact. The facts as found by the appellant were not disturbed. 5) The standard for assessing the factors articulate by the respondent as forming factual basis to support an honest belief that she has driven while intoxicated or over. 08) The respondent’"

Alternatively, she sought a Voices of the Child report. The applicant indicated that the child expressed a desire to live with her full-time. The parties’ affidavits conflicted as to their behaviour. The applicant indicated that the child told her he was required to continue skiing with the respondent even though he was having a seizure. She also indicated that the child told her that the respondent told his roommate he was going to stab the applicant and he called her crazy.

Alberta did not withdraw or abandon the charges and suspended his driving privileges for 3 months. Upon request, SGI also suspended his Saskatchewan driving privileges. At issue was whether the Alberta court lost jurisdiction; if so, whether that gave rise to a plea of autrefois acquit in Saskatchewan; apart from any loss of jurisdiction did the police procedure amount to an abuse of process at common law.

The trial judge erred in finding a plea of autrefois acquit was applicable but was correct in concluding Alberta lost jurisdiction. 1)The Information remained dismissed for want of prosecution. Jurisdiction over the respondent was lost when the information was not available in the Alberta Provincial Court, the appearance notice was not confirmed and the matter could not be dealt with (R. v. McGinnis). The Alberta court could have regained jurisdiction by issuing a summons or warrant within 3 months of February 6, 2001. A summons was not issued until August. The information was by then deemed to have been dismissed for want of prosecution pursuant to s.485(3). 'Deemed' in s.485(3) does not mean 'presumed until otherwise proven'. It means that the information is dismissed without any action by the court. Once dismissed the proceeding could only be recommenced with consent of the Attorney General or leave of the court, neither of which were obtained. 2)With respect to jurisdiction in Saskatchewan, s.476(b) grants concurrent jurisdiction to any province in which the offence may have been committed or committed within 500 metres of any province in order to prevent a charge from failing because of uncertainty as to location. The section was not intended to permit simultaneous prosecutions in two provinces or in a second province in the event of a failure in the first. 3)The respondent's appearance in a Saskatchewan courtroom as a result of a summons did not revive jurisdiction in Alberta. The Alberta proceeding was deemed to have been dismissed for want of prosecution on May 6, 2001. The charges have not been disposed of within the meaning of s.730(3). There was no finding in respect of which an appeal can be taken. The special plea of autrefois acquit is not available in these circumstances. 4)The prosecutorial conduct of the police in proceeding simultaneously in two provinces amounted to an abuse of process. The respondent was obliged to defend identical charges arising out of the same incident in two provinces for almost a year at substantial cost and stress. The police acted with arbitrary purpose and without regard for the principles of fundamental justice. The lack of malice or improper motive does not preclude a finding of abuse of process.","The Crown appealed a summary conviction appeal by the Crown when the trial judge dismissed charges of impaired driving and driving with a blood alcohol level exceeding.08. The trial judge held that the circumstances supported a special plea of autrefois acquit and that the manner of proceeding by the crown was an abuse of process at common law. HELD: The appeal was dismissed with costs of the proceeding to the Crown in Alberta and general damages to the respondent. 1)The trial judge erred in law in finding the court lost jurisdiction as he specifically found that if there was loss of jurisdiction it was over the offence, but in dismissing the Information he relied on the provisions of s. 485(2) of the Criminal Code which relate to loss of control over the accused and not the offence. 2)The court had not lost jurisdiction over the person was lost in Alberta. 3)The Provincial Court judge erled in law when he referenced the loss of jurisdictional jurisdiction in the meaning of s485(3) of The Criminal Code. He was correct in concluding the Alberta Provincial Court had lost jurisdiction. 4)The special plea by the respondent was based solely on the deemed dismissal for want of prosecution in Alberta which was unintentional. 5)The Court was unable to agree that appearance by the Respondent in Saskatchewan as a result of a summons issued before May 7, 2001 revived jurisdiction over him in Alberta, but the Alberta proceeding was deemed to have been dismissed for wantof prosecution on May 6, 2001. 6)The Saskatchewan information was sworn on January 19, 2001 but was not available in the Alberta Court when the respondent appeared. 7)The Crown sought to dismiss the charges for want or dismissal of the accused. The Saskatchewan information did not have before it an information in Alberta but was sworn in Saskatchewan on March 29, 2001 and was not present on that date. 8)The accused was charged with driving with an amount in excess of $20,000. The Alberta proceeding had been deemed to be dismissed for wants of prosecution on June 1, 2001 when the provincial court judge accepted the special plea and dismissed the charges. 9)The application for a stay of proceedings was dismissed. 10)The charges were deemed to lose jurisdiction by virtue of the fact that they were sworn in Alberta two months prior to the commencement of the trial. 11)The Alberta information was never available in Saskatchewan. 12)The province of Alberta did not withdraw or abandon its charges. 13)The issues before the Court were whether jurisdiction was lost or lost in Saskatchewan?

The court applied the rules of statutory interpretation, specifically the presumption of coherence and overlap, to the provisions of the Act and found that the applicant was using s. 186.1 for a purpose that the legislature did not intend. The applicant could have proceeded to dissolution under Division XVI. In s. 210(m) the legislature intended to give the court the ability to order disposition of property of creditors and shareholders but not to deal with a shareholder’s right to distribution on dissolution.","Shareholders approved a plan of arrangement and sought an order approving it pursuant to s. 186.1 of the Business Corporations Act. The plan of arrangements involves a proposed liquidation and dissolution with a provision that if various shareholders of record cannot be found after outreach efforts, their pro rata entitlement to return of the corporation's capital will accrue to and be paid to the remaining known shareholders. The proposal proposed to distribute the remaining property distributable to creditors and shareholders, under s. 220(3) shareholders can apply to the Minister of Finance for payment out to them on proof of entitlement.

c_2014skpc114.txt,The plaintiff’s claim was dismissed. The plaintiff had not proven his claim on a balance of probabilities that the defendant was responsible for the damage to his lawn.,"The plaintiff alleges that the defendant applied a substance in the back alley next to his property which caused damage to his lawn in the Town of Wadena. A Back-Track Investigations and Special Services report supports the plaintiff's belief that damage occurred to their back yard lawn was caused by run-off and/or leaching of a substance from the back alley. However, the evidence does not support that. In preceding years, before it was moved to the Statchuk yard, it was used to store tools, machinery and applicators. The floor in it replaced before moving to his yard. HELD: The plaintiff's claim is dismissed. The onus is not on the defendant to establish an alternative source of the offending substance and this involves proving that the plaintiff was responsible for killing their lawn. For the reasons stated, he has not done so. The plaintiff must prove his claim on a balance of probabilities. The report was based on expert testimony. The expert testified that he had no idea what substance got into the lawn and killed it. Photographs and evidence given by the town employee and the lawyer who prepared the report supported the onus on the plaintiff to prove his claims on a balanced of probabilities and this involved proving that Mr. Statchusk was responsible."

HELD: 1)The support order was terminated effective November 30, 1995. 2)The Court determined the value of a resort property owned by the Husband in BC and permitted an exemption for its value as at the date of marriage. 3)The Court refused to permit the Wife to subtract from the value of her assets, the amount owing on a student loan which pre-dated the marriage. 4)With the exception of those items already discussed, the Court divided the value of the matrimonial property equally.","Three issues arising from the breakdown of a 4 1/2 year marriage: the date spousal support should terminate, the value of property in British Columbia and whether the wife's student loan was a matrimonial debt. HELD: The husband's obligation to support the wife should end; $700.00 per month ordered for another year. The wife's obligation should end on November 30, 1995. 1)The court found the value to be $49,000.00 on the date the action was commenced. 2)The respondent was to consider the length of time the spouses cohabited and the functions performed by the wife claiming support. 3)The applicant's counsel did not consent to the proposal. The court reviewed the economic condition of the wife at the time of separation and found it to be one of dependency, not a matrionial debt and the husband had sufficient means to promote it. 4)The judge was not prepared to terminate the support order retroactively to April 1. 5)The husband was entitled to an exemption for the amount of credit to the amount he must pay for her share of matrimony property. 6)The wife's counsel was unwilling to impose it upon her.

a_1995canlii4315.txt,"The appellant was convicted of operating a motor vehicle while impaired. His conviction was upheld on appeal to a summary conviction appeal court. This appeal was based on the argument the provincial court judge's decision failed to provide reasons for accepting the evidence of various witnesses, failed to make findings of credibility with respect to witnesses, and failed to comment on the credibility and evidence of the witnesses. The appellant complained the judge did not provide adequate reasons for the decision. Dismissing the appeal, that the decision was supported by the evidence. The court referred to R. v. Burns, [1994] 1 S.C.R. 656 at 664, where the Supreme Court of Canada held that if trial judges state their conclusions in brief, and these conclusions are supported by the evidence, the verdict should not be overturned merely because they fail to discuss collateral aspects of the case.","The appellant appealed his conviction for driving while impaired by alcohol or drug. The Summary Conviction Appeal Court had dismissed the appeal and reinstated the conviction. The appellant sought leave to appeal and asked that the Court of Appeal reverse the decision of Nichols which held that the failure to comply with s. 841(3) did not render the information nullity. The only fact which could possibly be in issue was the actual knowledge of the appellant that consuming liquor in combination with the sedative Librex 'could possibly have an unexpected impact, an impact which, according to the evidence the police produced, was unknown to his own doctor except on a speculative basis'. Appeal dismissed."
b_1993canlii6618.txt,Members of the Association of Professional Engineers who were also SIAST employees challenged the statutory provisions and collective bargaining agreement whereby they were compelled to become members of the SGEU. In Queen's Bench it was held that the statutory provisions which created two bargaining units for institute employees and required certain employees to be union members did not violate s.2(d) of the Charter. Appeal dismissed,"The appeal was put to the court prematurely, with the result that it was put on what was essentially a hypothetical basis, and Charter decisions should not be made without sufficient factual base. There was no evidence put before the court that the appellants or any of them had yet suffered any adverse consequences as result of the impugned legislation, although proceedings were pending before the Labour Relations Board which might result in adverse consequences. More particularly, there was no suggestion that anyone had lost their job or had been in any way penalized for refusing to either pay union dues or to join the union, nor was there any evidence as to why anyone objected to being a member of the bargaining unit in question or the union in question so as to permit any reasoned decision as to the alleged right not to associate. The respondents were to have their costs of the appeal under double col. V, except the Attorney General who did not ask for costs. Appeal dismissed."
c_1995canlii5987.txt,The accused was charged with sexual assault and was tried in the Court of Queen's Bench. The evidence at trial indicated that the alleged acts had occurred prior to the accused becoming an adult. He had not been ordered transferred into adult court under s.16 of The Young Offenders Act. HELD: Accused acquitted. 1)The Judge was satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused had sexually assaulted the complainant. 2)Because the complainant's evidence suggested that the assault occurred while the accused was a young offender the Judge concluded that the Court of Queen's Bench was without jurisdiction in the matter.,"The sole issue was whether it was proven beyond reasonable doubt that the sexual assaults alleged occurred on or after October 22, 1986, the date the accused became an adult. The case had not come to the Youth Court by way of transfer from the Youth Courts. A concurrent proceeding was pending in Youth Court. The facts and testimony of the complainant and the accused were both proven beyond a reasonable doubt by means of their testimony. The accused was 26 years old and had been convicted of numerous criminal offences involving deceit, dishonesty and disrespect for the law. Each had spent considerable time in jail. HELD: 1)Jury selection was exercised only when a matter was transferred to the Court of Queen's Bench pursuant to s.8 of the Young Offenders Act. 2)The Court was satisfied beyond a reasonably reasonable doubt all the incidents of sexual assault committed by the accused occurred on/ after October 2, 1986 when he became an Adult. The complainant's evidence was clear that the alleged occurred while she was 9. She turned 10 on February 5, 1986 and was almost 11 on the first date specified in the indictment. Although the Crown had jurisdiction over the matter pursuant to ss.8 and 11, it was not exercised judicially because the Crown demanded that dates be proven beyond an unreasonable doubt. 3)The accused was acquitted of the charge in theindictment."
5_2001canlii345.txt,"The accused was charged with operating an overweight vehicle on a weight restricted road contrary to s.38(1)(b) of the Highways and Transportation Act. No permit had been issued for the tractor trailer. The defence argued the document entitled 'order for road restriction on provincial highway #332 pursuant to s.35 of the Highway Traffic Act' was not proof of the Minister's order according to law; even if the document is proof, the order is a 'regulation' under the Interpretation Act and so the provisions of the Regulations Act applies; since those requirements have not been met, the Crown has not established an order had been made for the purposes of this case. HELD: It was not proven beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused violated s.38(1)(b). It was not established that the order was published for the purpose of this prosecution nor that the document filed in court is proof of the order itself.  1)It is well known that in a criminal case a provision that enables the Crown to expeditiously prove certain elements of an offence must be strictly satisfied. Since a violation of the HTA is prosecuted under s.4 of the Summary Offences Procedure Act, which in turn adopts the Criminal Code summary conviction procedure, the Crown must strictly comply with the provisions respecting proof.  2)It is mandatory for the Minister to give notice of the order and there was no evidence he exercised his discretion by determining the most advisable manner in which notice was to be given. The Minister failed to take appropriate steps to cause notice of the order to be given. The Department of Highways placed road signs warning and advising of weight restrictions on the highway and along grid roads accessing #332, but no notice was given to the general public. Notifying persons who reside or do business in the immediate area of the road is not sufficient to satisfy the requirement to publish. 3)Even if it could be said sufficient notice was given, it could not be concluded that the endorsement upon the order that the order 'conforms to the original' meets the statutory requirement that the copy must be a certified copy 'under the hand of an officer or person in whose custody the...public document is placed' (s.12 SEA) since it was not known if she had custody of the document or under the hand of any of the persons set out in s.7(c) of the SEA since her official capacity is not described. The order was not published in the Saskatchewan Gazette and so a copy of the order so published could not be produced (s.7(a) SEA). It was not proven that the copy of the order had been printed by the Queen's Printer (s.7(b) SEA).","The accused was charged with operating a motor vehicle that violated the Minister's weight order contrary to s38(1)(b) of The Highways and Transportation Act, 1997. The accused owned a tractor trailer and another person owned a trailer. The trailer was overweight by 16,300 kilograms. The police observed the accused operating it in an easterly direction and stopped to assist other motorist. No overweigt permits had been issued to the accused and so the officer issued a ticket to the driver. The RCMP did not publish any notice of the order nor did the accused present any documentation of its purpose. HELD: The accused was convicted of operating a vehicle that breached the Minister’s weight order pursuant to s37(1) of the Highways & Transportation Act. The Court found that the Minister failed to take appropriate steps to cause notice of his order to be given. The Provincial Court did not find sufficient evidence to show that the minister exercised his discretion by determining the most 'advisable' manner in which notice was to begiven."
3_1997canlii11384.txt,"The Minister of Social Services applied for an order that the Public Trustee be served with notice of a protection hearing and act as litigation guardian for H.B. who was alleged to be of unsound mind. H.B.'s child born in 1995 was apprehended at birth and was currently subject of a child protection hearing. The Minister relied on the Public Trustee Act and, alternatively, on the court's inherent parens patriae jurisdiction.HELD: The Public Trustee was appointed amicus curae to act on behalf of H.B. upon being satisfied she is unable to act for herself. An assessment was ordered pursuant to s32 of the Child and Family Services Act. The order was to issue unless the Public Trustee shows cause as to why it is not the appropriate party within 10 days from the date of this order. 1)While the wording of s32 is ambiguous the Public Trustee was correct that the Act does not authorize it to represent an adult under a mental disability other than where a property interest is involved. Nowhere does the Act authorize the Public Trustee to act as personal guardian of a dependant or mentally incompetent adult. The PT Act does not authorize its appointment as litigation guardian in the matter of child protection proceedings. 2)Pursuant to its parens patriae jurisdiction the Court has a responsibility to protect the interests of H.B. who requires independent representation to ensure her rights are protected. If the court failed to intervene H.B. will be left in limbo, a victim of the system.","The Minister of Social Services applied for an order that the Public Trustee be served with notice of a protection hearing and act as litigation guardian for the child. The child was apprehended at birth and is currently the subject of a child protection hearing. The Public Trustees Act does not give the Public trustee the jurisdiction to represent an adult under mental disability in cases other than where a property interest is involved. HELD: An order was issued pursuant to s. 32 of The Child and Family Services Act. An order for an assessment was ordered. 1)The Public Truste Act does Not authorize the Public Board to act as a litigation guardian on behalf of the child. 2)S. 32 is considered in the context of the entire Act. Nowhere does the Act authorize the public trustee to act in a number of child protection cases to protect the interests of a mentally deficient parent who is unable to act on his/her own behalf. Besides, no one else has come forward to fulfill that role. It was therefore the PublicTrustee's intention to appoint the Public as amicus curiae to act upon being satisfied that she is unable To act for herself. 3)The Board was ordered to assess the Public's claim pursuant to 32 of the Child andFamily Services Act as to whether it was the appropriate person to act for the Board. 4)The board was instructed to issue an assessment pursuant to the s.32 provisions of the Act. 5)The Rules do not enlarge the provisions of The PublicTrustees Act. They cannot serve as the basis to appoint a litigation lawyer to represent the personal interests as opposed to the property interests of dependent adult or person under mental disabilities. It is therefore the Court's intention, upon being content with the wording of s.31, that the Act does leave the Board with jurisdiction to act only as a legal guardian in cases where a real interest is in play. 6)The Court was ordered aware of the Minister's concerns regarding the Public Bank's representation of the son to the Minister."

HELD: The action was dismissed with costs. 1)Nothing that the defendant published was false, malicious, dishonest, negligent or recklessly published without careful justification, improper motive or excuse. 2)The station followed the CRTC Regulations and was exonerated entirely by its controlling body. The defendant published the news it received from the police, a proven reliable source. 3)Nothing pointed to the defendant as being the cause for the loss of profits by the plaintiff's roller rink operation. The business was on a down side at the time. The assault occurring where it did was not the fault of either party. If it had a bearing on the immediate attendance figure it was minimal and the plaintiff did no promotion whatsoever to increase attendance.","The plaintiff was the announcer for a radio newscast about a sexual assault at a roller rink. The defendants claimed that the newscasts, which purported to be about the sexual assault, were produced in error. The plaintiff's solicitor was advised of this by the CRTC. HELD: The plaintiff was found not guilty. The Court found that the defendants had published the information that it received from the police, an established reliable source. Nothing was false,malicious, dishonest, dishonest or recklessly published. The police were always a proven reliable source and the Court found nothing to support the defendant's claim. The fact that the plaintiff had been accosted by two juveniles at the same time did not constitute a breach of the Commission's duty to report such an incident.

When man involved in an accident checked himself into hospital, the attending physician informed the RCMP of the accident and an RCMP officer came to the hospital. As the appellant had indicated to the physician that he had been drinking, the RCMP constable read demand for blood sample, which the attending physician attempted to obtain. The appellant refused and asked to speak to his lawyer. Unable to contact lawyer, the appellant refused to supply blood sample and was charged with refusal under s. 254(2) of the Criminal Code. The trial judge had held that as the physician attempted to obtain sample for medical purposes, he was not acting in the capacity of agent of the state, and his actions were not subject to the Charter. Dismissing the appeal, that while there may have been some issues of breach of confidentiality, the physician's actions were not analogous to search and seizure within s.8 of the Charter. The trial judge did not err in determining that the appellant's rights were not violated under either s.7 or s.8 of the Charter.",This was an appeal against a decision wherein the appellant was convicted of an offence contrary to s.254(5) of the Criminal Code. The appellant had been in an accident and was taken to the hospital where a blood sample was taken by the doctor for medical purposes while the accused was unconscious contrary to an explicit refusal by the accused to provide blood sample under any circumstances. The doctor had then prepared a medical report for the hospital in response to a written request by the police. That report included the results of the blood alcohol tests from the first blood sample and diagnosis the appellant had intoxicated at the time of being treated in the emergency department. The officer then read the demand for a blood demand to the accused. The accused made no reply.

8_2016skqb154.txt,"HELD: The order was granted. Following the expiry of the current temporary order, the court found that the children were in need of protection pursuant to s. 11 of The Child and Family Services Act. As the father had taken no steps to deal with his anger, violence and alcohol issues, the children continued to be in need of protection as they were likely to suffer physical harm at his hands. Their psychological well-being required that they remain in protection to allow them to deal with the trauma they had suffered while they were in his care. Therefore, the court found that because the children were doing well in foster care and did not wish to be returned to their father and that the expert had advised against them having any further contact with him, it would make a permanent order rather than a long-term order.","HELD: The court found that the children had made a remarkable turnaround and that their parents, both of them foster parents, were genuinely committed to the children's welfare. The Ministry had taken no measurable steps to deal with their anger, violence and alcohol issues. The children had been subjected to extreme daily stress and violence for several months. The parents had not seen the children for several years. The child protection worker assigned to the child protection file had been retained by the Ministry to complete a parenting capacity assessment report. She was involved in setting up the visitsations with the father. The father had not been involved with the children’s lives for three years. HELD: Decisions like this are made only by considering the evidence before it. The court was satisfied that sufficient change can occur within the context of an order under s. 37(1) such that it is in the best interests of the child to make such an order. The evidence disclosed that the father had taken little measurable steps in dealing with his anger, violent and alcohol problems. He had taken almost no contact with the parents.

The residential school was located at Beauval in the Province of Saskatchewan. The accused was considered the golden-haired boy of the priests and nuns and was very popular with the boys there. The Court noted that most of the complainants were from the rural areas and had attended one or more residential schools. The Church was a traditional, stable family life. Many of the victims attempted to put these acts of sexual violation out of their minds for much of their adult lives. HELD: The Court reserved its decision respecting this application and undertook to render a decision at the time of its final judgment. 1) The Court accepted that there is less likelihood of moral prejudice, reasoning prejudice and propensity reasoning in a judge alone trial as opposed to a jury trial. However, there is a potential distraction of the trier of fact from its proper focus on the facts charged and the potential for undue time consumption. 2) There are numerous instances of similar fact evidence being used to bolster the credibility of each complainant. However the Court was unable to determine whether these were similar facts evidence or similar facts of sexual assault or whether similar facts were adduced by the accused himself. 3) The accused had an ability to interact and bond with the people in his life. He was awarded $50,000 in damages for each victim who spoke up and participated in a variety of activities. 4) The Crown was required to consider the potential distraction from the triering of fact evidence from its Proper focus on facts charged, and the risk of overall prejudice."
c_2012skqb372.txt,"The plaintiff purchased insurance from the defendant. In 2000, the plaintiff's farm was damaged by a fire. He commenced an action against Wawanesa Insurance Company in 2001. In 2006, the plaintiff commenced an action against the defendant, alleging that the defendant was in breach of contract or negligent for failing to obtain full replacement value insurance coverage for the plaintiff. The defendant filed his defence in April 2007. Mediation took place in September 2010 and examinations for discovery were held in May 2011. At that time, the defendant asked the plaintiff to disclose the amount recovered in the Wawanesa lawsuit and the plaintiff refused. The defendant brought this application for relief that: 1) The plaintiff's action be dismissed for want of prosecution; or 2) The plaintiff be required to disclose the amount recovered in the other lawsuit. The defendant argued that the delays between the issuance of the statement of claim to the examination for discovery and then the delay between the time of mediation to May 2012 when the plaintiff's counsel filed the reply to undertakings were both inordinate.HELD: The Court applied the test established in International Capitol Corp. v. Robinson Twigg &amp; Ketilson to determine whether or not a matter should be struck for want of prosecution. The Court found that the first delay was inordinate but because the plaintiff and defendant both acknowledged that the action against the defendant would only proceed depending on the outcome of the claim against Wawanesa, the delay was excusable. The Court found that the second delay was excessive, but was not sufficient to strike the claim on that basis. Applying the factors provided in Capitol, the Court found:1. Stage of litigation: It did not occur at an early stage of the litigation as the matter could well go to pre-trial conference. 2. Impact of delay: The delay was not causing any problems for the defendant. 3. The context in which the delay occurred: the delay in question was actually only one year during which the plaintiff's counsel did not respond in a timely fashion to undertakings. 4. Reasons offered for delay: Counsel was busy and it had to determine which undertaking could or could not be answered. 5. The role of counsel in causing the delay: The Court held that the delay caused by the plaintiff's counsel should not be a reason to deprive the plaintiff of his claim for actions beyond his control. The Court denied the application to strike the plaintiff's claim but ordered that the plaintiff disclose the amount obtained in the Wawanesa action on the basis that this case fell into the exception to the policy which protects settlement communications. Here, the communications sought by the defendant were relevant and necessary to avoid double recovery.","HELD: The application was granted in the alternative and the plaintiff was required to disclose the amount recovered from its lawsuit with Wawanesa Mutual Insurance. The court found that the delay was inordinate and inexcusable. The plaintiff relied on cases such as Middelkamp v. Fraser Valley Real Estate Board, where it was found that settlement payments were made in an amount equivalent to approximately $13,000, and in the interim, to $15,000. The defendant, which was facing a high court challenge, argued that settlement payment amounts should be disclosed. The amount arrived at in the minutes of settlement were relevant. The plaintiffs action against Wawanea was dismissed and they were required to make full answer to undertakings and to disclose any amount recovered. The defendants were ordered to pay out $7,000 in settlement amount by the end of June 2012. The claim for want of prosecution was dismissed. The Court found that for the initial period of May 2006 to May 2010 the delay in resolving the dispute was inordinately long. The period between May 2011 to May 2012 was the one-year period that it took the plaintiff's counsel to respond to the undertakings. The delay was not excusable. The applicant argued that it was understood between the parties that the action against Mr. Hoeppner would only proceed depending on the outcome of the claim against WAWanesa. HELD: 1)The delay was inexcusably long. It would be to the defendant's advantage to allow matters to play out in the suit against Wawaanesa in hopes that a complete resolution could be had. 2)The plaintiff was advised by counsel that it should prepare its case for trial and receive specific documents to respondto the undertakes. 3)The defendant was ordered to make its case and order the settlement amounts arrived at at in minutes of the hearing to be disclosed, and 4)the plaintiff was ordered required to provide the amount of recovered from the lawsuit with respect to the amount that was recovered.  5)The court found the plaintiff had made its case in favor of disclosure and that it had received information in a timely manner.  6)The plaintiffs action for want to strike was dismissed with costs of $724,000 ordered to the plaintiff. 7)The litigation was at a high stage of its course and it was not at an early stage that it would lead the court to strike. 8)The defendants were awarded costs of the application."

Based on the applicant's income, his child support payment is reduced from $500 per month to $425 per month.  2) The applicant is in arrears in the amount of $56,365.60.

The application for rescission for arrears is dismissed.","FIAT: The applicant applies pursuant to the Inter-jurisdictional Support Orders Act for a variation of support for the parties' one child, Desiree May Braun-McLaughlan, born February 14, 1992. HELD: The application for rescission of arrears is dismissed. 1) The respondent has properly proceeded under The Inter-Jurisdiction Support Orders act in light of his residence and the fact that the original order was made pursuant to provincial as opposed to federal legislation. 2) The applicant provides evidence that he earned $45,784 per year. Based on these earnings, the respondent has an obligation according to the British Columbia Tables to pay the sum of $425 for the one child. It is fair to adjust the respondent's ongoing child support payments as at November 1, 2006. Given that the applicant is currently earning the sum $45.784 per yr, he can afford to pay a reasonable payment towards the outstanding arrear. 3) The Court dismissed the respondent application for a rescission. He was stubborn. The applicant provided no evidence as why he earned little income from 1995 to 1998 and in 2002 and did not, in any way, suggest that he was ill, injured or unable to work for any reasonable reason."

d_2000canlii19583.txt,"The accused was charged with assault causing bodily harm contrary to s.267(b) of the Criminal Code. HELD: The accused was found guilty.  1)The case law from other jurisdictions was reviewed. Given the law as it presently stands in Saskatchewan the Crown does not have an obligation to prove that bodily harm caused by the assault was objectively foreseeable and that the assault would subject the victim to the risk of bodily harm. The Court of Appeal expressly stated that R. v. Nurse was incorrectly decided and prefers the approach in R. v. Brooks which held the elements of assault causing bodily harm consist of the mens rea to commit the assault and the intentional application of force which results in bodily harm. 2)The victim would not have suffered bodily harm if the accused had not assaulted him. The assault was more than an insignificant or trivial cause of the bodily harm. While the bodily harm resulted directly from third parties falling on top of the accused and the victim, the third parties involvement was due entirely and as a direct result of the actions of the accused. It was clearly the accused who initiated the pile up. The accused placed the victim in a dangerous position, similar to that in the Samuelson and Brooks decisions. A very short period of time elapsed between the assault and bodily harm.","The accused was charged with assault causing bodily harm contrary to s. 267(b) of the Criminal Code. The accused was standing in front of the victim's car when he was punched and punched. Less than one minute later the victim was run over by a truck. HELD: The accused's charge was dismissed. 1)The evidence as outlined by the accused on his own behalf and Richard Schmitt was correct. The evidence as presented by the other disinterested witnesses was at variance in material ways. The Court held that the kick was not a contributing cause of death outside the deminimus range and that the assault would not have resulted in a pile-up. The second question was answered in the affirmative. While the bodily harm resulted from the effect of third parties falling on top of the accused and Mr. Brown, the third parties involved in the assault were due entirely and as direct result of the actions of the defendant. The third party involvement was due entirely, as direct as the actionsof the accused. The victim placed the victim in a dangerous position, similar to the accused in the Samuelson and Brooks decisions. The court also held that there was a very short period of time elapsed between the assault and the bodily damage. The assault was not considered a contributing factor but rather a contributing one."

HELD: Appeal dismissed. 1)The Court found no error in the trial judge's determination.,"The appellants appealed their judgment of the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act. They claimed thecharge had not been obtained by fraud. The Court held that the appeal, insofar as it was based on s. 180(2) of the bankruptcy & Insolcy Act, which may or may not apply to the judgment held by the appellants, we wish to make it clear that we have made no finding in that respect, since that question was not before us."
c_2013skqb155.txt,"The Crown appealed a decision of the Provincial Court dismissing an application for a recognizance pursuant to s. 810.2 of the Criminal Code. The judge held that the usual rules of evidence pertaining to criminal trials apply to a s. 810.2 hearing and that records kept by the Correctional Services of Canada (CSC) were inadmissible as business records under s. 30 of the Canada Evidence Act. The respondent had been convicted in 2009 of robbery with violence, assault causing bodily harm, assault and three counts of violating bail. He was sentenced to three years' imprisonment. In May 2010, the CSC referred the respondent's case to the National Parole Board (NPB) with a recommendation that he be detained until warrant expiry, in accordance with s. 129(2) of the Corrections and Conditional Release Act (CCRA). The recommendation was based upon the character of the respondent's offences and where there are reasonable grounds to believe that the offender is likely to commit another offence causing death or serious harm if released on parole. The NPB ordered that the respondent be detained in custody until the expiry of the sentence. Reviewed annually under the CCRA, the CSC prepared another assessment in 2011 and the respondent was not released from custody until March 2012. At that point, a 'warrant expiry package' was prepared by a parole officer, comprised of CSC records relating to the respondent, including a criminal profile report, the assessment for decision reports and copies of the NPB's reasons for ordering detention. These records were sent to the RCMP in Saskatchewan. The officer concerned then swore the information under s. 810.2, stating that he believed that there were reasonable grounds to believe that the respondent would commit a serious personal offence as defined by s. 752 of the Code. The application for a hearing was commenced in August 2012. The parole officer and the RCMP officer were called to testify and the Crown applied to have the documents in the package admitted into evidence, and the respondent opposed the application. The judge refused to allow the admission of the report, the assessment and the NPB reasons for ordering detention based upon R. v. Fontaine and R. v. Toulejour. Based on the business rules exception, the judge held that the criminal report profile was inadmissible because it was a copy and not accompanied by supporting affidavits as required by s. 30(3) of the CEA. HELD: The Court held that the application was allowed. The Supreme Court had confirmed that s. 810 hearings are not criminal trials and that the rules of evidence in criminal trials do not apply. Hearsay evidence is admissible and the judge is to determine whether or not sufficient weight can be given to the hearsay evidence to establish reasonable and probable grounds required for the individual to swear the information to justify the fear of harm to others by the respondent. The Court held that all of the CSC records submitted as part of the package were admissible under the CEA. The Court directed that the matter be returned for a new hearing of the original application.","This is an appeal from the Provincial Court dismissing an application for a recognizance pursuant to s. 810.2 of the Criminal Code. The issue is whether the usual rules of evidence pertaining to criminal trials apply to s810 hearing. The Provincial Court judge ruled that the usual Rules of evidence apply and that hearsay evidence is not admissible in s.810. 2 hearing. HELD: The appeal is dismissed. 1) The Court decided based on R. v. Fontaine, 2010 SKPC 16 (CanLII), 356 Sask.R. 330, that the normal criminal rules of law apply to this s.810 hearing. 2) The court found that s.880.2 hearings are not criminal trials. The usual rules to be applied in criminal trials do not apply. 3) The test of proof is both subjective and objective. It must be established that the victim actually fears that the defendant will cause personal injury to him; and that there are reasonable grounds for the fear. The Crown's written reasons for detaining the respondent in 2010 and 2011 were not signed. 4) The standard of review is correctness on a question of law. 5) The application for an order declaring that s8 10 hearings are inadmissible does not require formal sworn evidence such as viva voce evidence commonly used in criminal proceedings. The court also found that records kept by the Crown were inadadmissible as business records under s.30 of the Canada Evidence Act. 6) The Crown must establish that the informant actually fears the defendant Will cause personal Injury to him. The first condition is subjective, while the second is objective; namely, the Crown must prove subjectively the informant's belief and whether his belief is objectively founded. 7) The usual criminal rules apply to criminal proceedings, which are the normal rules of a s.786 hearing. 8) The issue has been dealt with by the Supreme Court of Canada in similar provisions of the Criminal Code, which were based on the standard of reviewing set out in R.No.7 of the Code. 9) The decision at all court levels up to and including the Supreme court confirm that s723(1) is an acceptable procedure because the judge refused to allow the admission of the criminal profile report, assessment for decision reports and the Crown's reasons for ordering detention admitted into evidence. 10) The normal criminal rule of evidence applies to s7000 hearings.

2_2008skca172.txt,"The appellant was tried by Queen's Bench judge sitting alone and found guilty of operating a motor vehicle while his ability to operate the vehicle was impaired by alcohol, thereby causing death contrary to s. 255(3) of the Criminal Code, and causing bodily harm contrary to s. 255(2) of the Code. He was sentenced to 5 years imprisonment after having been given credit of 1 year for the time served on remand. The appellant appeals both his conviction and sentence. On the conviction appeal the appellant raises a technical ground in relation to the manner in which the appellant was charged as well as issues of the propriety and fairness of the cross-examination of himself by Crown counsel, the admissibility of his criminal record at trial, and the admissibility of opinion evidence proved in the testimony of the Crown's expert witness on accident reconstruction. He also argues that the trial judge failed to find that the fact that the appellant was impaired at the time of the collision was the cause of the collision and that his conclusion was unreasonable and against the weight of the evidence. HELD: Appeal dismissed.  1) The trial judge has a discretion pursuant to R. v. Corbett, [1988] 1 S.C.R. 670, to exclude prejudicial evidence of prior convictions in an appropriate case. This discretion is exercised by the trial judge on the application of an accused at the close of the Crown's case. See R. v. Underwood, [1998] 1 S.C.R. 77. As such an application was not raised in this case, and the questioning about previous convictions by the Crown was not objected to when it occurred, and the issue of the appellant's previous alcohol related offences was raised in the appellant's own examination in chief, this court concludes that there is no basis for this Court to conclude that the cross-examination was inappropriate or that the evidence adduced was inadmissible.  2) It is not proper for Crown counsel to ask an accused on cross-examination to explain the testimony of a Crown witness, and that it is highly unfair and prejudicial to require an accused to agree with a Crown witness or stigmatize that witness as a 'liar'. Crown counsel should not have put these sorts of questions and the trial judge ought not to have permitted them. Defence counsel did not object to them. However, this Court is not satisfied that this error had any effect on the trial and this ground of appeal fails.  3) The Crown elicited opinion evidence from Constable Gibson in the area of accident reconstruction. No evidence was at any time offered as to his expertise to do so, other than his curriculum vitae, which was filed. This witness's evidence as to how the bodies might have moved in the vehicle in the course of the collision and its aftermath, and in particular, his conclusory opinion that Ms. McDermott was the passenger and Mr. Bear the driver, ought not to have been received in the absence of a ruling that he was qualified as an expert in relation to those matters, and that his expertise was necessary in relation to the subject matter of his testimony, and that his opinion was based on facts before the Court. 4) The appellant was charged and convicted with offences pursuant to s. 255(2) and s. 255(3) of the Criminal Code. The appellant argues that conviction requires that the appellant has been charged with an offence pursuant to s. 253(a). There is no merit in this ground of appeal. Impaired driving causing death and bodily harm are routinely charged in this manner. 5) This Court's review of the cross-examination of the appellant supports the trial judge's assessment of it as unbelievable. In light of the trial judge's findings of credibility, and the results of the DNA analysis of the samples taken, the evidence overwhelmingly supports the verdict reached by the trial judge that the appellant was driving. The conclusory opinions expressed by Constable Gibson in relation to the movements of the occupants in the truck, and as to who was driving the vehicle, played no meaningful role in a conclusion that was, compelled by the remaining evidence. Notwithstanding the errors apparent in the receipt of opinion evidence from Constable Gibson, there was no substantial miscarriage of justice. The appeal from conviction is dismissed. 6) The trial judge did not commit any error of principle in coming to the conclusion that an appropriate sentence was 6 years imprisonment. While the sentence is at the high end of the available range, it is not outside the range available in the circumstances of this case.","The appellant was convicted of operating a motor vehicle while his ability to operate the vehicle was impaired by alcohol, thereby causing the death of his passenger and causing bodily harm to the driver. The appellant argued that the trial judge erred in sentencing him to five years imprisonment as well as the sentence imposed because the Crown did not object to his cross-examination. The issue on appeal was whether the appellant was the driver of the truck at the time of the collision. HELD: Appeal dismissed. 1)The trial judge allowed the appellant to be cross-examined on all of his criminal record even though some of his prior convictions were not relevant to the issue of credibility and his admission of that part of the record was therefore more prejudicial than probative. 2)The appellant raised a number of valid objections to his questioning of himself by the Crown. He was allowed to offer an opinion on the issue at trial but objected to his giving opinion evidence on the question of where the occupants of the vehicle were seated. 3)The Crown did nothing improper in allowing the appellant's cross- examination. The trial judge clearly had discretion pursuant to Corbett to exclude prejudicial evidence of prior convictions in an appropriate case. However, the trial court was not satisfied that this error had any effect on the trial. The appeal court found that the appellant had been prejudiced by the questions and the Crown should not have put these questions and it ought not have been allowed. The Crown should have put the questions in the context of the Crown's witnesses. 4)The defence did not attempt to shift the onus of proof to the accused. The questioning about previous criminal convictions by the police was not objected to when it occurred. 5)The cross-and-examination was relatively innocuous and did not play a major role in the evidence of the appellant. The question of whether the respondent was the only person present at the scene of the accident was put in issue. The evidence of whether he was the person driving the truck was not raised in the absence of the admission of portions of his record on the basis of the Corbett decision. The respondent's evidence as to how the bodies might have moved within the vehicle in the course of the event was not opposed to when the collision occurred. The only issue at the trial was whether it was the appellant or the respondent who was the driving driver."
d_2013skca10.txt,"The appellant plead guilty to two counts of sexual assault, was declared a dangerous offender and sentenced to an indeterminate sentence. The appellant appealed the sentence arguing that the sentencing judge failed to give adequate consideration to the assessment of two expert witnesses who testified that they thought the appellant should be found a long-term offender. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. The sentencing judge was not bound to accept the assessment of the experts. Both experts testified that the appellant's risk to reoffend sexually was moderate to high and was extremely high if he did not receive treatment. Both experts based their opinions, in part, on the idea that the appellant had been a model inmate. Both experts believed the appellant's self report about his behaviour in custody, despite having reached the conclusion that he was a pathological liar. Both experts appeared to take the accused at face value when he said he was motivated to change. In fact, the evidence from correctional officials suggested that the appellant was prone to violent, aggressive and irrational behaviour in custody. He had shown on numerous occasions that he would not follow the rules in the institution and had been involved in several attempts to smuggle drugs into the jail, including picking up a package in the washroom of the court house during his dangerous offender hearing and convincing his lawyer to bring his baby into the jail with drugs in his diaper. The accused had committed two sexual assaults within months of being released from a previous sexual assault sentence. The trial judge was correct to emphasize protection of the public and was entitled to discount the opinion of the experts because it was based on incorrect assumptions. In supporting the sentencing judge's opinion that the accused would not take treatment because he refused to accept responsibility for his offences, the Court of Appeal noted that the accused had stated in his Notice of Appeal that he was serving a life sentence for two sexual assaults that he did not commit and the fact that he sent a letter to the Court saying that he had been falsely accused and did not sexually assault anyone. In addition, the Court considered fresh evidence that the appellant had refused to transfer to another institution in order to participate in high-intensity sex offender treatment pending his appeal.",The defendant was convicted of two counts of sexual assault. The court declared him a dangerous offender and sentenced him to an indeterminate sentence. The defendant vacillated between cooperating with the assessment and maintaining that he was coerced into pleading guilty. The predicate offences that led to the defendant being classified as dangerous offender were two sexual assaults. The Defendant pled guilty to these offences. The Court found that the defendant had been consistently aggressive and belligerent while in custody. The fact that the Defendant had not taken the high intensity sexual offender program which the experts had identified was a factor in his decision to be classified as a dangerous person. The trial judge failed to give adequate consideration to the opinions of the experts. The sentencing judge failedto give adequate due consideration to both the assessment of the two expert witnesses who both recommended he be declared a long-term offender and to an indefinite sentence.
d_2006nsca24.txt,"In the context of a divorce proceeding, the husband filed an interlocutory application for, inter alia, the termination of spousal support, and the sale of the matrimonial home. The Chambers judge ordered that the matrimonial home be sold and the assets equally divided between the spouses. The wife appealed. Appeal allowed; certain provisions of the Order struck or temporarily lifted to permit the parties a reasonable opportunity to make timely alternative arrangements to resolve the matters in issue consensually, short of selling the matrimonial home; the court's intervention was necessary to prevent a patent injustice. There was no mention of any division of matrimonial assets in the notice filed by the husband and in the unique circumstances of this case, it was unrealistic and unfair to address the issue of selling the house without at the same time taking into account its value and the parties' individual contributions to that value.","The husband applied to have the matrimonial home sold and to have its mortgage interest paid off on the basis that the matristonial home was worth $170,000. The wife, who had been cut off from her husband's medical insurance coverage, needed spousal support to continue paying the spousals and to return certain personal belongings. She also wanted title to the matron home back with all the money that had been put into it when the marriage was over. The husband applied for an interlocutory order that the home be sold and that the equity in the home would be divided equally after deducting legal fees and real estate commission. The mother appealed the Chambers judge's decision claiming a reversible error in his attempts to justify selling the matrionial home and divide the proceeds of sale equally between the parties. Appeal allowed; case remitted to the Supreme Court on an expedited basis for rehearing and proper determination; the judge ordered that the matter could not be heard again. Findings of credibility were entirely within the province and did not require any comment from the court; the court could not intervene if the matter was to be decided at any other time."

As of September 2007, the petitioner has arrears of about $2,900. He now applies to set his child support obligation and deal with the arrears. The petitioner claims he has been paying too much in child support under the Guidelines. HELD: 1) In terms of ongoing support, it is appropriate to determine the petitioner's income on the basis of the three year average of his employment income being $21,834 and add to that the $5,100 in rental income for a total of $26,934. The petitioner is actively engaged in farming. He pursues reasonable off farm income. In the absence of something further, the Court was not prepared to impute income. He shall pay child support of $221 per month.  2) In terms of the payor's ability to pay at the time the arrears accrued, the petitioner says he was paying in excess of his legal obligation. It is true that if one looked to his employment income the table amount would be approximately half of the $300 per month non-taxable that the petitioner agreed to pay back in 1992. However, one cannot ignore the fact that he agreed to pay it. He did nothing to seek to change this obligation in all of the intervening years. The petitioner's farming operation affords the petitioner an opportunity to manage his financial affairs. By reporting a farm loss each year, the petitioner in fact pays less tax on his employment income than he would otherwise pay. In the circumstances the Court was not prepared to rescind any of the arrears.","FIAT: The child support order of December 11, 1991 was registered in this Court January 27, 1992 pursuant to the Reciprocal Enforcement of Maintenance Orders Act, 1983. Under that order the petitioner was to pay ongoing child support of $300 per month. Arrears have accumulated and he seeks to expunge them. The petitioner is part of a family farm operation. He supplements his farm income with working for part of the season at a local sporting store. This generates some rental income. The respondent takes the position the petitioner's line 150 income does not reflect his ability to pay. The farm loss in 2006 was $5,100 per month and the respondent notes that when the petitioner recently sought financing for a half ton truck he indicated his income was $6,100.

2011skpc153.txt,The accused was charged with dangerous driving. The evidence established that the accused was observed driving a black Mustang that accelerated quickly from a red light. The police officer observed the vehicle accelerate over a period of two to three blocks and used radar to clock the vehicle's top speed at 140 km/hr. The posted speed limit is 60 km/hr. The intersection was near a church and school yard. There is a bend in the street near where this speeding occurred. HELD: The accused was convicted of dangerous driving. The accused was travelling well over twice the posted speed limit for that portion of roadway. The bend in the road adds to the danger. The accused was driving within the confines of a city and his actions were planned and deliberate. His conduct is a marked departure from the standard expected of a reasonably prudent driver.,The accused was charged with operating a motor vehicle on a highway in a manner that was dangerous to the public contrary to s.249(1)(a) of the Criminal Code. The accused was stopped behind a police officer as he was approaching a controlled intersection. The officer locked in his vehicle at one hundred and forty kilometres an hour in a sixty kilometre zone and the accused was racing at a high speed at one mile an hour. The police officer activated his emergency equipment and the vehicle accelerated for two to three blocks before locking in at one- hundred and 40 km an hour (60 km/h) in a tight lane. At this point the officer noted heavy traffic on the roadway and the posted speed limit was 60 km/hr. The vehicle was still accelerating and it was at this point that the officer locked the vehicle speed at 1 hundred and 45 km/hour. The evidence was not in dispute. The driver of the Mustang was seen accelerating for two-and-a-half blocks at a rate of over one hundred mile anhour and the officer observed the vehicle log some heavy traffic. The posted speed limits in this area are 60 and 65 km/H. The driving must constitute a marked departure from the standard expected for reasonably prudent drivers.
8_2008skqb481.txt,"FIAT: The applicant seeks an order setting aside a wage assessment certificate issued by the Director of the Labour Standards Branch (the Director) and filed with this Court. The applicant disputes liability for the amount set out in the wage assessment and claim that he inadvertently and innocently missed the time within which to file an appeal. The issues are whether this Court has jurisdiction to set aside the Director's certificate filed with the Court of Queen's Bench, if so what criteria ought to be applied in determining whether the Court should exercise its discretion and whether the applicant has satisfied the criteria. HELD: 1) Even though an appeal from a wage assessment to the appeals board and an appeal from an adjudicator to the Court of Queen's Bench both require 'appeals' within '21 days', an appeal to the Court of Queen's Bench is a true appeal while an 'appeal' to the appeals board is essentially a request for a de novo hearing. Consequently, this Court concludes that the consequences of missing the time limitation are not necessarily the same. 2) This Court does have jurisdiction to deal with an applicant's request, on a director appeal, because it is not a 'true appeal' that questions a decision made by an independent adjudicator after a hearing. Accordingly, the reasoning of this Court in Farmers of North America Inc. v. Langridge, 2004 SKQB 375, is not applicable. A finding that this Court is without jurisdiction to set aside a judgment, obtained without any independent adjudicative process, regardless of the basis upon which that judgment was obtained, is inequitable and at odds with existing practices and procedures. Section 62.4(4) of The Labour Standards Act states that a certificate filed pursuant to s. 62.4(3) has the same force and effect as if it were a judgment obtained in the Court of Queen's Bench for the recovery of a debt. This Court certainly would have jurisdiction to determine whether or not the applicant's application to open up a noting for default should be granted pursuant to Rule 114(3), Rule 271 and Rule 346. It follows that this Court is able to look behind the filing and examine the circumstances under which that judgment was entered. The Court of Queen's Bench is a superior Court charged with the administration of justice and enjoys inherent as well as statutory jurisdiction. This inherent jurisdiction cannot be removed by either level of government without constitutional amendment. 3) It is fair and equitable to apply, by analogy, the principles and resulting rules formulated relating to opening up a default judgment to the applicant's request to set aside the judgment registered in circumstances where he has failed to file an appeal disputing a wage assessment to the registrar of appeals.  4) The evidence is that the applicant is a businessman running a commercial enterprise in Foam Lake. It is expected that somebody in his position would have the savvy to read, review and understand the document, or at least seek assistance from someone who could help him. The applicant either failed or declined to read, or chose to ignore, the plain language of the documents served on him by registered mail. This amounts to wilful blindness at the very least. Numerous cases hold that wilful blindness is not sufficient reason to set aside a noting for default. In these circumstances the Court is not prepared to exercise its discretion in favour of setting aside the Director's certificate filed as a judgment of this Court.","FIAT: The applicant brings an application seeking an order setting aside a certificate issued by the Director of the Labour Standards Branch (the Director) and filed with the Court of Queen's Bench. The applicant disputes liability for the amount set out in the wage assessment and claims that he inadvertently and innocently missed the time within which to file an appeal. HELD: 1) The Court does have jurisdiction to set aside the certificate. It is not a true appeal that questions a decision made by an independent adjudicator after a hearing. 2) The document itself contained all the information the applicant would have needed to process the appeal. 3) The applicant has not demonstrated that the third party appeal process has been met. If the appeal is not conducted within 21 days, the Court must exercise its discretion to grant the equitable relief requested in this case. 4) The application is to be made as soon as possible after the judgment sought to be set aside comes to the applicant in the event of any delay. An appeal from a wage assessment to the appeals board is a true appeals. 5) The Certificate is properly issued as permitted by s. 62.4(1)(a). 6) The certificate has a clear information as to where to serve a notice of appeal and a hearing could be scheduled. 7) The handwritten letter to the adjudicator is sufficient compliance. 8) The Director's certificate is properly filed with this Court. 9) The issues raised in this application are whether the Court has jurisdiction to open up a director's certificate filed with Queen's Cross on the same basis that the Court would open up noting for default or set aside default judgment. 10) The principles and considerations that apply to director appeals are well settled. There has been no independent evidentiary based finding that would suggest or from which it could be reasonably inferred that the applicant cannot read or has any limitations that might effect his ability to understand the documentation served upon him. 11) The deficiencies in the applicant's explanation and the manner in which he chose to make this allegation, combined with the lack of a satisfactory explanation as to why it was that he did not file the appeal within 21 day, does not constitute sufficient reason to set off the certificate and is contrary to the Court's discretion to refuse to grant an extension of time in which to bring an appeal (see: R.S.S.). 12) The fact that the wage assessor served the applicant a letter by registered mail ought to have underscored the importance of the document.

9_2008skca107.txt,"This appeal arises from a dispute between the appellant, Dr. Huerto and the respondent Government of Saskatchewan, over the payment for medical services provided by Dr. Huerto to his patients. Over a period of approximately 10 years, the Government withheld payment in relation to what eventually amounted to some 12,000 of the appellant's accounts. The Government indicated through the use of a billing code, that the accounts would not be paid until further information was provided. The appellant believed the use of the billing code was unlawful and chose not to provide additional information. He started an action in the Court of Queen's Bench to compel payment of his accounts. His claim was largely dismissed on the basis that the action was premature. The appellant appeals from the Queen's Bench ruling and the Government cross-appeal in relation to the limited aspect of the case in which Dr. Huerto enjoyed success. HELD: Appeal and Cross-appeal dismissed.  1) Section 17(1)(c) of The Saskatchewan Medical Care Insurance Act is to the effect that the intention and purpose of the Act is not to establish a medical care insurance plan under which 'the exercise of professional judgment by physicians is in any way diminished'. This broad statement of principle should not be read so aggressively as to mean the Government, as the payor in a publicly funded health care system, has no right to ask questions about the accounts presented for payment by physicians. The Government has not denied payment of the appellant's accounts. Nor has it received the requested information from the appellant. The actions (the Protocol) taken by the Government cannot be characterized as an amendment of the Payment Schedule. The Protocol is an administrative tool which sets out the situations in which the appellant will be asked for further information about the provision of specific services. This is fully in line with the terms of the Schedule. 2) Section 5(1) of the Regulations should not be read as meaning the Government is entitled to ask for additional information about a service if, and only if, the nature of the service is 'unusual'. Rather, it simply stipulates that additional remarks must be included in an account rendered with respect to an unusual service. This does not imply the government can request extra information only in relation to an unusual service. A physician's obligation to include certain material in an account and the Government's authority to ask for additional information are ultimately two quite different things. 3) The Court does not accept that the appellant's claims were barred by s. 16(1) of the Act. It would be perverse to read the Act as requiring that, in order for an account to be paid, every bit of information demanded by the Government through the use of a billing code, or otherwise, must be supplied before the expiration of the 6 month period established by the Regulations. An account submitted the day before the expiration of the 6 month deadline would be voided by the application of the billing code. An account submitted well in advance of the expiration of the 6 month period would also be effectively denied if a request for further information was not made until at or near the end of the six month time limit, with the result that there was insufficient time for a physician to respond before that limit was exceeded. These potential problems are especially troublesome because there is an element of subjectivity in the application of the Protocol and even the most diligent physician might not accurately anticipate when an account or accounts will attract a request for extra comment. 4) The Court cannot accept the Government's submission that the trial judge should have declined to deal with the appellant's claim because the appellant had not fully pursued possible appeals to the Medical assessment Board. The Legislature in s. 40(3) of the Act has expressly provided that the appeal procedure established pursuant to the Act does not prejudice a physician's right to pursue matters in the courts. It stands entirely at odds with the notion that the appeal procedures in the Act should be read as being comprehensive and exhaustive.","Dr. Huerto commenced an action against the Government in the Court of Queen's Bench to compel payment of his accounts. Over a period of approximately 10 years, the Government withheld payment in relation to what eventually amounted to some 12,000 accounts. He appealed from the Queen'sBench ruling. The Government cross-appealed in relation the limited aspect of the case in which Dr. Huerta's claim may fail. Appeal dismissed; cross- appeal dismissed. The aspects of the Protocol impugned by Dr.Huerto are not inconsistent with the Payment Schedule. However, the principles of the Payment schedule and the underlying assumption that an account need not be paid merely because the services underpinning such accounts have been provided are not the same as other medical services. The principles of payment and the approach used by the Government to resolve the accounts are not consistent with s.17(1)(c). The principles and approach used in this appeal are not so aggressively as to mean the Government has no right to ask questions about the accounts presented for payment by physicians. Rather, they are best characterized as an individualized administrative process, which allows the Government, as the payor in a publicly funded health care system, to look behind the face of the accounts presenting for payment. The Protocol is best characterized by the use of a particular billing code which allows for the Government's request for further information about the services that underpinning the accounts. Such matters can only be addressed through a JMPRC established pursuant to s.49.2 of the MCIA. The protocol is not inconsistent. However the aspects of it that impugn the payment schedule are not, as it does not provide an individualization of payment, a mechanism to allow the Government for requesting further information. The application of the protocol allows the government to request more information about services underpinned by the AU code, in appropriate situations, to deny payment of an account. In this case, the trial judge concluded that the Government had not attempted to regulate the plaintiff's pattern of practice through the use the AU codes. The issue is whether the Protocol is an attempt to regulate his pattern of practices by or through the application of a standard procedure. The standard procedure is not the only one that can be used to regulate a physician's pattern. The approach used was not one of convenience or convenience but of necessity."
4_2005nssc253.txt,"The plaintiff in a rear end motor vehicle accident applied for summary judgment and an interim payment. The defendant argued that there was an arguable issue to be tried in that even if one accepted the plaintiff's evidence, there was the issue of contributory negligence to be considered. The defendant also argued that he did not see any brake lights on the plaintiff's vehicle and thus there was an issue as to whether or not they were working. Application for summary judgment granted as to liability with damages to be assessed; application for interim payment dismissed. There was no 'air of reality' to the defence; to strike the plaintiff's vehicle from behind on these facts meant that the defendant was travelling too close or didn't have proper care or control of his vehicle. However, the affidavit evidence showed that there were several other factors affecting the plaintiff's health besides the injuries sustained in the motor vehicle accident; serious issues existed between the parties at to whether or not the plaintiff's injuries sustained in the motor vehicle accident resulted in any ongoing inability to work in any capacity; any amount of assessed damages which might be arrived at would largely depend upon credibility and the medical evidence at trial.","The Plaintiff made a significant claim for summary judgment pursuant to Civil Procedure Rule 13.01 and an interim payment under Rule 31.01. The defendant argued that she should not be successful in her application for summary judgement because she had not been able to establish the motor vehicle accident resulted in her suffering injuries. The plaintiff argued that her injuries should be assessed as a 'bonafide defence' and that there should be an 'air of realty' to the defendant's argument. The summary judgment was granted and the application for damages was allowed. Judgement was entered against the defendant for liability with damages to be assessed. The court was satisfied that summary judgment is not to be allowed when there is any issue other than the amount of damages still in issue between the parties, which interpret to only be the case after causation has been determined as part of the summary judgment application. There was no 'air' to his argument that the Plaintiff's prior conditions would all combine to contribute in significant way to her current health complaints. The only issue to be determined was whether the Plaintiff had suffered a minor injury in the motorveh accident. The administration of costs were allowed in the cause of the action."
d_2006nssc73.txt,"Custodial arrangements for the parties two youngest children (aged 15 and 13), who currently lived with the father the majority of the time, were at issue. The marriage had been traditional, with the wife being the primary caretaker of the children. Both children were heavily involved in sporting activities and the father felt that since he was retired, he would be better able to ensure their attendance at various games and practices. The mother, who had recently commenced employment as a social worker, felt that the current interim arrangement was difficult for the children in that they would forget their school books at the other parent's residence and were sometimes left alone for extended periods at the father's residence. Children placed in the custody and primary care of the mother; until the separation, the mother had been the primary caretaker of the children and she appeared to have a stronger emotional bond with them; the father had been physically, emotionally and verbally abusive to the wife throughout the marriage and seemed incapable of putting the children's needs above his own; and the mother was much more likely than the father to encourage the children to have contact with the other parent. Although the father was retired and might have more time to spend with the children, this did not outweigh all of the other factors.","The parties were married for four years and had four children. The petitioner had been employed as a taxi driver for many years and obtained a university degree. She worked part-time and then became a social worker. The parties had four young children, aged eight, 13 and 14. The respondent was employed as an executive with the federal government. He lived in the matrimonial home which was far from complete. The two older children, ages eight and twelve, lived with their mother when they were living with their father. The mother was a social Worker. She earned two university degrees and a doctorate. The children's academic performance was poor and they did not receive proper meals while with their dad. The court found that it would be in the best interests of the children to be in their custody and primary care of their mother. The father was employed with the Department of Transport and later with theDepartment of Fisheries and Oceans. He earned a doctor's license and obtained two university degree but was a taxidriver. The wife was a stay-at-home mom. She was to have primary care and the parties' living arrangements were to be determined through an assessment of the parties'. The court awarded the mother $10,000 per month in child support and ordered custody to the parties. The husband was to pay child support of $5,000.00 per month until the children moved out. The Court found that the parties had a permanent breakdown of the marriage and there was no possibility of reconciliation. The parents were unable to find a permanent solution to the problems between them. The child support payments were to continue to be paid by the parties and would be deferred to a later date. The evidence showed that the husband was preoccupied with financial issues. The family lived in poverty and it was important to maintain their dignity and that their children be protected from the burden of debt. The courts were required to consider the needs of the oldest child in particular."

HELD: The application was dismissed with costs to the respondents in any event of the cause. The applicant did not demonstrate an entitlement to injunctive relief on the second and third stages of the three stage test. The applicant demonstrated there was a serious question to be tried but failed to demonstrate it would suffer irreparable harm. The delay (the action was commenced February 16, 1998) was considered. On balance the respondents would suffer greater harm if the injunction were granted as the respondent Nylen makes his living marketing and selling potassium sulphate.","The plaintiff Potash Corp. (PSP) Alsask, a specialty fertilizer company, incorporated in 1995 and is the parent company of Potash Sulphate Corp. and is incorporated in Alsasp. The defendant is attempting to assert that it somehow has a proprietary interest in the scientific principles of ion exchange and crystallization. Potash is a specialty fertiliser company and the name of one of the defendants in the within action is 'Plastic Sulphates'. The defendant obtained an exclusive license in 1997 from the plaintiff to use the technology described in the Technology Licensing Agreement used by the defendant. The plaintiff later purchased the defendant's assets and did not use the original technology. The defendants eventually placed PSP in receivership and the company no longer carries on business. The court ordered further injunctive relief and ordered that the defendants not sell or marketing any potassium sulphate to the plaintiff until further court order. The applicant also requested further injunctions and other ancillary relief ordered by way of injunction or otherwise as counsel may advise and the court may allow. The applicants were granted these items. The affidavit filed by the plaintiff's former employee indicated that he had no knowledge of the details of the defendant’s technology and that the defendant had assured him that it was not based upon or influenced by the information contained in the agreement.

The Court was unable to determine the precise nature of the violation of the provisions of the Technology Act. 4) The plaintiff was also not prevented from marketing or selling any potassium chloride to third parties. The factual foundation upon which the applicant relies is that the applicant entered into the Technology License Agreement with the view to considering Big Quill’ s potassium sulphates production system as possible option for its Alsaska plant. If the applicant decided not to use Big Quills’ equipment, it would become obliged to pay the fee specified in the Agreement.

The plaintiff had sought a full refund of tax paid on refrigeration equipment at a pickled herring plant (whose product was to be supplied on contract overseas) on the ground the equipment was used in the 'manufacture or production of goods for sale.' The contract stipulated that most of the processing occur at controlled cold temperatures. The defendant apportioned tax based on the time the equipment was used in the actual 'transformation or conversion' of the product. For the plaintiff, that (1) the tax exemption did not depend on the extent to which the equipment was used in the manufacturing process; and (2) since the contract required most of the process to occur under refrigeration, the use of a cold room was part of the 'manufacture or production' of the product.","Continental Seafoods applied for a refund of health services tax paid on refrigeration equipment which was installed in a new facility for pickled whole herring.

The accused contended his right to be secure against unreasonable search and seizure as guaranteed by s.8 of the Charter and his right not to be arbitrarily detained or imprisoned as guaranteed by s.9 of the Charter were breached. In issue was whether the RCMP officer had the jurisdiction to carry out his duties as a peace officer in the City of Prince Albert; if so, was he acting in the lawful execution of his duties in conducting random stop. HELD: The accused was found guilty of driving with a blood alcohol level greater than .08. A judicial stay was entered in relation to the impaired count on which he would have been found guilty if it were necessary. 1)The language used by Parliament in the Royal Mounted Police Act is clear, broad and unambiguous as it was their obvious intention to create a police force that operates without jurisdictional barriers throughout the entire country of Canada. When there is a limitation on their duties it is clearly stated. The Police Act does not mention any exclusivity between one force and another. Given the ultra vires statute construction doctrine it would not be appropriate for provincial legislation to take away powers given by the Federal legislation. The Police Act must be read in context as providing a manner of funding policing not a manner of taking away jurisdiction granted to RCMP officers. 2)The law is now clear that the police can detain vehicles as long as they do so for the purposes of checking for sobriety, licences, ownership, insurance and other mechanical fitness of motor vehicles. The R. v. Emke decision is outdated. 3)The officer was acting in the lawful execution of his duty. There was no breach of the accused's rights under the Charter.","The accused was charged with two offences contrary to s. 255(1) and s. 253(a) of the Criminal Code and driving a marked police vehicle while impaired contrary to ss. 253 and 253(b) of that Code. The police officer was on duty in uniform and driving marked police car when he observed the accused operating a marked vehicle. The officer observed the vehicle displaying an out of date sticker on it's license plate in violation of S. 27(5) of The Highway Traffic Act. The RCMP were not responsible for policing a particular part of the province and were not permitted to stop the vehicle. On the facts the officer was mistaken and had the jurisdiction to make the demand and the officer thereafter followed the officer out of the vehicle for approximately two minutes. The accused blew 170 and 160 respectively on the breathalyser tests and blew 170. Both tests were met and the accused blew 160. The Court concluded that the police officer's ability to operate a motor vehicle was impaired and that his right to secure against unreasonable search and seizure guaranteed by s. 22 of the Charter and his right not to be arbitrarily detained or imprisoned as guaranteed by ss. 27 and 28 of the Code and his Right to be Free from unreasonable search, seizure and detention guaranteed by section 22 of The Charter and the right not be arbitrarily detained or imprisoned by ss.(a) and (b) respectively) and that the words of the police Act must be read in their grammatical and ordinary sense in light of the intention of the legislature not a manner of taking away jurisdiction granted to the officer by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police Act."

Solicitor and client fees totaled over $21,000.

The plaintiffs were successful in recovering the base amount claimed but did not succeed in their claims for aggravated and punitive damages. The defendant should have admitted liability sooner rather than forcing the plaintiffs to trial. Costs should be substantially increased above the usual party and party costs because, as he contended, the defendant ought to have admitted responsibility sooner rather then forcing the plaintiff to trial, and the manner in which the proceeding was conducted set out the factors that the court may consider in fixing costs. The conduct of any party which tended to shorten or unnecessarily lengthen the duration of the proceeding, and any step in the proceeding which was improper, vexatious, prolix or unnecessary, should have been taken through over-caution, negligence or mistake. This was not an unreasonable amount of costs to recover the base figure claimed but not an excessive amount.

ABank asserted a debt claim against the defendants. The defendants applied pursuant to s. 8 of The Enforcement of Money Judgments Act (EMJA) to terminate the preservation order, which prohibited any dealings with 850,000 shares, or alternatively they sought an order reducing the number of shares subject to the order and requiring the plaintiff to post $3 million as security pursuant to s. 5(7) of the EMJA and $40,000 security for costs. Regarding ABank’s application, it argued that its claim in debt against the defendant arose out of the same transaction based on the allegation that Arslan transferred the shares to a trust (the other defendant was the trustee) in June 2013, the time at which he stopped paying his debts in full and thus denied it the opportunity to collect its debt. ABank sought the same relief as Sekerbank: judgment against both defendants under The Fraudulent Preferences Act and The Fraudulent Conveyances Act. The defendants argued that the limitation period that applied to ABank’s claim had expired and the application should be denied. Regarding the defendants’ application, they argued that the plaintiff’s strategy in the Saskatchewan action was to await the outcome of the proceedings they had initiated in Turkey against the plaintiff. The Saskatchewan action was independent from the Turkish action, and the plaintiff’s approach was unacceptable in the circumstances of the preservation order made against them in 2014. The plaintiff had not prosecuted its actions against them without delay as required by s. 5(c) of the EMJA. The defendants asserted that the share prices increased since 2014 and were now worth $18 million more than the plaintiff’s claim. If the preservation was not terminated, they requested that the number of shares be reduced to 100,000. HELD: The proposed plaintiff’s application was granted. The defendants’ application to terminate the preservation order or to reduce the number of shares subject to the order was dismissed. The court ordered the plaintiff to post $1 million as security under the EMJA and an additional $40,000 as security for costs. The court found that although the limitation period had expired, it would add ABank as a plaintiff and amend the statement of claim pursuant to s. 20 of The Limitations Act, because to do so would not create a wholly new proceeding and the defendants had not provided evidence that they would suffer prejudice. The preservation order was not terminated after the court reviewed the history of the proceedings in both Saskatchewan and Turkey and found that the plaintiff had not failed to prosecute its action without delay. The court found that there was insufficient evidence to justify the reduction in the number of shares subject to the order.  The information of the value of the security fell short of demonstrating a sufficient change in circumstances, especially in light of the addition of ABank’s claim. The court found that the order should be modified under s. 5(7) of the EMJA to have the plaintiff provide security because there was evidence that the trust may have suffered and could suffer losses in the future as a result of the order. The order for security for costs was justified based on the considerations specified in Queen’s Bench rule 4-24.","The defendants applied to terminate the preservation order and for an order reducing the number of shares subject to the order and requiring the plaintiff to post $3,081,463.14 as security pursuant to s5(7) of the Enforcement of Money Judgments Act and $40,000 security for costs. The first application was denied. The defendants sought to amend the order to add the plaintiff as a plaintiff and amendment the statement of claim. HELD: The preservation order was terminated and the statement as claim was amended. 1)The application to add ABank was denied as the defendants had engaged s20 of The Limitations Act. The court must be satisfied that neither of the defendants will suffer actual prejudice as a result of the proposed amendments. 2)There was sufficient temporal and factual relationship between the original and amended claims.  3)The defendants failed to meet the three conditions specified in s20(a) and (b). The failure to prosecute an action without delay could call for a termination of the preservation Order.  4)The court must consider the extent of and reasons for the delay in obtaining the information necessary to enforce the order. The passage of time between the passage of a statute and the passage by a defendant in this case could have prejudiced the plaintiff's ability to respond to the new claim. The delay would not affect the ability of the plaintiff, given the passage between the statute and regulations, to respond properly to the claim. 5)The plaintiff was given leave to amend and amend the preservation orders.  6)The amendments were not necessary to terminate or modify the preservation ordered order. 7)The preservation order remained in effect until the court rendered a final decision on the merits of the applicant's claim against the defendant. 8)The applications to amend or modify were granted in part. The application to include the plaintiff in the Statement of Claim was granted in the amended version."

The certificate of analysis was excluded as a result of the trial judge's decision that the accused's s. 8 Charter Rights had been violated. The trial judge found that the officer did not have reasonable and probable grounds to make the breathalyzer demand. HELD: The trial judge erred in determining that in the totality of the circumstances it was not objectively reasonable for the officer to have relied on the accuracy of the ASD test. A new trial is ordered.  1) There is no fixed rule or formula that an officer must follow when determining whether or not to wait 15 minutes prior to administering a road side test. In this case, the trial judge appears to have concluded that the officer who administered the ASD would not have relied on the results, or should not have so relied, if her partner had informed her of the empty beer can with fresh suds in it that he found at the scene. Implicit in this finding is the conclusion that the existence of the beer can would make a difference to the officer's assessment of whether she should wait 15 minutes for any mouth alcohol to dissipate before she could rely on ASD test results. 2) The trial judge made the same error that was dealt with by the Ontario Court of Appeal in R. v. Einarson. 3) The accused told the officer that he had been drinking in the car 'earlier'. Even if the officer had been told of her partner's discovery of an empty beer can at the scene, it would not constitute 'credible evidence' that the accused consumed alcohol within that 15 minute time frame. Whether or not the accused had consumed beer within 15 minutes of taking the test on the ASD is pure speculation.","The appellant was found not guilty of having care or control of a motor vehicle while his blood alcohol content was over.08. The trial judge found that contrary to s. 8 of the Charter, contrary to Part 1 of the Constitution Act, 1982, being Schedule B to the Canada Act 1982, the officer did not have reasonable and probable grounds to make the breathalyzer demand and further, that pursuant to s24(2) of the charter, the admission of the certificate of analysis could bring the administration of justice in disrepute. The Crown appeals both the trial judge's conclusions and the trial trial judge’s conclusion that under s. 24(2)(the Charter the certificate is excluded from evidence. HELD: The appeal is allowed and the acquittal set aside. The appeal and appeal are allowed and set aside with the acquittals and the conviction set aside on the ground that the trial Judge erred in determining in the totality of the circumstances it was not objectively reasonable for the officer to have relied on the accuracy of the ASD test. The court reviewed the facts in Einarson and concluded that the error was not made lightly. The fact that the respondent was observed leaving the bar was relevant in determining whether it was reasonable for an officer to delay administering the test. Further, the trial court found that the failure to inform the respondent of the contents of two cans of O.V. on the back passenger floor of a vehicle was not an unreasonable delay as it was possible that the driver had consumed alcohol within that 15 minutes prior to the demand."
d_2013skqb394.txt,"HELD: The Court held that the replacement of former Queen’s Bench rule 212 requiring the production of documents “relating” to any matter in question and rule 222 permitting examination for discovery “touching” the matter in issue in the action by new rules 5-6, 5-18 and 5-25, which use the phrase: “relevant to any matter in issue”, showed the intention that the broad relevance test was no longer applicable. The test under the new Rules was whether the matter qualifies as being material to the action based upon the matter as pled and whether the evidence tends to prove or disprove the matter in issue. This inquiry must be balanced against the notion of proportionality set out in the foundational rules. The Court dismissed the application, excepting the requested order under 3) wherein the defendant would fulfill its undertaking to have certain employees provide responses. With respect to the rest of the relief requested under 1), which involved the undertaking that the defendant would search its records regarding the loading of railcars, the Court held that the as matter was not an issue in the action, based upon a review of the claim as pled. Having regard to proportionality under the new rules, the defendant should not be required to answer the question in light of the effort and expense required versus the possible benefits. The Court held that the plaintiffs were not entitled to ask the defendants to review a binder containing hundreds of pages of invoices assembled by the plaintiff regarding its expenditures incurred as a result of the derailment in order for it to advise the plaintiff which invoices the defendant believed were not related to it. It was the plaintiff’s burden to prove its damages and the defendant was not required to assist the plaintiff to do so. The plaintiff’s requested undertaking for the defendant to provide any background documents and information that went into the preparation of sketch of the railcar in question by the defendant’s adjuster was also denied. The adjuster’s file was subject to litigation privilege and unless it was tendered as evidence at trial, there was no implied waiver of that privilege. Regarding the plaintiff’s request in 2), the Court agreed with the defendants that that plaintiff’s request that the defendant answer questions now, rather than after it had completed questioning of the plaintiff, was premature. The defendant had not yet taken a position on the cause of the derailment and they would advise the plaintiff when they had developed one. Rule 5-31 makes it an ongoing obligation to correct answers and there was no evidence in this application that the rules had not been complied with. The Court awarded costs in the amount of $1,500 to the defendants due to the complexity of the application, requiring the submission of briefs of law and the amount of time taken to argue them matters in Chambers.","FIAT: The plaintiff, CN applied to the Court seeking orders that the defendants, Clarke Transport and Clarke Transport, answer certain questions which they refused to answer on discovery. The application raises interesting issues with respect to the proper scope of questioning or examination for discovery. HELD: The application is dismissed. 1) The Court found that when the defendants applied for the proper order of production and questioning under the Queen's Bench Rules, it intended to move away from the broad relevance test that existed under the former Queen's. The Court held that the implied waiver should be narrowly construed and the privilege should be maintained where it is fair to do so and that any claim of privilege that arises from the information provided is not an issue in the action. 2) There was no evidence that the broad scope of the production and question obligations had not been complied with. 3) The history of some 445 railcars identified by CN as previously loaded by Clarke were not pled as an issue. The claim for damages was not raised. 4) The application for costs were dismissed. 5) The court found that the matter of railcars previously loaded was not within the proper subject scope of inquiry. It ordered the defendants to provide proper answers to certain questions and to provide appropriate answers. 6) The applicant was awarded costs within the order of the Court."

The basis of the application is that the parties participated in a Collaborative Law process whereby it is alleged by the respondent that confidential information was shared. The respondent also relies on the provisions of the collaborative law agreement signed by the parties. HELD: 1) The conflict in the facts was apparent and was not resolved by additional evidence. 2) Mr. Sauer agreed to withdraw as counsel so the parties may proceed to pre-trial and a trial without the necessity of a viva voce hearing.,"FIAT: The applicant brings an application for a court order requiring the solicitor to withdraw as solicitor for the applicant. The basis of the application is that the parties participated in a Collaborative Law process whereby it is alleged that Mr. Therrien alleged that confidential information was shared. The applicant submits that it would be a conflict of interest for the solicitor, who has been retained by the parties, to continue to act as her lawyer at trial, as the issues between the parties have not been settled. HELD: The application is granted. The court ordered that the solicitor withdraw as counsel and that the applicant be permitted to continue as counsel. The Court ordered that both lawyers should withdraw as set out in the contract.  1) The court found that the conflict in the facts was apparent at the initial application. The parties were given leave to file additional evidence on the issues which were in conflict. The additional evidence did not resolve the conflicts. 2) The applicant acknowledges that the only way to resolve the conflict would be by holding a viva voce hearing. The only way is by holding that hearing. It would be conflict of interests for the respondent to continue serving as counsel at trial as the parties had not settled on the issue of the Controverted Law contract. The Collaborative law process encourages private and confidential information to be shared at meetings with clients and lawyers, whether or not that information is shareable in court process. The confidential information is not included in the Contract. The collaborative law process encouraged private and sensitive information to being shared at the meetings, whether by a client or through a lawyer. The information is sharedable in the court process and is shared with the clients. The discussions about the possibility of settlement and the need for a viv voce process did not have place in this case. The evidence is insufficient to support a decision by the Court to require the lawyer to withdraw."
e_2007skqb367.txt,"The plaintiff is an employee of the City of Saskatoon and member of the Union. He commenced this claim based on the Indemnity Clause contained in the Union's bylaws. The plaintiff asserts he is involved in Union related litigation and is thus entitled to the benefit of the indemnity clause. HELD: The plaintiff's application for summary judgment is dismissed. The within action is dismissed in full. 1) The essential nature of the debate between the plaintiff and the Union relates to the interpretation of the indemnity clause in the Union bylaws. This is precisely the type of internal dispute that is not within the exclusive realm of the Labour Relations Board. The forum for this contest is the Queen's Bench Court and this Court has jurisdiction to entertain his claim under Queen's Bench Rule 485 for summary judgment. 2) The plaintiff represents himself. He has incurred no legal fees, other than disbursements, but he nonetheless asserts that he is entitled to $50,000. The figure of $50,000 is proffered by the plaintiff as an appropriate sum as he expects the defendant has spent at least that much defending all four actions. 3) It is plain and obvious that the plaintiff's claim is grounded on an interpretation of the indemnity clause that is so illogical and inconsistent with its plain wording that it cannot succeed. The plaintiff's claim for reimbursement of costs not incurred is equally incapable of success.","The plaintiff commenced an action against the union for breach of its by-laws. The plaintiff sought judgment for $50,000 on the basis of a provision in the union's by-law which states:Article XII of the Union's by law is an indemnity by-laws for indemnity. This clause is applicable to all union members. The union was obliged to protect its officers from actions done in the course of their office that made them subject to the plaintiff's or their spouse's litigation. As a result, the union was entitled to indemnify its officers. The dispute distills to an interpretation of the terms of the union membership contract in the form of an indemnification by-llaw. The by-Laws do not have the same stricture as those in the earlier actions. The Union invokes the reasoning in Street v. B.C. School Sports (2005), 138 Sask. R. 111 (C.A.). The parties involved in the action were veterans of the trade union movement and were familiar with the by-lamency provisions of the Trade Union Act. HELD: The Court held that it had jurisdiction to hear the plaintiff’s application for summary judgment under Queen’S Bench Rule 485 for summary judgement. In this case, the Court held the following with respect to the claim for reimbursement of costs not incurred: 1) The plaintiff was an employee of the city of Saskatoon and was entitled by the by law to benefit from an indemnities clause in the Union’ s. 48(1) of the bylaw. 2) The essential nature of the debate between Taylor and the Union relates to the interpretation of a terms of their union membership by-book. The parties were veterans. The essential character of the dispute between Taylor & the Union was that the plaintiff was involved in a union related action involving the disciplining of high school coach over recruiting practices. The Court noted that the history of the plaintiff and the settlement of disputes between them was a significant factor in their decision. The second front was a second front, this time in the context of a dispute between the union and CUPE Local 59. The third front was the plaintiff seeking damages for breach by-determining costs. The purpose of the third front in this case was to assist the Court in reaching its conclusion. The court noted that it was not appropriate to prevent the plaintiff from bringing this application in the absence of a clear and enforceable provision excluding his access to the Courts."

Prior to jury selection, he applied for a stay of proceedings, alleging that there had been a breach of his right to a fair trial due to negative pre-trial publicity. Dismissing the application, that the application was premature. However, the accused would be permitted to challenge potential jurors for cause due to the highly prejudicial and inflammatory pre-trial media reports.","The accused, who was charged with the murder of his former residents, applied for a stay of proceedings alleging that his rights under s.11(d) and s. 11(f) of the Charter had been infringed due to the pre-trial publicity. The accused argued that the pre -trial publicity had prejudiced his right to be tried by an impartial jury of his peers. HELD: The application for a stayed of proceedings was dismissed. 1)The pre- trial publicity had not prejudiced the accused's right to a fair trial by an unbiased jury. 2)The applicant had not established on a balance of probabilities that his right had been violated. 3)The presence of television news coverage and the extensive security arrangements in place had created an atmosphere of fear and terror surrounding the accused 'trial'. 4)The application for stay of Proceedings based on the unprecedented amount of prejudicial pre-rial publicity was denied. 5)The Court was satisfied that the media coverage, especially on social media, had created a 'feeling of fear' among the potential jurors. It was also satisfied that pre--trial media coverage had not affected the accused in the least."

HELD: The accused are sentenced to 40 months imprisonment for the offence of robbery with violence and 4 months consecutive for the offence of having their faces masked. Having regard for the fact that the accused have been in custody for nearly 10 months, the Court gives them two for one credit for time served in remand which is 20 months. The sentence is 2 years to be served in a federal penitentiary. The sentence takes into consideration their lengthy record of offences committed as young offenders, the gravity of the offence, the violence used against the victim, the fact that a high speed chase ensued in the city, and the need to deter not only these accused but other who might consider committing the offence of robbery.","The accuseds were found guilty after trial of committing two offences, namely: robbing cash and miscellaneous items at a convenience store and using violence against the clerk. The accuseds had been in custody since January 31, 2007 and had been out of custody for more than 10 months. The Crown had made a joint submission for a sentence of two years to be served in federal penitentiary as well as a concurrent sentence of four years for each offence. The defence argued that the sentence should be increased to take into account the time on remand that the accuseds spent on remandering and the effect of the violence committed against the victim. The Court of Appeal raised the sentence to two years of imprisonment, plus the time served on remands in the community, as well. The sentences were found to be in the range of sentences considered in the circumstances. The court also reduced the victim surcharge to a dollar for time served by the Crown."
6_2011nssc48.txt,"The two plaintiffs were forced to jump from the window of their third-floor apartment after a fire erupted in the building. The fire alarm system was not functioning and, despite being aware of previous problems with the 25-year-old system, the defendant had never maintained or inspected it; the self-closing hallway fire doors were continually in an open position; the battery-operated fire alarm in the plaintiffs' apartment was not functioning; and the plaintiffs were unaware of whether their smoke detector was wired into the building or was their responsibility. The male plaintiff suffered serious fractures to both ankles and a fractured fibula. He underwent four surgeries, was non-weight bearing for three months and was unable to run or engage in various sports. Although he had returned to work as a production worker, his condition would continue to deteriorate due to post-traumatic arthritis, most likely resulting in a future ankle fusion. The female plaintiff suffered a pelvic ring injury with bilateral pelvic and sacral fractures, a fractured elbow and a broken rib. She underwent surgery on her pelvis, was unable to look after her own hygiene for five months and developed bursitis in the hip. She continued to experience pain in the tailbone with extensive sitting and in the elbow with extension of the arm, had a permanent loss of elbow extension and walked with a limp. The worsening of her pre-existing anxiety and depression led to the diagnosis of post-traumatic stress disorder. The landlord argued that the plaintiffs' injuries had not been caused by any of its actions. Male plaintiff awarded the sum of $75,000 for general damages, $15,000 for past and future loss of valuable services and $45,000 for loss of earning capacity; female plaintiff awarded the sum of $55,000 for general damages, $35,000 for past and future loss of valuable services and $75,000 for future loss of income. Although there was no evidence that the defendant was responsible for the fire, its conduct created an unreasonable risk of harm in the event of a fire. Without evidence as to how much time the plaintiffs would have had to escape down the stairwell or how long they would have had to wait for the fire department had the smoke or fire alarms activated, the 'material contribution' test was applied to the causation issue. When the plaintiffs first awoke, the fire had already worked its way up through the attic hatch to the roof, where the flames in the eaves were visible to the plaintiffs. Smoke and fire were able to flow freely through the adjacent stairwell as a result of the fire door being left open, and the failure of the smoke detectors and fire alarms allowed the smoke and fire to progress before being detected by the plaintiffs. The female plaintiff was found to have no meaningful residual earning capacity due to the combination of her physical and psychological injuries.","The plaintiff and her partner were in an apartment building when the fire broke out. The plaintiff fell from the building's third floor stairwell and suffered serious injuries. The defendant acknowledged that the fire alarm system in their building was not working at the time of the fire but that it was being maintained by the plaintiff. The fire alarm clock in the plaintiff's apartment was not functioning at the relevant time and the smoke detector in the defendant's building was in excess of 25 years old. The interior of the building was blackened and smoke alarms were not working. The ceiling fan in the apartment was open and the door to the living room was closed. The plaintiffs' bedroom door was open at the correct time and there was a broken self-closing hatch on the door. The door to their living room had a raised door. One of the hallway doors on the third floor was open. The windows on the fourth floor were closed. There was a lot of smoke and the plaintiff was unable to escape. The smoke alarms in the building were not functioning properly and there were problems with the fire detection system, the smoke detectors, and the fire extinguishers. The defendants breached their standard of care by failing to maintain the fire alarms and failed to detect smoke alarms. Liability and damages were at issue in this case. The common law duty of care arises from the proximity of the relationship between landlord and tenants of its multi-unit residential building. In this case, the defendant owed a duty of caring to the plaintiffs to ensure they were reasonably safe from injury while residing in the premises. In order to determine causation, plaintiffs must demonstrate that negligence caused the injury using the 'but for' test. The 'but' test recognizes that compensation for negligent conduct should only be made where a substantial connection between the injury and the defendant’s conduct is present. It ensures that the damage was caused in fact and in law by the defendant. Liabilities and damages are at issue. The tenants were awarded damages resulting from the plaintiff’ s negligence. The court found that the plaintiff breached the standard of caring owed to the plaintiff by failing, on a balance of probabilities, to prove the plaintiff suffered damages. The negligence breached the common law standard of cares. The negligent conduct created an unreasonable risk of harm in the event of a fire. The failure to maintain adequate fire extinguisher safety and the fact that the smoke alarms did not operate at the appropriate time created an undue risk of injury. The liability may be imposed even though the but for test is not satisfied because it would"
6_1997canlii9949.txt,The applicant sought an order requesting an absolute order of discharge in bankruptcy. The bankrupt was indebted to Canada Student Loans and Saskatchewan Student Loans. He had obtained a Bachelor of Science degree but was unable to complete his final year of Veterinary Medicine because he had received the maximum amount of financing available. The bankrupt had been employed for 5 years as a taxi driver earning a less than average income; he lived at home with his parents; he was single with no dependents. He was reluctant to leave secure employment in an effort to obtain employment related to his educational qualifications. Counsel for the objecting creditor argued that the bankrupt had a minimal income and had the capacity to make small payments toward his obligation. HELD: An absolute order of discharge was granted in accordance with the principles of The Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act.,"The bankrupt obtained a Bachelor of Science degree in Chemistry and an Advanced Certificate in Science-Physio as a result of student loan funding. He was indebted to Canada Student Loans in the amount of $22,338.99 and Saskatchewan student loans in the amounts of $18,241.39. The Saskatchewan program objected to the automatic discharge of the bankrupt. HELD: After carefully considering the submissions and bearing in mind the objects and principles of the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act, an absolute order of discharge is appropriate. While am not impressed with the bankrupt's attitude, it would be futile to impose a conditional order of discharged in this situation due to the bankrupts low income. The bankrupt is obviously very intelligent and capable individual. sincerely hope he finds a way to complete his degree in veterinary medicine at some point in the future."
2_2005skpc39.txt,"The accused is charged with driving while over .08 contrary to s. 255(1) and s. 253(a) of the Criminal Code and impaired driving contrary to s. s. 253(b) and 255(1) of the Code. HELD: The accused is not guilty on all counts.  1) A breath test and demand should be made as soon as the officer forms the requisite grounds for making it. Those grounds did not change between the time the accused refused to provide an ASD sample at 8:17 a.m., when the officer arrested her for impaired driving and 8:40 a.m. when the officer read the accused the breathalyzer demand. There was no reason for the breath demand not being made forthwith. The rights of the accused under s. 8 and s. 9 of the Charter were breached. 2) The officer did not have reasonable and probable grounds for making the breathalyzer demand. The officer testified she gave the ASD demand to find out if the accused had alcohol in her system. When the accused refused, the officer arrested her for impaired driving. The officer was unsure of whether the accused had alcohol in her system when she read the accused the ASD demand and there was no new evidence gathered between 8:17 a.m. and 8:40 a.m. to justify the breath demand. The evidence does not support a subjective honest belief on the part of the officer that the ability of the accused to operate a motor vehicle was impaired by alcohol. As the breath sample evidence was obtained as a consequence of the breach of the s. 8 and s. 9 Charter rights of the accused, it should be excluded from evidence pursuant to s. 24(2).  3) The accused testified that she had been drinking alcohol and was feeling the effects of the alcohol at the time she was operating the vehicle. She said she knew the alcohol would kick in and that she was not really feeling the effects until she arrived at the police station. She offered an explanation for her difficulty in driving testifying that she was tired. The evidence of the officer, which was insufficient to support a belief of impairment as a prerequisite to a breath demand, cannot prove impaired driving. There is insufficient evidence to conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused's ability to drive was impaired by alcohol at the time she was driving.","The accused was charged with being at large on her undertaking given to Justice or Judge and being bound to comply with conditions including that she abstain from all use, consumption and possession of alcohol and that she not be impaired by alcohol. At issue was whether the accused was impaired by driving at the time she read the ASD demand. HELD: The accused was found not guilty of both counts. The evidence of the officer was insufficient to support a belief of impairment as prerequisite to a breath demand and the evidence of her refusal to comply was not enough to prove impaired driving beyond a reasonable doubt. As the breath sample evidence was obtained as a consequence of the breach of the s.8 and 9 Charter Rights of the accused, it should be excluded under s.24(2). Its admission would render the trial process unfair and bring the administration of justice into disrepute. The accused testified that she knew the alcohol would kick in and she was not really feeling the effects until she arrived at the police station. There was no expert evidence called by either side. Can neither take judicial notice of the fact that she would have been more impaired later at the detachment (after in her words, the alcohol 'kicked in'), nor of thefact that she will have been impaired at the 711, after drinking three or four beer within the preceding hour. The driving evidence together with red eyes and slurred speech is not enough for a reasonable person to conclude that the ability of the appellant to operate a motor vehicle was impaired at that time."

Specifically, the section reads: 11.1(2) For the purpose of ensuring the safety of hunters and the public, a searchlight shall not be used for the purposes of hunting wildlife. The case was decided on the basis of credibility. The Court reviewed the requirements for assessing credibility and found it did not believe the accused.

He cooperated with the police and provided evidence against his co-accused. He had a previous criminal record, which included convictions for mischief, theft, break and enter, breach of an undertaking and possession of stolen goods. Defendant sentenced to four years imprisonment; in assessing the appropriate sentence, the court allowed a credit for time already served (which was served virtually throughout in protective custody), a credit of 25% for the fact that the defendant had pled guilty and a further reduction of one and a half years for the defendant's assistance in pursuing the successful prosecution of his co-accused.","The accused, who had previously entered guilty pleas to eight counts contained in an indictment, was charged with aggravated assault, being a party to unlawfully causing bodily harm and breach of a dwelling. The charges were all connected. The accused had previously pled guilty to three counts of break and enter. The offences were all committed in the course of committing the break and enters. The evidence in the break-and-enter had shown that the accused was more of a follower than a leader and, particularly in these cases, he was not the main driving force or the main perpetrator. The defendant had less than perfect upbringing and a fair amount of instability. The co-accused was found guilty of similar counts. The sentences were all based on the evidence of the accused. The DNA evidence was conclusive that the offences were committed in a fashion that was consistent with the accused's stated motivation and that he co-operated fully with the police including testifying at the trial of the co-occused and the coaccused. The Court found that the co -accused had a previous criminal record as a youth of 23 years of age, had a Grade X education, had sporadic employment, and had a sporadic employment. The Co-accordinator was found to be the ringleader of the break & enters. He was sentenced to eight years imprisonment, plus a fine and a five-year prohibition from possessing a weapon. The sentence for breaking and entering a dwelling was reduced to four years imprisonment as well as being a part of a conspiracy to commit robbery. The Crown sought a term of six years imprisonment for each count, given the accused pleading guilty, the amount of time already served, and the amount that would be credited to the conspiracy. The sentencing judge also accepted the co co-ordinator's plea. The amount of credit that the Crown sought was reduced from the eight-year sentence as well."
7_2007skqb28.txt,"The respondent was charged with impaired driving contrary to s. 253(a) of the Criminal Code and driving while over .08, contrary to s. 253(b) of the Code. The Crown appeals the acquittal on the charge under s. 253(b) of the Code. At trial the Crown argued that, prior to searching the vehicle and having close contact with the accused in the police car, the RCMP officer did not have a reasonable suspicion that he had alcohol in his body and therefore did not make a screening device demand immediately. On appeal the Crown submits that the trial judge accepted this and therefore there was no unlawful detention and the lapse of 17 minutes from the time he was placed in the back of the police vehicle until a demand was made. The Crown submits that the trial judge was in error in concluding that the 17 minute delay was not warranted or necessary and that there was no breach of the accused's right to be free of arbitrary detention within the meaning of s. 9 of the Charter. HELD: The appeal is dismissed. It appears that the officer may have been anxious to search the vehicle in anticipation that more than just a charge of impaired driving could be supported. Had he proceeded with a quick search of the vehicle and then proceeded with the demand in a short time period that may have been a reasonable violation of the accused's Charter rights. It is obvious from the evidence that in the course of searching the vehicle, the police officer returned to the police vehicle where the accused was detained and he had a further conversation with him, following which he returned to continue his search of the vehicle. In the circumstances, the delay of 17 minutes from when the police officer should have made the demand but did not and detained the accused in the locked police vehicle while he conducted a search of the accused's vehicle without arresting him, advising him of his rights and conducting a search of his vehicle is a violation of potentially three separate Charter rights. The evidence of the subsequent breathalyzer and certificate of analysis is conscriptive evidence obtained following the breach of the accused's Charter rights and the trial judge properly ruled that pursuant to s. 24(2) of the Charter the evidence should be excluded and the charge dismissed.","HELD: The appeal was dismissed. The court found that the delay between the time the respondent was stopped and when the roadside screening demand was made took the position of the police officer being less than able to smell the accused’s breath. The delay of 17 minutes from the time that the respondent had been detained for a complaint of possible impaired driver to the time of the roadside demand was not an unreasonable delay and the accused was acquitted of the charges. The roadside demand, which was not made before the respondent’d been detained, was not directed at him. The officer was reasonably aware that the accused had been drinking and that he should have been given a warning. The defence argued that the roadside requirement was not a reasonable condition to be detained and that the demand was therefore made before his detention. The Court found that both the initial detention in the police vehicle and the subsequent detention in police car satisfied the test set out by the R. v. Therens administration. HELD: 1)The delay of approximately 17 minutes was approximately 17.5 minutes from when the police Officer should have made the demand but did not and detained Shire in the locked police vehicle without arresting him, advising him of his rights and conducting a search of his vehicle is a violation of Shire’ s. 10(b) and he was granted no right to counsel. 2)The trial judge found that because the normal operation of s.254(2) of the Criminal Code requires that there be no undue delay because person who is detained for demand for roadside screening is implicit that there is a breach of various Charter rights which is justifiable if there is no unduedelay. If there is undue delay, the breach of Charter rights is not longer justifiable. 3)The officer should have taken more time to process the complaint than he did to process it. The respondent was detained because he was locked in the vehicle and he could not exit. During the 17 minutes between the roadside stop and the demand, a large open container of alcohol (i.e. in a travel mug) was found within easy reach of the driver. The accused was taken to Carlyle detachment where he provided two samples of breath. However, the roadside search resulted in a 'fail' reading. The evidence obtained from the subsequent breathalyser test was excluded under s.24(2). 4)The detention of Shires was not arbitrary because the police had a specific lawful purpose for stopping the vehicle. The detention of him was lawful and there was no breach of his"
2_2008nssm16.txt,"The claimant purchaser brought an action for breach of contract and negligent misrepresentation, claiming that although the defendant vendors had advised her that there had been some damage to the chimney base in the residence, she had been told that this was a minor problem which was under repair and she had not been properly advised of a history of repeated flooding.  Following the purchase of the property, the claimant had commenced renovations and discovered extensive mould or rot throughout the basement, to such an extent that the entire basement had to be gutted, disinfected and rebuilt. She also claimed that a buried cistern was discovered in the backyard, which had been partly filled with earth but still filled up with rainwater and melted snow, and that the water had nowhere else to go but against the foundation. When the defendants brought a motion for non-suit at the conclusion of her case, the unrepresented claimant expressed surprise and dismay that her case could be dismissed before both sides had testified as she expected her remaining evidence to come out through the defendants' testimony. Motion granted; the claim against the defendants is dismissed; it is the responsibility of the buyer to verify the accuracy of the Property Condition Disclosure Statement (PCDS) and, in this case, the claimant had made no inquiry as to the statements made by the defendants of structural problems or unrepaired damage or leakage in the foundation. The claimant had notification, both in the PCDS and from her home inspector, that there were leakage problems in the basement and the inspection report had advised her of the need to make further enquiries. There was no evidence the latent defects (the cracks in the wall, the mould and the rotten wood) were visible to the defendants when they occupied the home, that there was continual leakage of which the defendants were aware or that the defendants had performed any repairs to the home during their occupancy to cover up the wood rot. Although there was evidence that the defendants were aware of the cistern and had not disclosed this to the claimant, there was no evidence to conclude that the cistern was causing the problem.","The claimant claimed damages for a house sale because the disclosure statement did not disclose a history of repeated flooding. The claimant alleged that the home had flooded 12 years ago and that it had been rented by the Defendants. The defendant denied having any non-disclosure agreement, that the claimant relied upon any information the Defendants had disclosed, and that the claims had been made against the claimants for several months. The only defence the defendant offered was that the plaintiff had been misleading and that there had been no negligent misrepresentation. The court reviewed the law on a non-suit motion and found that most of the evidence was from the parties' counsel. The judge decided not to grant the motion, saying that the sufficiency of evidence was a question of law. The non-suits filed were categorized according to the doctrine of merger and the determination of what are warranties and what are mere representations. The test for a nonsuit was summarized in Pino v. Wal-Mart Canada. The plaintiff was awarded $25,000 for damages. The second phase of the analysis involved determining whether the property was part of the original purchase agreement or collateral to the main purchase agreement. The third phase involved determining if the property had a history as a result of repeated floodedings. The final phase involved deciding whether the home should be sold or leased. The parties were to submit their proposed sale proposals. The proposal was to have the property sold or rented for a period of time. The realtor would have to be aware of the condition of the property prior to the purchase. The proposed sale would be subject to significant legislative and economic restraints which would result in the loss of rent for one month and the loss for one week for both apartments. The applicant was to retain counsel."
e_1999canlii6888.txt,"The plaintiffs sued based on a contract between the parties that required the defendant to share the proceeds of milk quota sales. The defendant took the position that the contract only required the sharing of fluid milk quota sales, and not all milk quota sales. The plaintiff sought rectification of the contract to change the wording of the contract to milk quota sales from fluid milk quota sales. Finding for the plaintiff and granting rectification, that the parties clearly intended to have the contract cover all milk quota sales. The proceeds from all sales are to be divided between the parties.","The plaintiffs sought rectification of the agreement terms in regard to the sharing by all three of them in the proceeds from any sales of milk quota by the defendant. The defendant had sold a number of dairy products prior to the 1988 quota scheme change. The three brothers each formed a new company at that time with the intention of transferring all three assets of their company to the defendant and having them each own a separate company. The purpose of the new company was to be more stable and more profitable. The court found that the agreement was not based on a quota system but on a real estate transaction. The agreement provided that the three brothers would have joint control of the dairy operation with the defendant, with the exception of one brother, and that the defendant would have the exclusive right to sell only the one product per quota. The plaintiff was to have his shares divided equally. The defendants refused to honour the agreement. The plaintiffs sought to have the agreement divided according to the value of the assets in the company and the defendant's proposed sale of the rest of the quota to the plaintiff. The Court found that both parties were in a conflict of interest and that it was improper for the defendant to divide the proceeds of the sale of one product in the first place. The provisions of the 1988 agreement were found to be in breach of the provisions of section 29 of the Trade Offering Act. Section 29 of The Trade Off Offering Agreement was found to have been breached by the plaintiff because the agreement referenced only one product and the words 'fluid milk Quota'. The agreement clearly stated that the two products were to be equally owned and the proceeds would be shared equally among the three. The terms of the 1989 agreement were not disclosed to the court."
e_2005skqb263.txt,"Accused is charged with second degree murder in the death of his estranged wife. The Crown sought to admit into evidence a number of statements that were made by the deceased to several crown witnesses concerning two previous incidents she had with the accused in the weeks prior to her death. In the first incident, the accused is alleged to have choked the victim after he confronted her about where she had been. In the second incident the accused confronted the victim and beat and choked her and then sexually assaulted and threatened to kill her. The Crown seeks to admit this similar fact evidence and several hearsay statements to prove the issues of motive, intent and modus operandi. HELD: The statements by the deceased are not admissible. The prejudicial nature of the similar fact evidence has not been overcome by its probative value. It is well established law that similar acts and other discreditable conduct evidence is presumptively inadmissible and that similar fact evidence is the exception to this. To determine its admissibility, three things need examination, 1) the probative weight of the evidence, 2) the assessment of the prejudice and 3) the weighing of the probative value versus prejudicial value. In examining the probative weight of the evidence, factors to be considered include the issues in question, the presence or absence of collusion, similarities and dissimilarities between the facts charged and the similar fact evidence and the strength of the evidence that the events occurred. The two previous incidents are extremely prejudicial in nature leading to potential moral prejudice. That is, reprehensible nature of the assaults could lead the jury to rely on the prohibited inference that the accused is the type of person who could have committed the crime. There is also a great risk of reasoning prejudice. That is, admitting the similar fact evidence may distract the jury from their proper focus which is the second degree murder charge. There is a possibility that the jury will equate the intention to harm with the mens rea required for a murder conviction. With respect to the hearsay evidence, the Court held that statements made by the deceased to her friends, family and colleagues concerning the threats and assaults will not be admitted. The test of necessity is clearly met by the fact that the person making the statements in now deceased and not able to testify. However, the Court was concerned about the reliability of the statements since there is nothing that would serve as convincing indicia of reliability adequate to offset the absence of an oath.","The accused was charged with second degree murder contrary to s. 235 after she was confronted by the husband who had sexually assaulted her and threatened to kill her if she dropped the assault and sexual assault charges. The Crown tendered statements that were made by the deceased to several Crown witnesses concerning two previous incidents of choking. The defence argued that s. 589 of the Criminal Code should be considered bar to the admissibility of the statements made by Michelle Lenius to her friends, family and co-workers. The court questioned the relevance of hearsay statements to the trial judge regarding the issues of motive, intent and modus operandi. HELD: The evidence is admissible on a principled basis and must not be confused with the evidence of similar fact evidence. The principles of the principled approach are not to be expanded on by the trial court in order to ensure the possibility of a fair trial. 1) The trial judge must not invade the province of fact and condition admissiblilty on whether the evidence is ultimately reliable. However, it will need to examine whether the circumstances in which the statement was made lend sufficient credibility to allow a finding of threshold reliability. 2) Hearsay evidence is presumptively inadmissible and it should not be admitted in order for the trial to ensure a fairtrial. The prejudicial nature of the similar fact information has not been overcome by its probative value and it must not been admitted in the order to determine the possibility that a fair Trial will be held."

In this matter, the defendant argued that the costs should be fixed at the amount actually recovered by the plaintiff.

The defendant were the project consultants for the City, and were involved throughout the tendering process and construction. Their report indicated a number of significant potential problems. The plaintiff was not made aware of the report when it bid on the project. The plaintiff subsequently became aware of the problems, which made their work more costly. After completing the work, it commenced a claim for the additional work which had to be performed due to the undisclosed site conditions. The defendants were joined by the City as a third party to that action. The plaintiff was successful at trial, but the decision was overturned on appeal. The plaintiff then commenced the present action directly against the defendant, alleging negligent misrepresentation. The defendant applied to strike the action on the basis of res judicata and abuse of process. Granting the application, that the present cause of action is the same one litigated in the first action, simply under a different legal concept. To allow the plaintiff to relitigate the same action on the same factual basis would be an abuse of process.","The plaintiff was the successor corporate entity of Turf Masters Landscaping Limited by virtue of an amalgamation of the two companies. Turf masters had obtained a subcontract to perform most of the work on a recreational park and sports field for the City of Dartmouth. The consultants for the city had been involved in a previous negligence action which had been concluded as a result of the city's non-disclosure of the site reports. Turff Masters bid on and obtained the subcontract for most of construction without being aware of the prior reports. Shortly after commencing the work, the city and Turfmasters commenced a'second action' (another action in a consolidation or joinder of causes) against the city, alleging negligence by the city. Turfs Masters commenced an action against the City and the city jointly and severally. The city brought a claim against Turf Master for unpaid monies and claimed damages for economic loss and negligent misrepresentation. Turfing Masters brought a third action (another consolidation or cause of action) against city and its consultants, CBCL. Turmoil ensued as the city brought its own action (failing to disclose the two site reports) and the plaintiff commenced its own separate action (which it did not disclose). Turf's application was dismissed and it was found that the parties had not suffered prejudice. The second action (to which Turfasters was entitled to a portion) was also dismissed as an abuse of process. The doctrine of res judicata and abuse ofprocess was not advanced by Turf Associates in its application and it did well in setting out its case against the defendant and its arguments in support of its opposition to the defendant's application. The parties were at this time considering their options as to which forum was appropriate to continue their remaining claims or causes of action arising from the non-closure of site reports and whether the second proceeding should be stayed or dismissed as abuse of due process."

d_1991canlii2552.txt,"The appellant, which was a wholly owned subsidiary of a major international company, induced the respondent to enter a franchise agreement by making representations as to the viability of the venture. The appellant sought to recover its losses from the respondent and relied on an exclusionary clause. Allowing the appeal in part, that (1) the agreement was unconscionable, having regard to the unequal bargaining power of the parties, the fact that the agreement was prepared by the appellant, and the fact that the appellant induced the respondent with its promotional brochure and its verbal representations as to the venture's viability to enter the franchise agreement; (2) the appellant cannot rely on an exclusionary clause given its unconscionable conduct; and (3) the appellant's claim for the value of the inventory together with pre-judgment interest was payable by the respondent. In a dissenting opinion, it was held that neither the appellant's conduct nor the franchise agreement was unconscionable; rather the respondent was an experienced businessman and the representations as to the venture's viability were mere projections, which he should have realized were unreliable.","The appellant was a wholly owned subsidiary of Imperial Oil involved in the distribution and sale of automotive parts and related products.

The Court agreed with the conclusion in Anderson that an order can be made with respect to damage awards even though, at the moment of the order, there is only a cause of action in existence and no precise amount of damages are known. There was no question that a cause of action or chose in action is property and thus the subject of an order under the Family Maintenance Act s.8. It is of no consequence that the order may be in another form such as money. To adopt any different analysis would be to unnecessarily limit the remedial application of s.8.

The mother argued that the records sought were irrelevant and that if there was any relevance, they were privileged, were unnecessary to the fair disposition of the proceeding, and their production would not save costs and would be injurious to the public interest. The addiction prevention and treatment service, Nova Scotia Hospital and mental health clinic records and files are ordered to be produced; the medical records of the family physician, the hospital and the woman's shelter are not ordered to be produced as these files would contain some irrelevant information and the relevant information could be obtained by other means. In a child protection proceeding, documents may be relevant to prove a protection finding, to monitor compliance with existing orders, or to develop and evaluate a plan of care. Records held by individuals or organizations to whom an individual has been referred as a result of a child protection proceeding are not privileged as no confidentiality could be expected in those circumstances. Records held by individuals or organizations whose services were accessed independent of a court order or the Minister's involvement that would ordinarily attract privilege may be ordered to be produced in child protection proceedings. However, if the information contained in the records can be obtained by a means targeted specifically to produce the relevant information, then orders for production for all of the records will not be necessary to the fair disposition of the proceeding. Also, since such records contain irrelevant, as well as relevant material, such an order would violate the privacy protections found in the Charter and be injurious to the public interest.","The applicant sought 13 orders of production for documents prepared by and in the possession of her service providers. The Minister was requesting the records as part of a protection proceeding. The applicant argued that this was a high threshold for a protection application, and that the documents would not be able to be produced because of their complexity and complexity. Application dismissed; the court found that the requirements of the protection order were high and that obtaining the records would not save costs. The court also found that it would not accept the applicant's repeated requests for documents as proof of the Protection Finding; the records were not relevant to the applicant’s present circumstances and would not assist in the preparation of the parental capacity assessment. The requirement to obtain the records, which must be obtained by means other than obtaining a Order of Production, was not a high priority."

The Jabours, the third parties who acquired title to the house, firmly bolted a wheelchair lift loaned to them by the Abilities Council by anchor bolts in a concrete slab. The Jabours sold to the Kapronczais who in turn sold the property 2 years later to the respondent, San Diego, but made no mention about ownership of the wheelchair lift. The lift ceased to operate and San Diego contacted the Abilities Council which claimed ownership to the lift. San Diego was awarded judgment for the depreciated value against Kapronczai who joined the Jabours as third parties claiming over against them for the San Diego claim. HELD: The appeal was dismissed against the plaintiff and the third party. 1)The wheelchair lift never became part of the realty notwithstanding how it was affixed. It was not the intention of either party that it become part of the realty. The intention of the parties is a prime factor in determining whether something is affixed to and becomes part of the realty. 2)The manner of attaching the lift only to the concrete slab arguably showed an intention that it not be permanent and part of the property.  3)Section 237(2) of the Land Titles Act protects a purchaser of realty against an unregistered interest in that realty. Interest is defined in s.237(1)(a)as any estate or interest in land. It is not intended to protect the purchaser of realty to which something is affixed that is not intended to the knowledge of the purchaser to be part of the realty. The defendants purported to sell that which was not theirs giving a claim for damages. The Provincial Court judge dismissed the claim against the third party, the Jabours, on the facts.","Respondent parties bought title to house property and caused the property to be affixed to the realty with a wheelchair lift attached to the concrete pad and operated by electric power from the house. The sellers sold the property without mentioning the purchaser, the respondent San Diego, about ownership of the wheelchair lift. A few months after the purchase, the wheelchair lifted ceased to operate. San Diego was told to get in touch with the Abilities Council the name of which was displayed on the wheelchair lifts was displayed there. The Abilities Council wanted the lift back but San Diego negotiated a purchase price for a total of $2,769.29 for which she got judgment. The Jabours appealed the decision. Appeal dismissed. The appeal was not directed at the plaintiff or the third party but against the third parties."
2_2000skqb301.txt,"Plaintiff, as litigation guardian for his four daughters, alleged that the defendant, in breach of a trust, wrongfully retained $20,000 to which his daughters are entitled. Mabel, mother of the plaintiff and the defendant, set aside $20,000 in a bank account. Prior to her death, Mabel gave written instructions to the defendant to give $5,000 to each granddaughter. The defendant claimed that the money was to be held to pay the estate's expenses and then be divided among Mabel's children. The money was never issued to the granddaughters. The plaintiff claims that the written instructions to the defendant constituted the establishment of a trust and that the defendant is the trustee of the money for the benefit of the granddaughters. HELD: Plaintiff's claim dismissed with costs to the defendant to be taxed at double column 2. An incomplete voluntary transfer will not be construed as a declaration of trust unless it appears that there is an intention to declare a trust, and not merely make a transfer. Mabel's written instructions do not contain any words that could possibly be construed as a declaration of trust. She intended to make monetary gifts. The fact that the defendant did not take the necessary steps to complete the intended gifts during Mabel's lifetime does not result in that intention being converted into a declaration of trust. As to costs, the plaintiff alleged that the defendant committed fraud and this was never withdrawn nor proven. Asserting an unfounded allegation of fraud justifies a special order as to costs.","The plaintiff alleged that the defendant had wrongfully, in breach of a trust, retained the sum of $20,000 to which his four daughters were entitled. The plaintiff had four children: Mabel, Brenda, Brian and Wanda. Mabel intended, by her written instructions, to prepare four cheques in the amount of $5,000 for the benefit of the four granddaughters. After Mabel died, the plaintiff, as litigation guardian of his four children, alleged that he had wrongly retained the money in a trust. The four grandchildren were named after the plaintiff. HELD: The plaintiff was not a party to the trust. It was not formed as a trust nor was it a gift. The written instructions were never given to the plaintiff; the trust was established as a gift for the four grandchildren. The court dismissed the claim that the plaintiff had been a volunteer and did not give any consideration to either the Royal Trust Company or Royal Trust Corporation which would create an equity in her favour.  1)An incomplete voluntary transfer will not be construed as a declaration of trust unless it appear that there is an intention to declare a trust and not merely to make a transfer. 2)An individual is not an individual but rather a volunteer. The voluntary transfer of funds will not interfere with the creation of an imperfect gift. 3)An entirely voluntary transfer is not a declaration or a declaration by the plaintiff unless it appears that there was an intention, and not a merely to makes a transfer, such as that of a bank director, to a charity or to make an application on an annuity contract."

After the tenant vacated the home, the landlord, pursuant to Residential Tenancies Act s.47, sought $3,746.76 for rent loss, cleaning, damage to the premises and unpaid utilities. The Rentalsman's order required the tenant to pay $2,930.01. The tenant appealed on the grounds the Rentalsman erred in law, as the decision was patently unreasonable as unsupportable by the facts; there was a denial of natural justice and due process because there was insufficient notice of particulars of the cleaning claim to allow the tenant to prepare a full and proper defence. The tenant argued there was a denial of natural justice and the decision should be overturned because he was not aware he could ask for an adjournment to present further evidence. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. The tenant was not denied natural justice or due process. While the description of cleaning did not specifically state the number of hours or hourly rate, it was sufficient to alert the tenant that it was for hours of work as well as for painting. The Rentalsman's decision, made after reviewing pictures, repair bills and the statements of house cleaners, who indicated the hours worked and their hourly rate, was not patently unreasonable as being unsupportable by the evidence.","The tenant appealed the Rentalsman's decision. He claimed the Rentalman's decisions were patently unreasonable, unreasonable and unsupportable by the facts and therefore the Deputy Rentalsmansman erred in law. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. 1)The notice given to the tenant was inadequate. He was not aware he could ask for an adjournment to present further evidence.  2)The Rentalsmen's decision was patently reasonable and was not patently unrealistic given the evidence. 3)The tenant was not denied natural justice and due process."
c_2009skqb514.txt,"FIAT: The respondent mother filed a motion asking for an order quantifying child support arrears which she claims are due and owing pursuant to the order of Gunn, J. in September, 2008. She also asks that the Court determine the ongoing child support amount to be paid by the petitioner father. The Court questioned whether this application was more in the nature of a variation of the Gunn, J. order. It is clear that there has been a change since September 2008 with respect to the residency of one of the children.HELD: 1) The father's unusual 2008 taxation year has led to the parties taking very different positions as to how the father's income should be calculated. The father argues that it would be appropriate to average the father's income for 2006 to 2008. The mother argues that his income is the sum set out on line 150 of his tax return. She argues that his total income is the sum of $302,196 for the 2008 year. The father's argument is that the severance he received in 2008 should not be included in his income. It is well established that severance pay represents an acceleration of income that would have been paid over a period of months. It is also well established that income for the basis of calculating child support should be determined on the basis of severance pay plus whatever other earnings the payor may have. The severance is included as part of the father's income. 2) The capital gain which shows on the father's 2008 income tax return shall not be included in his 2008 income. The father agreed as part of the distribution of family income to assume responsibility for the capital gain on the real estate he was receiving as part of the family property division. The gain does not reflect income actually received by the father and there will be no 'year to year' capital gains. See Andersen v. Andersen (1997), 32 R.F.L. (4th) 177. 3) The father's income for 2008 is $270,300.  4) If the parties were to proceed in accordance with their own agreement and consent order, the father would be forced to pay on his inflated 2008 income. However, the mother would then be forced to pay back to the father the overpayment. As of May 2009 the father's income is the sum of $160,000. 5) The mother shall have her costs of $600.","The mother has filed a motion requesting an order quantifying child support arrears which she says are due and owing pursuant to the 2008 order. As the Gunn J. order is premised on the child, Adam, residing with the mother and the child David, residing in the father's home, no longer lives with either parent. The father is paying support on an income which have now determined to be the sum of $270,300. The mother takes the position that the father will not earn the sum in the 2009 taxation year. HELD: 1) The father's 2008 income tax return is reduced to $115,000 and is reflected in his 2008 income Tax return. 2) The capital gain is a non-reoccurring amount which should not be included in the determination of the father’s 2008 income. 3) The parties agreed in 2008 that the son would primarily reside with the father and mother. The fact that the mother spent his severance funds on legal fees and to set up his new home in Alberta is irrelevant. The severance is included as part of the dad’ s. 8 income tax returns. 4) The Court reviewed the decision of Andersen v. Andersen, 1997 ABCA 409 (BC SC) and determined that the dad was paying support in the amount of $160,000. The Court determined that it would be unfair to have the father continue to provide support on the basis of an income in the sum $270 million when the evidence is clear he will earn approximately $100,000 less than that amount. If the parties proceeded in accordance with their own agreement and consent order, the father would be forced to pay on his inflated 2008 income and the mother would be required to remit back to the father the overpayment. 5) The fact the father spent his s. and s. 7 legal fees to pay as result of the court proceedings in this matter which included an intense pre-trial conference is irrelevant as well as the mother’d costs of the proceedings."
3_1999canlii12258.txt,An appeal from an order varying a child maintenance order which had been based on a written agreement between the parties entered into a week before the Federal Child Support Guidelines came into effect. The application to vary made about a year later was based mainly on the coming into effect of the guidelines. The decision to not to allow evidence on all issues because of conflicting affidavits gave rise to the first ground of appeal. The appellant also argued that the judge erred in finding that an order to vary would not be inequitable within the meaning of s.17(6.2) by reason of the terms of the written agreement and resulting order which contained special provisions to benefit the children. He also objected to the s.7(1)(f) order for $230 per month for extraordinary extracurricular expenses. HELD: The appeal was dismissed with the exception of the payments under s.7(1)(f) which were set aside. 1)The applicant was not denied the right to lead evidence on any relevant issue. Although the judge made no reversible error the procedure followed was not approved of. The principles stated in Zaba v. Bradley were reaffirmed. 2)No reversible error was found in the finding the appellant did not have custody of or access to the children for enough time to bring him within s.9; that the appellant's income for purposes of the Guidelines should include the bonuses received from his employer; and that he did not have a business based in his home. 3)The judge erred in not addressing the question as to whether the expenses were extraordinary within the meaning of s.7(1)(f). The activities were ordinary given the income of the parents and fell within the table amount fixed under s.3(1)(a).  4)Each party was to bear his/her own costs.,"The appellant was granted the right to lead evidence concerning matters concerning matters between the parties. The issue on appeal was whether the appellant objected to payments under s. 7(1)(f) of the Federal Child Support Guidelines, and whether the respondent was denied the right by reason of written reasons to lead the evidence on such matters as to the application and the reasons for judgment. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. The portion of the judgment relating to payments pursuant to s.7(1(f) was set aside. The court found no reversible error in the judge's decision, explained in the reasons in the reason for judgment, to reject the appellant's arguments respecting that issue. There was no error in his decisions supported by written reasons, that the appellant did not have custody or access to the children for enough time to bring him within s. 9 of the Guidelines; the appellant’s income, for the purposes of the guidelines, should include the bonuses he received from his employer in 1996 and 1997 and the fact that Elliott did not own a business based in the home."
5_2008nssc77.txt,"The claimant brought an action in the Small Claims Court to enforce a default judgment it had been granted against the defendant in Alberta for breach of contract. The claimant attempted to proceed in Nova Scotia on the basis of reciprocal enforcement under the common law or enforcement of the debt as a contract. The adjudicator dismissed the action, finding that the Small Claims Court did not have the authority to enforce an order arising from a foreign jurisdiction and that it could not proceed with the claim for breach of the agreement under the contract as there was no evidence that the Alberta action had been withdrawn, struck or transferred out. The adjudicator also found that the defendant had not attorned to the jurisdiction of the Alberta court. The claimant appealed. Appeal dismissed; although the adjudicator's interpretation of sec. 15 of the Act and his finding that the defendant had not attorned to the jurisdiction of the Alberta court when there was no evidence before him on that issue constituted errors in law, the present claim was beyond the scope of the Small Claims Court Act, given that the adjudicator would first be called upon to settle a dispute regarding the original court's jurisdiction, the locus of the original contract and a factual dispute concerning attornment.","The claimants commenced an action for breach of contract against the respondent in Alberta Court of Queen's Bench. The respondent did not file a defence and the claimants obtained default judgment for an amount not cited in either parties' submissions. The claim for breach was reduced from the amount of its judgment to fall within the monetary limits established by the Small Claims Court Act and in its defence, claimed the Alberta Court did not have jurisdiction. The Respondent commenced an application in the Small claims Court for reciprocal enforcement of the Alberta judgment under the common law, and in the alternative, enforcement of a debt as contract. The applicant commenced an actions for breach in another province, in the Alberta court of Queen’s Bench. This action concluded with the issuance of the default judgment. The small claims court appeals the decision wherein the adjudicator determined that Section 9 of the Act did not provide the Court with authority to enforce an Order arising from foreign jurisdiction. Rather than determine a claim based on a fixed amount, it is apparent an Adjudicator would be called upon first to settle a dispute regarding the original Court’S jurisdiction, the locus of the original contract, and a factual dispute concerning attornment. Taking into account the purpose of the legislation, the remedial goals, the underlying values of efficiency and access to justice, and the potential for a complex fact finding process in this action, the present claim extends beyond the authority of the Small Claim Court Act."
2_1999nsca132.txt,"The respondent filed an interlocutory notice, ex parte application, against the intended defendants, seeking an interim injunction. The applicant union applied for leave to obtain intervener status as a party pursuant to Rule 62.35, or as amicus currie pursuant to Rule 8.02, or alternatively as an intervener pursuant to Rules 5.02, 5.04, and 8.01(1), and to bring an appeal from orders made by a Supreme Court judge in proceedings brought by the intended plaintiff against the intended defendants. Rejecting the applications, that a Court of Appeal judge sitting in chambers does not have the jurisdiction to grant intervener status or to join a person as a party to a proceeding. Furthermore, as the union was not a party to the original proceeding, and was not joined as an intervener, or as a party defendant, by order of a Supreme Court judge, it does not have standing to file an appeal.","The union applied for leave to participate in an appeal of a decision which denied it the right to join as an intervener in a civil action. The Union argued that the orders of the Supreme Court and the Court of Appeal were inconsistent and did not provide sufficient context to restrict the broad definition of 'court' used in the Rule 5.04(1) and Rule 8. However, the Court declined to allow the Union's application to be joined as an interlocutor pursuant to Rule 5 and to bring an appeal under Rule 62.35. The application to join the Union was dismissed as a party because the Court had not yet determined that the Union should be joined. The Court declined the Union’s application based on the absence of any affidavits filed by the Union on its behalf. It was not necessary to deal with the applications from other parties. The court reviewed the history of the proceedings in the present case and found that the union did not have the status to file an appeal unless it was first joined in either of these two capacities as a result of the applications presently before the Court. Rule 5 was apparently not relied upon by the union. The union also requested an adjournment in order to prepare the documents that were usually filed in support of an application under either of the Rules. The order of October 1st simply continued the interim injunction until further court order. The notice of appeal was dismissed. The proposed appeal was directed to the Court as a matter of appeal and dismissed."

With respect to EK the Department seeks an order placing him with the Minister until his 16th birthday. This order was granted at trial. The parents do not oppose the applications with respect to JS and EK but the mother seeks the return of CS to her care. HELD: JS is in need of protection and he shall be placed with SK for an indefinite period. JS shall not be returned to live with his parents without a further order of this Court. This does not prevent JS from spending unsupervised time with his parents including overnight visits. CS is in need of protection and she shall remain in the custody of the Minister for a period of 3 months. During that time, the parents shall work with DCR to develop a case plan for CS's return. TK will have a mental health assessment as arranged for by DCR and will follow any recommendations of the mental health professional and participate in the Victim Intervention Program. KS will attend any session at Alternatives to Violence arranged for by DCR. 1) The Court was satisfied that the children were exposed to domestic violence or severe domestic disharmony. 2) Matters did not move quickly once the children were placed in the care of DCR. Instead of working with DCR to ensure a smooth reintegration of the children into their home, the parents vacated their apartment, moved to Alberta for a while, lived in a series of motels, camped at SK's apartment building and even lived in a tent. During that period of time, some of which encompassed the trial, the Court was not satisfied that there was an adult person who was willing and able to provide for the children's needs. The children are in need of protection within the meaning of s. 11 of the Act. 3) There is a reasonable prospect of change within a reasonable period of time. KS has quit drinking. TK is now employed. KS has attended some anger management programming flowing from his criminal conviction. The parents have a residence. TK is taking medication which promotes the continuation of her mental health. DCR acknowledged that there are no current issues with TK's mental health and that have not been for some time. TK says she is prepared to work with DCR to ensure the return of her children. The Court accepts TK's disinclination to work with Ms. Fraser.

The mother was the primary caregiver for the children until they were 18. The father was placed in the care of the Minister for a period of 3 months. The parties' relationship was not established as a common law relationship. The parents' inability to provide for the child's needs and physical and emotional harm to him were considered factors in the apprehension of the child.

Pursuant to s.(1)(a) of The Children andFamily Act, the mother was to have the children placed in her care for a time period of 31 months. Pursuit of the Child andFamily Services Act s.(2) requires that all children be in the custody of the minister for a specified period of time.

c_2003skpc139.txt,"The Provincial Director applied pursuant to s. 98 of the Youth Criminal Justice Act for continuance of the custody portion of a custody and supervision sentence made pursuant to s. 42(2)(n). The Provincial Director was concerned that, because S.T.T. had not followed through with his treatment, he was at a high risk to offend again. HELD: The application lacked compelling reasons to keep the young person in custody.  1) This was the first experience with an application of this nature in Saskatoon and the Court provided a detailed discussion of the procedure for the benefit of future applications. 2) The application was not brought in a reasonable time having regard to all of the circumstances. The young person must be put on notice that the application is being made. 3) The Review (Progress) Report is a form of disclosure for the young person and should be available well in advance of the hearing.",The accused applied to have the custody portion of a custody and supervision sentence terminated. The accused had been in custody for more than a month at the time of the application and had only been in the custody of his parents. The Provincial Director had no prior notice of the applications and the accused was remanded in custody pending a full hearing. The issues were: 1) the length of the sentence; the number of offences committed; the amount of time it would take the accused to complete his sentence; 2) the extent of the risk of re-offending; and 3) the availability of supervision programs in the community. The Court found that the time between the hearing and the application was not sufficiently compressed to consider conditions of supervision. The application was also premature. The youth had served 180 days in custody and had been here 180 days since the offence occurred. The issue was not whether the young person was likely to re- offend but that he may do so within the time remaining in the sentence. The court found that conditions of custody were limiting. The test for continuation of custody was not too stringent as the Court must necessarily look to these factors to determine whether there are compelling reasons to keep the youngperson in custody. The criteria in s.98(3)(b) were limiting as the youth had only served 180 day in custody; the conditions of his supervision in the Community were adequate to prevent the commission of a serious violent offence; and 4) the test for continued custody was really limiting. There were a number of alternatives short of continuing open custody which could increase the level of supervision and were to be taken rarely. The 1st criteria (s.983)(a) requires consideration of the conditions that would be imposed and whether they would be adequate to preventing the commissionof a serious offence. The young person had served 90 days in jail and had had only 90 days remaining for the community supervision portion of his sentence. It was important to consider the factors listed in s98(4). The youth was the first person to be charged for an offence of this nature. The Crown had not provided the accused with the particulars of the offences. The Youth Criminal Justice Act provides for the application to be made on an application for continuation. The first person is the first defendant and the only person to have been charged for the offence. There was a defect that was not fatal to the decision to keep him in custody at the beginning of the hearing.
8_1997canlii9861.txt,"This was an appeal from a Supreme Court decision dismissing certiorari applications to quash three orders of the Labour Relations Board ordering the appellant to reinstate the respondents and pay them compensation for dismissing them due to their support of a union. The appellant alleged that the Board's order should be quashed because it failed to give reasons for its decision. Allowing the appeal and remitting the matter for rehearing, that there is an implied duty on a tribunal to provide written reasons whenever substantial issues are involved and the reasons for the tribunal's decision are not obvious from a review of the issues and the record. In this case, the order of the Board imposed significant financial liability on the appellant, and the issues were complex and the concerns of the parties were substantial. As a result, the Board acted in a patently unreasonable manner in giving its decision without providing reasons.","The respondent hotel manager appealed three orders of the Labour Relations Board (Nova Scotia) ordering her to reinstate the individual respondents, to pay them compensation and to reconsider the first two orders. The union members who had filed complaints against the hotel were all members of its employee union.

The Union members filed a complaint against the respondent in the same terms. The Board of Directors confirmed the respondent's denial of the requested rent increase.

1990canlii2449.txt,"This was an appeal from a decision dismissing the appellant's application for an order in the nature of certiorari to quash the decision of the Social Assistance Appeal Board for the City of Halifax which affirmed the rejection of the appellant's application for municipal social assistance as an expectant mother. The appellant was a pregnant unmarried 16 year old living with her parents at the time of her application for social assistance. The trial judge concluded that under Municipal Assistance Policy 1.2.5 the applicant was not eligible since she was not a single head of a family maintaining a home for herself and her dependant child. Allowing the appeal, that s. 23(1) of the Social Assistance Act places a mandatory responsibility upon social service committees to provide assistance for all persons in need as defined in s. 19(e) of the Act. Pursuant to this statute, the City of Halifax has approved municipal assistance policies and Policy 1.2.5 relating to an 'Unmarried Mother - Pending Birth' was intended to set out the circumstances under which an unmarried mother was to be eligible. It was not intended that the appellant have to be already maintaining a home for herself and one or more dependant children. In a dissenting opinion, Chipman, J.A. concluded that as the provision with respect to an 'Unmarried Mother - Pending Birth' came under the heading 'Single Head of Family', the provision is merely an extension to include within the definition of a single head of a family an unwed mother whose child is not yet born. The requirement that she be a single head of a family maintaining a home still stands.","An unmarried, pregnant, 16 year old girl applied to the Social Services Department of the City of Halifax for municipal social assistance. Her application was refused because she was under 19 years of age and was living with and being supported by her mother and stepfather. The appellant appealed. Dismissing the appeal, that although an unmarried mother pending the birth of her first child could qualify for assistance, she was not the head of family maintaining a home for herself and a dependent child. The applicant was, nonetheless, considered a person in need under M.S.A. Policy 1.2.5. The fact that the appellant's parents were the primary caregivers and maintainers of the home for her and her dependent children did not disqualify her from receiving assistance."

HELD: The appeal was allowed in part under Rule 129 without prejudice to the plaintiff's right to proceed for the alleged loss of $38,585. 1)The appellant was granted leave to amend its statement of defence by pleading the relevant statutory conditions in the Saskatchewan Insurance Act and any additional material facts and new matters raised by the amended statement of claim. The plaintiff was granted leave to reply. Each party was permitted to re-open the examinations for discovery. 2)The insured had no defence to the counterclaim for premiums which was a separate action.

The respondent then stopped payment of the same with a claim of set-off being advanced.

b_2000skqb572.txt,"The accused was charged with sexual assault under s.271 of the Criminal Code. Although the DNA evidence established he had sexual intercourse with the complainant, neither had any memory of it due to their self-induced states of intoxication. Defences raised were consent, an honest but mistaken belief that she gave her consent, and extreme drunkenness such that he was so intoxicated that he was not in a conscious state and was incapable of forming any intent to have sexual intercourse without consent. HELD: The accused was found guilty.  1)Although the defence of 'extreme intoxication' is successful in the rarest of cases, the accused established the Daviault 'extreme intoxication' on a balance of probabilities. He would have been acquitted had it not been for s.33.1 which does away with this defence in sexual assault cases.  2)The court was satisfied on a balance of probabilities that his extreme level of self-induced intoxication rendered him incapable of making a conscious decision to have sexual intercourse with the complainant with or without her consent. The court was satisfied that the complainant had not done anything to suggest that she would consent. The accused was incapable of considering the issue of consent and accordingly did not have a mistaken belief or reasonable grounds for such a belief. It was clear from the testimony of an 11 year old that the intercourse took place long after the complainant passed out. She was incapable of giving consent after that time. Her assertion of lack of consent was inherently unreliable due to her lack of any memory of events that occurred before, during and after the alleged assault and would have been more in the nature of an assumption than a fact, but was found to be consistent with all the other evidence. It was not relevant that she may have withdrawn consent. 3)There was no evidence to give his second defence (that he honestly believed he had her consent) an air of reality. His assertion that she must have consented or he would not have done it was speculative assumption, not evidence. 4)Section 33.1 provides that the act of becoming voluntarily intoxicated to the extent of being incapable of controlling one's behaviour constitutes criminal culpability sufficient to found criminal liability for offences committed against the bodily integrity of others. The public outcry and Parliamentary response to Daviault strongly indicate that s.33.1 is not only consistent with the objectives of the Charter but is justifiable and essential in a free and democratic society. Of four recent cases that held Criminal Code s.33.1 violates the Charter, two held it was saved by s.1 while two held it was not saved by s.1 of the Charter. 5)Section 33.1(1) provides the lack of general intent or voluntariness is not a defence to an assault charge described in ss.(3)if it resulted from self-induced intoxication or the accused departed markedly from the standard of reasonable care generally recognized in Canadian society. The three sub-conditions described in ss.(2) concerning marked departure constitute criminal culpability similar to recklessness. Criminal culpability is not dependent on wilful intention to cause harm but on the wilful intention to engage in conduct that incurs the risk of harm without caring whether or not harm ensues. 6)The strong dissent in Daviault indicated those who render themselves incapable of knowing what they are doing through voluntary consumption of alcohol or drugs possess a sufficiently blameworthy state of mind that their imprisonment does not offend the principle of fundamental justice which prohibits the imprisonment of the innocent. The court has broad discretion to differentiate in sentences imposed for offences that were deliberately committed and those that were committed involuntarily because of self-induced intoxication.","The accused was charged with sexual assault. Although the DNA evidence established that the accused had sexual intercourse with the complainant, neither the accused nor the complainant had any memory of the sexual intercourse that took place between them. This was the second case that have heard this year that the Court of Appeal has held that it is saved by s. 1(1)(b) of the Criminal Code. The Court of Canada has broad discretion to differentiate in sentences imposed for offences that were deliberately committed and those that were committed involuntarily because of self-induced intoxication. The court also has discretion to consider the defence of honest but mistaken belief in consent by concluding that the person who is in a state of intoxication is capable of such behaviour. In this case, the accused testified that he was so intoxicated that he could not remember the events prior to her passing out. The only 'evidence' of lack of consent raised by the accused was 'extreme drunkenness'. It was difficult to understand how someone who was so grossly intoxicated could be capable of having sexual intercourse such as that of the accused. He never considered the issue of her consent or lack of it."
1994canlii5055.txt,FIAT The accused was charged with four counts of defamatory libel. The alleged defamatory words were on a placard he exhibited while picketing in a public place. He was released from custody on his consent to a term that prohibited him from picketing or carrying placards pending his trial. He later applied for a review of the order and sought an amendment permitting him to picket lawfully. HELD: Application dismissed. Amendment refused. If the accused was permitted to picket there was a substantial likelihood that he would commit another offence while on bail pending his trial on the four existing charges. The justice granting the judicial interim release order was therefore correct to impose a complete prohibition on picketing.,The accused applied for a review of the terms of his judicial interim release. He and his counsel consented to a judicial interim order containing certain terms. The accused sought an amendment by adding the phrase'regarding Sgt. Brian Dueck or Carol Bunko-Ruys'. HELD: The application was denied. The picketing prohibition term imposed by the justice with the consent of the accused was reasonably constituted as a condition of his release from custody. But for this condition the justice might well have ordered the accused detained in custody on the ground that there was a substantial likelihood that the accused would commit a criminal offence if he were not prohibited from picketing prior to his trial. The amendment was not allowed to proceed and the application was barred pending trial.  1)The picketing was reasonably prudent in the circumstances and nature of the case. The judge reasonably ordered that the defendant be detained in detention on the grounds that there would be a substantial risk that he would commit criminal offence or aninterference with the administration of justice. 2)The court was satisfied in the circumstance and nature the picketing that resulted in the charges was reasonably justified. But that condition might well well have been ordered that he be detained on the basis that there could be a serious likelihood he would committed a criminal offense or an interference with the justice of justice but for this reason the application to grant the writ was denied and the existing order stood.
b_1997canlii11386.txt,HELD: 1)The officer was to answer any proper questions seeking his opinion on audit issues arising in the context of the Trust Company's records or files. To be proper the questions need only be broadly relevant to the issues raised in the pleadings in the sense that they are in some way connected to the allegations made. Hypothetical questions seeking his opinion consequent upon his professional experience could be asked where his and C&amp;L's conduct were in issue. The officer's expert opinion could not be sought on matters not raised in the pleadings. 2)The disclosure and production of documents was justified under the broad relevance test. A party is entitled to discovery of a document if it directly or indirectly enables him to advance his own case or destroy that of his adversary or may fairly lead to a form of inquiry which may have either consequence. 3)The 'damage claim documents' had been provided. There should be a sameness in the manner and isolation of the documents in the discovery process undertaken by each party. Whether the memoranda of discussions with third parties were privileged or irrelevant was a matter for the trial judge. 4)The issue of compelling a response to undertakings had been resolved. 5)The request for an order for an immediate pre-trial conference was redundant as there was no basis for one until the action was ready for trial. 6)Leave to further amend the statement of claim pursuant to Rule 165 had been granted.,"FIAT. The chambers judge granted an order directing the defendants to respond to the undertakings given inthe examination for discovery of the plaintiff and ordered that the plaintiff attend for the resumption of examination for the discovery of him and answer questions that he refused to answer or took under advisement, any questions seeking his opinion on audit issues relevant to the action and questions that arise from the undertakes.  The order also required that the defendants comply with certain conditions in the pleadings, including that the documents be properly described and identified in the plaintiff's statement as to documents and that costs of the application be paid in any event of the cause.  1)The plaintiff failed to establish that the questions were hypothetical and did not raise the requisite issues of admissibility and weight. 2)The defendants were ordered to provide the plaintiff with specific information about the matters in issue. 3)The plaintiffs sought to have the defendants answer questions relating to the plaintiff, his opinion concerning audit matters arising in the context of Saskatchewan Trust Company records or files, proper questions seeking the plaintiff opinions on audit working patterns related to investments made by Saskatchewan Trust company and the requisite part of a document referred to as'matters for attention of partners as at December 31, 1985'.  4)The court found that the defendant was entitled to make the disclosure requested and that portions of the documents should be provided. 5)The defendant was ordered to attend for a resumption examination for discover of the defendant and to provide specific questions and answers. 6)The Court ordered that all of the memoranda be disclosed. 7)The application for costs was dismissed."

2008skpc160.txt,"The accused is charged with aggravated assault. A voir dire was held to determine whether the accused's s. 8, s. 9, s. 10(a) and s. 10(b) Charter rights were breached. HELD: There was no breach of the accused's Charter rights. 1) There is no evidence to establish that the accused did not speak to legal counsel. The agreed statement of facts establishes that the accused asked to speak with Ms. Bohachik, a lawyer with Legal Aid. The police officer put the accused in contact with legal aid duty counsel instead. When the officer told the accused that Ms. Bohachik worked with Legal Aid the accused said 'ok, Legal Aid is fine'. The accused was put in contact with Legal Aid duty counsel. There was no breach of the accused s. 10(b) rights.  2) Applying the common law definition of arrest to the present situation, it is apparent that telling a person that he is no longer under arrest, without releasing him from custody, does not terminate the arrest. It is only by ending the custody of the accused by releasing him that the arrest is ended and the accused is 'un-arrested'. It was agreed that the officer had sufficient grounds to arrest the accused. The arrest being legally made, it follows that the arrest continued until it was legally ended by his release. The arrest continued throughout the search and seizure at the police station. The Court finds that his continued detention after the purported 'un-arrest' constituted a de facto arrest. 3) There is no evidence that the accused misunderstood his actual status or that he was prejudiced by the 'un-arrest'. The accused has not established that he was the subject of 'unreasonable search or seizure' resulting in the violation of his rights under the Charter.","The accused was charged with aggravated assault. Prior to his trial, the accused gave notice that he would be making an application to the Court for a ruling that the accused's rights under s. 8, 9, and 10 (a) and (b) of the Charter had been infringed and sought a remedy. The accused was arrested and detained at the police station. The Crown called three witnesses to testify and during the course of the evidence, the sixth witness requested that the court enter a voir dire. The voir net was to hear and determine an application by the accused for a finding that the rights of the accused under s 8,9, and (a)(i) and s. 10(b) had been violated and sought remedy for that infringement. The defence argued that the right under s.(b) included a right to retain and instruct counsel of choice. The right under ss.(e) and(iii) was not breached. The Court held that the initial arrest was lawful, was not terminated by the purported 'un-arrest', and continued throughout the search and seizure at the Police Station. Even if the accused was in error in that finding, his continued detention after the purported “un-arrrest” constituted a de facto arrest as described in Latimer. The concept of an 'unarurest' is novel one to me. Neither Crown nor defence counsel cited any case authority dealing with that concept. The fact is that the first arrest was lawfully conducted, although they made it clear to him that he was detained and in custody, and that he had the opportunity to consult counsel and to be informed of his rights regarding counsel and the warning. The second arrest was not lawful, but was continued throughout search and search at the station. Even though the police deliberately decided not to arrest the accused, although their detention after he was 'unarrested' constituted a 'de facto' arrest as was described in Latvia. The conclusion that the second arrest, although not terminated as a de de facto, was sufficient to justify the continued detention of the second accused, who was in custody for a violation of his right to a Charter right, was nonetheless sufficient to warrant a search and a seizure resulting in a violation thereof. The third arrest was sufficient, if at all, to terminate the accused’s right to access counsel without delay and, if not, an arbitrary arrest, which was not, in this case, a violation pursuant to s. 11(b)(iii) of that right."

The original five year lease for use of the Jubilee Building as a bingo hall between Fundraising td. and REAL was assigned to GCB with REAL's written consent. GCB further sublet the building without REAL's consent or knowledge. Written notice of renewal was not sent to REAL. The basis of GCB's application was estoppel on the basis that REAL entered negotiations regarding a relocation of the bingo hall and then began to deal directly with CGB's sub-tenant after the renewal date had passed. HELD: The application was dismissed. Costs in the cause. 1)There was no evidence that Fundraisers, the original party to the lease, attempted to exercise the option to renew. 2)GCB did not have a strong prima facie case on the merits. It appeared that there were no negotiations between GCB and REAL. 3)There would not be irreparable harm. Under the current arrangements, the bingo would be operated by RCBA. If successful at trial the damages to GCB can be easily calculated based on the time it was unable to occupy the premises. 4)On balance GCB failed to satisfy the burden of proof that the inconvenience it will suffer by the refusal of the injunction will be greater than that suffered by REAL if granted.",The applicant sought an interlocutory injunction restraining the applicant from entering into any lease with the respondent and preventing the applicantfrom permitting the operation of a bingo hall by the respondent except as a subtenant. The applicant had entered into written agreements for the day to day operation of the bingo halls with the applicant. The agreement stipulated that the applicant would advise the tenant of its position on a date well after the renewal option deadline. The respondent never sought to renew the lease. HELD: The application for an interlocalutory injunction was dismissed. The court found that the respondent had a strong prima facie case and did not act in any way to exercise that right. The sublease contained a provision whereby the applicant could have compelled the applicant to renew but there was no indication that the tenant intended to exercise the right.
c_2006nsca45.txt,"The president of a company against whom the Securities Commission had ordered an investigation applied to the court for certiorari to quash the investigation. He alleged that the investigators had improperly obtained and used the contents of his email, some of which were subject to solicitor and client privilege. In the context of the certiorari application, the company president successfully argued that the Commission's return should contain the fruits of the investigation so far and that he should be entitled to examine one of the investigators for discovery. The Commission appealed, arguing that the underlying judicial review application was improper and premature and thus, the procedural orders should not have been made. Appeal allowed; the underlying judicial review application is stayed; the stay may be lifted by a judge of the Supreme Court on application with notice; the Order of the chambers judge on the procedural matters arising in that application is set aside. The underlying judicial review application was premature because the Commission should have had the opportunity to consider and address the company president's complaints. The decision as to whether or not to release the information sought required the balancing of competing interests in light of the overall statutory scheme and the specific circumstances of the case; the Commission was in the best position to conduct such an exercise.","The respondent received an order in chambers allowing him to appeal his application for certiorari. He sought to have the matter heard, as well as orders quashing, staying and prohibiting the Commission from pursuing the investigation. The chambers judge essentially granted the respondent's application and dismissed the Commission's's's. The Commission argued that the underlying judicial review application was improper and premature. It followed that the chambers judge should not have entertained the respondent’s interlocutory applications. The respondent argued that, in the first instance, he should have taken his complaints about the investigation to the courts. The court reviewed the history of judicial review and found that, under the Act, the applicant was entitled to know what the investigators did in order to mount his challenge and that his immediate recourse to the Courts was to use that information to the fullest extent. The applicant was also entitled to notice of examination. The issues raised by the appeal were whether certioraris is available to challenge an investigation and whether the Commission should not be limited in its pursuit of that objective. The Court found that the application for a stay of the judicial review was premature. The underlying judicial application should not at this stage be dismissed or stayed on the basis that the judicial reviewing application is premature. There are many administrative and practical issues to be addressed even before the investigation is finally resolved. The application for certification would require some level of finial and disclosure, but the Commission was in the best position to provide that information and had the statutory discretion to perform that balancing. The Board met its obligations under the Securities Act and the Act to make certain that all materials were before the Commission. The commission was in its best position and had statutory discretion not to order production. The Act provides for the appointment of an inspector pursuant to s. 27(5) of the Act and for the granting of a warrant to the Commission to obtain the materials. The inspector is obliged to provide a full and complete report of investigation to The Commission and the Commission has statutory discretion in relation to the granting and disclosure of any information or evidence obtained by the Commission and has the power to compel evidence. The purpose of the Commission is to investigate the conduct of the commission. The investigation authorized by the Act is to be carried out in the course of its investigation. To do so will require a balancing of competing interests in light of the overall statutory scheme and the specific circumstances of the case. The process could break down if full access to the material was available only to the commission and not to the police. The provisions in the Act expressly prohibited"

Children to remain with the mother until the end of the school year, at which point primary care of the children will be granted to the applicant; child support adjusted accordingly. The mother's decision to move was not in the children's best interests and it was done either to frustrate or with a callous indifference to the children's relationship with their father.","The parties, who were married in 1993 and separated in 2002, applied to have the children placed in the custody of their father.

The purpose of the conference was to assemble various professionals from diverse fields to discuss the complex issues surrounding the young person and to provide recommendations to the court as to an appropriate sentence. Various of the professionals had expressed their concern as to their ability to participate in the conference if the media was present. Application for access by the media denied; order granted excluding the public and the media from the pre-sentencing conference; the benefits of an exclusion order outweigh the deleterious effect of restricting the public's right to freedom of expression and the freedom of the press. Although the court convened hearing is a public proceeding to which, prima facie, the open court principle applies, the attendance, cooperation and participation of the invitees to the conference (all professionals who were bound by laws, policies and agreements of confidentiality) was strictly voluntary and many, if not all, would be unable and unwilling to participate in a conference that was open to the public and the media. The administration of justice was furthered by the court obtaining the best possible information from those identified as best able to provide it so that recommendations flowing from the conference would lead to the best sentence for the youth. There were no alternative measures which would prevent or reduce the risk of non-participation by the professionals.","The accused appeared before the Youth Court and entered or confirmed guilty pleas to 31 offences involving assaultive behaviour, threats, property damage and breach of court orders in relation to group home placements.

This agreement held that the sum of $550 (adjusted for inflation) is to be paid to the wife until she dies or remarries, whichever comes first. The applicant paid this amount (except for a unilateral deduction in 1995) for over 25 years. The basis of his application is that he is now retired and earning less income. In addition, the respondent now earns part-time income that she did not have at the time of the agreement. At the time of the agreement, the wife raised the couple's five children and received child support from the applicant. HELD: The application is dismissed with costs to the respondent. The SCC has held that in order for a Court to vary support provisions in a valid settlement, separation agreement or consent order, a material or radical change in circumstances causally connected to the marriage needs to be established. Retirement of one of the parties was reasonably foreseeable at the time they entered into the agreement. It was also foreseeable that retirement income is most often less than employment income. This is not the kind of radical unforeseen change in circumstance required to vary the support. The preamble of the parties' agreement states that they intended it to be a complete and final settlement. The applicant has always earned considerable income and continues to have a better standard of living than the respondent. The respondent's modest income does not provide grounds to vary the agreement as she still has a much lower standard of living that the applicant, even after receiving the spousal support.","FIAT: The divorced husband applied to vary the spousal support provisions contained in a separation agreement. The agreement provided for annual adjustments to the spouse amount payable based upon the increase in the Consumer Price Index. The husband was now 67 years old and retired, having deposed to a substantial loss in his employment income at the time the agreement was entered into. He maintained $550 per month for child support until the wife remarried or died, whichever date occurs the sooner. The Agreement provided for an annual adjustment to the amount payable when the consumer price index increased. The wife was living modestly and driving a 1978 vehicle which was in need repair. The application was dismissed with costs to the respondent. The retirement of the applicant and the reduction of his income as a consequence is or was reasonably foreseeable at the original agreement. It was not that kind of radical unforseen change in circumstance required to establish upon authorities to support the variation application. The respondent's modest income provides any proper ground for variation of the agreement. She still had a much lower standard of living than the applicant even after taking into account the amount she is receiving as spousa support. The fact it has occurred is not that sort of radical change in circumstances required to be established upon authorities. Nor am I persuaded that the respondent's moderate income provides some proper ground. She has a much higher standard of life than the respondent even after considering the amount her is receiving in spousals. The Retirement of the Applicant and the Reduction in Income as a Result is reasonably foreseeable. The Applicant's current income is $1,218 after receiving the taxable support payment of $627.00.

e_1998canlii13558.txt,"The bankrupt applied to annul his bankruptcy on the grounds that he received misinformation or had a misunderstanding concerning the effect of an assignment on the status of potential builders' lien claimants and because his assets had been undervalued. He also asserted that the bankruptcy proceedings were of no value to him as builders' lien claimants have status akin to secured creditors and could pursue the bankrupt personally for any deficiency that may arise if the home is sold and the proceeds distributed among the claimants. The trustee maintained the bankrupt was repeatedly advised or cautioned that bankruptcy may not affect the majority of his creditors. Subsequent appraisals placed the value of his unfinished home at $150,000 rather than $40,000. The bankrupt was now eligible to obtain mortgage financing but first had to get out of bankruptcy. The bankrupt had attempted an orderly payment of debts prior to bankruptcy and had considered proposal post-bankruptcy. HELD: The application for an order annulling the assignment was dismissed. 1)The bankrupt met the definition of an insolvent person at the date of the assignment. It would be dangerous to set a precedent which would allow such an application because of post-bankruptcy circumstances. An improved financial situation and the ability to pay debts in full should not be used as criteria to launch section181 application. 2)The bankrupt had not filed monthly financial statements nor made payments as agreed to cover the costs of the administration of the estate. The onus will be on the bankrupt to comply with the requirements of the trustee to qualify for an automatic discharge on November 15/98 or an early discharge as provided for in s168.1(2).","The bankrupt applied to annul his bankruptcy. Section 181 of the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act reads as ""(1) Where in the opinion of the court, a receiving order ought not to have been made on an assignment ought not have been filed, the court may by order annul the bankruptcy."" This application was made twofold. Firstly, that the bankrupt received misinformation or had amisunderstanding concerning the effect of an assignment on the status of potential builders' lien claimants and secondly, that he thought the various subcontractors would not be able to pursue claims against the home he was constructing or against himself. HELD: The application was dismissed. 1)The bankrupt was far from a model bankrupt. He had yet to file monthly financial statements and had not made payments as agreed to cover the costs of the administration of the estate. 2)The court must carefully review the decisions relating to this issue. 3)Section 181 vests wide discretion in the court when considering an application to annulate the assignment. The bankrupt met the definition of an insolvent personat the date of the assignment which would be dangerous because it would set a dangerous precedent for a trustee to apply for an order annulling the bankruptcy. Once the trustee has a realistic prospect of being able to pay off the debts in full, much more expeditiously than would otherwise take place, the bankrupt will have a new criterion for compliance: the ability to launch an application from within two months of filing of the statement. 4)The most secured creditors, who are secured, would benefit from the bankrupt's request being granted. If the bankrupt was granted financing it would likely result in these creditors being paid in full much more quickly than it would otherwise have.

The central issue was whether the Agreement was a lease and liquidated damages should be awarded in accordance with clause two, or a conditional sales security agreement whereby the dealer was restricted to repossession and sale by s.46(2) of the Saskatchewan Farm Security Act. HELD: The plaintiff's claim was dismissed with costs on Column 3. 1)The Agreement was a conditional sales contract whereby title was reserved until the defendant elected to make the final payment. The transaction falls within the ambit of the Saskatchewan Farm Security Act and the dealer's right to recover the unpaid purchase price is restricted to repossession and sale. Although the dealer framed the Agreement as a lease the Agreement itself used notions of retail financing and secured party. Nomenclature such as principal, past due interest, conditional sales contract, purchase of equipment, and retail sales contract were used. The construction and interpretation of the nature of the Agreement is a question of law. The Agreement had many attributes of ownership and collectively showed that the defendant acquired a substantial interest in the sprayer. He had possession and unrestricted right to use the sprayer with high base hours. The total payments were equivalent to the total payments under sales contract. The defendant had the option to acquire title by making the final payment. He bore the risk of loss and obligation for maintenance and insurance. 2)The court could not determine whether the option price would be substantially less, equal or more than the June 2002 fair market value of the sprayer. 3)If the Agreement is lease the defendant's consent to give up possession was conditional upon his release from further liability. Case Credit cannot foreclose the entitlement to 40 days notice and take possession of the sprayer by relying upon conditional unwritten consent. To validate early repossession would defeat the intention of the legislation to protect creditors. Case could take possession only in accordance with Part IV of the SFSA. 4)If the Agreement is lease and covered by the SFSA, the defendant would be released from all liability under s.55. It would be unjust to make any further order in a summary trial without the benefit of discoveries or pre-trial conference and without evidence of the fair market value at the time of seizure. 5)If the Agreement is lease and not covered by the SFSA, it would be held that the dealer was not barred by implied acceptance of the condition the defendant be released from further liability because of the exclusionary clause. Judgment would have been granted for $42,089 with costs on Column 3.","The primary issue is whether the Agreement is a lease or a security agreement. The central issue is between the parties whether the agreement is a leasing or a Security agreement. HELD: The claim is dismissed. The defendant is awarded costs on the basis of Column 3 of Schedule I of the Tariff of Costs. 1) The Agreement has many of the attributes of a lease, but the Agreement itself uses notions such as retail financing and secured party. The construction and interpretation of the nature of the Agreement was a question of law. The primary incidents of ownership are use of the sprayer for all of its useful life with the obligation to pay the capital cost plus the cost of investment, acquisition of substantial interest, purchase of equipment, realize on security and retail sales contract. 2) The primary issues of ownership and interpretation are ownership and control. The Agreement falls within the ambit of The Saskatchewan Farm Security Act. 3) The parties agreed to a conditional sales contract whereby title was reserved until Mr. Poirier elected to pay. 4) The agreement has many attributes of ownership. The retail financing agreement and security agreement are common elements. The purchase of a vehicle for the purpose of transporting the equipment is a security transaction. The vehicle is a motor vehicle. The owner was to have possession and the unrestricted right to use it. 5) The vehicle was to bear the risk of loss and obligations for maintenance and insurance. The agreement does not define 'finance' in that sense. 6) The plaintiff was awarded costs of the claim on the Column 3 as he advanced his case and advanced his evidence in defence. 7) The evidence is clear that the parties treated the trade-in as the advance payment (but the Agreement does not defines it in that way) even though the value of the trade in does not equal the amount of the advance payments. The difference being $679.33 (between $10,000.00 and $9,320.67). The issue was not plead in defence but rather in the framework of the summary trial, albeit without the benefit of discoveries or pre-trial conference. It would be unjust to make any further order under the Act in these circumstances and in the absence of an evidentiary basis, for example, of the fair market value of a sprayer at the time of the seizure as required for an order under s. 55(c) of the Act."
c_2008skca28.txt,"The appellant agreed to buy a two-story condominium unit from the respondent developer. The building permit had not been obtained, nor had condominium titles been raised at the time the sale agreement was entered into. In the course of construction the respondent opted not to proceed with the two-story unit, revising it to a single story unit which was offered to the appellant. The appellant did not accept the offer, and registered a miscellaneous interest against the title to the entire parcel of land. The appellant sues for specific performance of the agreement and in the alternative, damages. The developer succeeded in obtaining a court order discharging the miscellaneous interest. The Court's jurisdiction to hear the appeal is found in s. 111 of The Land Titles Act, 2000. The issue is whether the appellant possessed an interest in land so as to support the registration of a miscellaneous interest. HELD: Appeal dismissed.  1) Before a condominium plan as defined in The Condominium Property Act, 1993 comes into being, there is nothing in the Act which directly or inferentially entertains the prospect that a purchase of a 'proposed unit' can constitute an interest in land, or a registrable interest for the purposes of s. 50 of The Land Titles Act, 2000. 2) The Act expressly prohibits the registration of any charge against the common property. The appellant is not entitled to rest his claim to a registrable interest in the surface parcel on the basis of a notional claim to rights in 'common property'. Common property, by definition, does not come into existence until the condominium plan comes into effect. 3) For the purposes of s. 50 of The Land Titles Act, 2000, the appellant had no basis in law, or under The Condominium Property Act, 1993 for asserting an interest against the surface parcel owned by the respondent.","The appellant agreed to purchase a two-storey condominium unit (Units and 6) from the respondent developer. It was the only planned unit of its kind in the warehouse the developer proposed to convert to a 26 unit condominium complex. The developer opted not to proceed with the two-story unit, revising it instead to a single story unit (Unit 5). The appellant registered a miscellaneous interest against the title to the entire parcel of land. The Chambers judge agreed with the respondent that the appellant's ultimate remedy should lie in damages as opposed to specific performance and urged the respondent to file its statement of defence and proceed to resolution without further delay. The order was immediately registered in January 2007 and the appellant’s miscellaneous interests was discharged from title. The appeal is dismissed with costs. The registration of a miscollegious interest is analogous to the registration of caveat protecting an interest under the former Land Titles Act. The principles of the common law apply. The respondent had not filed a statement of defense at the time it made the application, and the issues lacked refinement. The determination of appropriate remedies was premature at that stage of the proceedings."

The appeal is made on the basis that the trial judge did not comply with the mandatory provisions of s. 737 of the Criminal Code. HELD: The imposition of a victim fine surcharge under s. 737 of the code is mandatory subject only to an application under s. 737(5) relating to undue hardship. If an offender is exempted from payment of the victim surcharge, it is also mandatory that the Court give reasons. The sentence is varied to include an order requiring the respondent to pay a victim surcharge in the amount of $30.","HELD: The Crown appeals the sentence to the extent that the victim surcharge was waived. The sentence was made on the basis that the trial judge did not comply with the mandatory provisions of s. 737 of the Code. The victim surcharges are paid on an annual basis and are part of a victim surtax payable on an offence committed under s. 730 of the Act. The surcharge is waived when an offender is convicted or discharged under section 730of an offence under this Act or the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act. If an offender was exempted from payment of the victim fee, it is also mandatory that the court give reasons. HELD: 1) The maximum surcharge of 15 per cent is paid by the Crown in accordance with the maximum surcharges paid by S. 527 judges. 2) The sentencing judge consistently and consistently failed to meet the statutory and other obligations of an S. 725 victim surfand. 3) The entire S. 737 record is changed. S. 687 has been employed by SCC since 1995 and is consistently employed by the court to ensure that the maximum amount is paid. This is particularly true when the sentencing judge has consistently failed in his duties to the court. SCC has a high standard of enforcement and the SCC is consistently used to ensure the maximum maximum surpluses are paid. The sentencing Judge has consistently and reliably failed to provide the court with the required reasons. 4) The Court has consistently raised the maximum victim surpland paid by victims of criminal justice offences by using S.745(5) and S.771(6) of the Criminal Code."
d_2012skqb237.txt,"The appellant was convicted of driving over .08 contrary to s. 253(b) of the Criminal Code. The appellant's memorandum of law and oral argument only addressed whether the police officer had reasonable and probable ground to arrest and demand his breath sample and asserted a violation of his rights pursuant to s. 8 and 9 Charter of Rights. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. The trial judge tested the officer's credibility and the judge's conclusion was supported by facts. The officer's belief was based on the observation that the appellant was driving with a flat tire, with windshield wipers operating on a clear night, as well as slurred speech and bloodshot eyes. The officer had reasonable and probable grounds to demand a sample of the appellant's breath.","An appeal from a conviction in the Provincial Court of Saskatchewan that the appellant did, having consumed alcohol in such a quantity that the concentration thereof in his blood exceeded 80 milligrams of alcohol in 100 milliliters of blood, operate a motor vehicle contrary to s.255(1) and s.253(b) of the Criminal Code. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. 1)The trial judge was in a position to test the credibility of the trial judge. In coming to his conclusion he considered the totality of the evidence, the trial court considered the facts. The trial judge's decision was reasonable and supported by the evidence. It is not clear that the officer observed the bloodshot eyes of the appellant after making the formal arrest as argued by the appellant. The appellant was in the police vehicle at the time that the trial officer made the demand for sample of his breath. 2)The bloodshot eye evidence did not establish that the respondent had reasonable and probable grounds to make the demand. The officer's evidence was not supported by what the appellant testified at trial. The evidence was clear that she had observed the appellant stumble out of the vehicle and that he was running with a flat tire and with the vehicle's windshield wipers operating although it was a clear night. 3)The court found that the decision of the court was reasonable. It was not clear if the appellant had fainted or had a cleft lip and that that may have affected his speech. The bloodshot Eyes were not established by the trial as they were not clearly observed. The decision of a trial judge to exclude the blood-shot eyes was not reasonable and support by the totality evidence. 4)The appeal was based on reasonable and reasonable grounds to demand a sample of the respondent's breath. The respondent's memorandum of law and oral argument dealt only with the contention that the police officer did not have reasonable and likely grounds to arrest him and to demand that he provide a sample for analysis, thereby infringing his right under ss. and of the Charter and in s.8, or s.9 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. The video confirmed that she was correct in most of those observations. The subjective element in determining whether she had reasonable or probable grounds for making the demand is not present. The determination that the court erred in finding that the breath sample was minimally invasive and should not be excluded is correct. The court found the respondent has reasonable and possibly probable grounds. The appeal court found"
5_2007skpc74.txt,"Decision, following a voir dire, on the admissibility of statements made by the accused to a police officer, beginning with: 'Excuse me, I was in a roll-over accident and I am intoxicated.' The officer, who observed symptoms of impairment, asked the accused how much he had had to drink and was told he had consumed about 15 beers. The officer placed the accused under arrest for impaired operation of a motor vehicle, and read him his Charter rights, the Police Warning and a Demand for Blood Sample. The officer then detained the accused by remaining with him while awaiting the Blood Kit to arrive and for a blood technician to take the blood. During this time, the officer interrogated the accused about the accident and the accused provided additional information. The Crown contended that if he was given the police warning then it would be clear to the accused that he did not have to continue to answer questions the officer's questions. The Defence argued that since the arrest and the blood demand were based upon self-incriminating evidence obtained by breach of the accused's s. 7 rights, the arrest was illegal and all evidence obtained thereafter should be excluded; or, at least, that the information obtained was illegally obtained and the police could not rely on that information to make the demand. The accused testified that he talked to the police officer only because he believed he had a legal obligation to do so, based on advice he had received from others that there was a legal obligation to report the accident promptly to the police. The Crown conceded that the accused did have a legal obligation to report the accident promptly, and that if the accused believed he was reporting the accident when he gave self-incriminating statements to the police officer as a result of that belief, those statements must be excluded according to law. HELD: All of the statements of the accused, including those made after the arrest, are excluded and will not form part of the Crown's case. The evidence obtained, and the statements, in particular, were self-incriminating and conscriptive. The officer was acting in good faith, not with serious intentional disregard of the accused's rights. He was not taking a statement under the Traffic Safety Act. He did not know that the accused was only saying things because he believed he had to under compulsion of statute. Even though the investigator did nothing that violated the accused's rights, they were nevertheless violated. Because the violation resulted in the making of statements that amounted to self-incriminating evidence, following the logic of the case law, it is necessary to exclude those statements. The accused did approach the police officer with the intention of reporting the accident as is required by the Traffic Safety Act. As such, and as the Crown correctly concedes, his initial statement, anything said by the accused while providing his personal information and the answer to any question while registering at the hospital are excluded from this trial. As the self-incriminating statements made under compulsion of statute have been excluded, it follows that any evidence that came about as a result of the officer following up on those excluded statements are also in breach of the accused's s. 7 rights.","The accused was charged with impaired operation, driving over.08 and breach of his section 7 rights. The voir dire was held following a voir net on the admissibility of statements made by the accused to a police officer. The accused made several self-incriminating statements to the police officer, which were all made under compulsion of statute. HELD: The evidence received by the officer was as the result of a breach of the accused's section 7 right. The statements were excluded from the trial as they were self- incriminating and conscriptive. The admission that the accused believed he was reporting the accident when he gave self- incriminating Statements to the officer as a result of this belief would be accepted. The evidence must only be excluded based upon the factors expressed in R. v. Collins, [1987] SCC), 113 C.C.C.; and Stillman (1997), 113 S.C.(3d) 321. The officer was acting in good faith and was not acting with a serious, intentional disregard of the victim's rights nor was he taking a statement under the Traffic Safety Act. He was interrogating the accused after he had arrested him, explained what he was doing, explained his rights to counsel and further warned him that he was not obligated to say anything further to the accused. He responded to the officers treatment for his injuries by remaining with the accused while awaiting the Blood Kit to arrive and for blood technician to take the blood. The police officer formed the opinion that he should ask the accused for a blood sample to determine the quantity of alcohol in his blood. He therefore placed the accused under arrest for impaired operation of motor vehicle, read him his Charter rights, the Police Warning and Demand for Blood Sample and was'relatively co-operative throughout. The self- referencing statements that were made under a compulsion of a statute have been excluded. The defence also argued that since the arrest and the blood demand were based upon evidence obtained by breach of a accused's s. 7 rights and were self incriminating, the admissible statements will be excluded."
7_2018skca42.txt,"Criminal Law – Murder – Second Degree Murder – Conviction – AppealEvidence – Unsavoury Witnesses – Vetrovec Warning – Charge to Jury The appellant had been found guilty of second degree murder following a trial before a judge and jury. He appealed on the ground that the trial judge had failed to give the jury a Vetrovec warning regarding the testimony of his former common law spouse (S.S.) and a witness who had been his friend (W.D.) who was the source of the gun used in the shooting of the victim. The appellant’s trial counsel had initially identified the need for the judge to issue the warning because W.D. had an interest in the outcome because there were outstanding charges against him and because there was the potential that S.S.would be charged too, she would also have an interest in the case as well. During the pre-charge conference with defence counsel and the Crown, the trial judge noted that in giving the warning to the jury he would also have to convey a summary of the Crown’s confirmatory evidence. The defence counsel then withdrew his application. The victim had been a friend of the appellant. According to S.S.’s testimony, the appellant and the victim had pre-arranged a meeting in an abandoned farmyard. The victim worked as an automated teller machine (ATM) technician and as part of his job, he travelled between ATMs carrying cash. S.S. did not see what happened between the two men but heard two gunshots and then saw the appellant and the victim point guns at each other. She saw the victim on his knees pleading with the appellant and offering money in exchange for his life. The appellant instructed her to collect the money and the victim’s cellphone and place them in his truck and while she was doing so, she heard another gunshot and saw the victim lying face down and the appellant standing over him holding a gun. As she and the appellant left the scene, the appellant gave her the victim’s gun. The appellant hid the other guns and the money at another farm site and then dumped the victim’s cellphone and ammunition in a farm field. Apart from the handguns, none of the other items were ever recovered. The witness remained in a relationship with the appellant for another four years following the crime until November 2013. She was contacted by the police in February 2013 and denied any knowledge of the incident. At trial, S.S. testified that she was afraid of the appellant and he had warned her that as an accomplice, she was as involved as he was. When the RCMP contacted her again in May 2014, she again denied any knowledge but then told the officer what she knew because she felt safer and would receive protection from the appellant. S.S. did not have a criminal record, nor was she charged with any offence arising from this incident. The appellant testified that during the meeting in the farmyard, the victim produced two handguns and they began to test fire the weapons. The victim suggested that they stage a fake robbery. The appellant would rough up his friend and then take the cash from his truck. The victim became quite aggressive after the appellant hit him too hard and began chasing him with one of his guns. S.S. then took one of the guns and shot the victim three times. She took $23,000 in cash from his truck because she had financial problems. The testimony of W.D. was that the appellant had acquired two handguns, a Glock and a .22 calibre handgun, from him, ostensibly on behalf of another friend. Several days later, the appellant returned both handguns and reported that after his friend began to shoot at him with the .22 calibre, he had returned fired and shot him three times. On the appellant’s insistence, the witness changed the barrel of the Glock handgun several months later. The police arrested W.D. and charged him with unspecified offences arising from the incident. In the appellant’s version, he testified that the victim brought the guns to the meeting and assumed that he acquired them from W.D. He therefore returned them to W.D. after the incident and requested that he change the barrel on the Glock to protect W.D. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. The court found that the trial judge had not erred by not giving the Vetrovec warning. It was not mandatory for him to do so regardless of the position of the defence counsel. The judge was aware of the need for such a warning in the circumstances and after consulting with the Crown and the defence, he exercised his discretion to decide that he would not instruct the jury. The judge was aware that the defence counsel withdrew his application as a tactical decision to avoid having the judge repeat the Crown’s confirmatory evidence to the jury. The judge’s exercise of his discretion was entitled to deference.","HELD: The appeal was dismissed. The court found that the trial judge did not give a Vetrovec warning to either witness. The appeal court also found that in the circumstances the trial court erred in law by not giving a warning to both witness. Although the witness's testimony may have been slightly disreputable, the court found no error of law on the part of the trial Judge in failing to give a warning. The trial judge’s decision was based upon a fundamental misunderstanding of the strength of the ballistic and scientific evidence and was not based on a fundamental mistake of the judge. The scientific evidence did not support the version of events given by the witness."
b_2004skqb105.txt,"FIAT: The defendant applied for security for costs in the amount of $50,000. HELD: The plaintiff was required to supply security for costs in the amount of $18,000. 1) The defendant proved facts, which demonstrated the existence of several of the criteria listed in Rule 538 of the Queen's Bench Rules of Court. The plaintiff failed to establish any of the situations listed in Rule 539.  2) The presence of a counterclaim does not necessarily or automatically prohibit the granting of an order for security for costs. Rather, it is a factor to be considered. In this case, the counterclaim was not a wholly distinct claim. It arises in respect of the same matter and transaction as the claim proper. 3) The defendant commenced the builders' lien action, long before filing a defence and counterclaim within this action. Had the counterclaim not been filed, an order for security for costs as requested would have been appropriate. It is somewhat artificial to now deny that relief because of the counterclaim, which has the effect of facilitating a disposition of all matters within one proceeding. 4) The plaintiff applied ex parte under s. 56(1) of The Builders' Lien Act to have the defendant's lien vacated. The application was granted, but the plaintiff was required to post security for costs in the amount of $50,000. The Builders' Lien Act does not impede the jurisdiction of this Court to deal with the application of the defendant.","FIAT. The defendant applied to have the plaintiff ordered to provide security for costs in the amount of $50,000. The application was dismissed and the amount ordered in the lesser amount of money was increased by $18,000 to reflect the fact that the plaintiff had commenced an action several months before the counterclaim had been filed. The counterclaim was based on an allegation of negligence by the defendant in resolving the work. The plaintiff asserted that the defendant had failed to rectify certain sub-soil conditions which were frustrating the work and eventually directed the defendant to vacate the site. The defendants counterclaimed for the cost of the work, which was in the sum of $20,000, $25,000 of which was security for cost. The court reviewed the case law and found that the presence of a counterclaim did not preclude an order for security for the costs. The Court then considered whether the counter claim was a form of cash monies, a bond or letter of credit provided by a recognized financial institution for the defendant and concluded that it did not have an absolute prohibition. The presence of the counterclaimed in the circumstances of this case did not disqualify an order such as that for security."

The terms of the settlement and the sum paid were not to be disclosed. Beyond the issue of privilege which was a complete answer to the request, revisiting that action was a more critical problem.

There were numerous adverse impacts on the victim. 2)Mitigating circumstances included the absence of a criminal record; his abstinence from alcohol since the assault; the absence of penile penetration; his remorse and apology to the victim and to the court; his serious health problems; his ability to rehabilitate and the fact that he was a model citizen prior to the assault.","The accused was convicted of sexual assault. The Crown sought a sentence of 1/2 to years for the offence, categorizes it as rape, and alleges there was no prior romantic connection between the victim and the accused, and that she pleaded with him not to do this. The property damage and vandalism had no connection to the case. HELD: A lower sentence was justified. A sentence of 18 months in a provincial correctional centre would seriously affect the accused's ability to rehabilitate. A three year threshold sentence was imposed for sexual assault where there was penetration, and the prohibited weapons were prohibited. The accused was prohibited from having fire arms, ammunition or explosive substances for a period of ten years from his release from prison.

The defendant owned and operated residential rental properties. The plaintiff, who had stopped working as a medical records technician in 1988, maintained the household and assisted in the business by answering phones, bookkeeping, showing apartments and helping with minor repairs. (1) that the plaintiff met the three requirements to prove an unjust enrichment by virtue of the plaintiff's contributions of time and money, namely (a) an enrichment, (b) a corresponding deprivation, and (c) the absence of any juristic reason for the enrichment. The proper remedy was an award of monetary damages representing 25% of the increase in the value of the defendant's assets during the relationship, not the imposition of a constructive trust; and (2) jointly held properties were to be sold pursuant to the Partition Act, unless the plaintiff elected to buy out the defendant's one half interest within 30 days. Prejudgment interest was calculated from the date of separation to September 1, 1991, at 10% per year.","The plaintiff sought an order for the partition and sale of two properties owned jointly by the parties and a division of other property owned by the defendant based on a constructive trust. The parties cohabited for approximately twelve years. The plaintiff was employed as a medical records techinician, but for most of the years they lived together, she worked part-time. The defendant purchased and operated a small farm and log house. The plaintiffs lived in the log house for four years. For the four years between their separation they lived in it, the plaintiff paid all of the household expenses with the exception of the mortgage on the property held by the plaintiff. The respondent, who owned a small business, made significant contributions to the construction of the log home. The court found that the respondent's income from his various businesses and income from the farm and his income from an employment and interest income was $2,000 per year. The Court found that Mrs. Keddy had a minimal role in the construction business, contributing labour and running the farm for the plaintiff's benefit and helping to prepare the annual rental increase notices. The constructive trust was established, and the parties' assets were properly managed. The appellant's claim for damages was dismissed. The evidence showed that the parties had a common law relationship and that the court would not allow any unjust enrichment to occur if the facts showed that all of her assets were in fact acquired by the respondent. The petitioner's contributions were both direct and indirect. Her involvement in his business directly assisted in the preservation of the farm, its continuation in his absence, and its debts were properly accounted for.

Although the signature card signed when the account was opened could not be found for the hearing, the probate court relied on the evidence of the bank representative (who testified that she had the card when she closed the account and she was 100% sure that the account was a joint account and who was able to present to the court the form of the applicable account agreement) in determining that the monies in the joint account belonged to the daughter.  It was also found, on a strong balance of probabilities, that the deceased intended to make an inter vivos gift to her daughter and, alternatively, that the evidence rebutted any presumption of resulting trust in favour of the deceased or her estate. Another of the deceased's children appealed. Appeal dismissed; the probate court judge did not misapprehend the evidence, lack an evidentiary basis for his findings, rely upon incorrect legal principles or fail to apply or misapply the law.","At issue was the ownership of monies in a joint bank account in the names of the deceased and her children. The appellant and the respondents were children of the late Mrs. Scott and served as adminstratrix of her late mother. The respondent and her 10 children were children. All parties were self-represented on the appeal. The appeal was dismissed as there was no evidence of an inter vivos gift and the probate court judge did not err in making a determination that, unless all the evidence was put forward, the account was not properly handled by the court and that further investigation was required."

After undergoing treatment from 14 specialists, the plaintiff had little relief four years following the accident. He was rendered permanently disabled from all work for which he was trained and could no longer work the farm, sawmill or Christmas tree operation he had developed. Assessing non-pecuniary damages at $60,000. In assessing pecuniary damages, the court accepted the defendant's expert evidence which led to the conclusion the plaintiffs businesses were marginally profitable. The defendants were ordered to pay $30,000 as real, net loss of future income. The court approved a 5% capitalization rate as being appropriate where there was an eight year term to age 65. The plaintiff settled his future Section B benefits just before trial. The court rejected the defence argument that they were entitled to a credit for present value of those benefits which represented a figure over seven times the settlement figure. The defendants were only entitled to a credit for sums actually paid to the plaintiff. The court rejected the plaintiff's actuarial report as being late and in breach of Civil Procedure Rule 31.08.","The plaintiff was seriously injured in a motor vehicle accident. His automobile was struck from behind. He was not hospitalized, never required surgery, was not even remotely disabled for any type of employment, and had been making reasonable efforts to improve his condition. For the defendants, that the injuries had rendered the plaintiff totally and permanently disabled for all employment, save for temporary temporary work. The plaintiff was awarded general damages of $47,000, $54,000 of which were pre-tax, and $55,000 interest.

c_1998canlii12367.txt,"The decision of the Board of Arbitration was held by the chambers judge to be fundamentally flawed in that the majority brushed aside basic grammatical conventions; had proceeded upon a bad principle of construction obviously weighted in favour of the grievance; had discarded the ordinary meaning of some words; and had violated the terms of the agreement precluding alteration of its provisions. She also held that one cannot ignore the phrase 'pursuant to Article 28 or 26', read it out of existence nor re-write it and that if the words were given their ordinary meaning the interpretation was patently unreasonable. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. 1)The trial judge did not err in concluding the majority decision of the Board of Arbitration was patently unreasonable. Its decision rested upon an interpretation of the collective bargaining agreement that the words of the agreement could not reasonably bear. 2)No material error was found in her analysis in finding that the decision was fundamentally flawed or in her analysis of the phrase 'pursuant to Article 28'. Nor in her identification or application of the governing standard of review. DISSENT: The appeal would have been allowed. 1)There was no dispute that the central issue, the reviewability of the board's interpretation, requires an application of the test prescribed by Shalansky. The Chambers judge did not follow that approach. Once it is accepted that there are two reasonable constructions, the suggestion of a reviewable error of law in consensual arbitration disappears. The decision can only be set aside if it involves an interpretation the words of the agreement could not reasonably bear. The patently unreasonable test is a very strict test. 2)The judge was wrong to use the Melford decision to support her conclusion that the Pool interpretation was the only one which the words of the collective agreement could reasonably bear. 3)Once the ordinary meaning of the words 'pursuant to' must be set aside by reason of their context in Article 16, the decision by an adjudicator to choose either 'for the purposes of' or 'subject to' is motivated more by the result desired rather than by fine legal principles of interpretation. Such policy decisions are better left to arbitrators in the field than to judges.","The Chambers judge was not convinced that the majority decision of the Board of Arbitration in the grievance was 'patently unreasonable'. She noted at the beginning that she was not empowered to interfere with the decision of a board of arbitration unless it was'reasonable'. The resulting interpretation was not necessarily unreasonable. Allowing the appeal, that the Chambers judge's analysis was perfectly rational and that the appeal was dismissed with costs, that both parties were not bound by the Court's interpretation of the decision, and that neither the Chambers nor the Chief Justice's approach was irrational."
5_2006skca7.txt,"This is an appeal brought by the R.M. from a judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench determining that a mortgage held by the R.M. was subordinate to a mortgage held by the respondent Farm Credit Canada (FCC), even though the R.M. mortgage was registered before the mortgage of FCC. The R.M. had agreed with the mortgagor that its mortgage would be subordinate to that of FCC. The appeal raises the application of the priority provisions of The Land Titles Act, 2000 and in particular the application of s. 54 of the Act. HELD: The mortgage of the respondent has priority over the mortgage of the appellant. The appeal is dismissed with costs.  1) It is not necessary in this case to consider whether the priority provisions of the Land Titles Act are overridden by commercial postponement agreements in mortgages, or whether reliance by the competing security holder is necessary in order to displace the doctrine of privity of contract in relation to a covenant to postpone, for the court consider the matter to be governed by a consideration of the nature of the interest created by the R.M. mortgage in light of s. 54(3) of the Act. 2) Registration does not and cannot alter the nature of the legal interest granted by the instrument registered. In the present case the mortgage instrument states that it is pursuant to the prior Grant Agreement executed by the parties. This agreement, in turn, clearly provides that any security granted by Mainline to the R.M. is subject to the prior security interest of the respondent to the extent of $3,125,000. In effect, Mainline granted to the R.M. a mortgage of a limited interest, being Mainline's equity of redemption after any mortgage held by the respondent, to the extent of $3,125,000. The appellant admits that it was never intended, as between itself and Mainline, that it would obtain a security interest in priority to that of the respondent. Mainline granted a mortgage to the appellant subject to the prior interests, as defined, of the respondent and of CIBC. The appellant is therefore, seeking to increase the interest actually accorded to it by the debtor by relying on its prior registration and the priority provision of the Act.","This is an appeal from a judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench determining that a mortgage held by the respondent was subordinate to a mortgage holding by the R.M. even though the RM. mortgage was registered before the mortgage of the respondent. The appeal is dismissed with costs to the respondent on the basis that the trial judge's conclusion that the respondent has priority over the appellant is arguable. The respondent agreed to a postponement in favour of the applicant. The trial judge held that the RMR had priority over that of the appellant. The appellant appealed. Appeal dismissed; the trial court disagreed with the conclusion that a fee simple mortgage of a respondent has a priority over a mortgage of that of an R. M. mortgage. The fact that the second FCC Mortgage was registered in favour and registered against the respondent's fee simple interest is not an arguable issue in this case. The R. m. had agreed to the postponement under the terms of the Land Titles Act. The second FCC mortgage was not registered nor was it a security interest at all. The claim of priority was not made against the mortgage by virtue of the second caveat but rather by way of a security arrangement between the parties. The parties agreed to postpone their transactions until the completion of the land acquisition. The Court held that by virtue in the filing of the caveat the respondent obtained priority over its prior interest. The appellants appealed. HELD: Appeal dismissed with cost to the respondents. 1)The LTA is only effective pursuant to the principles of privity of contract and is not subject to the priority provisions of The Land Title Act. 2)The Act does not prevent or preclude the parties from contracting to change the statutory order of priorities between themselves. Postponing a mortgage (i.e. subordinating one security to another) is common in commercial practice and effectively alter the priorities between the Parties. The Act does, however, require a prior knowledge of the underlying principles of the common law and privityof contract. The principles of justice and the primacy of contract do not apply to this case, as registration, by virtue only, has the benefit of hindsight and the prior knowledge set out in the LTA sets out clearly. 3)The respondent obtained, under the provisions of the LAA, priority over first equitable interest of the appellants. The LTA does not permit or require prior knowledge or the prior intention of either party. The decision in Royal Trust Co. v. Roberts Group Ltd. 1995 CanLII 6094 did"
8_2015skqb6.txt,"HELD: This was an extraordinary event for all of the accused and nothing in the evidence suggested that they required rehabilitation or that incarceration would assist in rehabilitation. The victim did not provide a victim impact statement, but the court concluded that the event would have been terrifying for him. The gravity of the offence was high given the maximum sentence of life imprisonment. The court found the following mitigating factors: 1) guilty pleas; 2) the event was not planned in advance, it was prompted by alcohol use; 3) the assault was serious but brief; 4) the accused were all employed and contributing members of society; 5) the accused all accepted responsibility for the offence; and 6) the accused all complied with strict release conditions for three years. The aggravating factors were: 1) s. 348.1 of the Criminal Code was applicable to all accused even though their level of participation differed; 2) they entered the victim’s residence by breaking a window; 3) the crime was intense; 3) two of three accused had weapons and used them on the victim; and 4) the victim had some lasting injuries from losing three to four teeth. The court was prepared to extend leniency to the accused; however, some period of incarceration was found necessary to meet the objectives of deterrence and denunciation. A.H. was sentenced to 10 months incarceration, J.M. to 11 months incarceration, and N.F. to 12 months less a day incarceration for the break and enter charge and one year consecutive incarceration on the s. 85(2) charge. All accused were given an 18-month probation period to follow their incarceration. Terms of the probation included counselling as required and no contact with the victim.","HELD: The Court sentenced the three accused pursuant to s. 267(b) and s. 348(1)(b) of the Criminal Code to imprisonment for common assault. The Court found that the three had acted in good faith and were at low risk to re-offend. The offences occurred over a period of 13 days. The three accused admitted to the offence, and gave a statement to the police shortly after their arrest. They were assessed as being at medium risk to reapply for the offence. The 9-1-1 recording showed that the accused decided to break a window in the back of the house and enter through it, which was also where the offence took place. The accused admitted that they used the roofing hammer and that they threw the roofer hammer into the house. The Crown sought a sentence of 9 to 12 months, bearing in mind that there was a medium risk of re-occurrence. The alleged assault on the complainant was violent and took place over a distance. The common law student who had been assaulted by the three was 28 years old. He had a previous criminal record for driving over.08. He was fined $2,000 and prohibited from driving for one year. The fourth accused, who was 29 years old and had a significant criminal record, sought a term of 9-to-1 probation. He also sought a DNA order, a firearm prohibition and a forfeiture order in relation to the imitation firearm. The first accused sought a life sentence in the range of 9 years. The second accused sought sentence of 1 year to 18 months. The sentences were found to be in line with the range the Court had previously imposed. The third accused sought sentences of 1-1 year, 1 year, and 1 year for the use of the imitation gun. The court found that both the accused and the fourth accused had a similar record for offences committed in 2012 and 2013. The circumstances of the offence and the person who was arrested at the time of the assault were very familiar to the accused. The 3 accused who were convicted of common assault had a lengthy record for violent offences committed against their peers. The residential environment was very hostile and it was common to see people get into fights in the street. The impact on the victim was immediate and severe. The 4 year sentence given to the fourth and 5 year olds was severe. It would appear that the four accused engaged in activity that incited these three accused to take some action, once their complaints to police went unaddressed. The four year sentence sought"
2_2011nssc290.txt,"Rule 85.04 – Order for confidentiality The parties moved under Rule 59.60 to have the court seal their file after media asked to view it. They didn't ask to exclude the public from the hearing, nor did they seek a publication ban.  , the file will be sealed. While Rule 59.60 doesn't provide guidance on when it would be appropriate to seal a file, Rule 85.04(1) does. The SCC decision of Dagenais (and related cases) applies. A confidentiality order should only be granted when: necessary to prevent a serious risk to an important interest; there are no less intrusive measures available; and the benefits outweigh the costs. Personal embarrassment or damage to a party's reputation isn't enough. Here, the important public interest is the protection of personal identifiers (e.g. SIN's, addresses, bank account numbers and other personal information required on court documents). Having these identifiers accessible to members of the public can result in identity theft, which is a real and serious concern. The court is able to take judicial notice of the fact society values the prevention of identity theft (and that it exists in the first place). There are no less intrusive measures to prevent access to this personal information that aren't cumbersome and costly for the parties and court administration staff. The salutary effects of a sealing order outweigh its deleterious effects, especially since the public will still be permitted to access the court hearing and any decision that is rendered. The open court principle was crafted at a time when the internet wasn't a public source of information and manipulation.","The parties had both requested an order to seal the contents of their divorce file. The petitioner had requested the file be sealed on the date of the hearing and in a separate file, not accessible to the public, essentially two files for every proceeding. The parties sought to keep the documents contained in the file private. They also sought disclosure of any information that might be disclosed. The filing system was under different regulatory systems than those to which the public may be subject. The media was prohibited from viewing the file and the parties' websites contained information about upcoming events and birth dates, income tax returns and income tax filing. The court had a duty to protect the privacy of witnesses and children. It did not want the information to be disclosed because it would create an unnecessary burden on the parties and undermine their credibility. The applicant and respondent sought to have the file sealed to protect their reputation, their reputation against unproven allegations that may be contained in material filed in this proceeding. HELD: The sufficiency of the application was satisfied. The salutary effects of a sealing order do not outweigh its deleterious effects in the circumstances. The file should be sealed to preserve their reputation and to permit the Maintenance Enforcement Program to find a payor of spousal or child support or to issue garnishment against wages or income tax refunds, or to suspend driving privileges. The sufficence of a sealed file does outweigh its burden because it contains information that can be of interest to the general public. There is no evidence of the public's interest in preserving confidentiality. The risk of identity theft is real. Should not have to wait until it occurs to recognize that risk. Do not need a police officer to inform me about this risk. The public has an interest in and expects personal identifier information contained in court documents to be protected in order to prevent identity theft. There must be a social value and public interest in protecting these personal identifiers. The present system is not designed to protect these personal identifying information. The practice of sealing files is common in many jurisdictions. It is not a new concept. The preservation of the files is a public interest and society values prevention of identity loss. It was important to have a system in place to protect this information. It would be unfair to the parties if they were prevented from accessing the file. A sealing order would result in the loss of valuable information and the applicant's reputation being damaged."
b_2013skqb265.txt,"The appellant landlord appealed a decision of the Residential Tenancies hearing officer. The tenancy in question had commenced in April 2012. On September 18, the tenant had given six weeks' notice of her intention to terminate the tenancy. The term of the lease stated that it was for a term of 12 months (April 2012 to March 2013) and continuing thereafter from month to month until one of the parties gave one month's notice. The appellant did not try to rent the premises following receipt of the notice because he had decided to furnish the unit prior to re-renting. He spent $15,000 doing so and advertised the unit in mid-January, increasing the rent by $400 and obtained a new tenant as at February 1. Although it is not stated what relief the landlord sought from the Office of Residential Tenancies, the hearing officer stated in the decision that the lease was a month-to-month tenancy. The appellant argued that the hearing officer made errors in law in that he 1) misinterpreted s. 19(1)(g)(iii) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 in making that finding, as the lease was for a fixed term; and 2) misinterpreted s. 8(2) of the Act in finding that the landlord's efforts at mitigation were not reasonable within the meaning of the section and the landlord was legally disentitled by s. 8(1) of the Act. HELD: The Court held that the hearing officer had erred in law in finding that the lease was for a month-to-month tenancy. The one-month-notice provision only applied if the tenancy was extended beyond the fixed term. The appeal was allowed on this issue. The Court found that the decision of the landlord to furnish the premises was a business decision, and the result of this decision could not be attributed to the tenant. The Court dismissed the appellant's claim for loss.","The appellant landlord appealed a decision of the Residential Tenancies Hearing Officer in finding the tenancy agreement was not a fixed-term agreement and that the landlord is legally disentitled to compensation pursuant to s. 8(1) of the Act. HELD: The appeal was dismissed with costs. 1)The tenant did not properly furnish the unit prior to re-renting it and spent approximately $15,000 on the process to furnish it. He spent approximately 15,000 dollars on the unit and obtained a new tenant effective February 2013 at $2500 per month. 2)The fact that an indefinite term follows the fixed term of one year does not detract from the fact that the respondent was committed to the fixed Term of one Year at the time she gave notice to terminate the lease on September 18, 2012. 3)The wording of the lease indicated it is for a fixed term from April 1, 2012 to March 31, 2013 and may thereafter be continued on month to month basis. None of the macro decisions that were made by the tenant in this case could be attributed to the respondent. To put the respondent's business forward, it would be appropriate to have the respondent advertise the unit for rent immediately after receiving the notice to vacate, which would be a reasonable time to do so. 4)The hearing officer misinterpreted s. 19(1)(g)(iii) of The Residential Tenancy Agreement in finding that the tenancy was not for a Fixed Term. 5)The Hearing Officer erred in law in holding that the fact a month-to-month tenancy would follow the primary fixed term negated a fixed Term. 6)The applicant had to take six steps to convert the premise to a fixed premise to minimize damage or loss."
b_2018skpc52.txt,"/n The accused was charged with violating s. 7(2)(b) of the Saskatchewan Fishery Regulations, 1995 by unlawfully fishing in an area of Canoe Lake, specifically Jans Bay, that had been closed to all fishing since 1993 because of overfishing by the local commercial fishery industry. The accused, a status Indian with Aboriginal and Treaty 10 rights, was fishing for food. He had used a net in the restricted area and had caught eight suckers, two walleye and one northern pike. The Bay was very close to the residence of the accused on the Canoe Lake First Nation and was his preferred area to fish. The remainder of Canoe Lake was subject to restrictions governing all fishing but open to unlimited Treaty sustenance fishing all year round. The accused admitted to the actus reus of the offence. Under the Constitutional Questions Act, 2012 the accused gave notice that he would argue that s. 7(2)(b) of the regulations was invalid because it restricted his Treaty and Aboriginal right to fish food in the restricted area as defined by the Regulations; infringed his Treaty and Aboriginal right to fish for food as protected by s. 35(1) of the Constitution Act, 1982; and infringed his Treaty and Aboriginal right to fish for food as protected by s. 25 of the Charter of Rights. The agreed Statement of Facts confirmed the accused’s Aboriginal Treaty status and right to sustenance fishing. The Crown’s major witness was an expert in fish biology and he testified that the restricted area had been closed to protect it for walleye spawning. He stated that the closed area could not be opened for sustenance fishing. The conservation effort had been supported by the Canoe Lake Band Council./n HELD: The accused was found guilty. The court found that the accused had failed to show a breach of his Treaty fishing right that would raise a defence or a Charter remedy to the charge against him: 1) the challenged regulations were within the implied common law limitations on Aboriginal fishing rights; 2) alternatively, the regulations fell within the provisions that permitted such regulations in Treaty 10; 3) alternatively, if they were not within the implied limitations of the right, the evidence had not established a prima facie infringement of the right; 4) alternatively, if there was a breach, it met the justification principles set out in Sparrow and Pierone.","The accused was charged with angling for or for the purpose of breaching his Treaty right to fish for sustenance. The accused argued that the wording of the two letters violated his Treaty rights. The issue was whether the accused was bound by s. 7(2)(b) of the Saskatchewan Fishery Regulations, 1995, which amended the wording to apply only to commercial fishing and not toreaty sustenance fishing rights. HELD: The accused was granted a stay of the charge. The Court found that the evidence presented was that the accused admitted to the actus reus of the substantial charge but put forth as defence his rights to fish in any water and at anytime he so chooses. The evidence showed that the restrictions on fishing in the restricted fishing areas were not used to protect Treaty status or to protect against overfishing. The only restriction that the Court could find was that commercial fishing was not being restricted in the areas designated for sust sustenance purposes."

The Court drew an adverse inference against the accused by his attempt to induce a potential witness to fabricate an alibi by. The Court was convinced beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused's purpose in writing the letter was not to insure himself against the prospect of wrongful conviction, but to induce perjured evidence for his benefit in order to discredit the identification evidence adduced at the preliminary inquiry.

It was direct evidence that he wasn't at the Club at the Time of the Robbery. 2)The accused's admission that he never saw the accused at the nightclub and that he attempted to manufacture an alibibi by inducing perjured evidence for his benefit was not sufficient to warrant an inference of guilt. 3)The allegation that the accused consented to the letter was a fabrication. The letter admitted that he did not meet the onus of proving the robbery was committed against him. 4)The admission that the victim did not remember the date of the robberies was a mere fact. 5)The evidence drawn against the accused was not a fact which was against his interest nor was it exculpatory. The admission that it was obtained by an unreasonable search or seizure and was corroborated by the identification evidence of the victim. 5]The accused did not have any friends at the party at the first time nor did he meet the accused's father. He was always in the presence of the other person throughout the evening. He did not make any changes to the description of the accused, which was not significant. 6)The admissibility of the letter could not be drawn from its contents. The admissiblilty of the allegation was not drawn from the letter itself. 7)The only conclusion drawn was that the letter admitted fact which is against the interest of the Court and was not reasonable to conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that the person who committed the robbery committed the lie and that the robbery took place at the Eureka Club. 8)The adverse inference was not based on fact but on a reasonable inference that the statement was made by the accused to be an attempt to induce a potential witness to fabricate an albibi by perjury."

The wife requested a 50% increase based on the husband's income increase of 50%. She suffered from MS and was unable to work. HELD: Spousal support was varied to $3,500 monthly. The only material change in the wife's means and needs is that fact she is residing with a new partner who resides in her home in exchange for yard work and housework. Although he worked, he made no apparent financial contribution to the household. The wife was awarded costs fixed at $1,000.","FIAT. The issue was whether there has been a material change in circumstances by virtue of a change in either the husband's or wife's employment status, or financial means or needs, warranting an increase in spousal support. The husband's position was summarized in his affidavit as follows: $3,000 per month in spouse support; $400 per month for rental income; $1,000 for travel and auto expenses. HELD: An increase was warranted but not to the extent claimed by the wife. Spousal and support were varied to $3 million per month, continuing on the first day of each month thereafter until further order; costs fixed in the amount of $1 million were ordered to the wife in the amounts of $600. The wife's request for a 50% increase was not adequately or reasonably accounted for in the wife's presentation. She requested a 50 percent increase in support because her expenses were halved due to the shared cost of living, if those shared costs were reasonably accounted after; and rental income of $400 was to be added to the table. An increase of $3.5 million was warranted, but not necessary to offer hearsay evidence such as 'our accountant calculates the company's bottom line has declined by 62%...' or bare assertion that the bank requires the bonuses to be repaid to the company. The restrictions on withdrawal must be objectively justified as legitimate, reasonable, reasonable business purpose or an unavoidable contractual requirement. The awards conferred on the wife were not discretionary and her contributions to the corporate performance were not material to the increase in her means and needs."

Two children were born of the relationship; the parties owned home as well as other assets. They separated in 1995. The appellant brought an application under s. 275 of the Matrimonial Property Act seeking an equal division of assets. She also sought a declaration that the Charter is infringed by the definition of spouse in s. 2(g) of the Act, because it does not include or recognize her common law relationship. The Chambers judge dismissed the application. He found that marital status is not an analogous ground upon which to base claim of discrimination under s. 15(1) of the Charter; or, in the alternative, that s. 2(g) does not constitute discrimination under s. 15(1) of the Charter; or, in the further alternative, that if s. 2(g) is discriminatory, it is saved by s. of the Charter. Allowing the appeal, that marital status is an analogous ground, and that s. 2(g) is discriminatory under s. 15 of the Charter because it denies a person in a common law relationship benefits which are granted to a similar person in a marriage relationship. The Crown did not discharge its onus of proving that the discrimination is demonstrably justified in a free and democratic society. The court rejected the appellant's submission that common law should be read in to the Act, and instead declared s. 2(g) to be unconstitutional and of no force and effect. This declaration was suspended for 12 months to enable the legislature to devise new criteria for eligibility under the Act that do not infringe s. 15(1) of the Charter.","The appellant and the respondent were married for 10 years and had two children. The respondent separated in 1995 and the appellant commenced an application under the Matrimonial Property Act seeking an equal division of the parties' assets. The appellant sought a declaration that the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms was infringed by the definition of spouse in s. 2(g) of the MPA. The Act did not apply to the appellant because they did not come within the definition in s2(m) of that Act. The parties moved to River Bourgeois where they took up occupancy in a residence owned by the appellant and her husband. After the separation of the spouses, the appellant continued to live in this home assuming the debts and expenses connected therewith.

Canada in that the appellant had no claim to the same rights as the respondent. The Chambers judge concluded that both parties were entitled to unequal treatment and that the infringement was not saved by s.1. 4)The appellant was awarded costs of the constitutional challenge. 5)The applicant was awarded general damages.  6)The appeal was allowed.

It is pertinent to note Art and Laura are estranged from four of their six children.  Two of Art's children claim he sexually assaulted them. When Melody testified she said her first preference was that the boys be placed with Mary Stevens, their foster parent, but did acknowledge that the boys would be in good hands with Art and Laura. 2) While the Court accepts that the Stevens home is a positive and nurturing one, there is no question it is not an ideal physical place for 9 people. With organization, routine and discipline however, it can function at a satisfactory level. Further, if an order is made under s. 37(2), the boys have the opportunity to be adopted. The Court cannot lightly preclude that possibility.","The Ministry of Social Services sought an order under s. 37(2) which is a permanent committal and is a precursor to the boys being placed for adoption. The boys were apprehended from their maternal grandparents, who were apprehended by the RCMP and placed in the custody of their maternal grandmother, L.H. and her paternal grandfather, A.H.(Art) Lavier. HELD: The Court found that the boys had a generally good relationship with their parents and that they were able to cope with the pressures of living with their new children. However, in the circumstances the Court concluded that the Stevens home did not meet the necessary standard for protection. The Court ordered the boys placed with the Minister until the age of 18. The Children and Family Services Act sets out clear objectives. If a child is found in need of protection, the Court is required to look firstly at s.37(1) which requires a determination of whether or not the children should be returned to parent, placed with a person of sufficient interest, or with the minister for a temporary period not exceeding 6 months. The court concluded that this was a somewhat unorthodox household and that the children were always in need a stable environment. All the children had special needs, even high needs. The parents were often in the house nude and masturbating. The children did not have access to their parents. The family lived in an apartment with a small kitchen and refrigerator. The son of a former partner was often in attendance. The mother of the children who resided with the father and his wife were often at the parties. The father was working and was paying support to the children. The Family Services worker who cared for the children at the home was not involved. The child and his sister were not involved in the activities. The parties' relationship was somewhat unorthodox. The fact that the parties' children were often exposed to each other and sometimes touched inappropriately is a factor that warrants an order of protection."
c_2011skqb478.txt,"The accused was found guilty of possession of cocaine for the purpose of trafficking and possession of marijuana for the purpose of trafficking contrary to s. 5(3)(a) the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act, and having in his possession cash (almost $30,000) knowing it was obtained through the commission of an offence contrary to s. 354 and 355(a) of the Criminal Code. At issue was the accused's sentence. The Crown sought a global sentence of 5 years plus a forfeiture order of items seized, a fine in lieu of forfeiture for all cash used for legal fees, a mandatory weapons prohibition and sought bodily substances for DNA analysis. As the accused had been denied bail and had pre- trial detention of 15 months and 24 days, the defence sought one and one-half times credit for time served on remand.HELD: The accused had 9 prior drug convictions since 1999, two for trafficking in 2000 for which he received a 12 month sentence of incarceration and, in 2007, one trafficking and conspiracy to traffic which resulted in his receiving a 5 year penitentiary sentence. As the accused had been a compliant prisoner on remand, the Court granted him credit for 1.5 days for each day spent on remand for a total of 23 months and 21 days credit. The Court imposed a sentence of 30 months imprisonment, and ordered a DNA sample as well as a fine in lieu of forfeiture in the sum of $16,326 (being the sum transferred to the accused's legal counsel to pay his legal fees) to be paid within 60 days and, in default of payment, a term of imprisonment of 6 months consecutive to the term of imprisonment otherwise imposed.","The accused was found guilty of three counts contained in an amended Indictment dated December 12, 2011, charging him with the following offences: 1) he was a 34 year old male with a serious prior conviction for trafficking in cocaine and cocaine; 2) he had nine prior drug convictions since being arrested; and 3) he would have qualified, had he been in the regular prison population, for a one-third reduction in his sentence for the current offences. HELD: 1). The Court gave the accused credit of 1.1 days for each day he spent on remand and 23 months 21 days credit for the time he had spent on the return to provincial custody. The amount of cocaine found in the accused's possession was admittedly for the purpose of trafficking. The Court found that the amount of marijuana found in this accused's hand was not comparable to those found in cases involving sophisticated drug distribution and trafficking organizations dealing with huge quantities of cocaine. The accused had nine previous drug convictions; nine for trafficking; and one conspiracy to traffic resulted him receiving a sentence of 5 years in the penitentiary. The court found that it would not be appropriate to impose an overall sentence less than 2 years in this case or this offender. 2) The Court accepted the accused’s deposition that he was not a street level drug possessor or trafficker but rather a participant in a drug trafficking organization. He qualified, having been in his possession for the purposes of trafficking, for 1-third a reduction in sentence for good behaviour. The evidence showed he had a serious addiction to drugs and cocaine. His pre-trial detention was in part the result of a failed preliminary hearing date which saw the prosecutor unable to reach Estevan. The pre- trial was re-scheduled with the resulting delays. The Crown had to provide a number of sample samples to the defence. 3) The accused was ordered to pay a fine in lieu of forfeiture in the sum of $16,325.98 to be paid within 60 days and, in default of payment, a term of imprisonment of 6 months consecutive to the term of the imprisonment imposed by this judgment is ordered. 4) The amount involved was $16k325.99 which was transferred to the accused at his request to pay his legal fees. The sentencing judge considered this to have a significant impact upon the appropriate sentence to be imposed for the offences for the new offences."
3_2004skqb379.txt,"FIAT: The issues to be determined on this application are custody, child support and cancellation of the arrears of child support. HELD: 1) On the issue of custody, the mere passage of time, in this instance 9 years, would constitute a material change in circumstances relevant to custody. The child is now 15 years old. The parties are not candidates for joint custody and shared parenting. The child's view of the dysfunctional relationship between her parents compels this Court to preserve the status quo as being in the child's best interests. The petitioner will continue as the sole custodian.  2) The access was varied in January 2004. Nothing has changed to warrant a variation. 3) There was no evidence to support the respondent's statement that the child is living with him half the time. There was no evidence or explanation as to why he has failed to pay child support, which creates the present arrears. The evidence with respect to the respondent's finances was unsworn and out of date. In oral argument, the respondent asserted that he contributed to his daughter's care and that he is contributing to her education trust fund. If these expenditures were in fact made over and above his own cost of living, the Court would be compelled to accept the fact that he has financial resources available to him other that the $9,940 of social assistance which is disclosed in his tax return and financial statement. 4) The essence of the respondent's application for variation of the child support is based on his claim that his health has precluded him from working. The respondent's doctor was examined and, based on that medical evidence, the Court could not conclude that the respondent's generalized anxiety and depression disorder is beyond his control. The evidence was that the respondent could choose to help himself by eliminating alcohol and marijuana use. The respondent failed to meet the burden of proof by demonstrating that his depression and anxiety disorder was the consequence of factors beyond his control and thus preventing him from working and having an income with which to pay his child support obligations during the period under review. The application for variation of child support and cancellation of child support arrears is dismissed with costs.","FIAT. The respondent applied to vary the support and access provisions of the May 2, 1995 judgment. The 1995 judgment provided for the divorce of the petitioner and distribution of matrimonial property estate to the couple, and custody, access and support for the child of the marriage. The petitioner was then 13 years old and had been off work since 2000. HELD: The application was dismissed. The court found that the respondent had not shown a material change in circumstances relevant to custody and that it was therefore appropriate to vary custody when the respondent was 15. The matter was then proceeded to trial on the issue of variation of the 1995 judgment and whether it should be varied at this time. 1) The respondent was found to be in the joint custody of the 15-year-old and the 15 year-old with whom the petitioner had been living together for the past four years. 2) The mere passage of time in this instance would constitute a material Change of circumstance relevant to the custody application. The mere mention of the respondent's disability in the 1995 judgement did not disqualify him from continuing to pay child support. 3) The petitioner had not demonstrated a material difference in circumstances necessary to support a variation of custody ordered when she was 15 years old."
c_2003skqb197.txt,"The plaintiff brought a professional negligence claim against her former solicitors with respect to their handling of three charges against her for practising medicine without a licence and one charge for providing medical treatment, while not registered under the Medical Professions Act. The solicitors brought a motion for non-suit pursuant to Queen's Bench Rule 278A. HELD: The motion for a non-suit was granted. The claim was dismissed. Although given an opportunity, the plaintiff failed to call expert evidence respecting the elements of negligence including the duty of care, standard of care, breach of the duty of care or causation. The solicitors were awarded one set of costs taxed on column 4.","HELD: The application was dismissed. The court found that the plaintiff had presented no evidence that the trial judge, in his charge of the negligence claims, had erred in finding that the medical profession was not properly registered under the Act. The plaintiff was entitled to rely upon the evidence of her former solicitors, who had primarily and indirectly represented her. The Court also found that there was no expert evidence presented by the plaintiff to the jury to provide the jury with the competence to reach a verdict on the second most fundamental issue of the case, the negligence claim. The defendant lawyers were found to have breached their duty of care by failing to call an available expert witness to testify at the original trial. The trial judge found that if the plaintiff raised the issue of whether the evidence fell short of establishing the existence of standard practice, the question arose as to whether the jury could determine the applicable standard without the aid of expert evidence."
d_2007skpc27.txt,"The accused is charged with assault contrary to s. 266 of the Criminal Code. The Crown applies to admit into evidence oral statements made by the complainant to her neighbor and to the police for consideration of the truth of their contents. HELD: The statements made by the complainant are found to be reliable and are therefore admissible.  1) Hearsay statement may be admitted on a principled basis, the governing principles are reliability and necessity. A number of cases have held that necessity is met when a witness recants or in some other fashion effectively holds hostage evidence that cannot be obtained from another source. 2) There is no other way to obtain the complainant's evidence. Whether her alcohol consumption that night erased her recollection of events or whether she is a hostile witness is immaterial at this stage. Either way she effectively holds hostage that evidence and the court need not determine the reason for the purpose of this application. The test of necessity has been met.  3) With regard to reliability, the question becomes whether there are sufficient indicia of reliability in a particular case to substitute the lack of oath, lack of cross-examination and absence of video taping. Where the hearsay statement was made in circumstances which provide some guarantees of trustworthiness, the test for reliability will be met. The following circumstances are evidence of trustworthiness: the complainant arrived unexpectedly at her neighbor's apartment, she was upset and crying, she asked that police be called, she spontaneously described the assault, she repeated a consistent version to the police, she had fresh red marks which corresponded with her description of the assault and the accused verified aspects of her complaint with comments he made.","The accused was charged with assault contrary to s. 266. The Crown applied to have the initial statements made by the complainant admitted into evidence as truth of their contents for the purpose of the trial. Evidence was then called on voir dire. HELD: The Crown has made an application to have hearsay statements admitted into support for the truth of its contents as an exception to the rule which presumptively excludes hearsay evidence. The facts are straightforward. The complainant is the common- law spouse of the accused and had been for seven years. She is the spouse of a friend and had for seven. The parties living in an apartment building next door to the friend's daughter had an argument over a bank card. During this dispute, the accused grabbed the complainant by the neck and threw her on the floor. The evidence supports the inference that the complainant and the accused were alone in their apartment from the time Ms. [D.P.] arrived home to the time the accused (E.C.] arrived. The Court found that the first statements made to her neighbour and to the police were consistent. The accused's subsequent jealous and possessive behaviour was also found to be supportive of reliability. The following circumstances were evidence supportive of the trustworthiness of the statements made: the complainant's evidence is important to the Crown's case and there is no other means of obtaining that evidence. Whether her alcohol consumption that night erased her recollection of events or whether she is a hostile witness is immaterial at this stage. The statements were made contemporaneously and spontaneously to a friend without any apparent guile. The court also pointed to the accused's first jealous and possessedive behaviour as evidence of reliability which was not considered by the court for the application."

The journalists had no prior opportunity to hear its contents because Jones entered a guilty plea. The application was not opposed. The applicant sought an order for mandamus or a declaration. HELD: The presumption is in favour of public access to court records and the burden to contrary proof lies with the person who would deny access. This right is tempered by other factors (see R. v. SJS). Requiring the journalists to attend at the offices of the Attorney General and playing the CD ROM and making their own notes balances the interests of innocent parties whose conversations were recorded.",FIAT. The Saskatoon Star-Post applied for access to a CD-ROM entered in evidence at a sentencing hearing. The Crown had played the CD-Rambler to the defence but the Crown had not provided an order for mandamus or a declaration. The applicant applied for an order to release the CDROM to the respondent. HELD: The Court of Queen's Bench is the appropriate court to obtain such relief. The appropriate court is the Court ofQueen's Bench as it was the respondent in this proceeding. The Court ordered that the CDs be made to its expense and that it be entitled to make a copy to the applicant for its own possession and own leisure. The CD-RW was to be played for the sentencing judge. The Applicant was to contact the Attorney General for an appointment to return the CD to its possession.  1) The applicant was to make its own copies and request a declaration by Queen's Park.  2) The Attorney General did not oppose the application.

b_2017skqb308.txt,"The Minister of Social Services applied for an order committing a two-year-old child to the care of his maternal grandparents for an indefinite period of time. The grandparents were previously designated as persons of sufficient interest. The child had lived with them since birth. The mother and father both suffered from addictions and had stopped living together by the time the child was born. The father had multiple criminal convictions, including drinking and driving offences and weapons offences. The mother’s relationship with her parents, family support worker and child protection worker during the course of the child’s life had been marked by volatility, argumentative behaviour and threats, one of which resulted in criminal harassment charges. The child was the subject of a protection order, which imposed conditions upon his parents. Neither meaningfully complied with the conditions set out in the protection order. Both parents testified at trial that their present circumstances were not suitable to raise a child. Each expressed intention to take steps necessary to provide a home for the child. Each parent asserted that a temporary order was appropriate. | HELD: The child was placed in the custody of his grandparents on an indefinite basis, which, while not temporary, was not as potentially immutable as a permanent order. That the child was in need of protection was not seriously challenged by either his mother or father. The prospect for change at the time of trial was limited to statements of good intentions. On their own, such statements were insufficient. There were opportunities for the parents to demonstrate a reasonable prospect for change. These opportunities were squandered and, in some cases abusively rejected by the mother.","HELD: The Court found that the parties were in need of protection under s. 11 of The Child and Family Services Act (CFSA). The Ministry’s position that the respondent remained a child in needof protection was not seriously challenged by either of the parties. The Court noted that the evidence showed that neither of the parents was able and willing to provide the minimum level of parenting required for the child’ s needs. The Ministry also suggested that a temporary order be appropriate. The issue was whether the children were receiving the level of parental care that was below the minimal standard that will be tolerated in our society. The respondent’d parents were in poor health and there was concern that their child would suffer physical and emotional harm if removed from their care. The evidence showed the respondent”s parents were unable and unwilling to provide adequate support for the youngest child, who was now 12 years of age."

The plaintiffs terminated the contract believing the defendant's workmanship was poor and that he caused some damage to their home and created a mess. The plaintiffs sued the defendant alleging damages. The defendant counterclaimed the cost of the work completed but for which he was not paid and compensation for the lost use of his tools. HELD: The Court granted judgment for damages in the amount of $3,822 for necessary repairs and $100 for cleaning expenses and granted the counter-claim in the amount of $580 for unpaid work performed by the defendant and then applied setoff. The Court allowed the cost of issuing the claim and for reasonable cost of service.","HELD: The plaintiffs claim damages in the amount of $5,975.95 for the removal of a bedroom wall. The counterclaim is set off against the claim of the plaintiffs. The general contractor denies his workmanship was poor, that he was not allowed to finish the job or clean up the mess. The plaintiffs counterclaim for lost use of tools in the amounts of $3,822.00 and $100 for the countertop. The court accepts the plaintiff's assertion that he would have cleaned the mess if he had been allowed to. The plaintiff's claim for lost wages is reduced by 10% as the plaintiff is not entitled to recover those costs. The defendant is entitled to judgment against the plaintiffs in the sum of $6,292.54 for the damage to the plaintiffs' property and $580.00 for the plaintiff to recover his counterclaim. 1) The plaintiffs were substantially successful in their claim. The Court is satisfied the plaintiffs owed a duty of care to the plaintiff in that there was sufficient relationship between them and the defendant to expect that the plaintiff would have done the same job. 2) The defendant's conduct constituted a breach of the contract and negligence, which precludes the plaintiffs from being fully compensated for new countertops of greater value than the one which would have depreciated over time as the result of wear and tear. The doctrine of betterment precludes plaintiffs from getting fully compensated, by using the same countertop, in addition to the same amount of money. 3) The plaintiff is entitled in the matter of $2,874.54 to recover the cost of the repair, service, postage, photographs, witness fees, mileage and parking to attend Court. Many of these costs are not typically awarded in Small Claims Court. Because the plaintiffs were successful in this claim, the plaintiffs are entitled to judgments against the defendant in the figure of $4,278.54."
5_2000skqb565.txt,"FIAT. The accused applied for an order pursuant to s.581(1) of the Criminal Code quashing count 1 on the grounds it offended the 'single transaction rule'; an order pursuant to ss.7 and 24(1) of the Charter and the common law doctrine of abuse of process that portions of the indictment as amended be quashed or stayed on the basis of the judgment in the trial of the former co-accused, Reginald Schafer; alternatively, an order staying the proceedings on the grounds of unreasonable delay in bringing the accused to trial. He argued the Crown would be in breach of an agreement in which he waived delay to proceed on the charges on which inconsistent findings could be made and would constitute bad faith. HELD: 1)The application to quash count 1 on the basis it charges more than one transaction was dismissed. The count particularizes in the alternative various ways in which the accused is alleged to have defrauded the investors of ICC by using funds of ICC to advance his or Schafer's interests. The case law cited by both parties clearly establishes that the word 'transaction' as used in s.581(1) is to be interpreted broadly and flexibly, and that a single transaction may, in this sense, include a number of acts or incidents occurring over a period of time. 2)Count 1 of the indictment was to be amended. The application to stay proceedings on the basis of findings made in the Schafer trial was allowed in relation to the particular charge in subpara.(b) of count 1 regarding use of ICC funds in the amount of $513,000 for Trirak along with subpara.(j) regarding alleged representations to ICC's investors that 30% of their investment would be invested in GICs. To allow the Crown to pursue these allegations would be an abuse of process. The Crown had indicated it would not proceed with subparagraphs (c) or (d). 2)There had not been unreasonable delay in light of the complexity of the charges, reasons for the delay, and the agreement by the applicant not to object to certain portions of delay. There was ongoing disclosure and there were various court appearances following the laying of charges.","FIAT: The accused applied for an order pursuant to s. 581(1) of the Criminal Code quashing a count of the indictment as amended on the ground that it applies to more than one single transaction; an order under ss. 7 and 24(1), the common law doctrine of abuse of process that portions of the indictments as amended be quashed or stayed on the basis of the judgment of Klebuc J. in the trial of the former co-accused, Reginald Schafer, and an order staying the proceedings on the grounds of unreasonable delay. The Crown argued that the application to quash was substantively different from that determined by Matheson J. who had earlier in the year requested that the Crown provide particulars. HELD: The application to dismiss the count was dismissed. 1) The Crown was not bound by the findings of the trial judge in Schafer. The Court was not in any way bound by any of the findings in the original indictment. 2) In some cases the Crown conceded that it would be beneficial to both the accused and the Crown to have the benefit of the benefit in the light of the new indictment. 3) The Court dismissed the application by the accused that it was not interested in proceeding with the trial which would result in a reduction in the indictment from the number of counts it already faced. The applicant's argument that the conclusions of the judge in the Schafer case were not substantively similar to that determined in the earlier indictment was not supported by the Crown's argument. 4) The applicant was granted an order to remain in the province until the outcome of the Schaper trial was known."

The court believed the evidence provided by the two accused and found that it was possible that the lease represented the actual arrangement between them and O.G. and that they believed that there only 400 plants in the greenhouses and they were part of a legal grow operation. The letter provided by O.G. purporting to change the address of his licences was found to have been forged by him. Regarding the possession for the purpose of trafficking, the court found that it was not satisfied on the evidence that either of the accused ever had personal possession or control of the marijuana plants nor that they had joint or constructive possession by virtue of some arrangement with O.G. The accused had explained that the cash seized by the police from their house had been received by them after they sold a trailer.","Criminal Law – Cannabis Business – Economic CrimeHELD: The Court of Appeal held that an amendment to an information expanding the time particulars of the offence can be made at trial based upon evidence that indicates the offence may have been committed within the amended timeframe. The Court held that the evidence pointing to the possibility that the Crown has proven beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused were unlawfully producing cannabis, that the marijuana was being grown for the purposes of trafficking, and that the currency in question was not obtained by the commission in Canada of an offence punishable by indictment. The evidence did not provide precise information as to when construction of the greenhouses started, although common sense would suggest it would have started within the first week of June, but the evidence indicated that the first few months of 2016 were the start of the marijuana crop crop season. The accused's residence was located to the east of the greenhouse site and was clearly a marijuana grow operation. The court found that the cannabis crop was healthy and some 449 plants were being grown at the site. The Crown challenged the veracity of the accused's evidence. The defence argued that the three individuals were active participants in the marijuana grow operations and were in the possession for the purpose of trafficking. The offence was committed against the accused, and the evidence did show that the Court had not established that the alleged offences were committed against them. The defendant's residence had been extensively searched and the court found evidence that the four individuals were involved in the cultivation of marijuana plants. The alleged cultivation of cannabis by the accused was a relatively sophisticated marihuana grow operation, with the plants being grown under valid licences, being grown in the presence of other individuals, and being in the possiblilty of trafficking in marijuana. The marijuana crop was legal tender for production on the accused’s property and the licence to grow marijuana was valid. The applicant’ s residence was found to be in the area of the alleged marijuana crop cultivation and was in good condition. The RCMP found electronic devices and documents related to their previous work in the oilfield. The property was also found to have a computer lab and a computer system for monitoring the environment. The affidavit also showed that the affidavit material contained information that indicated the marijuana plants were not being grown by the applicant for the offence of trafficking and that they were not producing marijuana for the production of marijuana.

HELD: 1)Generally under s. 59(2), the court before it can approve proposal must be satisfied; the terms are reasonable; the price of the transfer prices are reasonable and the terms calculated to benefit the general body of creditors; the proposal is not properly approved by the creditors in accordance with s. 60(2)(d) of the Insolvent and Bankrupty Act or alternatively, that the proposal fails to treat all of the creditor classes equally. 2)The proposal is primarily calculated tobenefit Prairie Security Fund and the guarantors of the secured creditors and not the general community of creditors. 3)The proposed is not a 'holding proposal'. 4)The applicant is likely to terminate its relationship with Gustafs at any time which would effectively put an end to Gustafsen's ability to sell or lease products or lease the products or furniture of the company to its unsecred creditors. 5)The application is likely not to be successful in court. 6)The criteria to be followed by the Court on an application of this nature is set out in ss. 59 and 59(1) ofthe Act. The criteria to follow by the court on an Application of this Nature is set as follows: 1).Under s.59(2) the court must consider not only the wishes and interests of creditors, but also the conduct and interestsof the debtor, the interests of the public and future creditors and the requirements of commercial morality. The proposal is meant to benefit Prairie Security fund and the Guaranty Bank Trust Company and the secured and unsec secured creditors of the Corporation and not general body creditors. 7)The applicants are likely to be in position to terminate their relationship with the corporation at any moment which would essentially put an END to Gust's ability To bid or lease a vehicle or furniture manufactured by the applicant would be sufficient to withhold approval"
3_2002skqb54.txt,"The wife sought an order for equal distribution of matrimonial property. They married in 1988, each for a second time, and separated in 1997. Each had significant assets at the time of the marriage, which had increased in value. They agreed at the time of the marriage to keep their assets separate and to not make a claim on the assets of the other and that their entire estates would be left to their respective children.  The wife argued the agreement was not applicable to the present situation where they have separated and was only in effect during the time of the marriage or upon their deaths. HELD: The wife was entitled to judgment for $54,000. 1)There was no conflict in the evidence as to the verbal agreement made at the time of the marriage nor as to their intention. This is an appropriate situation to apply s.40 of the Family Property Act. The fact they each executed a will to give effect to that intention and the husband paid practically all of the day-to-day expenses led to the conclusion their verbal agreement should be considered binding, notwithstanding their marriage ended by separation rather than death. 2)The condominium purchased by the husband was the 'family home' as provided for in s.2(1)(a). There was no extraordinary circumstance as provided in s.22(1), which would prevent equal division of the value of the family home. The Melville residence owned by the wife at the time of the marriage was exempt in accordance with their agreement. It had not increased in value and the wife solely paid its maintenance. 3)No costs.","The petitioner sought an order for equal distribution of matrimonial property. The parties married in 1988, each for a second time, and separated in December 26, 1997. Each had significant assets at the time of the marriage which had increased since that date. The respondent's assets then and at the relevant time were greater in value than those of the petitioner. They each completed new wills shortly after the marriage to this effect. HELD: 1)The petitioner was entitled to judgment for half of the value of the assets acquired after marriage being: 1-half of the values of the condominium, one-half the value furniture, vehicle and camper; $54,000.00.  2)The court was not satisfied there was any 'extraordinary circumstance' as provided in s. 22(1) of the Act which would prevent the valueof the family home from being divided equally between the parties. The petitioner was awarded half of her assets acquired post marriage being divided.  3)The parties agreed their entire assets would be left to their respective children after their deaths. They completed new will shortly after their marriage leaving all of their assets to their successors. 4)The respondent was entitled half of his assets acquired by the petitioner after marriage to be divided equally. 5)The Court was not convinced there was an 'extraordinarily' condition' as per s. 23(1)(a) of The Family Property Act which prevented the value from being split equally between them."

The police did not see the appellant driving; they came across his minivan immersed in a slough in excess of 35 feet off the highway. Based on the tire tracks, the appellant was charged with dangerous driving. The trial judge concluded that the circumstantial evidence presented by the Crown was consistent with the appellant's guilt and the circumstantial evidence was inconsistent with any other rational conclusion. The appellant argues that without expert evidence called by the Crown to prove it was not possible for the appellant to have swerved in the manner he testified to create the same physical evidence shown in the photographs, the Crown has failed to prove that the appellant drove through the stop sign. In other words, the trial judge could not simply rely on his own experience to find that the appellant could not have been able to manoeuvre the minivan in the way he described. HELD: Because the Crown's evidence was not the only rational conclusion to be drawn by the trier of fact, the Crown has failed to prove the case beyond a reasonable doubt. While no accident reconstructionist was available to check the accident scene after the incident, the Crown could have called an expert to testify whether the defence's theory could hypothetically be rational. However, no expert was called. The appeal is allowed and the conviction set aside.","The appeal court concluded that the circumstantial evidence presented by the Crown was consistent with Fleury's guilt and the circumstANTial evidence was inconsistent with any other rational conclusion. Fleury appealed his conviction of dangerous driving, which was upheld on appeal. The issue on appeal is whether the circumstanting evidence presented was consistent and consistent with the appellant's guilt. The circumstantials evidence presented at trial was inconsistent inconsistent with an other rational decision. It was the defence's theory at trial, the accused's unwavering statement at the scene that he was travelling south on Highway 2 at the point of the 'T' intersection and had not stopped at the stop sign. Fleur was travelling at a high speed across the four lanes of traffic when the accident occurred. The defence argued that, without expert evidence called by the police to prove that it was not possible for Fleury to have swerved in such a manner to create the same physical evidence, the Crown failed to prove Fleury drove through the stop stop sign on Highway 11. The appeal court agreed with the defence that it seems unlikely that a minivan could make a 90° left turn at substantial speed without leaving any tire tracks across the two or three lanes it had to travel before leaving the pavement. The trial judge erred in concluding the trial judge could not prove that Fleury was making a left turn in such high speed without the assistance of an expert."

Three crown witnesses and five defence witnesses testified as to the altercation in the bar. HELD: The accused was found guilty. 1)The self-defence argument was not accepted. Neither s.34 or s.37 of the Criminal Code justified the assault. 2)The testimony of the Crown witnesses was accepted. The complainant was no threat to the accused in his inebriated state and the accused took advantage of the situation to administer a beating to him. The injuries were not consistent with the scenario described by the accused and the witnesses.","The accused was charged with anassault causing bodily harm. The incident occurred when the accused subdued a patron with a headlock and removed him from the bar. The events surrounding the altercation were described by three Crown witnesses and by five defence witnesses including the accused. The accused admits that he threw punch but says that he struck him first. He also says that the punch was not that hard. He does not know how he sustained the injuries. HELD: The accused was found not guilty of the charge. 1)The evidence was consistent. The Crown witnesses' descriptions of events were consistent. 2)The accused did not attempt to 'get at' the accused whilst being restrained by Layman. He was no threat to the accused and that the accused took advantage of the situation to administer abeating to him. 3)The Court found that the two Crown witnesses who had been in the bar prior to the incident were no threat and that both the accused's co-workers and the accused in fact took advantage in the situation of administering abeating (to him) to him as a result of the commotion.  4)The court accepted the accused was not favourably disposed toward the accused, and that he was indeed instrumental in bringing about the events which resulted in his injuries. The facts were found to be consistent with the accused being found guilty of assault and that his co-worker was trying to 'fix' him. 5)The Crown offered evidence that the co- workers were trying to get rid of the accused or to exact some manner of revenge. The Court rejected the accused 'fixing' him by allowing them to do so. 6)The only thing that was necessary was the consistent assault and self-assurance that he did not cause harm was not used."

The defendant brought these motions seeking an order compelling the Superintendent of Bankruptcy to testify at the Charter MotIONS. The plaintiff brought several motions seeking a stays of those charges on on the grounds his rights were violated. The Crown argued that the RCMP had not pursued investigations into other parties with sufficient vigor and that the Superintendent had somehow dissuaded the RCMP from investigating other parties' conduct and deflected suspicion of wrongdoing to him. HELD: The application was dismissed. The accused had not met the onus which rests upon him to satisfy the Court on the balance of probabilities that the Redling has relevant or material evidence to give concerning the issues raised by the Charter motions. The testimony and documentation presented since the Subpoena was quashed raise issues which warrant compelling the accused's attendance.

The hearing officer directed that the order of possession would be deferred if the tenant paid the rent that was owing and future rent. The tenants argued that the hearing officer erred in not considering that the premises were infested with bed bugs and the tenants had been forced to incur personal expense to remedy the problem. They sought to adduce new evidence by affidavit on this point at the appeal. HELD: The Court declined to admit the affidavit evidence about bed bugs. However, the matter was remitted to the hearing officer for rehearing because the reasons provided by the hearing officer were deficient.

1991canlii4370.txt,"The defendant lawyer was retained for the purpose of obtaining and disbursing mortgage funds. The plaintiffs, creditors of the defendant's client, sued the defendant for negligent misrepresentation, breach of trust and breach of undertaking. The defendant initially received three irrevocable letters of direction for payment of amounts owing on a construction project. When the project got into financial difficulty the defendant advised his client to seek separate counsel to deal with the creditors - suppliers. At a creditors meeting the defendant advised the creditors' counsel of the initial three letters of direction. The project was considered viable by the creditors and continued, with the defendant obtaining postponements of the three letters of direction. Further creditors' meetings were held, a Creditors' Committee struck, and subsequent letters of direction sent to the defendant by the client and certain creditors. The defendant, in acknowledging a subsequent letter of direction, made no mention of the earlier three letters, nor any explanation of 'all of the proceeds'. One member of the Committee was aware of the initial irrevocable letters of direction. On what was to be the final mortgage draw, the defendant requested and was refused a postponement of the initial three letters. With his client's consent, the defendant disbursed the funds, to pay off the initial three creditors, a mechanics' lien referred in one of the subsequent letters of direction, his legal fees and the balance as per a letter of direction received from two of three members of the Creditors' Committee. Dismissing the action, that (1) there was no negligent misrepresentation as the creditors had continued to advance supplies, not on the basis of the defendant's letter of acknowledgement, but because they considered the project viable. Further, certain other plaintiffs were not aware of the letter, and could not have relied on it. Other plaintiffs did not supply after the letter and therefore did not rely on it. The Court noted that on a balance of probabilities, the defendant's disbursement did not cause the demise of the project. At the time of the disbursement the project was still viable and the plaintiffs made their own decision to cease supplying and to lien the project;  (2) there was no breach of trust as the defendant had no fiduciary duty and had at no time acted for the plaintiffs;  and  (3) there was no breach of undertaking as the undertaking must be considered in all the circumstances, including knowledge of the plaintiffs, the other letters and meetings. The Court concluded that the member of the Creditors' Committee who was aware of the initial irrevocable letters had a duty to advise the other members. The documentation was clear that legal fees would be deducted and the Committee was also aware of the direction to pay the mechanics' lien.","The defendants had received three irrevocable letters of direction from the plaintiff requiring them to pay the mortgage payments from the two mortgage brokers. The plaintiff had also received representations from the defendants indicating that they intended to disburse the mortgage advances but that they had not been paid.

The first mortgagee to the project had become dissatisfied with the handling of the project funds by one of the principals of and was withdrawing its support. The second mortgagee, who had been retained by the plaintiff, had also become dissatisfied and was terminating his support of the construction project. The third mortgagee was also disbursed by the defendants. The project continued to operate relatively uninterrupted until early March when the first mortgageee, who was the second mortgageee to theproject, became dissatisfied with his treatment of the first mortgages and was suspending his support. Three months later, the first second mortgagees filed mortgage draws which were not paid in any manner that could be interpreted as a breach of trust. The drawings were still outstanding and a settlement was reached for the mortgage advance of $78,400.

b_2018skqb197.txt,"HELD: The court sentenced the accused to a global sentence of 10 years for the manslaughter conviction. A one-year concurrent sentence was imposed for the conviction of prohibited possession of a firearm. The court gave him credit at the rate of 1:1.5 for his time on remand, resulting in a net global sentence of six years, five months to be served in a federal penitentiary. The Gladue report was considered and the background of the accused was assessed as an enormous mitigating factor. The court found that this was not an appropriate case to make an order pursuant to s. 743.6 of the Code both because of the multiple Gladue factors and because it had addressed the principles of denunciation and deterrence in the global sentence.","HELD: The Court sentenced the accused pursuant to s. 236(a) of the Criminal Code, RSC 1985, C-46 and his guilty plea to possession of a firearm while prohibited from doing so.  1) The evidence was conclusive that the accused had a long record of criminal offences, including 57 previous convictions, 17 of which were for violent offences. The evidence showed that the most aggravating factors were the accused's use of a weapon in the death of his cousin, that his behaviour was inconsistent with his usual behaviour, and that his inability to get away from his situation caused him to commit the fatal shooting. The accused had been convicted of manslaughter, but the sentence was reduced to a concurrent one year sentence for manslaughter.  2) The accused pled guilty to manslaughter. He had a lengthy record including 57 prior convictions, 15 of which are for violent offenses. His conduct in the offence of killing his cousin was described as extreme and violent, and his use of the firearm in the killing of his own cousin, who was of aboriginal heritage, was aggravating. The Crown requested a 15 year global sentence with no parole eligibility until Gordon had served half of his sentence pursuant to ss. 743.6(1) of The Criminal Code. The Court reviewed the cases provided to it by counsel. The most significant of these was the accused’s use of his firearm in killing his own uncle, who had allowed him to live with him and allow him to move with him to new community. The defence argued that a concurrent sentence of 1 year concurrent to the 8 year sentence imposed for manslaughter was appropriate primarily as a result of the Court having to recognize the multiple Gladue factors in the case. The court concluded that a global sentence of 10 years was appropriate, primarily as result of that Court havingto recognize the multiplicity of Gladue factor that had to be addressed. The administration of justice was also requested to assist in the handling of the case law. The sentencing judge reviewed the various victim impact statements filed by the siblings of the victim, and the accused was sentenced to 11 years less credit for remand time than was imposed for the manslaughter conviction. The principles of sentencing were summarized in s. 718.2 of the Code."

Twenty-two months passed between the laying of the charge and the trial date. Cote was not responsible for the delay and actively pursued a speedy trial. The delay was caused by the Crown's failure to provide timely disclosure. HELD: The charge was stayed. In applying the decision of the SCC in R. v. Morin, the court found that 22 months is an unreasonable and exceptional period of delay and is of sufficient length to warrant an inquiry. This case had no particular complexity above the norm for cases of this kind and did not require this delay.

He suffered damage to his political career, embarrassment from media reports, unemployment, and economic hardship. The court balanced the individual's right to be tried within a reasonable time with society's interest in having the matter proceed to trial despite delay.

Romania sought extradition of the applicant so that he might serve a 3 year prison sentence imposed as a result of a conviction in Romania for criminally negligent homicide with respect to a motor vehicle collision where the accused, while impaired, hit a pedestrian and killed him. The applicant offered surety from the Romania community in Saskatchewan who did not appear to have known the accused for long and offered to put up his car as bond. The applicant had common law spouse in Saskatchewan but owned no real property. HELD: Although the Crown conceded that the applicant had met the relatively low threshold of showing that his application for leave to appeal his extradition order was not frivolous, the Court of Appeal declined to release the applicant. The Court of Appeal held that there is an elevated risk of flight in light of the fact that the applicant has exhausted all appeals in Romania and is facing a 3 year prison sentence. Canada's international obligations in extradition proceedings require the Court to look more severely at the risk of non-appearance than it would if the application was made solely under s. 679 in respect of criminal proceeding in Canada. The sureties offered by the applicant were not sufficient to ensure his attendance at Court.

Romania opposes the application. The accused states that he is a Convention refugee and that he has family and long-term employment in the province. He contends that his conviction in Romania is a factor in his application for release. The Court of Appeal in Regina quashed the committal order and the trial judge ordered him remain in custody pending his trial. The application for judicial inter-registration is dismissed. The court found that the accused has not met the low threshold required under s. 679(3)(b) as it would be impossible for him to surrender himself into custody and his detention is not in the public interest. The onus on the accused to surrender is not on him. The appellant has proven that his application to be released from custody is not frivolous and there is nothing in the accused's proposed surety package which would give him an incentive to surrender. The risk of non-appearance is further heightened by the accused’s failure to abide by his community-based sentence and his failure to meet the terms of his release imposed. The issue of the accused not being returned to Romania is also raised."

It will not inordinately delay. It is obvious from the material that the parties were not ready for trial. They had not exchanged documents, and the plaintiff gave notice of his intention to amend his statement of claim after the consent order was granted. They were not exchanging documents. They did not exchange documents. 3)Pre trial proceedings are not inordinately long. Pre-trial decision-making is not necessary. schedule for the completion of the steps necessary to bring this matter to trial can be worked out with his assistance or an application can be made to court in the absence of agreement on time limits."
d_1999skqb276.txt,"FIAT. The plaintiff applied for summary judgment in his claim for dismissal without just cause. The plaintiff was initially hired as body shop foreman but additionally acquired the title of assistant manager. When the body shop manager became ill that work load also fell to the plaintiff. It was during this period that the performance of the plaintiff, described by the defendant as serious misconduct, resulted in his termination. There was no issue of a lack of mitigation as the plaintiff accepted a job with another autobody shop but at a much lower rate of pay. The action was brought pursuant to the simplified procedure outlined in Part 40 of the Rules of Court. HELD: Damages were to be calculated by the parties for the 7 month notice period based on his income and value of benefits over the previous year, less the 6 weeks pay received, and less wages and benefits received from his new employment. Jurisdiction was reserved to hear further evidence should the parties not reach agreement. 1)By using the words 'shall grant judgment unless', Rule 488 requires the presiding judge to grant judgment except in the circumstances outlined in s.488(a)and(b). The test is not whether there is contradictory evidence in the affidavits but whether despite the contradictory evidence the issue(s) can be decided in the absence of cross-examination and it would be otherwise unjust to do so. If the court can assume the defendant's evidence is true and still grant summary judgment there is no genuine need for a trial. 2)As noted in numerous decisions, whether an employer is justified in summarily dismissing an employee is ultimately a question of fact. The plaintiff was not terminated because of poor job performance in performing his contractual duties as foreman and manager but because of his alleged poor performance in doing the job normally assigned to two persons. The employer has the right to expect that employees will not disparage their immediate supervisors or other employees in the course of their employment and certainly not to clients or customers of the employer. The type of conduct here would not justify dismissal the first time it came to the employer's attention if the employee had been guilty of such conduct while performing only his own job function. 'Griping' is not uncommon in the workplace. The case law seems uniform that one or more warnings to an employee must be given before it can be said such activity 'fractures the employment relationship'. The category of misconduct can be said to change from poor attitude to disobedience or insubordination where dismissal results after one or more warnings. 3)The plaintiff was entitled to 7 months notice to reflect the fact that junior management positions are fewer in number and the considerable wage difference between management and non- management positions.  4)The plaintiff was entitled to taxable costs.","FIAT. The plaintiff applied for summary judgment in his claim for dismissal without just cause brought pursuant to the simplified procedure outlined in Part Forty of the Rules of Court. The defendant opposed the application and requested a summary trial. The Plaintiff obtained employment with the defendant's predecessor, Merlin Motors, doing bodyshop foreman. The Defendant later purchased the bodyshops business from Merlin and retained the Quality Manager. The Quality Manager was terminated for poor job performance in performing his contractual duties as foreman and assistant manager. The Court found that the Quality Management had not been prepared for the job which was thrust upon him by the Defendant. The Defendants gave the plaintiff six weeks notice of termination effective six weeks later. The action was dismissed without prejudice to the Plaintiff. The Summary Judgment Rules require the presiding judge to grant judgment unless there is a genuine need for trial. In this case the plaintiff was able to obtain employment within two and one-half months of the end of the notice period given by the defendant at wage considerably below what he had earned with the Defendant and was still entitled to judgment. The trial was to be held in the manner set out in the Rules."
2_2005skpc38.txt,"The accused is charged with driving without due care and attention contrary to s. 44(1) of the Highway Traffic Act. A pedestrian was crossing a road adjacent to a parking lot and, while walking directly in front of a stopped vehicle, was struck by the vehicle when it rolled forward. HELD: The accused is not guilty. The court accepted the accused's evidence that his vehicle rolled forward only a short distance of not more than one foot and not at a fast or accelerated speed and that the pedestrian was crossing outside of the cross walk and that the accused applied his brakes as soon as he saw the pedestrian. The accused did exercise due diligence.","The accused was charged with driving without due care and attention contrary to s. 44(1) of the Highway Traffic Act. The accused was on duty in a marked police car when the vehicle rolled forward and struck the complainant. The complainant crossed the street outside of a grocery store and was injured in a motor vehicle accident. The officer applied his brake when he saw the accused cross the street and asked the complainant if he needed an ambulance. The pedestrian was seated in front of the store when the accident occurred. The police car rolled forward approximately a short distance from the complainant's vehicle and struck him in the hip. The impact of the vehicle on the complainant was minor and the impact of this accident was minor. The defendant was not injured. The issue to be determined was whether the Crown has proved that the accused drove without due notice and attention applying an objective test in assessing carelessness and whether he has then shown, on a balance of probabilities, that he exercised due diligence in the context of the circumstances he encountered. HELD: The accused's driving was careless. The Court accepted that the officer applied the objective test applied by the Supreme Court of Canada in R. v. Kozun 1997 CanLII 11313 and found that the Crown had proved that accused drove careless. On a balance on the issue of probabilities the Court found that accused's vehicle rolled over only a short space of not more than one foot and not at a fast or accelerating speed. The evidence showed that the vehicle did not accelerate and did not move forward quickly before striking the complainant, and that the defendant exercised due care or care in the circumstances of the incident. The issues were whether the accused's actions in operating his vehicle on a road beside a cross-walk constituted driving without Due Care and attention and whether the Court was satisfied that his driving was negligent. The actions of the accused were found to be careless."
b_1996canlii5028.txt,"Guardian was the general liability insurer for Kellogg. Royal was the primary insurer as holder of Kellogg's blanket fleet coverage. Kellogg's employee was involved in a motor vehicle accident while on company business but was driving his wife's vehicle at the time of the accident. Royal denied coverage and refused to defend on the basis of an exclusionary provision regarding the use of substitute automobiles. It was held at trial that Royal was not obligated to participate. HELD: 1)The case law reveals some inconsistencies with respect to the relationship between the duty to defend and the coverage provided by the policy. Where the policy clearly does not provide coverage, the insurer had no duty to defend. Where a policy only provides coverage for some allegations the insurer is only obligated to defend those allegations which may trigger the obligation to indemnify. When a policy is ambiguous some courts have adopted Thames and have stated the mere possibility that the policy may provide coverage is sufficient to oblige the insurer to defend. 2)Section 209 provides no guidelines as to the scope of the inquiry the judge may engage in. The chamber judge did not define the scope of his inquiry and stated that the standard suggestion that Guardian must raise an arguable point was 'off target'. To determine whether an insurer has the obligation to defend a chamber judge must examine the coverage provided by the policy. The judge made no finding of ambiguity in the exclusionary provision. He simply determined the Honda was not covered by the Royal policy and did not decide the issue of indemnity. 3)The affidavit evidence indicated that the parties lived in the same premises thus that argument was without merit. CONCURRING JUDGMENT: The appeal was dismissed for different reasons.  1)There has been an acceptance of the general concept that the duty to defend is broader than the duty to indemnify. To order an insurer to defend a chamber judge need be less sure the policy provides coverage than would be the case for an actual determination of liability under the policy. 2)There was a factual element which could not be determined on this application such as whether a partially deflated tire constitutes a breakdown within the meaning of the policy and whether the automobile the employee was driving was owned by someone living in the same dwelling. 3)The question centered around the words used in clause 5 of the policy and who it referred to. There were inconsistencies in terminology. The policy should not be interpreted as though the restriction it contains on what automobile can be used as a temporary substitute should be ignored.","An appeal from an application for directions to determine whether Royal had an obligation to defend. The appellant was the primary insurer as the holder of the blanket fleet coverage of the respondent. The respondent was the respondent's general liability insurer as well as the primary holder of its blanket fleet. When the provisions in the policy are ambiguous, a judge may conclude that there is no obligation to defending. However, the chambers judge did not decide that indemnity was an appropriate defence and the appropriate scope of the inquiry was broader than that envisaged by the insurer. The issue to be resolved was whether the chambers Judge erred in his application of the principles of contract interpretation when he decided the Honda was not a 'temporary substitute automobile' within the terms of the Royal policy. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. 1)No matter the scope of an inquiry the duty to defend does not arise with respect to claims which are clearly beyond the scope the policy. 2)The difficulty with a chambers judge engaging in an extensive inquiry into policy coverage in an application to defend arises when he ultimately rules there is a no obligation on the insurer, there is an obligation on an obligation of the insurer to defend, and after the trial, the trial judge concludes that the insurer has an obligation pursuant to the duty that is imposed. 3)The chambers judge was aware that the respondent had an exclusionary provision in its policy which denied coverage to any individual who had a claim which was not clearly asserted. The chambers judge could not intervene to determine the extent to which the individual had an exclusive right to defend the claim. 4)The Court concluded that the chambers juridical test as articulated in Nichols was not applicable in this case. The Court concluded the chambers court erred by misunderstanding the judicial function established by s.209(1) of the Act by deciding the issue of indemnity when s. 209(3) made it clear an application under s.208(1)(a) did not affect the rights and obligations of the insurers in respect of the payment of any indemnity under their respective policies. 5)The Chambers judge erred when he misconstrued the standard by which the obligation of Royal to defend is determined. The test is merely one that if it can be shown the claim arguably falls within the coverage of a policy the insurer is obliged to defend on behalf of the insured. 6)The court concluded that there was no duty to protect in any circumstance."
d_2007skqb324.txt,"This is an application by the accused for an order that evidence obtained by way of a telephone interception be ruled inadmissible because it is irrelevant. Alternatively, the accused seeks exclusion of the intercepted communication on the basis that it was conducted in violation of s. 8 of the Charter and ought to be excluded under s. 24(2). The accused is charged with abuse of a position of trust contrary to s. 153(1)(a) of the Code. HELD: The evidence is admissible. The accused's application is dismissed. 1) After examining the transcript of the conversation, it is immediately evident that the contents of the communication are relevant. The complainant and the accused are discussing the intimate details of their relationship. The conversation is logically probative to the charge. 2) The learned provincial court judge did in fact have sufficient evidence before him to issue the telephone intercept authorization. The complainant was prepared to initiate a telephone call to the accused and engage him in a conversation which would likely cause the accused to make admissions or statements which could be confirmatory of her allegations. 3) The authorization clearly permits the police to intercept private communications in relation to an offence under s. 271(1) of the Code. That investigation was live and bona fide at the time that the authorization was obtained. The law in this country is that evidence of other crimes revealed during the course of a lawful intercept process does not render the evidence obtained inadmissible in relation to an offence not named in the authorization. The focus is on whether the interception was lawfully obtained and executed, not on what is discovered. Here the police obtained a valid authorization to intercept private communications in relation to an offence under s. 271(1) of the Code. During the investigation of that charge, they obtained evidence which is relevant to an offence under s. 153(1)(a) of the Code. The fact that the offence of s. 153(1)(a) is not named in the authorization nor included as an offence for which an authorization to intercept private communications could be obtained, does not affect the admissibility of the evidence. Therefore, there is no Charter breach. 4) Even if the evidence was obtained in violation of s. 8 of the Charter, such evidence is considered non-conscriptive evidence. Where the evidence is non-conscriptive, the court ought to go on to do a balancing as to whether or not the evidence ought to be excluded pursuant to s. 24(2) of the Charter. The factors to be considered are trial fairness, seriousness of the breach and the effect of exclusion. In this case if there is a breach, it was not serious and was inadvertent, the result of unmindful draftsmanship. There is no evidence of bad faith. There is no evidence of manipulation. The seriousness of the breach, if there was one, was minimal, and to admit the evidence would not bring the administration of justice into disrepute.","The accused was charged with two offences contrary to s. 8 of the Charter. The accused argued that the police had reasonable and probable grounds to believe that the accused committed offences contraryto s. 271(1) and s. 273.1(2)(c) of the Criminal Code. HELD: The evidence obtained by way of a telephone interception was ruled inadmissible because it was irrelevant. The evidence was irrelevant because it is not part of the conversation. The learned judge who issued the authorization did so in error because there was no basis upon which he could conclude that there were reasonable grounds to believed that information concerning the offences would be obtained through the interception sought and, therefore, the evidence ought to be excluded pursuant to s24(2). The accused's applications were dismissed. 1) The evidence is relevant and admissible in that it does not violate the accused's s.8 rights. The only thing which could be considered non-conscriptive was the fact that the conversation was reasonably close to the accused and he chose his audience. The police did not know that the complainant would be able to elicit relevant responses from the accused. 2) The surreptitious recording did not compel or coerce the accused to speak. The allegation that the Crown sought to exclude the evidence was pure speculation and fell short of what could be consider to be reasonable grounds for belief that information would be obtain through the intercept sought. 3) There was no Charter breach. The Court reviewed the provisions of the Code and there was sufficient evidence before the judge to issue the telephone intercept authorization. The judge did not have to decide whether the evidence should be excluded. 4) The Court found that the evidence of the telephone conversation was relevant and that it did not violate its s.7 rights. It was reasonable to presume that information related to the offence would be acquired through the acquisition of the intercepted private communication. The Crown did not establish that the breach was serious and was inadvertent. 5) The accused was awarded his costs of the application in accordance with s. 24(2) of The Charter."

The Crown applied to have a witness, who was an unindicted co-conspirator and separately charged with drug offences arising out of the same investigation, declared adverse pursuant to s9 of the Canada Evidence Act. She had contradicted her prior video taped statement made shortly after her arrest and had demonstrated hostile attitude towards the Crown. The defence took the position that she was now telling the truth; that the statement was improperly obtained in breach of the confession rules of voluntariness and the statement did not meet the requirements set out in R. v.

It will be for the jury to decide what, if any, portions of such statement they wish to accept. 1)A prior inconsistent statement cannot be introduced in evidence for its substantive content, unless the requirement of necessity, and a threshold of reliability arrived at on a balance of probabilities are established. When, as here, a witness recants, the requirement of necessity is established. The real issue is whether the prior statement meets the test for reliability. When, as here, there is only one demonstrably false piece of testimony in the statement, which does not implicate anyone but rather attempts to exonerate someone, the Court was not prepared to say ipso facto the statement is unreliable. 2)The independent evidence sufficiently corroborated her statement in enough different particulars that, but for the demonstrably false portion, it met the threshold of reliability.","FIAT.
