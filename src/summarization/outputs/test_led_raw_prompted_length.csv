b_2005nssf21.txt,"The parties were married for 13 years and had three children. Both parties appeared to have a standard of living higher than their personal annual income would dictate; the husband by funneling many of his personal expenses through his company and the wife with the financial assistance of her parents. The wife sought lump sum spousal support to cover the cost of her tuition for a three year course in a divinity college. In addition to the matrimonial home, the parties owned various rental properties. Joint custody of the children ordered with primary day to day care to be with the wife; in the event that the parties cannot agree on any major issue concerning the children, the final decision will be made by the wife; income attributed to the husband for child support purposes; piano lessons and musical instruments found to be extraordinary expenses within the meaning of s. 7 of the Guidelines but soccer, tennis and horseback riding are not; no spousal support ordered; all property equally divided. The wife's father had given her one rental property from which the rental proceeds went to the mortgage and into the parties' joint bank account; the husband was extensively involved in the operation of the property. This property was found to be a gift to the wife that became a matrimonial asset during the marriage as it was operated as a family venture. A second rental property was purchased by the husband and the wife's brother; the wife considered herself a partner in the venture even though her name was left off the deed. This property was also found to be a matrimonial asset.","The parties agreed that a Joint Custody Order would be issued and that primary care would remain with the mother. The parties also agreed that the children's best interests were served by remaining in the matrimonial home with their father. HELD: 1) The parties were to share joint custody of the three children. Primary care was to be with Ellen. The mother was to have access on specific terms. The father was to pay basic guideline support for the children in the amount of $650 per month.  2) The evidence of value in relation to this property covers several dates. The appraisals are dated August 6, 2003 and April 3, 2004. The mortgage balance is as of August 2002, the date of separation. 3) The children will have the opportunity to become involved in many activities in the future. Although this expense had not been incurred at the time of the trial, there was no question that it was necessary and imminent."
b_2017skqb81.txt,"HELD: The issues were determined as follows: 1) the applicant applied pursuant to The Seizure of Criminal Property Act, 2009, as that version of the Act was in place at the time of the seizure. The respondent argued that s. 35.1 did not apply at the time of seizure, because it was not in the Act at the time of seizure. The respondent argued that the two-year limitation period pursuant to The Limitations Act applied to the application with the date of seizure being the date of discoverability. The respondent also argued that the 2009 Act did not have retrospective application. The court found that the applicant applied pursuant to the 2009 Act and therefore the matter was assessed from that perspective. Section 35.1 of the 2009 Act required applications for forfeiture to be made within two years from the director becoming satisfied that the property sought to be forfeited was proceeds of unlawful activity or an instrument of unlawful activity. The court found that the words “Notwithstanding The Limitations Act” at the beginning of s. 35.1 served to provide an intention to prioritize the content of s. 35.1 over The Limitations Act. An affidavit filed by the applicant indicated that the director became satisfied that the property was an instrument of unlawful activity after August 2016. The director’s application was brought four months later, well within the two-year limitation period. The court then considered whether the 2009 Act had retrospective application and found that B. had the same legal position and faced the same jeopardy regardless of the version of the legislation, and therefore, there was no retrospective problem;  2) s. 7 outlined the test to apply. The court accepted the expert’s evidence with regards to the significance of the factors evidencing drug trafficking and how common they were to the drug trafficking trade. The applicant’s evidence also showed that the person alleging to purchase the truck from the respondent was not the purchaser and the purchase price was $8,000, not $16,000. The court found it more likely than not that the money was proceeds of unlawful activity; and 3) B. did not provide evidence or argument to support the exception that forfeiture would clearly not be in the interests of justice. The property was found to be proceeds of unlawful activity and the forfeiture order was granted.","This is an application by the Director under the The Seizure of Criminal Property Act for an order directing the forfeiture of $10,475.00 to the Crown in Saskatchewan pursuant to Part II.1 of the 2009 Act. The property had been seized by the Regina Police Service (RPS) from William Ross Butler in 2008. Since the defendant filed notice of dispute in response to those proceedings, the Director applied to this Court for a forfeiture order. HELD: The application was granted. 1)There is no retroactive effect to the application. 2)The current legislative mandate reflected in 2009 Act is prospective in operational effect and not retroactive. The Director's application is not statute barred and there is no limitations issue. 3)The definition of 'property' and 'proceeds of unlawful activity' is based on the expiration of limitation period. The legislation is civil not criminal in nature, and it is an in rem remedy."
3_2004skqb374.txt,"FIAT: In 1996, the respondent was ordered to pay $600 per month as child support for his daughter. He now applies to reduce his support obligation and rescind the arrears which have accumulated. HELD: 1) In 1999, the respondent sold his ownership interest in a business and retained a one-third interest. In 2001, he was terminated from his full-time employment as a result of an unexplained absence from work after he received a suspension for insubordination. Since his termination, he has not obtained full-time employment. He has continued to work seasonally 3 months a year and earn the gross amount of $21,000. The Court found that it is the respondent's choice to work a minimum amount each year. It has been said that individuals, who are subject to support obligations, are entitled to make decisions in relation to their careers as long as the decisions are reasonable at the time having regard to the circumstances. The respondent's decision to work only three months a year and to possibly return to school is not reasonable. 2) For the purposes of this application, the respondent's income was imputed to be $40,000 and he was ordered to pay $328 per month as support for his daughter. 3) The sharing of the s. 7 special expenses should be based on the respondent's imputed income. 4) A retroactive variation of child support is warranted. The respondent commenced his application for variation in June 2002 and the chambers judge was of the view that any variation of support should be retroactive to September 2002.  In light of the fact the respondent's previous support obligation was tax deductible/tax inclusive, the petitioner may in fact benefit from a retroactive variation as the child support she will receive, pursuant to this order, will be payable on a net of tax basis.  5) Rule 608(2) provides that a successful party will be entitled to costs of a family law proceeding unless, pursuant to Rule 608(3), the successful party has behaved unreasonably or has acted in bad faith. The difficulty in the matter before me is determining whether or not the respondent has been successful. Although his support obligation decreases, his previous payment was tax deductible while his ongoing payment will be net of tax. It is very likely that the respondent's financial position has not changed as a result of the order. The Court also had grave concerns respecting the substantial delays in the proceedings caused by the respondent's unwillingness to provide financial disclosure. Costs were awarded to the petitioner in the sum of $750, as the discovery motion would not have been necessary had the respondent provided appropriate financial disclosure.","FIAT. The parents of one child, who was underemployed, applied to reduce their support obligation and rescind arrears which had accumulated under the previous order. The primary questions to be answered were: 1) what is the current income; 2) should the child support variation be retroactive; and 3) should costs of this variation application be granted to either the applicant or the mother of the child. Although the applicant's support obligation had decreased from the monthly sum of $600 to $412, his previous payment was tax deductible while his ongoing payment was net of tax. It is very likely that the successful party has not changed as result of the order for child support. The difficulty in the matter is determining whether or not the applicant has, indeed, been successful on this motion."
7_2006skca94.txt,"The tenants apply pursuant to s. 49(2) of The Residential Tenancies Act for leave to appeal a decision of the Court of Queen's Bench reviewing a decision of the Rentalsman. HELD: Application allowed.  1) The parties agree that the rent for July was paid on July 27. The landlord then immediately applied for and was granted a writ of possession. 2) The tenants advise that the landlord holds the equivalent of one month's rent as security for the payment of the last month rent of the tenancy. The landlord claims it is a security deposit. 3) The tenants claim they tendered the arrears on the basis that the landlord would not apply for a writ of possession and that the arrears were accepted on that basis. 4) The Court of Queen's Bench Chambers judge dismissed the appellant's appeal the same day saying 'the rent for August has not been paid and not paid by required time, appeal is dismissed'. 5) The first issue on appeal is whether the Chambers judge erred in finding the Rentalsman had jurisdiction to make the order granting possession on the basis that 'the rent was 15 days in arrears when the Notice of Termination of the tenancy agreement was served and the tenant has failed to vacate the premises in accordance with the Notice' if the landlord accepted the rent in lieu of seeking a writ of possession. The second issue on appeal is whether the Chambers judge erred in considering that the subsequent month's rent was not paid.","The tenants apply pursuant to s.49(2) of The Residential Tenancies Act[1] for leave to appeal a decision of the Court of Queen's Bench reviewing a Rentalsman decision. HELD: The tenants have until 4:00 p.m. on August 31, 2006 to serve their notice of appeal and 15 days thereafter to file their appeal book and factum. The landlord has leave to apply on 48 hours notice to lift any stay of execution. 1)The rent was 15 days or more in arrears when the Notice of Termination of the tenancy agreement was served and the tenant has failed to vacate the premises in accordance with the Notice. Based on the evidence provided, the Landlord's claim has been sufficiently proven and an Order should be made placing the landlord in possession of the rental premises. 2)The tenants appealed the Rentalsmans decision to the Queen’s Bench. Their appeal was heard on August 15, 2006. The Chambers judge dismissed the tenants’ appeal the same day. 3)The landlord was granted leave to seek a writ of possession."
8_2007skpc1.txt,"The accused applies for relief pursuant to the Charter on the basis of post-charge delay denying her the right to have her trial in a reasonable time. HELD: There was a Charter breach and the appropriate remedy is a stay of proceedings.  1) The length of delay in this case from the date of charge to the date of trial is approximately 31 months. The Supreme Court proposed as a general guideline a delay of 8 to 10 months in Provincial Court as acceptable. This is consistent with the reality in Buffalo Narrows, where trials are set within 6 months of entering a plea. 2) 12 months of the delay can be attributed to the accused. 6 months was deducted from the delay for inherent time requirements in arranging for the accused's appearance in Court. The remaining delay of 13 months is either attributable to the Crown or caused by factors outside the control of the accused. 3) In this case the accused has suffered actual prejudice in that the delay in bringing this matter to Court from the time of swearing the Information to the date of trial has prejudiced the accused's ability to make full answer and defence and her right to a fair trial. While the restrictions on employment opportunities caused some prejudice, this could have been overcome by applications to amend her conditions of release. 4) There have been four trial dates set on these charges, resulting in a lengthy delay to a verdict being reached. No explanation is offered for the adjournments except for the last adjournment caused by bad weather.",The accused applied for relief pursuant to the Canadian Charter of Rights on the basis of post-charge delay denying her the right to have her trial in a reasonable time. HELD: The Court found that there was a Charter breach and that the appropriate remedy was a stay of proceedings.  1)There was a breach of the accused's Charter rights. Fairness to the accused requires that even for offences such as these that trials be held within reasonable time so that the accused does not suffer undue prejudice and so that society's interest in having these matters heard can also be done within reasonable period of time. 2)The Court found the prejudice suffered due to the outstanding charge had affected her ability to apply for higher-paying job opportunities and caused her stress and frustration. The accused did not contribute to the remaining delay as there were some delays attributable to her in time until she was ready to enter pleas and then to have the matter rescheduled for trial. 3)The court found that the prejudice caused by the adjournments was either attributable to the Crown or caused by factors outside her control. Limitations on institutional resources caused delay of 2 months. 4)The length of delay was attributable to both the Crown and the accused as these adjournments were at her request for the purpose of deciding defence election and entering plea.
e_2001skqb128.txt,"The mother had custody of the 12 and year olds under the terms of the January 10, 2000 consent judgment. The father applied to vary child support in November on the basis of his reduced income. HELD: The application was dismissed with costs to the petitioner fixed at $1,000. The onus is on the applicant to provide cogent, independent or objective verification of change of circumstances. This application was brought 10 months after the pre-trial conference. It was of no consequence that someone may come into the home rather than using commercial day care service. There was no change in the father's hours of work or the schedule. The only change was that the mother was no longer available to provide care during Saturday of his access weekends. The mother was not to schedule activities during the father's access periods without his consent and he was to provide 7 days written notice if he chooses not to exercise access during specified times. This was not a variation of the custody/access regime but rather specific directions to provide some predictability for the children.","HELD: The application was dismissed with costs fixed in the amount of $1,000. The consent judgment provided that the respondent shall have access to the children at all reasonable times including the following: 1) On alternate weekends from Friday evening until Sunday evening at 8:30 p.m. to be extended to Monday evening in the event of long weekend. The material does not satisfy the Court there has been any material change in the circumstances of the children since the consent judgment. 2) The respondent's income is reduced and refers to his 1999 tax return indicating an income of $42,386.34. It was the respondent's understanding the children no longer attended institutional daycare. The fact that someone may come into her home to provide child care services as opposed to using commercial child care service is of no consequence. There has been no material change. 3) If the level of child support was simply an agreed upon amount the question was whether there had been some other material change that would make the income imputed to the respondent inappropriate?"
3_2000canlii19612.txt,"The plaintiffs claim for crop damage caused by the defendant's cattle entering the plaintiff's canola field. The defendant denies he is responsible or negligent, but admits his cattle were in the field.HELD: Damages were awarded in the amount of $2,533.45. The court valued the loss at $3,052.36. It then deducted 2% attributed to wild animal damage, 5% for the plaintiffs failure to calculate actual yield from the rest of the crop, 5% that the plaintiffs would have paid in dockage and 5% for the cost of production. Civil liability for crop damage caused by cattle flows from the Stray Animals Act. A cattle owner is strictly liable for damages caused by his straying cattle.  This liability may possibly even be absolute and only an act of god may serve as a defence. The issue here is the quantum of the damage. The fact that the defendant was refused access to the plaintiff's property to repair the fence has no bearing on liability in this case. An independent adjuster assessed the damage at 557 bushels. The court found on the facts that the damage was caused exclusively by the defendant's cattle on several occasions.","The plaintiff's claim against the defendant was for crop damage sustained as a result of his cattle getting into the plaintiff's canola field in late July, 1999. The defendant admitted that his cattle were in the plaintiff’s canola crop on one occasion but denied liability. HELD: Judgment in the amount of $2,533.45 was granted in favour of the plaintiff, together with pre-judgment interest from January 2000 and costs. 1)Under the present s.27 (1) and the pre-1977 statutes, the cattle owner is strictly liable for damage caused by his straying cattle. The fact remains that the cattle did move onto the farm and that other cattle were not in the field. 2)No evidence was put before the court as to whether other cattle contributed to the crop loss. The onus was on the plaintiff to establish the portion of the damage that was caused by the cattle. 3)The plaintiff was obliged to keep the fence in good repair and to accept his specific crop loss figures and his estimate of crop yield."

The proposal had received the necessary proportion of support from Gustafson's creditors. One unsecured creditor opposed the application. HELD: 1)Under s. 59(2), before it can approve a proposal, the Court must be satisfied; (a) that the terms are reasonable; (b) that the terms are calculated to benefit the general body of creditors; and (c) that the proposal is made in good faith. 2)In determining whether to approve a proposal, the court must consider not only the wishes and interests of creditors, but also the conduct and interests of the debtor, the interests of the public and future creditors and the requirements of commercial morality. 3)If, however, a large majority of creditors, i.e., substantially in excess of the statutory majority, have voted for acceptance of a proposal, it will take strong reasons for the court to substitute its judgment for that of the creditors. 4)Gustafson had met the criteria set out in the Act and the authorities referred to in Bankruptcy and Insolvency Law of Canada, and accordingly the proposal was approved.","This was an application pursuant to ss. 58 and 59 of the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act for the approval of a proposal made pursuant to s. 50 of the Act by Gustafson to its various creditors.

3_2002skqb54.txt,"The wife sought an order for equal distribution of matrimonial property. They married in 1988, each for a second time, and separated in 1997. Each had significant assets at the time of the marriage, which had increased in value. They agreed at the time of the marriage to keep their assets separate and to not make a claim on the assets of the other and that their entire estates would be left to their respective children.  The wife argued the agreement was not applicable to the present situation where they have separated and was only in effect during the time of the marriage or upon their deaths. HELD: The wife was entitled to judgment for $54,000. 1)There was no conflict in the evidence as to the verbal agreement made at the time of the marriage nor as to their intention. This is an appropriate situation to apply s.40 of the Family Property Act. The fact they each executed a will to give effect to that intention and the husband paid practically all of the day-to-day expenses led to the conclusion their verbal agreement should be considered binding, notwithstanding their marriage ended by separation rather than death. 2)The condominium purchased by the husband was the 'family home' as provided for in s.2(1)(a). There was no extraordinary circumstance as provided in s.22(1), which would prevent equal division of the value of the family home. The Melville residence owned by the wife at the time of the marriage was exempt in accordance with their agreement. It had not increased in value and the wife solely paid its maintenance. 3)No costs.","The petitioner seeks an order for equal distribution of matrimonial property. The parties married in 1988 and separated in 1997. One of the assets the petitioner owned prior to the marriage was residence in Melville. After their separation, the petitioner returned to her residence which the parties agreed to keep separate and to not make claim on the assets of the other. HELD: 1)The petitioner is entitled to half of the value of assets acquired after marriage. The only evidence in writing of the parties' intentions is the respective wills executed shortly after the marriage leaving all of their assets to their respective children. There is, however, no conflict in the evidence as to the verbal agreement they made at the time of the marriage.  2)There is no 'extraordinary circumstance' as provided in s.22(1) of the Act which would prevent the values of the family home from being divided equally between the parties. The petitioner's assets then, and in the condominium plan or replacement plan, as the case may be, as defined in The Condominium Property Act, 1993, including the owner's share in common property as shown on that plan."
c_1997canlii9802.txt,"An appeal from an order which quashed an interim order of the Labour Relations Board (LRB) pending the determination of a grievance by an arbitration board, even though no proceedings were pending before the LRB and even though it had no power to make a final order respecting the proceedings before the arbitration board. At issue was whether s5.3 of the Trade Union Act authorized the Board to make such an order. HELD: The appeal was dismissed with costs.  1)The Board recognized the question to be a jurisdictional question. The standard of review is whether the decision was correct rather than patently unreasonable. 2)The chambers judge arrived at the correct conclusion whether from the point of view of the plain meaning of the words of s5.3 or the context of the entire statute or a purposive approach.  3)S5.3 refers to the 'board' which is defined by s2(c) to be the LRB and accordingly referred to applications and orders of the LRB. The interim power is not only based on the final power but is also part of the final power and both are part of the same process. 4)S25(1), when read with ss(1.1) and (1.2) indicates an intention on the part of the legislators to grant exclusive jurisdiction to arbitration boards to deal with disputes arising out of the interpretation of collective agreements. 5)Whatever the scope of s42, it cannot be used to release the restrictions of a statutory provision the very purpose of which is to define the jurisdiction of the LRB to act in respect of such matters.","This was an appeal from an order of Barclay J. which quashed an interim order of the Labour Relations Board pending the determination of a grievance by an arbitration board, even though no proceedings were pending before the Board, and even though it had no power to make any final order respecting the proceedings before the arbitration board. The issue was whether s. 5.3 of The Trade Union Act, R.S. s. 1978, c. T-17, authorizes the Board to make interim orders in respect of proceedings before arbitration boards.

e_2007skpc90.txt,"The plaintiff sues the defendant town for water damage sustained to her former residence when frozen pipes burst. The plaintiff claims she told the Town Office to shut off her water supply and the failure to do so let to the damages being sustained. HELD: The claim is dismissed. 1) There is no evidence that the plaintiff gave clear instructions to the town to shut off her water. 2) The proximate cause of the damage was turning off the heat and power without ensuring that water line, toilets, and the water tank had been properly drained. 3) The plaintiff sustained no damages herself. She admits she negotiated the sale price of $50,000 with her daughter prior to any damage being sustained to the property. No adjustment had to be made to her daughter thereafter for any 'loss' occasioned. Any claim would have to be made by her daughter not her.","The plaintiff brought an action for water damage sustained to her former residence when frozen pipes burst. She alleged that she instructed the Town Office to shut off her water supply and the failure to do so led to the damages being sustained. The Town of Martensville disputes that such instructions were given and that, in any event, the cause of the pipes bursting was not as result of the water not being turned off but rather because the plaintiff had the power and heat disconnected. HELD: The plaintiff's action was dismissed. There was no order as to costs. 1)Any claim at this point would have to be made by her daughter, not her as she had no further standing, having legally divested title and not received any less value on the sale of the property in the process. The evidence demonstrates a misunderstanding at best between what the plaintiff believed she was requesting and what in fact she did instruct. This cannot be construed as negligence in the circumstances by the town nor does the fact that specific forms are now utilized for disconnect purposes, elevate the matter on the facts before the Court, to negligence by the Town. 2)The plaintiff’s action could not succeed for the following reasons: a)the Court could not find on the evidence that clear instruction were given by the plaintiff to the town to disconnect the water service. To the contrary, the form executed by the defendant clearly indicates request for final billing. This however cannot be interpreted as negligence. This is not negligence in any circumstances or does not the fact the specific forms were now utilized by the municipality elevate the subject on the matter. 3)The evidence demonstrated a misunderstanding of what was asked of the plaintiff. The defendant did not request the water be disconnected and accordingly no signature was required or obtained on the back of the form. Neither did Ms. Isaac advise the power was being shut off."
6_2009skqb394.txt,"The plaintiff bought a house. She used the services of Cecilia Mui, a realtor associated with the defendant 100% Realty Associates Ltd. operating as Re/max Saskatoon. The house was purchased from the defendants Edward and Verl Karpinski. The vendors' realtor was the defendant, Mario Jacobucci, owner of the defendant Trevi Holdings Ltd. The house did not meet the plaintiff's expectations. She now sues the defendants seeking recovery of damages for alleged latent defects. She claims Ms. Mui fell below the standard of care required of a realtor representing a purchaser. She claims Ms. Mui was negligent in misrepresenting certain facts and breached the fiduciary duty expected of her. The plaintiff claims the Karpinskis misrepresented facts to her, negligently and fraudulently. The plaintiff claims that Mr. Jacobucci and his company are liable to her in damages, both in negligence and as parties to the misrepresentations made by the vendors. Special and general damages are claimed as are aggravated damages and punitive damages. The trial took place over 22 days, spanning several years and included testimony from 14 witnesses. Two main issues are raised. The first is the liability of each of the defendants. The second issue is quantum of damages. The credibility of the parties is at the forefront of the determination of the issues. HELD: The vendors are liable to the plaintiff for breach of contract. Each of the defendants is a tortfeasor, each having breached an obligation or duty owed to the plaintiff, whether through negligence or misrepresentation. Their wrongful acts and omissions all contributed to the same damage. In that respect their liability is concurrent. The liability of the vendors and Mr. Jacobucci is joint, and that of Ms. Mui is several. As concurrent torfeasors, the fault for the damage shall be apportioned equally among the four of them.  1) Credibility is not a science, see R. v. Gagnon, 2006 SCC 17. It is not always possible to articulate with precision the complex intermingling of impressions that emerge after watching and listening to witnesses and attempting to reconcile the various versions of events. The principles and tools to be used in assessing credibility are summarized in Novak Estate (Re), 2008 NSSC 283. 2) Certain of the evidence of the Karpinskis and Ms. Mui is so unreliable that the whole of their evidence is cast with doubt. 3) The opinions and conclusions of Mr. Loraas and Mr. Epp are accepted by the court. They are professionals with no interest in the outcome of the action. Their evidence was largely unchallenged. The Court finds that the pine shakes were rotten, sealant had been applied to the shakes on at least two occasions and prior to the plaintiff offering to buy the property, the shakes were not properly installed allowing water to seep into the house, the skylight leaked and caulking had been applied to stop the leaking before the plaintiff offered to buy the house, there was improper and inadequate venting which resulted in moisture damage to the interior of the house and mold in the attic, the moisture damage in the house included damage to drywall and paint blisters. Nail pops throughout the house were largely the result of the house being moved. No inspection was done after the house was moved. 4) The Court finds the Karpinskis did not speak truthfully or completely when they answered the questions in the Property Condition Disclosure Statement (PCDS). The Court does not accept that the vendors were not aware of water and moisture damage arising from the improperly installed shingles, the missing ridge caps, the leaking skylight or the lack of venting. The sealant on the roof was sufficiently old to predate the plaintiff's purchase of the house. The vendors repaired the sink holes and moisture pockets and effectively concealed the problems. It should have been disclosed. Although the vendors denied knowing of the structural damage to their house, they knew the house had been cut in half and moved 300 kilometers and had sustained damage. The structural problems were concealed by the vendors through repairs to the dry wall, reinforcement at stress points, and repainting and patching of wall paper. The fact that the house had been cut in half and moved should have been disclosed on the PCDS. 5) It is not only current defects or ongoing problems that need to be disclosed on a PCDS. A prospective purchaser does not look to the PCDS only to ascertain that the roof is not leaking on the day it was signed, see Kaufmann v. Gibson, [2007] O.J. No. 2711 (Ont. S.C.) (QL). The Karpinskis are liable to the plaintiff for breach of contract for failing to disclose the existence of structural defects, damage due to water and roof leakage. The terms of the PCDS formed part of the agreement between the parties and the deliberate withholding of this information amounted to a false representation as to the condition of the home. With respect to damage arising from these defects, the doctrine of caveat emptor does not apply. 6) The requirements for negligent misrepresentation have been established by the plaintiff. The failure to disclose, or silence as to a known defect, amounts to an act of concealment of a material fact and has the same effect as an express misrepresentation and is sufficient to attract liability, Thomas v. Blackwell, 1999 SKQB 168. 7) The false representations knowingly made by the vendors and their silence as to material facts were fraudulent. 8) Ms. Mui was negligent and her conduct and advice to the plaintiff fell below the standard of care expected of a realtor acting for the purchaser of a rural property in 1999. She did not conduct any preliminary background checks with the Rural Municipality, which would include determining if proper permits had been obtained, prior to the plaintiff's offer to purchase. Ms. Mui did nothing more than merely mention a home inspection to the plaintiff on one occasion. At no time did she recommend a home inspection even after she knew the house had been moved and before the condition regarding a satisfactory PCDS was removed. Another reason to strongly recommend a home inspection would be in circumstances where the realtor knew that a rural municipality did not require building inspections and Ms. Mui knew this to be the case. The plaintiff relied on the representation of Ms. Mui to her detriment. Had Ms. Mui disclosed all material facts to the plaintiff and explained and recommended a home inspection, the Court is satisfied that the outcome for the plaintiff would have been different. Knowing the house had been moved and had not been inspected the plaintiff would have most likely reconsidered her decision to purchase. 9) The Court is satisfied that Mr. Jacabucci is liable to the plaintiff for negligent misrepresentation. He represented that the home was of 'quality construction'. This was incorrect. Mr. Jacobucci was also complicit in, and party to, the negligent misrepresentations made by the vendors in the PCDS. He knew the house had been moved and sustained damage. He also knew the skylight leaked. The plaintiff relied on these misrepresentations and damages resulted.  10) The costs incurred by the plaintiff to repair the house total $17,613. She is awarded $15,000 as compensation for personal time and effort that she expended in repairing the home. There is no evidence that the distress the plaintiff experienced constituted a physical injury, or a recognized psychiatric illness and she cannot be compensated for mental distress, whether under tort or breach of contract. She is awarded $10,000 for aggravated damages. Her claim for punitive damages is dismissed. Her claim for solicitor and client costs is dismissed.

She engaged the services of a realtor associated with the defendant, 100% Realty Associates, operating as RE/MAX Saskatoon. After a lengthy search, the plaintiff purchased a country home in 1998. The property was owned by the defendants, Edward and Verl Karpinski. Their realtor, Cecilia Mui, misrepresented facts to the plaintiff, induced her, in part, to purchase the home, and in answers that she gave in a Property Condition Disclosure Statement (PCDS) which formed a condition of the contract for sale.

7_2001nssc49.txt,"The parties were divorced two years ago and the matter had been finalized by an appeal decision in June, 1999. Both parties made application to vary child support on the basis of changes (ups and downs) in the farming business. The respondent wife, who recently purchased a house, also applied for lump sum spousal support which claim had been disallowed by the Court of Appeal. Monthly spousal support terminated as wife now self-sufficient; child support increased due to increase in husband's income; lump sum payment of $8,000 awarded to wife to help pay her relocation expenses from move with husband given six months to pay lump sum, but monthly spousal support to continue until the $8,000 was paid in full. Applications to vary should not be entertained simply because of the usual ups and downs of the farming business; the court must strive to average out the individual's ability to pay in such circumstances in order to ensure stability of payments for both parties. Lump sum spousal support payments must not have the effect of a significant redistribution of the division of matrimonial property but the reasons for the belated application must be examined.","The parties have made counter applications to vary spousal and/or child support and lump sum support less than 2 years after being divorced and less than one year after the Court of Appeal decision which settled the support awards of the trial judge. The parties originally claimed material change in circumstances based on his poor farming results in 1999 and Ms. Macdonald's improved employment and income situation. The trial judge awarded $10,000 for the down payment on the home and $20,000 to reimburse her for the RRSP's she cashed for moving expenses. In the present circumstances, the parties have a current need for a lump sum award to compensate the petitioner for relocation expenses for the reasons mentioned above. The respondent has not established an immediate need for such an award. HELD: 1) The respondent's income for support purposes is $41,000 and the respondent shall pay $8,000.00 as lump sum Spousal Support. The circumstances do not justify this expanded request. Considering the moving expenses and the tax consequences of cashing some RRSP’s and other expenses such as furniture, etc., the intention of the respondent is to reinstate those or part of those.  2) In the circumstances the parties find there is a current urgent need to pay for her relocation expenses. This was contemplated by the judge and the court of Appeal, but not nearly to the extent requested because to do so would give effect to significant redistribution of matrimonial property. 3) The parties have not addressed the question of costs directly, pending my decision."

In earlier hearings, the Crown and applicant had each sought new trial dates to ensure procurement of witnesses for trial. The Crown sought to subpoena the victim to testify. Due to the delay in obtaining authority to serve an out of town subpoena in New Brunswick, the Crown was unable to serve the victim until three days before trial. The victim did not learn of the trial date until the day before and was unable to attend. An adjournment was granted. The applicant contended the trial judge had exceeded his jurisdiction. Dismissing the application. It is within the jurisdiction of the trial judge to deal with the issue of adjournments in accordance with the provisions of the Criminal Code. Jurisdictional error is not to be equated with error of law. Any decision to grant an adjournment is therefore within the court's proper discretion. If a remedy exists, it is by way of an appeal and not a prerogative writ. In any event, the sequence of events was sufficient to justify the granting of an adjournment. There was neither neglect nor laches on the part of the Crown.","The applicant sought an order of prohibition and certiorari directing that Judge Archibald and any other provincial court judge could not hear the trial of the Queen v. Jessome.

He had the right to exercise the discretion and right to be wrong. If there is any remedy, it is by way of appeal, not by a prerogative writ. 2)The decision to grant the adjournment on the basis that the Crown had fumbled on one of the subpoenas did not satisfy the Court. There was no controversy as to the events leading up to the witness not being available at the date of the trial."
9_1994canlii4844.txt,"This decision is supplementary to [1993]TWL QB93506. Applications to further divide matrimonial property and to vary spousal maintenance. The husband had declared personal bankruptcy since the date of the original orders obtained under the Matrimonial Property Act and Divorce Act. HELD: 1)The husband's obligation to pay maintenance was reduced to $1 per month and the arrears accruing after the date of his assignment into bankruptcy were cancelled.  2)The wife's counsel requested that the court value and divide all of the matrimonial property equally notwithstanding the bankruptcy, because she might pursue a constructive trust claim for her 1/2 share as against the husband's trustee. 3)The court valued all of the matrimonial property and determined that 56% of this value should be paid to the wife, and only 44% to the husband, given amounts he had spent since the separation.  4)The court left unresolved the issue of which matrimonial assets might be exempt under the Bankruptcy Act and therefore available to the wife.","The wife filed a motion seeking a variation of the spousal maintenance order made in November in light of her husband's bankrupt financial situation and his inability to earn any income at this time. HELD: 1)Division of matrimonial property. The husband did pay the respondent $2,300 by way of maintenance out of certain barley he sold privately. The respondent claims this was in violation of his original order prohibiting the sale of any assets of the marriage without consent of the other party or the Court. The division of property is based on asset values which are at this stage problematical and should he succeed in that contention then the trustee in bankruptcy would not be able to claim her share of those assets for distribution to the unsecured creditors of the petitioner. 2)The husband did not pursue livestock operation on the farm for a number of reasons. In addition his financial circumstances became even worse in 1994 and as result he made voluntary assignment into bankruptcy on February 14, 1994. As a result of the bankruptcy it is simply not possible to determine at this point in time how much either of the parties can hope to recover from the equal division of the property pursuant to The Matrimonial Property Act. However, counsel for the husband suggested that include all of the assets in my order dividing the assets down to the sum of $42,400. The wife was to be given 56% of the estimated asset value and 44% to the husband. 3)The petitioner did not take up farming and his subsequent decision to assign into bankruptcy made the calculation of what each hopes to recover to the detriment of the wife problematic at best.  4)The wife became entitled to the following set-off to be included in her share: 5)The respondent's share of the proceeds of the sale shall be reduced by the value of the 1990 Oldsmobile which fix for this purpose at $9,000 in order to achieve a 50% split of assets to each party in accordance with the Act. The petitioner's action as contrary to my order do not condemn him for it because it is clear did not consider at the time that he required income to live on and the barley fell into that category. In any event he paid one half the net proceeds to his wife which covered the maintenance payments ordered for November, December, January and $300 for March, April and May for total of $4,100."

The bankrupt contended that s241 of the Income Tax Act prohibits disclosure of tax information concerning both the bankrupt's common law spouse and the company of which she was sole director and shareholder. The second preliminary issue raised was that portions of an affidavit were based upon information and belief as opposed to personal knowledge as required by Queen's Bench Rule 319 for a final matter. HELD: A conditional order of discharge issued requiring the bankrupt to pay $1,750 from any source to the trustee by monthly installments of $100 per month. Judgment interest would accrue on any arrears.  1)This discharge hearing related to Nick Morin. The relevance of the tardiness in remitting goods and services tax of his common law spouse's company was questionable. The information was confidential and disclosure would be improper for these proceedings. The principle and exemption contained in s295(5)(a) of the Excise tax Act would not allow disclosure of goods and services tax remittances in these proceedings. 2)None of the alleged facts raised pursuant to ss173(1)(a),(b),(d),(f) and (m) were proved. It was not proven as outlined in s173(1)(f) that the bankrupt put them through unnecessary expenses by a frivolous and vexatious defence to the action. The conclusion of the investigation conducted by the RCMP as a result of the superintendent's investigation order was that the evidence would not support a successful prosecution.","The bankrupt applied for a conditional order of discharge under Queen's Bench Rule 319. The bankrupt contended that the facts under s. 173(1)(a) of the Income Tax Act conflicted with his claim of $58,720 for unpaid personal income tax. He argued that the failure of his former business, Red Bull Enterprises Ltd., was caused by protracted dispute with the Department of Highways over the right of Red Bull to occupy land owned by Highways. He claimed that the business failure combined with pressure from creditors such as the Michaluk's caused him to look at bankruptcy as the only alternative. HELD: The discharge order was granted. 1)The bankrupt's evidence was that it was their own fault he stopped making payments because they didn't do what he wanted them to do. The'my way or the door way' attitude is nothing more than bullying tactic used by the bankrupt to justify his failure to honour an agreement.  2)Reasons for the automatic discharge of the bankrupt were not satisfied. 3)The court was not satisfied that any of the facts had been proved."

The appellant argues that without expert evidence called by the Crown to prove it was not possible for the appellant to have swerved in the manner he testified to create the same physical evidence shown in the photographs, the Crown has failed to prove that the appellant drove through the stop sign. In other words, the trial judge could not simply rely on his own experience to find that the appellant could not have been able to manoeuvre the minivan in the way he described.

The court however reduced the damages by $16,500 as it disagreed with the trial judge's determination regarding mitigation of damages. Appeal allowed to the extent of reducing the damages from $165,000 to $148,500.","This was an appeal from an assessment of damages in a wrongful dismissal action brought against Saskatchewan Transportation Company by Leo Larsen, its former president and chief executive officer. For the most part we can find no tenable basis for concluding that the award of damages was inordinately high. The trial judge assessed the damages on the general principles, first, that the object of these awards is to compensate for the loss of income sustained in consequence of the wrongful dismissal; second, that their measure is prima facie the amount that would have been earned had the employment continued subject to deduction of such amounts as in the ensuing months are either earned or should be earned in light of the duty upon persons suffering losses to keep them to minimum. The salary was calculated on the premise his annual salary was $102,000, not $110,000. He resisted the attribution on pragmatic grounds, arguing that the company had not paid him any salary; that there was no guarantee the company was going to earn profit; that it needed working capital; and so on. Awarding the sum of $165,000 to Larsen for the purpose of mitigation, that he was entitled at common law to disregard all but his year of service with STC, and to reduce his loss accordingly, was an error."
9_2008skqb429.txt,"FIAT: The plaintiff seeks an order confirming the order nisi for judicial sale. HELD: Application dismissed. The Court will not set aside the order nisi for judicial sale on the basis that the application for leave was premature or that the statement of claim was not noted for default. However, the application for confirmation of the sale is premature as the property is to be listed for 6 months. There does not appear on the evidence to be a sale to be confirmed. The plaintiff is prepared to make an offer, but does not appear to have done so. The draft bill of costs submitted contains numerous items which occurred prior to the granting of leave and there is no order from the Court authorizing pre-leave costs, nor any evidence as to why the Court might consider pre-leave costs. On a renewed application for confirmation of judicial sale, it would be preferable to have evidence directly from the listing agent setting out the steps taken to market the property and detailing for the Court any offers received. There will be no costs awarded for this unsuccessful application.","FIAT: The defendants entered into a mortgage with the plaintiff on April 14, 2005 for land described as: Lot 4, Block 17. The mortgage was renewed for a year period with a maturity date of March 14, 2008. This was not in compliance with s. 3(2) of the Act which prescribes that an application may be brought after the expiration of 30 clear days from the date of service on the Provincial Mediation Board. The plaintiff applied ex parte for an appointment to hear an application for leave to commence an action under the Land Contracts (Actions) Act. HELD: The application for confirmation of the sale is premature as the property is to be listed for six months, and on the basis that there is no sale to be confirmed based on the evidence filed.

3_1998canlii14061.txt,"FIAT. SaskPower sought an order pursuant to Queen's Bench Rule 547 to require the plaintiffs to post security for costs on the ground Wind Power was a non-resident plaintiff with little or no assets in the province of Saskatchewan. HELD: The motion was dismissed.  1)Rule 547 is limited to cases where the plaintiff is a non-resident or where the defendant is given a statutory right to apply. Wind Power is an Alberta company extra-provincially registered in Saskatchewan. Dove Industries, a Saskatchewan company incorporated specifically to develop a pilot project in Saskatchewan which did not proceed, had shareholders in the province. 2)Given the amount of the claim against SaskPower in the amount of $6,400,000 and the significant claim for costs in excess of $50,000 the Court would have granted the security for costs but for the delay by SaskPower in bringing its application. The action was commenced in April 1996. Unexplained delay by a defendant in seeking security for costs will prevent the grant of an order. To make an award for security for costs at this stage would place a burden on the plaintiffs and possibly prevent the action from taking place at the scheduled time.  3)The plaintiff was awarded one set of costs in any event of the cause.","FIAT. The defendant sought an order pursuant to Queen's Bench Rule 547 requiring the plaintiffs to post security for costs in this action on the ground that it was a non-resident plaintiff with little or no assets in the province of Saskatchewan and Dove Industries was incorporated specifically for a wind power demonstration project which did not succeed (and which is related to the subject matter of this action) and accordingly has little or any assets in Saskatchewan. HELD: The plaintiff shall have one set of costs of the application in any event of this kind. 1)There are appropriate circumstances to deny the defendant an order that the plaintiffs post security at this stage against either or both of the plaintiffs. 2)There is a significant factor that precludes the Court from making that kind of order. It has been held that the common law has not been supplanted entirely by the rule. The court is still permitted to invoke its inherent jurisdiction to regulate its own procedure by ordering security for the costs in instances not covered by the Rule. 3)In the present case, the amount of the claim against SaskPower was $6,400,000 and the significant claim for costs which could be awarded to it in the event of successful defence was in excess of $55,000. 4)The fact that the application was not made until now would have left the plaintiffs with the distinct possibility that, ultimately, the court was not going to be asked by SaskPower to have them furnish security. 5)There were appropriate circumstances, per Grotsky J., in Thole v. McKenna, supra, to allow the plaintiff within time to be limited by the court to give security for its costs in such amount and in such manner and form as the court may direct."
d_2009skqb517.txt,"Counsel for the plaintiffs brings two notices of motion seeking 1) the opportunity to cross-examine a deponent on her affidavit and 2) an order to compel one of defendants to supply pre-certification notices to all persons who may be eligible to participate in the class action that is contemplated. HELD: The motions are dismissed with no order as to costs.  1) One of defendants contends that 7 people alleged by the plaintiffs to be viable class members have already entered into a full and final settlement with the defendant. This defendant earlier sought to examine these individuals. The Justice of this action at that time did not allow the examination but instead made an order permitting the defendant to file affidavits on the issue. This is the source of the affidavit the plaintiff seeks cross-examination on. The order also allowed the plaintiffs to file reply affidavits, which they chose not to do. There is nothing in the original order that could be interpreted as saying that the plaintiffs could cross-examine on the affidavit. In the view of the Court, having chosen not to file reply affidavits pursuant to the original order, it is not reasonable for plaintiff's counsel to embark on a totally different approach several weeks after the deadline has passed. There is also some concern that the actual purpose of the proposed cross-examination would be more general and broad-ranging than a mere challenge to the defendant's assertion that the individuals at issue have already entered into full and final settlements with the defendant.  2) In its barest sense, plaintiffs' counsel requests that the defendant supply a plaintiff by way of sending pre-certification notices to its clients. The Court is aware of Lewis v. Shell, where an Ontario court ordered notice to potential class members. However, that case is not similar to this case. In the Lewis case, the Court was faced with concern over the defendant contacting individuals who might be potential class members for the purpose of obtaining early settlements. Moreover, the Ontario class actions legislation is less restrictive than Saskatchewan's. The section of the Class Action Act which may permit such an order refer to a 'class action,' not an 'action.' As this case is still in the pre-certification stage, it is not yet a class action within the meaning of the Act. Spavier v. Canada also indicates that pre-certification motions of this sort would rarely be successful in this jurisdiction.","The plaintiff brought a motion pursuant to s. 12 of The Class Proceedings Act of Ontario for an order compelling the defendant to produce a list of proposed class members who had been provided with a letter and related package by the defendant (relating to a test of their premises for contamination). The defendant moved to dismiss the claim on the basis that there was no plaintiff named in the statement of claim who purchased Holguin vacation package from the plaintiff. The Plaintiffs opposed the motion. If the motion succeeds, the action will be dismissed against Red Seal only. The plaintiff seeks to have Red Seal send out the above notice and provide proof that the notice was sent out in compliance with anticipated order. HELD: The application for examination is dismissed. 1) The wording of s. 14 and s. 24 of the Class Actions Act creates a concern about the suspension of time limitations. 2) There is no Saskatchewan authority for the proposition that the limitation is suspended only if the action is certified as a class action. It would appear that the court was concentrating more on common law regarding preliminary conflict objections. It is not in my view open to the plaintiffs make use of either section at this time.  3) In the case of Sparvier vs Canada 2006 SKQB 533 (CanLII), the court reviewed the words of s14 and s24 of the Act and concluded that there have not been any previous cases in which plaintiff was allowed to cross examine defendant on an affidavit. 4) The Court was not prepared to broaden the scope of Ottenbreit J.’s decision to allow for examination of Ms. Moore. 5) In Pearson vs Inco, the Court was faced with concern over the defendant contacting individuals who might be potentially class members for the purpose of obtaining early settlements. That is not the situation here."
d_2010skca52.txt,"The appellant contests an order for $600.00 monthly spousal support given by a Chambers judge on an application to review a previous order which granted the respondent $300.00 monthly spousal support for a period of 1 year. The parties were married for 24 years following a 2-year period of cohabitation. They have 2 adult children, one of which is largely supported by the appellant. Both parties have some health problems. Originally, the appellant was ordered to pay the respondent $300.00 in monthly spousal support for a period of 1 year. Given the appellant's health difficulties and the fact that he was nearing retirement, the trial judge noted that the respondent would do well to become self-sufficient as soon as possible. The Chambers judge who reviewed the original order found that, during the year period the respondent was collecting spousal support, she had not engaged in any gainful employment. She had sold her house and used the proceeds to spend over 4 months living in Hawaii and Jamaica. She obtained probationary employment just after filing a notice of motion but lost the job before the hearing commenced. HELD: The appeal is allowed, the orders of the Chambers judge for spousal support and costs against the appellant are set aside. The Chambers judge imputed an income of $14,289 to the respondent on the basis that she was capable of working 30 hours per week at minimum wage. He did not indicate why he did not find her capable of full time employment. The Chambers judge made an error in calculating the income of the appellant. He also discounted the expenses borne by the appellant in relation the maintenance of their adult child, who was a full-time student. It was incumbent on the respondent to establish that she was unable to become self-sufficient. The evidence did not begin to establish that and, in fact, clearly showed that she made little effort to do so within the year allocated by the trial judge.","Division of matrimonial property and spousal maintenance. The parties separated in 2003 after 24 years of marriage following two years of cohabitation. At the time of the judgment, the appellant was 60 years old and the respondent was 53. They had two adult children, born in 1984 and 1989 respectively. The respondent had taken a buyout of her pension and job in exchange for $35,000. She was disabled and did not know when she would be able to work 40 hours per week. HELD: Appeal allowed orally from the bench for the reasons set out. 1) The evidence before Sandomirsky J. established that during the year following the one year order of Ottenbreit J. the respondent had not engaged in any gainful employment at all. She had sold her house and used the proceeds to spend over four months out of Canada, living in Hawaii part of the time and spending a month-long vacation in Jamaica. She paid for her adult children to visit her. Finally, on April 14, 2009, she commenced employment at Westfair Foods in a probationary position. This was after the 1 year spousAL maintenance order had expired and only few days prior to filing the application to review that order and to award to her substantial support. Prior to the hearing of her application, she lost this position and said in her affidavits, filed in support of the application, that she was 'disabled and still receiving treatments' and that she had sought permanent full time employment but had been unable to receive any offers of employment. She filed no medical evidence to indicate she was unable to work nor did she say that she could not work. In fact, she indicated she was seeking a full time position. 2) The respondent imputed an income to the respondent of $14,289 based on the assumption she was capable of working 30 hours week at minimum wage. He did not indicate why he did not find her capable of full-time employment. He found the appellant's income to be $38,964.37. The evidence did not begin to establish that and, in fact, clearly showed she had made no effort at all to do so within the year allocated by the order and prior to the filing of the notice of motion, and little effort between that time and the application."

HELD: The application was dismissed. 1)Nothing which has come before the Court since the Subpoena was quashed (or at any time) supports those beliefs expressed by the applicant. No likelihood has been established that Mr. Redling will provide any evidence concerning the investigation into the conduct of any other party which would be relevant or material to the issues raised by to the Charter motions. 2)Nothing has come to the Court with respect to the search and seizure of the evidence which has been provided by the OSB and the RCMP in the course of their investigation is likely to affect Mr. Black's rights with regard to the charges against him.  3) Nothing which has appeared before the court since the SCC was made quashed or at any other time has supported those beliefs. Nothing has been shown to support those beliefs or that any lack of vigorous investigation into activities of other persons involved in the NsC bankruptcy or deflected suspicion of wrongdoing to him. Nothing is known about the RCMP officers involved who were involved with the RCMP during the investigation of the bankruptcy of the corporation. There is no basis to find that they were likely to provide any additional information concerning that issue.  4)The applicant was not satisfied on the balance of probabilities that the RCMP officer who was Superintendent was likely to have any further information concerning the issue. The testimony and documentation presented by RCMP officers and the documents to which they referred raise issues which warrant compelling the officer's attendance.  5)The application could be characterized as a request for a re-consideration of the decision to quash the subpoena. The applicant had not met the onus which rests upon him to satisfy the Court on the probabilities that Redling has relevant and material evidence to give concerning the issues presented by the charter Motions.
d_2006nsca124.txt,"The accused successfully challenged the sufficiency of the grounds to issue a search warrant that was used to search her residence. Although the Information to Obtain was based on information from an anonymous, unproven source, the source's information was corroborated by independent information as to the accused's employment and residence. The only corroboration of the presence of a crime (a suspected marijuana grow operation) was from a FLIR test. The court found that the evidence did not rise above the level of suspicion, albeit strong suspicion. Corroboration of the employment and residence of the accused did not provide particular support for the informant's credibility; neither were results of the FLIR test and the presence of covered windows sufficient corroboration. The Crown appealed. Appeal allowed; new trial ordered. Although the trial judge articulated the proper test and began by analyzing whether the warrant could have been issued, the issue was later mistakenly transformed into whether he, himself, would have issued it. By weighing the probative evidence, the trial judge effectively substituted his views for those of the issuing justice and wrongly required the issuing justice to draw proper inferences as opposed to reasonable inferences.","The Crown appealed the validity of the search warrant, alleging that it was issued without sufficient information. The judge agreed and quashed the warrant. This rendered the search unlawful and thereby a presumptive breach of the respondent's Charter rights. Consequently the judge excluded the evidence obtained in the search. The Crown appealed. HELD: The appeal was allowed and a new trial ordered. 1) The judge's interpretation or application of the standard upon which he was to review the decision to issue the warrant was an error of law. 2) There was no breach of s. 8 of the Charter and no basis on which to exclude the fruits of the trial. 3) The evidence obtained by the search was wrongly excluded and had it been admitted, the result would not necessarily have been the same."
b_2012skqb252.txt,"The tenants appealed a decision of a hearing officer under s. 72 of The Residential Tenancies Act. The hearing officer determined that the landlord's claim for non-payment of rent had been established and that an order for possession as warranted. The hearing officer directed that the order of possession would be deferred if the tenant paid the rent that was owing and future rent. The tenants argued that the hearing officer erred in not considering that the premises were infested with bed bugs and the tenants had been forced to incur personal expense to remedy the problem. They sought to adduce new evidence by affidavit on this point at the appeal. HELD: The Court declined to admit the affidavit evidence about bed bugs. However, the matter was remitted to the hearing officer for rehearing because the reasons provided by the hearing officer were deficient. The Court held that it was impossible to tell whether the hearing officer considered the tenants' evidence at the hearing, made findings of fact in that regard or whether equitable jurisdiction should be invoked in this situation. The reasons are inadequate to allow a meaningful review of the decision.","The tenants appeal the decision of a hearing officer under s. 72 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006. They contend the hearing officer, who rendered her decision on May 31, 2012, committed several errors of law and seek to have the matter remitted back for re-hearing. HELD: The appeal is allowed. The decision of the Hearing officer is set aside and the matter returned to the Hearing Officer for a rehearing of the matter. 1) The Court must bear in mind that it is commonplace among judicial and quasi-judicial decision-makers, whether explicitly or implicitly required to give reasons setting forth the facts and explaining the basis for their decisions, to refer to those portions of the evidence bearing upon fact in controversy, particularly those portions with opposing force or weight, for it is here where the case on the facts rises or falls on balance. The mere failure to mention particular portion of evidence, then, does not in itself amount to disregard or oversight. The court must bear this factor in mind when reviewing the legality of decisions and conclusions reached by the Rentalsman. The tenants sought to file affidavit evidence in support of their appeal. As s 72 appeal is an appeal on the record, affidavit evidence, as general rule, is inadmissible.  2) Having concluded the appeal should succeed for the reasons given, the court found it unnecessary to determine if it erred in not considering the tenant's and the landlord's applications at the same time. The Act addresses powers, procedure, evidentiary issues and to some extent scheduling, in sections 73-78."
9_2006skca114.txt,"This is an application for leave to appeal, and leave being granted, an appeal by the Crown from a sentence imposed against a young offender pursuant to the Youth Criminal Justice Act. The respondent pled guilty to a charge of robbery, an offence contrary to s. 344(b) of the Criminal Code. The respondent was sentenced to 90 days secure custody, 45 days community supervision, 1 year probation and a 10 year firearms prohibition. HELD: Appeal allowed orally. The sentence is set aside and a sentence of 12 months closed custody, 6 months community supervision, 1 year probation and a 10 year firearms prohibition was imposed in addition to the 90 days closed custody already served at the time of the appeal.  1) It was clear that the primary concern of the sentencing judge was that, in the wake of the Supreme Court of Canada decision in R. v. B.W.P.; R. v. B.V.N. 2006 SCC 27, a custodial sentence might not be open to him at all. It is the Court's view that the sentencing judge's conclusion that the decision in B.W.P. virtually ruled out custodial sentences for young persons under the Youth Criminal Justice Act was unwarranted. The gist of that decision is that under the Act the principle of general deterrence is not a factor to be taken into account and cannot be used to justify a sentence harsher than the circumstances of the offender and the offence would warrant. Nor is specific deterrence to be considered as a separate factor. 2) It is the Court's view that a long custodial sentence is necessary to accomplish the task of bringing the seriousness of the offence to the respondent's attention, and provide meaningful consequences to reinforce societal values without negatively affecting the respondent's likelihood of rehabilitation.","This was an application for leave to appeal and, leave being granted, an appeal by the Crown from a sentence imposed against a young offender pursuant to the Youth Criminal Justice Act, S.C. 2002, c.1.

The sentencing judge relied solely on the principle of rehabilitation, essentially ignoring the other sentencing principles including the level of gravity, the principle of deterrence, the need to denounce such acts, the sentence imposed on the co-accused, and the need to protect the public. A sentencing circle was inappropriate given the level of violence, his risk to re-offend, his consistent ignoring or refusal to follow court orders, and the fact that a penitentiary term was called for in such circumstances.

Application for summary judgment granted; application for interim payment dismissed. There was no 'air of reality' to the defendant's defence; whether or not the plaintiff's brake lights were working, to strike her vehicle from behind on these facts meant that the defendant was either travelling too close or didn't have enough care and control of his vehicle. The plaintiff was making a significant claim for damages but she suffered from numerous previous injuries and conditions relating to her health; any damage assessment would depend largely upon credibility and the medical evidence at trial; to assess interim damages in this case would be a most difficult task and would only be a haphazard guess. The plaintiff's claim was also complicated by the fact that it could possibly be subject to the 'minor injury' cap on damages.","This was an application for summary judgment pursuant to Civil Procedure Rule 13.01 and an interim payment under the Civil Procedure Rules 31.01. The plaintiff was operating her motor vehicle and said in her affidavit that she was struck from behind by one of the Defendants named in the motor vehicle accident. The defendant argued there was an 'air of reality' to the plaintiff's argument. Judgment was entered against the defendant as to liability with damages to be assessed.  1) The plaintiff's damage claim is further complicated in this particular matter as a result of the defendant's failure to disclose that he has a bonafide defence or at least an arguable issue to be tried. 2) There has to be an air of reality to the defendant’s argument. If the brake lights did not work then the defendant drove straight into the rear of the plaintiff and her vehicle was stopped as well. There was conflict in her evidence about depression and other problems she was having with her mental health in the report of Doctor Watt. 3) Serious issues exist between the parties as to whether or not the plaintiff”s injuries had resulted in any on going inability of her to work in any capacity. As well there is a question as to her claim involving loss of valuable service as well as whether the amount claimed is appropriate when the plaintiff stated in discovery that she had been able to do some housework and did so. 4) There is an air to the defence that the plaintiff stopped abruptly, without more by way of supporting facts, lacks a reality. The bald statement in the pleadings does not disclose the existence of an actual or probable defence and cannot fend off an application to summary judgment.  5) The evidence submitted by the plaintiff had to be read without the benefit of any examination or cross examination before the Court in an attempt to decide what was likely to be recovered. The court must also be aware of the comments made by MacKeigan C.J.N.S. in Wilson v. Deamond. 689 at para. 5. 6. 7) The Court must be aware that the defendant argues there has yet to even be an independent medical examination of the victim.

9_2012skpc49.txt,"The accused plead guilty to two counts of sexual assault. The victims were his granddaughters. The assaults were alleged to have occurred between 1983 and 1991. A sentencing hearing was held because there was significant disagreement on the facts. The Crown alleged three aggravating factors: 1) that the sexual assaults were numerous, 2) that the accused touched the victims directly on their skin and not just on their clothing and 3) that there was digital penetration by the accused on both victims. HELD: At a sentencing hearing, the Crown must prove aggravating factors beyond a reasonable doubt. The Court held that the two victims were sexually assaulted by the accused on numerous occasions over a period of a number of years. The Court was satisfied these sexual assaults were a common occurrence on every occasion that the accused was in the company of his granddaughters. The Court found that the accused touched the victims under their clothing on numerous occasions and that there were a couple of occasions that the accused digitally penetrated each victim. Finally, the Court concluded that the accused got bolder over time and took more liberties and chances with his victims.","The accused was charged as follows: that between January 1, 1983 and December 31, 1991, at Willow Bunch, Saskatchewan and Winnipeg, Manitoba, did commit sexual assaults on Leanne Eger contrary to provisions of the Criminal Code; that between 1989 and December 1991, Winnipeg and Regina did commit acts of sexual assault on the same girl contrary to the provisions; that there was digital penetration by the accused. HELD: The Court held that the Crown had proved beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused's conduct was not an isolated incident or even restricted to few occasions. The evidence establishes that the abuse occurred over several years, many times. The test is not the number of times digital penetration occurred. The victims have no doubt recalled the incidents of digital penetration as this more severe abuse would stand out from other occasions.

The driver was found guilty of possession for the purpose of trafficking. The trafficking charge against him was judicially stayed. HELD: An order of forfeiture issued pursuant to s.16(1). The application for relief was dismissed. 1)It was not necessary to address the Charter submissions with respect to s.19(3) because Crown counsel consented to the respondent's application being viewed as an application for relief from forfeiture under s.20. 2)It was impossible to conclude the respondent 'appeared innocent of any complicity' in the offence for which the driver was convicted and that she 'exercised all reasonable care to be satisfied' that the Lincoln was not likely to be used in the commission of the offence. 3)Section 11 of the Charter applies only when person has been charged with an offence. There was no charge against the respondent at this time. 4)The Act distinguishes between three types of persons who might own, or have an interest in, conveyance which is 'offence-related property': the interest of person convicted of the offence is forfeitable pursuant to s.16(1); if the person has been neither convicted nor charged and appears innocent of any complicity in the offence; someone charged with the offence which gave rise to the forfeiture application (as here). The forfeiture is not, except with respect to an offender, arbitrary. In view of the provisions available under the Act to obtain relief from forfeiture it cannot be concluded that empowering a court to grant an order of forfeiture constitutes cruel or unusual punishment.",The Crown applied pursuant to s. 16(1) of the Controlled Drug and Substances Act for an order forfeiting the Lincoln to Her Majesty in Right of Canada. The registered owner of the vehicle was charged with trafficking in marijuana and possession of marihuana for the purpose of trafficking. Fair was found guilty of possession of marijuana for the purposes of trafficking and the other charge against him was judicially stayed. The Crown appealed. HELD: The Crown's application was dismissed. 1) Section 20(4) does not require the applicant to prove either beyond a reasonable doubt her innocence of any complicity in the designated substance offence and that she exercised all reasonable care to be satisfied that the property was not likely to be used in connection with the commission of the offence. 2) Section 19(3) provides the court with the authority to make an order of relief from forfeiture. There is no evidence adduced at trial to rebut the foregoing testimony. 3) The Crown did not dispute the assertion by the Crown that the Lincoln was within the definition of 'offence-related property'.

For the respondent, that the Education Act requires a request be made of the Minister in proper form and receive Governor in Council approval.

d_2005nsca104.txt,"The son of unmarried parents, who had graduated from high school, was working part-time, living with his mother and had not made a final decision on a further course of study sustained a serious brain injury just a few months after his 19th birthday. He required extensive rehabilitation and would not regain his pre-accident physical and intellectual capacity. The mother successfully applied for a reinstatement of child support which had been discontinued by consent, pre-accident, when the son was residing with the father. The son, now 23 years old, was upgrading his high school marks at the time of the hearing and hoped to be admitted to a community college program. The father appealed. Appeal dismissed; the judge's decision to award support was not premised upon a finding that, pre-accident, the son had made a clear decision to pursue a further course of study but on the fact that the son intended to pursue his education and had not withdrawn from parental charge at the time of the accident. There was no evidence to support the allegation that the usual Guideline amount was 'inappropriate' in this case; the Act prohibited the consideration of public income assistance when fixing child support; given the uncertainty about the son's future, this was not an appropriate case for a time-limited order.","This was an appeal from an order made pursuant to the Maintenance and Custody Act requiring the appellant father to pay child support for his son, who was over the age of majority, to remain dependent for maintenance purposes, even though not actually attending an educational institution. HELD: The appeal was dismissed with costs payable by the father to Ms. Davis in the amount of $2,000. The court was not persuaded there was any evidentiary basis upon which the judge could conclude that the Guideline amount was 'inappropriate' and therefore depart from it. He did not err. The wording of certain grounds of appeal presume an interpretation of the Judge's decision which is not supported on careful reading of the judgment."

Dismissing the application, that (1) pursuant to s. 32 of the Charter, the Charter did not apply to these employees since the university was not a subordinate body of government, and was not being controlled by government, but was an independent institution; the fact that the university's governing statute provided that teaching staff were 'deemed to be persons employed in the public service of the Province' for the purposes of their pension plan did not constitute governmental control such as to warrant the application of the Charter; and (2) the proper forum for this application was the Human Rights Commission. The court also considered the retroactive effect of the Nova Scotia decision in Sniders v. Nova Scotia (Attorney General), which struck down the provision in the Nova Scotia Human Rights Act precluding anyone 65 years or over from making an age discrimination complaint. The court concluded that the Sniders decision did have a retroactive effect to the date when s. 15 of the Charter came into force.","This was an application under s15(1), 24(1) and 52(2) of the Charter of Rights and Freedoms for:(a) an order declaring that the mandatory retirement of the applicants by the respondent is invalid and infringes, denies and is inconsistent with the applicants' rights as guaranteed under the Charter and that the applicants be reinstated as full time members of the Faculty of the respondent immediately and that they pay all compensation due to them as employees since the date of their mandatory retirement plus interest, and(b) costs of this proceeding."
1991canlii4370.txt,"The defendant lawyer was retained for the purpose of obtaining and disbursing mortgage funds. The plaintiffs, creditors of the defendant's client, sued the defendant for negligent misrepresentation, breach of trust and breach of undertaking. The defendant initially received three irrevocable letters of direction for payment of amounts owing on a construction project. When the project got into financial difficulty the defendant advised his client to seek separate counsel to deal with the creditors - suppliers. At a creditors meeting the defendant advised the creditors' counsel of the initial three letters of direction. The project was considered viable by the creditors and continued, with the defendant obtaining postponements of the three letters of direction. Further creditors' meetings were held, a Creditors' Committee struck, and subsequent letters of direction sent to the defendant by the client and certain creditors. The defendant, in acknowledging a subsequent letter of direction, made no mention of the earlier three letters, nor any explanation of 'all of the proceeds'. One member of the Committee was aware of the initial irrevocable letters of direction. On what was to be the final mortgage draw, the defendant requested and was refused a postponement of the initial three letters. With his client's consent, the defendant disbursed the funds, to pay off the initial three creditors, a mechanics' lien referred in one of the subsequent letters of direction, his legal fees and the balance as per a letter of direction received from two of three members of the Creditors' Committee. Dismissing the action, that (1) there was no negligent misrepresentation as the creditors had continued to advance supplies, not on the basis of the defendant's letter of acknowledgement, but because they considered the project viable. Further, certain other plaintiffs were not aware of the letter, and could not have relied on it. Other plaintiffs did not supply after the letter and therefore did not rely on it. The Court noted that on a balance of probabilities, the defendant's disbursement did not cause the demise of the project. At the time of the disbursement the project was still viable and the plaintiffs made their own decision to cease supplying and to lien the project;  (2) there was no breach of trust as the defendant had no fiduciary duty and had at no time acted for the plaintiffs;  and  (3) there was no breach of undertaking as the undertaking must be considered in all the circumstances, including knowledge of the plaintiffs, the other letters and meetings. The Court concluded that the member of the Creditors' Committee who was aware of the initial irrevocable letters had a duty to advise the other members. The documentation was clear that legal fees would be deducted and the Committee was also aware of the direction to pay the mechanics' lien.","The plaintiff sought to have the defendant's solicitor disburse funds from mortgage draws, insurance claims and rentals from two mortgage brokers to the project. The first mortgagee, the second mortgagee of the project, had become dissatisfied with the handling of the mortgage draws by one of the principals of and was withdrawing its support. In early 1987, the defendant received a number of irrevocable letters of direction, which he acknowledged, requiring him to pay the proceeds from mortgage draw or advances in particular manner. The applicant sought postponements of the drawings and received a letter from the solicitor requesting that the funds be disbursed to other creditors. Dismissing the application, that the plaintiff had not established the basis for a claim under breach of trust and could not succeed on this ground."
b_2018skqb197.txt,"HELD: The court sentenced the accused to a global sentence of 10 years for the manslaughter conviction. A one-year concurrent sentence was imposed for the conviction of prohibited possession of a firearm. The court gave him credit at the rate of 1:1.5 for his time on remand, resulting in a net global sentence of six years, five months to be served in a federal penitentiary. The Gladue report was considered and the background of the accused was assessed as an enormous mitigating factor. The court found that this was not an appropriate case to make an order pursuant to s. 743.6 of the Code both because of the multiple Gladue factors and because it had addressed the principles of denunciation and deterrence in the global sentence.","HELD: The Court found the accused guilty of second degree murder but guilty of manslaughter. The sentencing decision was with regard to both the manslaughter conviction pursuant to s. 236(a) of the Criminal Code and his guilty plea to possession of a firearm while prohibited from doing so. The accused had an extensive criminal record including 57 prior convictions of which were for violent offences. Notwithstanding that firearm prohibition, the accused willingly accepted a firearm from a niece to hunt rabbits and prairie chicken. He displayed a complete lack of remorse. The Court reviewed all of the cases provided to it by counsel and found that a global sentence of 10 years was appropriate in this case to be served in a federal institution. The Crown appealed the sentence appeal. HELD: 1) Although the Crown provided the Court with multiple cases, the Court was prepared to impose a concurrent sentence of 1 year to the ten year sentence the Court had imposed for the manslaughter convictions. 2) The Crown suggested that the Court should allow the CSC to do their work without being impeded by the Court's arbitrary imposition of such an order that would result in Gordon not being eligible for parole until he had served half of his sentence. 3) The court reviewed the three cases the Crown presented to the Court by counsel but, in particular, the three case of Stonechild, which were referred to in support of its position that a 15 year sentence was appropriate."

The original corollary relief was made in 1989. An application for variation was dismissed in 1993 except that an order suspending the enforcement of the arrears during the times the respondent was unemployed was granted. The petitioner who had custody of the children and resided in Manitoba was employed. She requested that the matter be dealt with summarily on affidavit evidence and did not want a trial of the issue. HELD: The respondent was to pay $300 per month per child in the months when his gross earnings are $2,200 or greater and $150 per month per child when they are less. Arrears were reduced by $7,000. When he earned more than $2,200 per month he was to pay $200 per month on arrears in addition to the on-going child support obligation. The 1993 order was continued and it was further ordered that the respondent file quarterly a financial statement or cheque stubs evidencing his income with the maintenance enforcement office. 1)There was a significant reduction in the respondent's income since 1994, therefore there was a material change in circumstances. 2)The respondent had not provided specific information about the number of months he was in receipt of social assistance. It was clear, however, that his income during 1995 and 1996 did not allow him to meet his support obligations. Since his employment was uncertain a flexible order was appropriate.","The father applied to reduce the amount of on-going maintenance for his 2 daughters and to reduce arrears of approximately $14,600.

However, the photographs graphically depict the extent to which his appearance was altered. Hurt feelings can reasonably be inferred from the fact that the plaintiff was rendered unconscious on the ground in a crowd of onlookers.

They had resided with their grandmother for most of their lives and it was important to maintain their relationships with their school and friends.

b_1999canlii12595.txt,"The applicant applies for amendment of the judgment dated March 19, 1999 as it relates to costs. At the end of trial, the applicant requested the Court to reserve on the matter of costs. The applicant intended to make a submission for award of solicitor and clients costs. Evidence was led at trial about insubstantial offers made directly between the parties. Further evidence now indicates that substantial offers were made through council although not led at trial. The applicant argues that solicitor and client costs of $70,000 should be awarded because the offer to settle of $250,000 is close to the total judgment award of $230,000 including party and party costs of $20,000. The respondent takes the position that the estate was willing to pay reasonable maintenance costs and the quantum of maintenance could have been summarily determined without the necessity of extensive discoveries and without a lengthy trial. The respondent submits the approach of a needs-based assessment was upheld by the judgment and is always the approach always taken on behalf of the estate. The respondent argues the real question is whether the parties were acting bona fide during their negotiations and the issue should not be determined on the basis of the closeness of the offers. HELD: Solicitor and Client Costs of $70,000 are not appropriate in this case. The applicant's conduct was not entirely pure. The applicant was made aware in a prior judgment that under The Dependants' Relief Act there is nothing to indicate that a person is entitled to part of an estate as a beneficiary but rather that a beneficiary is entitled to maintenance. In spite of this ruling the applicant continued to claim the whole of the estate and to pursue full disclosure of the financial worth of the estate. Solicitor and client costs are within the discretion of the court but such discretion is exercise only in rare and exceptional circumstances. The conduct of the respondent cannot be characterized as reprehensible, scandalous or outrageous. The respondent's unwillingness to make full financial disclosure did contribute to the increase of costs but is insufficient to merit full solicitor and client costs. The Court awards fixed costs to the applicant in the amount of $47,000 together with disbursements.","The applicant applies for an amendment of the judgment of March 19, 1999. At the conclusion of trial, counsel requested that costs be paid on the basis of Column IV, Schedule 1B of the Tariff of Costs of The Queen's Bench Rules. It is now clear that the applicant intended to make a submission for award of solicitor and client costs of approximately $70,000. Evidence was led at trial about insubstantial offers made directly between the parties. The further evidence showed that substantial offers were made through counsel although that evidence was not before the Court at trial. The applicant argued that the court needed to know the full extent of the estate so as to properly determine the applicant's entitlement to the estate. This argument cannot be accepted. The court has an inherent power to vary its own order so that to carry out what was intended or even to reconsider or withdraw the decision so long as the order has not been perfected. Rule 343A contemplates amendment of judgment in these circumstances. There is a substantial monetary difference between the party and party costs awarded in the judgment, and the solicitor and clients costs claimed by the applicant. This contributed to the respondent's unwillingness to disclose the financial worth of his estate and prolonged the litigation and as such should be factor into the costs awarded."

The wife disagreed and a trial of this issue was directed and determined in the husband's favour. The wife appealed. HELD: Appeal allowed.  1)Since the judgment of this Court in Childs v. Childs Estate, [1988] 1 W.W.R. 746, there is no doubt that a judge has the power, under Rule 7 of s. 44 of The Queen's Bench Act, R.S.S. 1978, c. Q-1, to enforce or set aside an agreement compromising an action by summary proceedings. The law as stated in that judgment applies as well to agreements or settlements reached during the course of pre-trial conferences. 2)Parties will not usually intend to settle selected issues on a piecemeal basis, but rather will reach tentative agreements on selected issues conditional on an overall settlement agreement being concluded. Such was the parties' intention in this case, and accordingly, there was no settlement contract for the judge in the court below to enforce.  3)This is not to say that parties cannot reach several separate independent, binding and enforceable agreements as part of an effort to reach an overall settlement of the matters in issue between them, but in order to do so, the intention of the parties to settle on a piecemeal or installment basis must be clear. Nothing in the evidence indicated such an intention in this case. 4)In cases of settlement agreements reached at a pre- trial conference, the application to enforce, or to set aside, should be made under Rule 7 of s. 44 of The Queen's Bench Act as was done in Childs and not under Rule 184A as was the developing practice.","This was an appeal from an order that determined, after trial of an issue, that the parties had reached a binding agreement as to the value of the respondent's pension plan during negotiations during a series of pre-trial conferences. HELD: The appeal was allowed from the bench with brief written reasons to follow. 1)The parties had entered into an agreement to divide certain matrimonial property and the fact that there was property in Germany and India as well as in Saskatchewan had complicated matters. 2)The court failed to note that the courts were dealing with complete agreements settling or purporting to settle all aspects of the actions in question."

In the absence of many facts about the circumstances surrounding the accident and the witnesses likely to be called by the defendant, Nova Scotia is the forum conveniens.

HELD: The application was amended to include an additional claim for costs.  1)It was an entirely different question as to what law will apply to a trial in Nova Scotia and, as I have previously stated, the rule is that the substantive law that governs will be the law of the place where the injury occurs. That is the province of Quebec. Counsel are going to have to find some way of not only getting the law but also interpretations of the law, before the Court in the Nova Scotia. do not think you should automatically expect judge presiding at trial in a province where the law is the same."
c_1998canlii12344.txt,"At issue was whether the right of appeal to a board of revision against a municipal tax assessment was exercised properly having regard for s303(1) of the Rural Municipality Act and how and when notice was given. The company posted the notice of appeal by registered mail the day before the expiration of the 20 day appeal period. The notice arrived at the post office on a Friday, the day after the period expired and was picked up by the administrator the following Monday. The Appeals Committee refused to direct the board of revision to hear the appeal on the basis the company failed to give notice within the period prescribed by s303(1) and concluded that the board did not have the power to extend the time. HELD: The appeal was allowed. The board of revision was directed to hear and determine the assessment appeal. 1)The Committee did not err in deciding the prescribed time period for an appeal could not be extended.  2)The less formal expression 'to give notice to' as used in the Act is a less exacting term than 'to serve notice upon'. Wascana Energy exercised its right of appeal properly, or at least effectively, requiring the board of revision to entertain the appeal.","The question was whether the right of appeal to a board of revision against a municipal tax assessment was exercised properly, or at least effectively, having regard for the governing provisions of the statute and the fact of how and when notice of appeal was given. HELD: The appeal from the decision of the Committee was allowed with costs as usual and there was an order directing the board to hear and determine the company's appeal. 1)The phrase'may give notice in writing' must be taken by implication to allow for notice to be given by means of registered mail. If this meaning is imported the necessity of receipt, then this case is indistinguishable from Jordan's case, for only then could there have been a complete failure to exercise the right to appeal within the prescribed period. Nor did any other form of prejudice arise. 2)The essence of the term of subsection 303(1) empowers persons to give notice to, as distinct from requiring them to serve notice upon, the administrator. This is less formal expression suggesting less exacting term. Moreover, it is an Act of such commonplace application as to strongly suggest notice might be given in the disposition of such appeal by the deadline of August 1st. But not every failure to observe statutory requirements of procedural nature carries with it such effects. If the legislature does not expressly provide for the effect of imperfect compliance or noncompliance with requirement of this nature, the matter becomes one of implication."
3_2002skca102.txt,"The accused applied for a stay of proceedings on the ground the Crown failed to provide adequate disclosure. In making disclosure, the Crown appended a copy of the respondent's criminal record to its affidavit. The defence then applied for a stay on the ground of perception of bias on the part of the Provincial Court judge because the respondent's criminal record was before her. The Crown appealed the order which prohibited the judge from continuing as trial judge in respect to the respondent's criminal charges of impaired driving, driving with blood alcohol levels exceeding .08, and dangerous driving. HELD: The appeal was allowed. The order for prohibition was quashed and the matter was remitted to the Provincial Court for trial. There is abundant authority that disclosure of an accused's criminal record to the court alone does not amount to an automatic disqualification of the court on the ground of apprehended bias, appearance of bias or other prejudice to the accused. The judgment in R. v. Peters is almost directly on point. The judge in this case said she had not read the record, she was not biased as a result of the information tendered at the pre-trial proceedings and the record was something she could put out of her mind as she did in all instances where she ruled evidence inadmissible. She was correct in these circumstances to dismiss the application for a stay and to decline to recluse herself.","The accused was charged with impaired driving, driving with a blood-alcohol level exceeding.08, dangerous driving and dangerous driving.

If inadvertent errors should automatically result in termination of proceedings, then more egregious, and perhaps deliberate errors on the part of the Crown, or its witnesses, would necessitate no less result. 3)There was no law which guarantees that inadvertent, inadmissible evidence will not be introduced. Even though the Crown's decision dated December 17, 2001, indicated that it was aware of its existence, the Crown was at fault in this case by filing the affidavit. 4)The appeal was permitted.

The applicant suffered soft tissue injuries to his cervical spine when his vehicle was struck from behind by an uninsured driver. He received a partial income replacement benefit from SGI on the basis he was not able to perform some but not all of his farm duties. HELD: 1)SGI was not entitled to terminate Sawkiw's benefits pursuant to s185(d), (e), (f) or (g). SGI's failure to make a suitable rehabilitation program available to Sawkiw prior to October 1/97 and its failure to reassess his level of income replacement benefits as at September 14 where significant factors contributing to his desperate circumstances. SGI was requiring Sawkiw to attend daily physiotherapy of 3 to 4 hours duration with approximately 2-1/2 hours of additional travel time. It is common knowledge that pain can be exhausting; that daily physiotherapy can be exhausting; that daily travel of 2-1/2 hours can be exhausting; that the physical demands of farming can be exhausting; and, that the mental demands of managing a farm and coordinating and organizing the work of others on a farm can be exhausting. It was far from clear how SGI expected Sawkiw to devote approximately 6 to7 hours per day to his treatment program and still have the mental and physical reserves to devote any time or energy to his farming oprations. He could only reasonably be expected to participate in daily physiotherapy if he was receiving a full, rather than a partial income replacement benefit. 2)The benefits were properly terminated pursuant to s129(1)(e) the first day of his full time employment in Alberta. However, from September 14/97 to the date of termination Sawkiw was entitled to be paid full income replacement benefit without adjustment for a partial return to work. Sawkiw was entitled to the difference and interest from the date such additional benefits should have been paid until the date of this judgment. 3)SGI was to arrange for an assessment by the rehabilitation centre forthwith. If it is found that as a result of the accident Sawkiw is not able to hold the employment he held at the time of the accident, SGI is encouraged to consider his condition as a relapse under s142(1)(a). Under the terms of this judgment the final income replacement benefit will be other than one made pursuant to s139 or 140. 4)Sawkiw was entitled to his solicitor and client costs respecting services rendered and disbursements incurred from the date of filing his notice of motion to the date this judgment is received. He was also entitled to his costs associated with preparing and filing his notice of motion set at $600 being the maximum amount payable under the Personal Injury Benefits Regulations.",HELD: The termination of benefits was made pursuant to s. 185 of The Automobile Accident Insurance Act.

The defendant claimed the contract of employment was all inclusive; that the plaintiff exaggerated the amount of time he spent on the job in winter; that the reduced winter hours were not in lieu of overtime pay as he was a manager within the meaning of s.4(2) of the LSA; the doctrine of estoppel or waiver applied as he never claimed a right to holiday pay for 10 years and the employer relied on his not doing so; if the plaintiff is entitled to holiday pay he should only recover back to April 1990 as he is limited by the Limitation of Actions Act; it should not be based on wages plus truck allowance as wages as defined in the LSA does not include allowances for costs. The claim for unpaid holiday pay claimed from April 1988 to October 1997, based on his wages plus one-half his truck expense allowance, was reserved pending a decision by the Court of Appeal as to whether the Court of Queen's Bench has jurisdiction to determine the issue of entitlement to holiday pay. HELD: The claim was dismissed with costs.  1)The Court of Appeal held in Kolodziejski v. Auto Electric Service that the Queens' Bench has jurisdiction to entertain a civil action for non-payment of holiday pay. 2)The plaintiff may rely on s.30(1) of the LSA to establish he is entitled to holidays and on s.33 to establish he entitled to pay in lieu of taking holidays. The onus then shifts to the defendant to prove it complied with some exception in the LSA. Section 75 prevents an employee from waiving his or her entitlement. Whether the plaintiff asserted his right to holiday pay or not, he remained entitled to his annual holidays in accordance with the LSA. 3)The plaintiff can claim for any holiday pay in lieu of time off that he can establish he was entitled to from April 1990 to his termination date. Section 3(1)(f)of the LAA states that a cause of action for recovery of money under a contract, express or implied, must be commenced within 6 years of the date on which the cause arose. 4)The plaintiff clearly indicated that a portion of the truck allowance was made to avoid paying tax. As such it would be contrary to public policy for the Court to appear to endorse the plaintiff's actions by calculating his holiday pay on the basis of his wage and this portion of his truck allowance.  5)The defendant's position that the contract included a component of holiday pay each month was inconsistent with its position that the plaintiff took these days off as holidays during the year. The contract of employment did not include a component of holiday pay in lieu of time off.  6)Failure by the defendant to keep records for the purpose of inspection by the minister does not result in a reverse onus. The onus remains on the plaintiff to establish what holidays he did not take. 7)The plaintiff admitted to taking time away from his duties for personal time and for city business as mayor. The plaintiff was not there in his capacity as superintendent. Section 31(1)(b) indicates that an employee shall be permitted to take holidays in one uninterrupted period. The defendant allowed the plaintiff to take days off in any manner he chose. It was inconsistent that the plaintiff's failure to comply with the notice requirement meant for the benefit of the employer could be used by an employee to disclaim that his days off were holidays. 8)The plaintiff was clearly a manager within the meaning of LSA. Even if he were not a manager, he failed to prove, on a balance of probabilities that he worked overtime hours in excess of the statutory minimum in order to qualify for overtime. Any days off taken by the plaintiff could not be considered taken in lieu of overtime. The days he was away were holidays as defined in s.30 of the LSA. 9)He did not establish he did 3 weeks holidays.","The plaintiff sued for damages from the defendant alleging he was constructively wrongfully dismissed from his employment with the defendant. The plaintiff elected to have the determination of liability and the assessment of damages determined by a civil jury. The jury determined that the plaintiff was constructally dismissed and awarded the plaintiff damages. HELD: 1)The jury trial should proceed with respect to the issues of liability, damages and the issue of entitlement to holiday pay. 2)The plaintiff's hours of work were very flexible in the winter. It was only in the first winter of his employment that he was required to be at work 30 hours per week. He did not put in the hours he spent on the job for any particular time during the winter months. The defendant claimed the plaintiff's truck allowance should not be included in the calculation of his holiday pay entitlement. 3)The defendant argued that the $250.00 portion of the truck allowance was made to avoid paying tax. 4)It would be contrary to public policy for this Court to appear to endorse the defendant's actions by calculating holiday pay on the basis of his wage and this portion of his truck allowance. Any holiday pay owing to the plaintiff will be calculated only on the plaintiff’s wage. 5)If the court found that the defendant was not all-inclusive or that it did not exceed the minimum standards set out in the LSA, the plaintiff should only be entitled to a holiday pay in lieu of taking holidays. 6)The issue of holiday pay should be determined by the Court of Appeal."
b_1995canlii6024.txt,"The accuseds were charged under ss.300 and 301 of the Code with (i)committing and (ii)publishing a defamatory libel against a police officer. They filed a plea of justification as permitted under s.611(1) of the Code. The Crown denied the truth of the plea pursuant to s.611(4) and the matter proceeded to trial. At the opening of their trial the accuseds applied for an order declaring ss.300 and 301 of the Criminal Code to be of no force and effect on the basis that they constituted an unreasonable limitation on their rights and freedoms guaranteed under ss.2, 7 and 11 of the Charter. The Crown admitted that ss.300 and 301 limited an individual's right to freedom of expression as provided by s.2 of the Charter but argued that this infringement was justified under s.1 of the Charter. HELD: Application allowed in part.  1)The onus of justifying the limitation of a right or freedom is on the party seeking to uphold the limitation and the standard of proof is by a preponderance of probability. 2)The standards against which a limit on a right or freedom guaranteed by the Charter can be shown to be reasonable and demonstrably justified are those underlying values and principles essential to a free and democratic society. While the right of free speech is important in our society, it is not unrestricted. 3)In order to justify an infringement of this right, it must be shown that: (i)the impugned legislative provision has an objective of pressing and substantial concern and (ii)there is a proportionality to the legislation in that: (a)the measures must be fair and not arbitrary, carefully designed to achieve the objective in question and rationally connected to the objective; (b)the means should impair freedom of expression as little as possible; (c)there must be a proportionality between the effects of the limiting legislation and the objective. S.300 of the Code meets these tests, and is therefore a reasonable limit on free speech and is valid. 4)Ss.611 and 612 of the Code, which permit a plea of justification do not create a reverse onus on the accused. They are procedural and merely serve to put the Crown on notice as to the accused's defence. The Crown must still prove that the alleged defamatory libel is knowingly false beyond a reasonable doubt. 5)S.301 of the Code makes it an offence to publish a defamatory libel whether or not the accused believes it to be true. S.301 is therefore not a reasonable limit and is invalid. ADDENDUM: The Court ordered that the agreed statement of facts set out at pp. 2 and 3 of the judgment not be published nor broadcast in any manner.",The applicants apply for a declaration that s. 300 and 301 of the Criminal Code constitute an unreasonable limitation of one or more of the rights and freedoms guaranteed by s. 2(b) and s. 11(c) of the Charter. HELD: 1)The applicants are entitled to a declaration of defamatory libel pursuant to s. 299 of the Code. 2)The Court must balance the value of freedom of expression against reputation. The mens rea elements of the s.300 offence are the best evidence of the gravity of the libel. 3)The court must not be diverted by the offensive content of the particular speech giving rise to the Charter challenge.
b_1991canlii4497.txt,"A large diseased elm tree fell on a truck and injured the plaintiff driver. For some years prior to the accident, the defendant had operated a hazardous tree removal program.

For the plaintiff, that there is a prima fade duty of care owed by the Department of Transportation to users of highway against reasonably foreseeable hazards, including the falling of trees onto the highway. Further, the defendant had a duty to use a reasonable standard of care in the operation of the hazardous tree removal program. The defendant was negligent in failing to train the inspector properly. The Court referred at length to the Supreme Court of Canada decision in Just v. British Columbia. The defendant's claim against the third parties (owners/occupiers of property on which tree stood) was dismissed.","The plaintiff was in good health and driving a half ton truck on a public highway near Falmouth, Nova Scotia. A tree fell on his truck, crushing him inside the cab. He was now a paraplegic. The plaintiff's action against the defendants Redden and Lockhart was discontinued. This defendant, the Attorney General, did not consent to the discontinuance of the other defendants. HELD: The plaintiff was awarded $1,200.00.  1)The defendant was not exempt from liability on the basis that the system of inspections, including their quantity and quality, constituted a policy decision of a government agency and was thus exempt. 2)The plaintiff as a user of the highway was in sufficient proximity to the respondent to come within the purview of that duty of care. 3)It would be eminently reasonable for the appellant as user to expect that it would be reasonably maintained. 4)The respondent was not obliged to pay any contribution or indemnity to the plaintiff."

Judge applied the test that the justice of the peace `must be satisfied on reasonable grounds.' Substantial compliance found and warrant upheld.,The respondent issued a search warrant to search a dwelling house for weapons allegedly used in an attempted armed robbery. The applicants sought an order quashing the warrant on the grounds that the search warrant was unlawfully and invalidly issued in excess of the jurisdiction of the Respondent for the following reasons: (1) the sole ground upon which the Information was based is hearsay information from a confidential source and no details are provided in support of the informant's opinion or conclusion that such information is reliable; and (2) no reliance could have been placed thereon in determining whether reasonable and probable grounds existed for the issuance of the warrant.
d_2009skqb70.txt,"At issue is the amount of Income Replacement Benefits (IRB) payable to the appellant by SGI. The parties agree that the calculation of the IRB as provided by s. 117 of the Act is the annualized sum of $28,889.75. The appellant takes issue with SGI's reduction of the amount determined in accordance with s. 117 of the Act by calculating the appellant's net income in accordance with s. 135 to s. 138 of the Act. HELD: SGI has correctly calculated the appellant's IRB when it made the requisite deductions as set out in s. 137 to find the appellant's net income, and then reduced the net income to 90% to determine his IRB. It would be neither a rational nor fair interpretation to reduce a full-time earner's IRB by 90% and not the other types of earners. It would be neither a rational nor fair interpretation to deduct income tax, employment insurance premiums and Canada Pension contributions from only full-time earners. All earners are subject to these payments being deducted from their income but for their inability to earn an income because of an automobile accident. The further deductions to obtain the non- earner's IRB are in keeping with his earning reality.","The hearing judge determined the income replacement benefit (IRB) for the non-earner as defined by the Automobile Accident Insurance Act was less than the IRB calculated for the 181st and subsequent days following an accident, as determined pursuant to s. 117 of the Act. The parties brought the matter back for further determination because SGI is paying Montgrand an amount less than that. HELD: 1) The hearing judge correctly calculated Montgrand's IRB when it made the requisite deductions as set out in s. 137 to find his net income, and then reduced the net income to 90% to determine his IRB. If it is greater than that, Montgrand has the benefit provided by s. 116(4) of the act. 2) SGI was correct in applying Regulation 102 which states that interest payable pursuant to Part VIII is to be calculated in accordance with the Pre-judgment Interest Act. It strives for one's earning reality. Non-earners may well become someone whose employment income, but for the accident, would be more than the 'weighted average' approach used by SGI. The Act is intended to correlate a victim's income with his or her earning reality, and as stated in the previous Montgrand judgment, the legislation attempts to find that reality. 3) The IRB is calculated on the basis of gross yearly employment income that the victim could have held at the time of the accident. The further deductions are in keeping with the earning reality and the legislation is designed to find the income reality. The provisions of s. 135 138 do not apply to Montgrand as an income earner defined in the Act, nor to any other types of earners. 4) It would be neither a rational nor fair interpretation to deduct income tax, employment insurance premiums and Canada Pension contributions from only full-time earners. All earners are subject to these payments being deducted from their income but for their inability to earn an income because of an automobile accident."
c_2007nsca4.txt,"The appellants applied for leave to amend their notice of appeal in regard to an order requiring them to post security for costs with respect to certain interlocutory applications. The application was opposed, inter alia, on the basis that the allegations which underlie the proposed amendment were not justiciable issues before the trial judge, were irrelevant on the application and were not ruled on by the trial judge. Application to amend the notice of appeal allowed; the amendment is reasonably necessary for the presentation of the appeal and will not occasion prejudice to the respondent. The respondent's opposition to the application fundamentally misconceived the role of a chambers judge who is asked to grant leave to amend a notice of appeal. It is not the role of a chambers judge to rule on the substantive merits of the arguments the appellants wish to make. The focus in this situation is on whether there is any prejudice to the respondent as a result of this issue being raised by amendment rather than in the original notice of appeal.","The appellants apply for leave to amend their notice of appeal. Leave is required because the underlying proceeding is an application for leave and, if granted, an appeal from an order requiring the appellants to post security for costs with respect to certain interlocutory applications in which they will be the moving parties. As, in their view, their arguments in opposition to the amendment relate to the merits of the point raised by it, those arguments are for a panel and not chambers judge to consider. The amendment should be granted but without limiting the responding parties from arguing these points before the panel."
b_2000skqb36.txt,"The accused, Cote, applied for remedy pursuant to s.24 of the Charter of Rights stating that he was denied the right to be tried on a fraud charge within a reasonable time. Twenty-two months passed between the laying of the charge and the trial date. Cote was not responsible for the delay and actively pursued a speedy trial. The delay was caused by the Crown's failure to provide timely disclosure. HELD: The charge was stayed. In applying the decision of the SCC in R. v. Morin, the court found that 22 months is an unreasonable and exceptional period of delay and is of sufficient length to warrant an inquiry. This case had no particular complexity above the norm for cases of this kind and did not require this delay. Cote did not directly or indirectly waive his s.11(b) right to be tried within a reasonable time. Cote was subject to substantial and sufficient prejudice by the delay. He suffered damage to his political career, embarrassment from media reports, unemployment, and economic hardship. The court balanced the individual's right to be tried within a reasonable time with society's interest in having the matter proceed to trial despite delay. Here the defence was not seeking to delay the trial and use the protective shield of s.11(b)as an offensive weapon.","The accused was committed to stand trial on two fraud charges and one count of conspiracy to commit fraud. He applied to this court for a remedy pursuant to s. 24 of the Charter of Rights and Freedoms. HELD: The application was based primarily on the accused's position that he has been denied the right to be tried on the fraud charge within a reasonable time. 1)The length of delay was substantial and sufficient to tilt the balance in favour of requiring a judicial stay. 2)The Crown conceded its responsibility for the delay in this matter. It has attempted to explain the delay but found the words of Justice Noble in R. v. A.K. (1996), 1996 CanLII 7056 at p. 189. 3)The accused's counsel was requesting disclosure even prior to the first scheduled court appearance but the short recess was insufficient time for the Crown to be certain that everything from the file had been disclosed.

e_2012skca69.txt,"The applicant applied for judicial interim release under s. 20(b) of the Extradition Act and s. 679 of the Criminal Code. Romania sought extradition of the applicant so that he might serve a 3 year prison sentence imposed as a result of a conviction in Romania for criminally negligent homicide with respect to a motor vehicle collision where the accused, while impaired, hit a pedestrian and killed him. The applicant offered surety from the Romania community in Saskatchewan who did not appear to have known the accused for long and offered to put up his car as bond. The applicant had common law spouse in Saskatchewan but owned no real property. HELD: Although the Crown conceded that the applicant had met the relatively low threshold of showing that his application for leave to appeal his extradition order was not frivolous, the Court of Appeal declined to release the applicant. The Court of Appeal held that there is an elevated risk of flight in light of the fact that the applicant has exhausted all appeals in Romania and is facing a 3 year prison sentence. Canada's international obligations in extradition proceedings require the Court to look more severely at the risk of non-appearance than it would if the application was made solely under s. 679 in respect of criminal proceeding in Canada. The sureties offered by the applicant were not sufficient to ensure his attendance at Court. The application for judicial interim release was dismissed.","The applicant sought judicial interim release pursuant to s. 20(b) of the Extradition Act and s. 679 of the Criminal Code so that he might serve a three-year prison sentence imposed as a result of his conviction, in that country, for criminally negligent homicide (an offence equivalent to that of manslaughter in Canada). Romania sought an order of this Court releasing him from custody pending the Minister's decision on his surrender to Romania. HELD: The application was dismissed. 1)The applicant's status as a Convention refugee and Canada's non-refoulement obligations do not displace the well-established requirement that a court considering an application for judicial interim released in an extradition proceeding must limit the assumption of risk of non-appearance more severely than the Court would do in an application by an offender made directly under s. 7 of the Code. 2)The application before this Court was for judicial release and did not engage those legal obligations.  3)It is not appropriate for the Minister to make such an inquiry as these are matters clearly and properly left to the Minister. However, the recent decision of the Supreme Court of Canada in Németh v. Canada (Justice), 2010 SCC 56 (CanLII), leads one to the conclusion that Canada's legal obligations under the Convention with respect to non-compliance with the terms of any order for his release are squarely before the Minister (given the nature of the sentence to which he is now subject in Romania, the exhaustion of his appeal rights in Romania and his desire not to be returned to Romania are important considerations in this case."

The Husband claimed that the value of the crop harvested was less than the farm expenses and resisted any change in the previous interim orders made. HELD: Application dismissed. The Court was not prepared to make the interim orders requested on the basis of the contradictory affidavits filed. A pre-trial was directed.","The applicant sought an interim distribution of matrimonial property and interim support for her two children, aged 16 and 13, and an order prohibiting the respondent from contacting her and from going to her workplace.

The respondent was ordered to pay $2,000 lump sum support for the children at the end of the 1994 harvest. The applicant sought to have the respondent (husband) barred from contacting the wife and from visiting her workplace in the absence of periodic child support if he got a job off the farm. An earlier consent order forbade the husband from disposing of the property. The wife sought to be paid half of the value of the crop retroactive to July 1 and that her husband be denied the right to enter the tools shed and farm yard now that he is finished farming for the year. The husband denied disposing any matrimony property since the date of the order other than the canola crop which he harvested from rented land.

The defendant alleged the First Nation was responsible for the administrator's conduct and applied to join the First Nation as a third party so that contribution or indemnity could be claimed. The applicant required leave under s.7 of the Contributory Negligence Act and Rule 107A(c) of the Rules of Court.

The plaintiff's claim dated back to 1984. The parties were not ready for trial. No prejudice was established.  3)The third party's liability, if any, will have to be determined on a case by case basis.

It applied to join the G[…] First Nation as a third party to the action brought by the plaintiff against it and Starr; so that it can claim contribution or indemnity from it if the applicant is found liable to the plaintiff. HELD: The application for leave was granted. The applicant shall have its costs of the application, taxed, against the plaintiff and the proposed third party.  1)Pre-trial was ordered by consent of the parties. It was obvious from the material that the parties were not ready for trial. They had not exchanged documents, and the plaintiff gave notice of his intention to amend his statement of claim after the consent order was granted and shortly thereafter gave notice to the applicant. 2)The applicant had not established any prejudice. There was no indication that the inherent delay in allowing third party proceedings would result in the disappearance of any evidence, or that extra costs will be incurred by plaintiff in redoing steps already completed or that the process will become so cumbersome and complicated as to undermine the plaintiff's claim.  3)The proposed party claims it will suffer prejudice if it is joined as third party by the applicant and Starr. There are many claims arising from alleged abuse at the residential school which could result in applications to join it as a party. The third party suggests it will incur large costs in defending these actions. It suggests it would be cost efficient and simpler to have the applicant sue it in one action to determine its liability, if any, to applicant. Unfortunately, this is not solution to the problem. Each individual action brings by former student at a residential school is different in nature. It may cover a different time period and/or employee so that the extent of the third party's involvement will vary from case to case. The parties' liability will vary on a case by case basis."
d_1999skqb276.txt,"FIAT. The plaintiff applied for summary judgment in his claim for dismissal without just cause. The plaintiff was initially hired as body shop foreman but additionally acquired the title of assistant manager. When the body shop manager became ill that work load also fell to the plaintiff. It was during this period that the performance of the plaintiff, described by the defendant as serious misconduct, resulted in his termination. There was no issue of a lack of mitigation as the plaintiff accepted a job with another autobody shop but at a much lower rate of pay. The action was brought pursuant to the simplified procedure outlined in Part 40 of the Rules of Court. HELD: Damages were to be calculated by the parties for the 7 month notice period based on his income and value of benefits over the previous year, less the 6 weeks pay received, and less wages and benefits received from his new employment. Jurisdiction was reserved to hear further evidence should the parties not reach agreement. 1)By using the words 'shall grant judgment unless', Rule 488 requires the presiding judge to grant judgment except in the circumstances outlined in s.488(a)and(b). The test is not whether there is contradictory evidence in the affidavits but whether despite the contradictory evidence the issue(s) can be decided in the absence of cross-examination and it would be otherwise unjust to do so. If the court can assume the defendant's evidence is true and still grant summary judgment there is no genuine need for a trial. 2)As noted in numerous decisions, whether an employer is justified in summarily dismissing an employee is ultimately a question of fact. The plaintiff was not terminated because of poor job performance in performing his contractual duties as foreman and manager but because of his alleged poor performance in doing the job normally assigned to two persons. The employer has the right to expect that employees will not disparage their immediate supervisors or other employees in the course of their employment and certainly not to clients or customers of the employer. The type of conduct here would not justify dismissal the first time it came to the employer's attention if the employee had been guilty of such conduct while performing only his own job function. 'Griping' is not uncommon in the workplace. The case law seems uniform that one or more warnings to an employee must be given before it can be said such activity 'fractures the employment relationship'. The category of misconduct can be said to change from poor attitude to disobedience or insubordination where dismissal results after one or more warnings. 3)The plaintiff was entitled to 7 months notice to reflect the fact that junior management positions are fewer in number and the considerable wage difference between management and non- management positions.  4)The plaintiff was entitled to taxable costs.","FIAT. The plaintiff applies for summary judgment in his claim for dismissal without just cause brought pursuant to the simplified procedure outlined in Part Forty of the Rules of Court. The defendant opposes the application and requests summary trial. HELD: The plaintiff is entitled to enter judgment for the damages which flow from this dismissal without a cause as set out hereafter. 1) The defendant bears the burden of demonstrating there is a genuine need for trial.  2) The plaintiff's damages are to be calculated in the manner set out in the foregoing. 3) In this case the alleged misconduct of the plaintiff would have justified him being warned to not continue such conduct, but it falls far short of conduct justifying cause for termination. 4) In the case of a person in the plaintiff's position, who occupied a junior managerial position in a very specific industry, the notice period selected should reflect that management positions are fewer in number than non-management positions, and that there was a considerable wage difference between a management position and one."
4_2008skqb174.txt,"Accused pleaded guilty at opening of trial to one count of distributing child pornography in the form of written works. The accused was active on a pedophile website and posted 11 stories describing sexual activity between men and infants and pre-teen girls. HELD: Accused received 15 months imprisonment followed by 3 years of probation with addition orders including providing DNA samples and being added to the Sex Offender Registry. The Court accepted that the internet has led to the accelerated proliferation of child pornography, making it an increasing social problem. The social harm of such material is borne almost exclusively by infants and children, the most defenceless members of society. For this reason, denunciation and deterrence are the dominant sentencing principles. The defence submitted that the writings do not actually harm children in their making and, therefore, should not be subject to the same denunciation as pornographic images. The Court rejected this argument because it cannot be assumed that the writings do not stimulate the demand for images and since not all pedophiles are voyeurs only some will act on their desires and anything that stimulates this desire places children at risk in the real world. Aggravating factors in this case were 1) the fact that the accused extolled pedophilia and wrote hard core child pornography and encouraged others to the same. 2) The accused was a high profile contributor to the web site and he remains unrepentant Ã» he does not believe there is anything wrong with writing these stories and only stopped because the law requires it. A conditional sentence would not represent sufficient denunciation or deterrence. Mitigating factors in this case included a lack of criminal record, the guilty plea and the fact that the accused is looking after his elderly mother.","The defendant pled guilty at the opening of trial to distribution of child pornography contrary to s. 163.1(3) of the Criminal Code. HELD: The defendant was sentenced to 15 months imprisonment to be followed by a term of probation of 3 years, as well as an order requiring him to comply with the Sex Offender Information Registration Act for a period of 20 years. The defendant had been active on a pedophile website dedicated to man-girl relationships for over two and a half years. He had written hard core child pornography in several of his stories, which on the scale of written child pornography places it in the upper half of the scale. The fact that he disclosed his stories were largely fantasies is not mitigating factor that detracts from the effects such written pornography has, as set out above. A fit sentence in this matter requires period of incarceration. 1)The defendant was found guilty of distributing child pornography. 2)The Court accepted the defendant's submission that child pornography writings do not in their production actually harm children, and therefore should not be subject to the same denunciation as images. In the absence of evidence to the contrary, it cannot be assumed that writings stimulate the demand for images which do directly harm children."

e_2010skca8.txt,"Fulltext of judgment follows: Following the conviction of the respondent on a charge of trafficking in morphine contrary to section 5(1) of the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act, the prosecutor asked the sentencing judge to make a DNA order under section 487.051(3) of the Criminal Code. The judge declined to do so for the reason this was the respondent's first drug offence and she had no record of violence.

The error lay in the judge's failure to have regard for the offender's record as a whole—she has 53 prior convictions—and to have adequate regard for her objectives."

A pedestrian was crossing a road adjacent to a parking lot and, while walking directly in front of a stopped vehicle, was struck by the vehicle when it rolled forward. HELD: The accused is not guilty. The court accepted the accused's evidence that his vehicle rolled forward only a short distance of not more than one foot and not at a fast or accelerated speed and that the pedestrian was crossing outside of the cross walk and that the accused applied his brakes as soon as he saw the pedestrian. The accused did exercise due diligence.","The accused was charged with driving without due care and attention contrary to s. 44(1) of the Highway Traffic Act. HELD: The accused was found not guilty of the charge. 1) The accused's actions in operating his vehicle on the road beside a cross-walk constituted careless driving, as distinguished from dangerous driving under the Criminal Code. The actions of the accused which could be considered careless are, firstly, the speed at which he drove past the crosswalk, and secondly, his driving forward into Mr. Kuchar. The accused should have simply continued driving. 2) On a balance of probabilities, the accused drove within a short distance of not more than one foot, and not at a fast or accelerating speed. The officer's evidence that neither seat belt, belonging to the accused, locked upon striking the accused and that the vehicle did not accelerate and did not move forward quickly before striking him. The Crown suggested that the accused had an oblique motive for doing so, perhaps thinking that Mr. Banga was being insolent and returning to set him straight."
b_2008nspc5.txt,"The accused was charged with driving a motor vehicle while his licence was revoked when he was found operating an all terrain vehicle (ATV) on a highway. Accused found not guilty; the accused could not have obtained a licence to drive an ATV on the highway because it is a prohibited vehicle. Before one can be found guilty of this offence, it must be proven that they were driving a motor vehicle of a type or class for which they could have been properly licenced to drive on a highway.","The accused was observed by police officers driving his all terrain vehicle (ATV) along a highway. At the time his driver's license was revoked, he was driving a prohibited vehicle on the highway under s. 11 of the Motor Vehicle Act. The accused was found not guilty of the offence because his 'driver's license' was revoked. The defence argued that the words'motor vehicle' in s. 287(2) do not include an ATV and that even if those words did, the accused should be found guilty because his license revocation is irrelevant since he could never have been licensed to drive an 'ATV on a highway'. HELD: 1) The accused could not be charged with an offence of operating a motor vehicle on highway, or for speeding and would be liable for any damages arising in the event of an accident. The Crown argued that since there is no nexus between his driving of the motor vehicle and the revocation of his driver’s license he should be guilty of this offence. The only issue at this trial is whether this makes the accused guilty of driving a motor Vehicle on the road while his license was revved.  2) The words'motivator' are used within the sections of the MVA to determine whether the provision applies to the use of ATV’’ or other prohibited vehicles. When the content, context and purpose of section 287(3) is considered, the legislature intended for that subsection of the Highway by those individuals who had their licences or privilege of obtaining licences to do so cancelled, suspended or revoked. Before one can be convicted of such an offence, it must be proven that they were driving a vehicle of type or class for which they could properly have been permitted to drive a vehicle. In s.287(2), it is clearly not exempting ATVs from the definition of motor vehicles in all provisions of the Act. It is my intention to not exempt ATV's from all references to 'Motor Vehicle' in the Act, but the only issue is whether the accused was guilty of that offence."
7_2011skpc143.txt,"The plaintiff filed a number of duplicate claims on behalf of a number of individuals. The issue was whether the claims should be issued. HELD: Section 7(1) of The Small Claims Act provides that a Provincial Court Judge acts as a gatekeeper to insure that claims comply with the Act before they are issued. In this role, the Provincial Court judge is exercising a quasi judicial function. Counsel for the plaintiff has clearly indicated that the claim is a test case. The plaintiff seeks declaratory relief. A substantial amount of the claim involves an allegation of breach of contract, but neither the plaintiff nor the proposed defendants were signatories to the contract. Accordingly, they would not be entitled to the benefit of the agreement. As virtually all of the potential issues raised by these claims are declaratory in nature, they are outside the jurisdiction of the Provincial Court. Any litigation over these issues must be done in the Court of Queen's Bench.","HELD: The court declined to issue the summons. The court reviewed the letter and found that it was not in the usual way that matters are dealt with in the Court of Queen’s Bench. The judge had refused to issue a summons and the matter was referred to another Provincial Court Judge, who was away for two weeks on education leave and vacation leave, to advise him when he could pick up the claims for service. There was no claim being advanced against any potential defendant other than the Government of Saskatchewan."

He qualifies since 1987 for a disability pension under CPP by reason of his mental disability which provides for a basic income of $580 plus GTS rebate for a total of $630 per month.

There is no juridical reason why the petitioner should obtain the total revenue owned by the respondent particularly when he brought the land into the marriage. In fact, fairness and equity would suggest just the opposite, at least in respect to one half of the revenue.

The respondents were named executors of his estate. A simultaneous application had been brought by the same applicant to remove the respondents as executors of his estate (see: 2016 SKQB 15). The applicant had failed to serve the respondents with notice of this application or the alternate executor and beneficiaries named in the will. In addition, the applicant had misunderstood that she could rely upon evidence filed in another action that was also before the court in this application. HELD: The application was adjourned. The applicant was instructed to serve notice of the application and the adjournment on the alternate executor and the named beneficiaries. As the applicant had not understood that evidence from another action could not be considered by the court on this application, the applicant was also required to file further affidavit evidence.

In order to determine the issues, it is necessary for the court to be provided with information. If the applicant wishes to consider the evidence filed on QB 33 of 2015, the applicant will need the consent of the respondents for the Court to consider that evidence or will need to file further evidence in affidavit form putting forward before the Court such evidence as is relevant on this application. 2) There is little evidence as to why the respondents suggest they should be removed as the executors as the respondents. The applicant appears to have been of the view that evidence filed at QB 33 is evidence before the court on the application. It is not. The evidence filed by the respondents is not evidence to consider.

b_1996canlii5028.txt,"Guardian was the general liability insurer for Kellogg. Royal was the primary insurer as holder of Kellogg's blanket fleet coverage. Kellogg's employee was involved in a motor vehicle accident while on company business but was driving his wife's vehicle at the time of the accident. Royal denied coverage and refused to defend on the basis of an exclusionary provision regarding the use of substitute automobiles. It was held at trial that Royal was not obligated to participate. HELD: 1)The case law reveals some inconsistencies with respect to the relationship between the duty to defend and the coverage provided by the policy. Where the policy clearly does not provide coverage, the insurer had no duty to defend. Where a policy only provides coverage for some allegations the insurer is only obligated to defend those allegations which may trigger the obligation to indemnify. When a policy is ambiguous some courts have adopted Thames and have stated the mere possibility that the policy may provide coverage is sufficient to oblige the insurer to defend. 2)Section 209 provides no guidelines as to the scope of the inquiry the judge may engage in. The chamber judge did not define the scope of his inquiry and stated that the standard suggestion that Guardian must raise an arguable point was 'off target'. To determine whether an insurer has the obligation to defend a chamber judge must examine the coverage provided by the policy. The judge made no finding of ambiguity in the exclusionary provision. He simply determined the Honda was not covered by the Royal policy and did not decide the issue of indemnity. 3)The affidavit evidence indicated that the parties lived in the same premises thus that argument was without merit. CONCURRING JUDGMENT: The appeal was dismissed for different reasons.  1)There has been an acceptance of the general concept that the duty to defend is broader than the duty to indemnify. To order an insurer to defend a chamber judge need be less sure the policy provides coverage than would be the case for an actual determination of liability under the policy. 2)There was a factual element which could not be determined on this application such as whether a partially deflated tire constitutes a breakdown within the meaning of the policy and whether the automobile the employee was driving was owned by someone living in the same dwelling. 3)The question centered around the words used in clause 5 of the policy and who it referred to. There were inconsistencies in terminology. The policy should not be interpreted as though the restriction it contains on what automobile can be used as a temporary substitute should be ignored.","This appeal arises from an application for directions to determine whether Royal had an obligation to defend. The appellant, Guardian Insurance Company of Canada, is the primary insurer as the holder of the blanket fleet coverage of Kellogg. The respondent, Royal agreed to defend but submitted that Royal also had a duty to defend in the name and on behalf of the insured. The chambers judge found that Royal was not obligated to defend because the Honda involved was not insured by Royal. The two issues to be resolved on appeal were whether the chambers judge erred in his application of the principles of contract interpretation when he decided the Honda was not a 'temporary substitute automobile' within the terms of the policy. HELD: 1)The chambers judge did not define the scope of his inquiry. He simply said in response to Guardian's argument it merely must raise an arguable point that the standard suggestion by the insurer was 'off target'. 2)There was no evidence in the affidavits filed by the respondent that the McLeod resided together. It was clear from the pleadings that the policy did not provide coverage for that which was alleged. The question was arguable should not be conclusive. It would be rare to apply for directions which contain no arguable points. 3)The difficulty with chambers judge engaging in an extensive inquiry into policy coverage in an application is so broad that it arises when he or she ultimately rules there is no obligation to protect and after the trial, the trial judge concludes that the insurer has an obligation of indemnify."
c_2016skqb374.txt,"HELD: The appeal as to the convictions and the sentences imposed was dismissed. The court found with respect to each issue that the trial judge had not erred: 1) the defence had acknowledged the appellant had used force and that his spouse had not consented to it. Therefore the appellant could not argue on appeal that the trial judge failed to take implied consent into account. The trial judge was entitled to accept the spouse’s testimony as she was not cross-examined at trial. There was nothing in the transcript that showed the trial judge took a zero tolerance approach. The trial judge found that defence of de minimis was not open to the appellant based on her finding that the application of force by the appellant was more than trifling. On appeal, the court could not substitute its view of the evidence from that of the trial judge; 2) the trial judge found that the appellant intentionally drove in a manner that he knew created a danger for others and to frighten his spouse. She was entitled to conclude the appellant’s conduct was a marked departure from that expected of reasonably prudent driver. The evidence was reasonably capable of supporting her decision; and 3) the appellant had not identified how the trial judge had erred on any of the grounds an appeal court could consider. It was not open to it to intervene only because it would have weighed sentencing factors differently from the trial judge.","HELD: The appeal was dismissed. The trial judge found the accused guilty of dangerous driving and assault. The accused received a sentence of 18 months probation plus 18 months’ probation. The conditions of the probation order required the accused to attend personal counselling, including domestic violence programming, as directed to do so by his probation officer, and to have no contact with the complainant except through third party for purposes of arranging access to his children. On the dangerous driving conviction, a three-month driving prohibition was imposed. The evidence was nonetheless reasonably capable of supporting the decision made by the trial judge. The appeal from dangerous driving was dismissed because the accused’s driving behaviour was a marked departure from the conduct expected of a reasonably prudent driver in similar circumstances."
9_2008skpc147.txt,"The parties entered into a handwritten agreement with regard to the feeding and maintenance of 100 cows. The plaintiff was to provide labour and the necessary equipment to feed and maintain the cows for $.50 per cow per day. The defendant was to provide the feed and medicine. At paragraph 6 the contract stipulated that the plaintiff was to receive a bonus for each live calf that he got to pasture. The amount of the bonus was left blank. The plaintiff sues the defendant, claiming a bonus for the 2004-2005 year and the 2005-2006 year. HELD: The claim is dismissed. In law an agreement to come to an agreement is not enforceable. This is especially true where an essential term regarding remuneration has not been agreed to. The parties agreed that they would settle on the bonus amount later on but they never did. The plaintiff believes he is still entitled to a bonus. The Court cannot make the agreement for the parties.","The parties signed a handwritten agreement on the 20th day of October 2004. The entire document reads as follows: The contract was to cover feeding and maintenance of one hundred and one cows to be boarded at the plaintiff's farm at Canwood, Sask. The plaintiff took delivery of the cows and cared for them as he had agreed to do in the October 2004 contract. He looked after the cows as well as the calves as they were born. He sent monthly invoices to Dobson who paid them as they arrived. At the end of each month, the plaintiff submitted an invoice to Ray for any costs associated with the above conditions. The terms of the invoice past due after 15 days is subject to 1% per month interest. The bonus to be paid for each live calf brought to his farm was left blank in the contract because neither of them were sure what it should be. In the year 2005-2006 he did not contemplate payment of bonus because the cows had been more carefully bread and calving was expected to occur and did occur in the more mild temperatures of April and May.

The Respondent had previously been acquitted of charges based on the same allegations in criminal court. The Respondent has abused a child within the meaning of the Act. Although the standard of proof is on the balance of probabilities, it is elevated with the seriousness of the allegations and their implications. However, it is considerably less than proof beyond a reasonable doubt.","This was an application brought by the Agency for a finding that the respondent had abused a child as described in s. 62(a) or (b) of the Children and Family Services Act. HELD: The Court found that the accused had sexually assaulted a child within the meaning of Section 62(b) and s.63 of the Child Abuse Register. The evidence of the child that she was sexually assaulted by the respondent has more probability of truth than disbelief. The Court adopted the position that the standard of proof elevated with the seriousness of the allegations and its implications (considerably less, however, than proof beyond a reasonable doubt) and that the Court must adopt the position adopted in J.L. v. CAS of Halifax."
e_2014skqb23.txt,"Civil Procedure Injunction HELD: The first portion of the statement of claim is an attempt by the plaintiff to have the Court take jurisdiction over a matter that is already before the Saskatchewan Human Rights Tribunal. While the court has jurisdiction to hear human rights complaints, the jurisdiction only arises after the tribunal process has been exhausted. Since the tribunal procedure has not been completed, the portions of the statement of claim dealing with the human rights complaint are stayed on the basis that the underlying issues may only be heard by the court upon application of the Chief Commissioner of the Saskatchewan Human Rights Code pursuant to s. 29.6 of the Code. With respect to the claim that the defendant breached The Animal Protection Act, the essence of the claim is to seek damages against the plaintiff for the loss of the service dog. That portion of the claim must be struck because the plaintiffs cannot circumvent the provisions of The Animal Protection Act, 1999 nor eliminate the defendant’s right to be charged and tried in Provincial Court through the expediency of claiming a declaration in a civil suit. The third claim is that the defendant was negligent in allowing other children to interact with the service dog will not be struck because, assuming the facts in the pleadings are true, the claim for damages is viable. Likewise, the fourth claim that the defendant intentionally inflicted mental and emotional suffering on the autistic plaintiff will not be struck as is not plain and obvious from the pleadings that the claim cannot succeed. The plaintiffs’ application for an interlocutory injunction was dismissed because the claims that have not been struck are not rationally connected to the injunction, even assuming the remaining claims present a serious issue to be tried they do not justify a finding that the plaintiffs will suffer irreparable harm if the injunction is refused and the balance of convenience weighs in favour of not granting an injunction.","The plaintiffs are the five children of the Lawless family who reside near Maryfield, Saskatchewan. They attended a French language school for two years. In February 2013, the defendant informed the family that the children's provisional permission to attend a fransaskois school would not be extended for the 2013-2014 school year. The Lawless applied for an interlocutory injunction, which would order the defendant to grant ongoing permission to the children to attend the school. The father applied to strike out the statement of claim. HELD: The application to dismiss the claim was reserved, while the application was dismissed with written reasons to follow. The Court's reasons for decision on both applications were that the plaintiffs had failed to live up to their ten commitments and the Court was convinced that support for their success did not exist in this case. 1)The Court was not convinced that the CÉF's discriminatory conduct was the real reason for its decision. 2)The court found that the court was not in the best interests of the plaintiffs to continue attending the school because of their failure to meet their commitments."

Certiorari granted; declaration issued that application for final subdivision approval was complete; order for mandamus granted and the development officer directed to issue final approval (subject only to the applicant correcting the technical error in the plan). The development officer's decision was based on interpretation of relevant legislation and the proper standard of review is correctness. The development officer misinterpreted the legislation. Since the applicant had already received tentative approval under the old regime, it did not have to meet the new higher standards for final approval. There was not another legal remedy open to the applicant equally convenient, beneficial and appropriate. The right of appeal under the legislation existed only from a refusal by a development officer and technically, this was not a refusal as the application was found incomplete.

The damage is alleged to have been caused when the defendant's truck left the ramp leading onto the bridge and fell into an excavation pit.

There is no prejudice to the plaintiff because he has settled with his insurer and is requesting settlement with the defendant's insurer.

The accused is charged with abuse of a position of trust contrary to s. 153(1)(a) of the Code. HELD: The evidence is admissible. The accused's application is dismissed. 1) After examining the transcript of the conversation, it is immediately evident that the contents of the communication are relevant. The complainant and the accused are discussing the intimate details of their relationship. The conversation is logically probative to the charge. 2) The learned provincial court judge did in fact have sufficient evidence before him to issue the telephone intercept authorization. The complainant was prepared to initiate a telephone call to the accused and engage him in a conversation which would likely cause the accused to make admissions or statements which could be confirmatory of her allegations. 3) The authorization clearly permits the police to intercept private communications in relation to an offence under s. 271(1) of the Code. That investigation was live and bona fide at the time that the authorization was obtained. The law in this country is that evidence of other crimes revealed during the course of a lawful intercept process does not render the evidence obtained inadmissible in relation to an offence not named in the authorization. The focus is on whether the interception was lawfully obtained and executed, not on what is discovered. Here the police obtained a valid authorization to intercept private communications in relation to an offence under s. 271(1) of the Code. During the investigation of that charge, they obtained evidence which is relevant to an offence under s. 153(1)(a) of the Code. The fact that the offence of s. 153(1)(a) is not named in the authorization nor included as an offence for which an authorization to intercept private communications could be obtained, does not affect the admissibility of the evidence. Therefore, there is no Charter breach. 4) Even if the evidence was obtained in violation of s. 8 of the Charter, such evidence is considered non-conscriptive evidence. Where the evidence is non-conscriptive, the court ought to go on to do a balancing as to whether or not the evidence ought to be excluded pursuant to s. 24(2) of the Charter. The factors to be considered are trial fairness, seriousness of the breach and the effect of exclusion. In this case if there is a breach, it was not serious and was inadvertent, the result of unmindful draftsmanship. There is no evidence of bad faith. There is no evidence of manipulation. The seriousness of the breach, if there was one, was minimal, and to admit the evidence would not bring the administration of justice into disrepute.","The accused applied for an order that evidence obtained by way of a telephone interception be ruled inadmissible because it is irrelevant. Alternatively, the accused sought exclusion of the intercepted communication on the basis that it was conducted in violation of s. 8 of the Charter. HELD: The evidence was relevant and admissible in that it did not violate the accused's s.8 rights. The surreptitious recording did not compel or coerce the appellant to speak. The recording was not conscriptive evidence in the sense described in Stillman. The accused argued that such an intention amounts to pure speculation and falls short of what could be considered reasonable grounds to believe that information concerning the offence would be obtained through the interception sought. The evidence ought to be excluded pursuant to s. 24(2). The Court reviewed the provisions of the Criminal Code and there was no Charter breach. It was clear that evidence produced as result of a wiretap was non-conscriptive and the evidence collected was limited to those specified offences. The Court viewed the seriousness of the breach, if there was one, to be minimal, and to admit the evidence would not bring the administration of justice into disrepute."

The petitioner has demonstrated that he is a person of sufficient interest; the relationship between the parties was not short and, during its lifespan, the petitioner formed a close bond with the child and was involved with her life. The community viewed them generally as father and daughter. However, the Court cannot conclude that requiring the child to visit the petitioner would be of any benefit to her. This child has already had to contend with multiple 'fathers' and multiple 'siblings', many of whom have been only temporary or fleeting personalities in her life.

The accused testified that he felt he was being shunned in the Block and had received threats from the first complainant and others in the complainant's group who were brandishing shanks earlier that day. The defence argued that the Crown failed to prove that the injuries caused to the first complainant fell within the definition of 'wound, maim, disfigure or endanger life'; and that the acts done to the first and second complainants were in self-defence as contemplated by s. 34 of the Criminal Code. HELD: The accused was convicted of both counts. 1) In relation to the accused's defence of self-defence pursuant to s. 34(2) pertaining to the first complainant, the Court found the accused did not believe that he was being assaulted within the meaning of the law and, even if he did hold this belief, such a belief was not reasonable in the circumstances. Further, the Court did not accept, on a subjective or objective basis, that the accused reasonably believed that the first complainant had the present ability to carry out the threat, notwithstanding that the physical aspect of the assault need not be imminent or immediate. Lastly, the Court found that the accused did not believe that he had no other option. The accused admitted that he had other options but chose not to avail himself of them. 2) The Court found it did not need to assess the application of s. 37 of the Code in relation to the common assault charge. Rather, the Court found s. 27 of the Code applicable and determined that the second complainant was legally justified to use as much force as was reasonably necessary to prevent the commission of an offence which would be arrestable without warrant. The Court found the second complainant was clothed in legal justification and the accused was not entitled to the protection of s. 34(1) because the accused provoked the assault, and the force he used was more than necessary to defend himself as the accused was armed with a shank and the second complainant was not.","HELD: The accused was charged with aggravated assault and one count of common assault relating to a violent incident that took place in the maximum security unit of the Saskatchewan Penitentiary at approximately 8:30 a.m. on September 1, 2008. The accused and the two alleged victims were inmates at the prison and were being held on 'B' Block, range designated for gang members. Given that the incident was captured by two security videos, there is no doubt as to what happened. The issues raised by the accused pertain to how his actions ought to be characterized. The Crown must also establish the mental element. The mens rea requirement for aggravated assault is an objective foresight of bodily harm. If the accused is a joint principal offender, he is capable of constituting a 'joint principal offender' pursuant to s. 21(1)(b) of the Criminal Code. In this case, it is not legally necessary to distinguish and isolate the specific acts of Knife from the acts of the other joint participants."
1995canlii4465.txt,"The plaintiffs statement of claim was served on the defendant in Ontario two days after it was issued. Two weeks later the prothonotary issued default judgment for $8,000, plus $2,880 in interest and $404.42 in costs. The defendant applied, pursuant to Civil Procedure Rule 12.06, to set aside the default judgment, on the ground that the plaintiff did not meet the requirements for obtaining a default judgment from the prothonotary or, in the alternative, on the merits that it had, by affidavit evidence, raised triable issues and provided a reasonable excuse for its failure to file a defence. Dismissing the application with costs of $1,000 to the plaintiff, that although the plaintiff ought to have sought the court's leave to take default judgment such a procedural ommission did not, in the circumstances, prejudice the defendant. Further, while there were triable issues between the parties, the defendant's failure to file a defence was neither a mistake nor an oversight, but rather a deliberate decision so as not to attorn to Nova Scotia jurisdiction, and therefore was not a reasonable excuse.","The plaintiff corporation sought directions pursuant to Civil Procedure Rule 12.06 to ensure that this underlying issue, that is, whether Nova Scotia or Ontario is the appropriate forum, was addressed. The defendant entered into a letter arrangement whereby the plaintiff would pay the defendant what the defendant terms a deposit and service fee and agreed to pay 50% of every energy savings enjoyed for a period of sixty months, provided such savings were the result of whatever of the defendant's recommendations were approved by and implemented by the plaintiff. The plaintiff sought leave to tender an Affidavit sworn by Mr. Weld, March 8, 1995, which concluded that there were a number of triable issues and that the defendant presented a reasonable excuse for his failure to defend. HELD: The application was dismissed with costs to the plaintiff in the amount of One Thousand Dollars ($1,000.00). 1)The plaintiff's mistake was not one of substance rendering its claim for relief nullity. It had the right to default. It attempted to exercise it. 2)The defendant's apparent intention to avoid the jurisdiction of the Nova Scotia Supreme Court, while simultaneously drawing the plaintiff into litigation in Ontario where it has no presence, is in my view, inconsistent with the interpretation and application of our own Rules. The older cases which held that an irregularly obtained judgment was a wilful and deliberate decision to ignore the proceedings in British Columbia were also dismissed. 3)There was no evidentiary basis sufficient to persuade the court that in order to do justice between these parties, the defendant should exercise its discretion in favour of the applicant."

The accused, charged with trafficking in a narcotic, sought an order for a judicial stay of proceedings pursuant to s.24(1) and (2) of the Charter on the basis his right under s.11(b) to be tried within a reasonable time has been breached. HELD: The application was dismissed. The delay was not unreasonable.  1)The 25 months between when the charge was laid in May 1996 and the trial date in November 1998 was sufficiant delay to raise the issue of the reasonableness of the delay. Defence did not waive delay. 2)There was no reason given for the three and one-half month delay between the swearing of the information and the arrest. The accused's right to a fair trial had not been prejudiced by the total time delay. His right to security of person and to liberty were not affected. 3)Seven months delay was due to scheduling delays resulting from defence's application to remove prosecution counsel who had previously represented the accused. The Crown acted in good faith in opposing the application and had a meritorious position. 4)All other proceedings were within the systemic guidelines. 5)Prejudice to his liberty was minor as he was on bail since shortly after his arrest. He was able to make full answer and defence. He was employed throughout since his release. His inability to enter long term contracts or travel out of province would have existed for 21-1/2 months of the 25 month delay in any event. 6)Individual and family stress is to be expected.

He has been employed throughout the period since his release. The prejudice he refers to in not being able to enter into long term contracts or travel out of the Province on several occasions would have existed only for 21-1/2 months of the 25- month delay, and would only have existed in any event for at least 15 months of that period of time.  2)The Crown did not share in the responsibility for the delay."
6_2017skca42.txt,"Statutes – Interpretation – Limitation of Civil Rights Act, Section 2The appellants had granted a residential mortgage in favour of the respondent that secured a loan in the amount of $460,800. The loan was a consolidation of existing debt, part of which was the balance of $373,089 owed on the original loan that had enabled the appellants to purchase the land. The remaining $87,711 was non-purchase money financing approved by the respondent. The appellants fell into default, and the respondent commenced foreclosure proceedings when the balance owed had increased to $536,186. The property was sold through judicial listing orders and the net sale proceeds were paid to the respondent. As the proceeds were insufficient, the respondent sought an order entitling it to the deficiency. The Chambers judge considered s. 2 of The Limitation of Civil Rights Act (LCRA) and held that the amount of the deficiency should be $162,675.99. The issues on appeal were how the proceeds of sale should be applied against the mortgage balance and what the proper amount of the deficiency was. HELD: The appeal was allowed. The court reviewed the purpose and policy behind the LCRA. It then examined its conflicting decisions in Hrynewich Holdings and Andrews and held that the latter was a per incuriam judgment and therefore not binding and the approach set out in Hrynewich would guide the disposition of this appeal. Therefore, it found with respect to each issue that the holding in Hrynewich meant that payments should be allocated on a pro-rated basis to purchase money and non-purchase money debt balances and the proper amount of the deficiency to which the respondent was entitled to judgment against the appellants was $31,160.23.","Hrynewich Holdings Ltd. granted a mortgage to the respondent in 2011. At that time, the balance owed had grown to $536,186.72. The respondent sought an order for solicitor-client costs to be set aside. The parties agreed there should be an order that either party may return the matter of costs relating to the motion for the deficiency judgment to the Chambers judge. The appeal will also be allowed to this extent. The appellants have been successful on this appeal. While the court was aware of the previous decision, it was forgetful of its conclusions as to how sale proceeds should be applied to the purchase money and non-purchase money portions of the debt. The Chambers judge pro-rated the calculation pursuant to the percentage owing on both purchase money (which was used to finance land purchase and the non purchase money portion) and found the proceeds of the sale were to be applied against the mortgage balance. When that balance (which includes accrued interest) had been exhausted, the mortgagee could sue for the balance. The conclusion in Andrew (CA) would not have been made had the Court considered the respondent. The appellant appealed. Appeal allowed."

c_2003skpc17.txt,The accused was charged with failure to provide forthwith a breath sample contrary to Criminal Code s.254(5). HELD: The accused was found not guilty. The court accepted the evidence of the accused where there was a discrepancy between the testimony of the officer and the accused. The mental element of the offence of refusal consists of intentional non-compliance. The officer in his conversation with another officer said he could not understand why he was not getting a proper sample. There was a reasonable doubt that the officer did understand why he was not getting a proper sample and could not provide the accused with adequate instructions.,The accused was charged with failing to comply with a demand made to him by a peace officer pursuant to s. 254(2)(a) of the Criminal Code to provide forthwith a sample of his breath as in the opinion of Cst. Rozario. The accused chose not to disclose in his disclosure information the name of the 'ride along' nor even that there was a ride along. HELD: The accused was found guilty of failing to provide a sample. The officer's lack of cander in giving his testimony in this regard has raised doubts in my mind as to his forthrightness in respect to other important details in this matter. It is for this reason and as result of my observations of the accused while he was testifying that prefer the testimony of the officer over that of the police officer where there is discrepancy.
d_1997canlii11011.txt,"An application to vary the terms of a 1995 consent judgment such that the applicant would have sole custody. Alternatively he sought an order preventing the mother from removing their daughter from Saskatchewan. The father obtained an ex parte order preventing the mother from removing the child from the province until the return date of the motion. The mother had always been the primary caregiver and had custody since the separation in 1994. The father had exercised regular and frequent access. She was given exclusive possession of the matrimonial home under the terms of the consent judgment which contemplated the home would be listed for sale and the net proceeds divided between the parties. Subsequent to the consent judgment the applicant went through bankruptcy proceedings in which he transferred his interest in the home to the trustee who then sold that interest to the respondent such that the applicant no longer had any interest in the home. HELD: 1)Relocation was neither foreseen nor reasonably contemplated by the judge making the original order. The threshold criteria was thus satisfied. 2)The trial of an issue was required as the matter could not be decided on the basis of affidavit evidence. The child had a close relationship with both parents. The disruption as a result of a change in custody or removal of the child from the community could not be assessed. 3)The applicant's request for interim relief was denied. If the mother proceeded with her move a revision of the access provision would be appropriate. 4)The child's best interest is the proper test to be applied (Cote) having regard to the factors identified by the Supreme Court of Canada in Gordon. 5)The applicant became aware in early June of the mother's intention to move to British Columbia and did not object. The timing of the application, a few weeks prior to the proposed move, raised the suspicion that it was the respondent's decision to sell the matrimonial home which prompted this application.  6)Costs were left to the trial judge.","This was an application to vary the terms of a consent judgment such that the applicant would havesole custody of his daughter from the Province of Saskatchewan. In the alternative the applicant sought an order preventing the respondent from removing their daughter from Saskatchewan. HELD: 1)The respondent was a good mother and there was nothing to suggest relocation was either foreseen or would have been reasonably contemplated by the judge who made the initial order. The timing of the application raised the suspicion that it was the respondent's decision to sell the matrimonial home which prompted this application. While to permit the move, pending trial, will impact negatively upon the existing access arrangements and the relationship between the applicant and his daughter, the best interests of the child are rightly presumed to lie with the custodial parent. The finding of material change effectively erases that presumption. 2)The applicant was not able to assess the effect of a disruption as a result of a change in custody or removal from the community."

There was a long history of relatively short terms of employment and several moves to take employment. The respondent had a grade 12 education and some university courses but no practical skills or training. For the past 3 years, the respondent had made no reasonable efforts for employment, developed no skills of a practical nature, and derived her income from child support payments and the Child Tax Credit and by incurring debt in excess of $20,000.00 The parties had entered bankruptcy during the course of the marriage and had no assets or savings or pension entitlement at the time of separation or acquired since. The petitioner now earned an annual salary of $115,500.00. The Agreement did not address the level of child support in accordance with the Federal Child Support Guidelines, nor did it provide for practical retaining by the Respondent to facilitate employment. This was an exceptional situation that required some adjustment to the Agreement reached by the parties. The court ordered the establishment of a retraining fund of $6,500.00 with direct payments to whatever institution the Respondent may choose. Limited spousal support was to terminate on the earlier of completion of the retraining allowance or transfer of the balance of the outstanding to the Respondent on September 1st, 2001. An adjustment was also made to account for arrears in child support and child support payments.","The parties entered into a Partial Agreement and Minutes of Settlement in 2000. The Agreement provided for joint care and custody with the primary residence being with the mother and the responsibility for their day to day care. The parties separated in 1996 and there have been a number of interim applications and interim orders. HELD: The Divorce Judgment will be issued forthwith. 1)The parties had never had any financial stability in part because they far too readily accessed credit based on future expectations of capacity that had never been realized and they would be wise to cease utilization of credit for short term relief. Doing so in the long run imperils the ability to provide properly for the children. 2)The Agreement did not address the level of child support in accordance with the Federal Child Support Guidelines in effect nor did it provide a limited capacity or practical retraining by the petitioner to facilitate employment. Quite possibly, s.15(3) of the Divorce Act would have been invoked."
5_1995canlii4187.txt,"This was an appeal from the conviction of the appellant that he broke and entered a used car dealership and stole a vehicle, contrary to s. 348(1)(b) of the Criminal Code. The theft was reported to police by a passing motorist who saw the vehicle being driven off the car lot early in the morning. The vehicle was spotted on the highway, and when stopped, was exited by two individuals. Two officers followed tracks through a wooded area, and noted that in two areas the tracks broke through ice on a brook. Shortly thereafter the appellant came out of the woods on a nearby road; his lower body was wet and chunks of ice and snow clung to his clothing. The imprint of his footwear resembled that of the tracks in the snow. The appellant was convicted, based on the doctrine of recent possession. He argued there was no evidence he was in recent possession of the stolen vehicle. Dismissing the appeal, that there was sufficient evidence to support the findings of fact made by the trial judge.

The Court was required to decide whether the questions were the proper subject matter of a stated case.

The Court was substantially in agreement with the submissions of counsel for the respondent that this Court should decline to answer questions submitted to it by the applicant. These questions are eight in number but when broken down into their several parts, result in some forty questions. The questions are not responsive to the evidence or to any determination made to date in the case and, indeed, by their very wording are speculative and hypothetical.

The defendants had previously been permitted to re-open judgments obtained against them and had filed defences. Prior to that they had consistently failed to attend examinations in aid of execution. Contempt proceedings had been commenced against them but were adjourned sine die at the time the defendants were permitted to defend. The defendants resisted the application on the basis that they were now non-residents and not compellable by an appointment, and that the designated officer of the defendant corporation was no longer an officer. This information had not been communicated to the plaintiff's solicitor who had acted in good faith on information given to him previously by the solicitors for the defendants. The examinations had been scheduled unilaterally because the defendants' solicitor consistently refused or neglected to return phone calls or correspondence from the plaintiff's solicitors. HELD: The judge refused to strike the defences holding that in the circumstances Queen's Bench Rule 231 did not apply. He also held that the defendants, considering their conduct throughout the whole course of the lawsuit, were in contempt and ordered them to attend without conduct money any examinations unilaterally scheduled by the plaintiff failing agreement between counsel as to dates.

None of the calls were returned. The plaintiff's solicitors also failed to provide written notice of the person who it proposed is the proper officer to be examined on its behalf.

In a letter to the union, the employer confirmed the wage increases provided for in the agreement would be paid to the employees as a lump sum following the expiration of the legislated wage freeze. After the expiration of the wage freeze, however, the employer refused to pay the lump sum on the grounds that it would contravene the Act. The union sued the employer in the Supreme Court, claiming the lump sum or, in the alternative, damages for negligent misrepresentation. The employer applied to strike the Statement of Claim on the grounds that the union's claims were within the exclusive jurisdiction of an arbitrator. The Chambers judge dismissed the application. The employer appealed. Allowing the appeal and staying the action pending submission to arbitration as provided for in the collective agreement, that the Chambers judge erred in allowing the action to continue. Where there is a doubt about the arbitrability of a dispute, that issue should generally be determined at arbitration. This reflects the central role of arbitration in collective bargaining labour relations, recognizes that arbitration is the forum best suited to conducting the necessary inquiry, and helps ensure that no one, absent sound reasons, will be left with rights but no effective remedy.","The employer appealed a Chambers judge's decision to strike out the union's statement of claim on the grounds that the collective agreement's claims were within the exclusive jurisdiction of an arbitrator. The employer appealed, seeking leave for this purpose. Dismissing the appeal, that the chambers judge erred in allowing the court action to continue.

The respondent's farming income was determined on a 3 year average as it varied from year to year. The facts justified adding back 25% of the capital cost allowance on the machinery over the last 3 years for Guideline purposes. Day care and play school costs of $440 per month were to be divided according to their proportionate share based on the Guidelines. The respondent was to pay one-half of the cost of extra curricular activities and any future activities as agreed upon. The approach used in Cook v. Kilduff was adopted and the amount for the two natural children was deducted from the amount payable for three children. One-half of the difference was added to the Guideline amount of support for the two children. 4)Spousal support was not ordered. The mother was employed and the respondent's income was not likely to increase in the near future. Given he paid child support and the extra costs, their income was nearly the same. 5)Of the six quarter sections owned by the respondent prior to marriage, there was no equity in one and the increase in value in the others was marginal.

Absent evidence as to how the plaintiff arrived at the information used in the calculation of the forecasted tonnages, no negligent misrepresentation could be found, as there was no evidence that the information was negligently obtained.

HELD: 1)The nature of the work was to be construed by the wording in the contract; any variation in wording between the 1984 invitation for tenders and the 1985 invitation for tender is inconsequential. The plaintiff was required to maintain and service the banks and in order to do this it was necessary to remove snow from the areas in which coal was being banked and to substitute from other sources at the contractor's expense if Devco deemed it was in position to have its equipment on site. 2)The equipment supplied by Roper was not the same type and model of equipment as it listed in the response to the tender, and no objection appeared to have been taken with the equipment delivered to the site. 3)Costs were to be determined based on the estimate in respect to banking and blending of coal. 4)The defendant was to pay on the weights determined at the weight scale."
8_2010nssc219.txt,"The parties' hostility prevented them from reaching an agreement on interim parenting arrangements for their two-and-a-half-year-old child. There was a no contact order in place pending the outcome of domestic violence charges against the father (who had not seen the child for four months). The mother had nothing positive to say about him. They disagreed about the extent of his marijuana use, and the extent of his involvement with the child. He agreed to abstain from drugs around the child and for 12 hours before access. The mother expressed concern the father was a flight risk because he was from Egypt and had family support outside the country. Sole custody to the mother, with supervised access for a period of time (to reintroduce the father to the child), moving to increasingly longer periods of daytime access. The father must complete a parenting course to better learn how to meet the child's various needs. There was insufficient evidence to show he is unable to protect the child from her severe nut allergy. There was insufficient evidence to establish he is a flight risk. Even if he had threatened to flee with the child, it is relevant that he lacks the means to do so. While there has been unpleasantness and some violence between the parties, the evidence does not establish domestic violence of a nature that would require supervised access on an ongoing basis.",The mother sought to have the Father's access supervised. The father was an abuser of marijuana and because of this abuse the child was at risk if in his care unsupervised. The mother was concerned that the father would be able to obtain an Egyptian passport for their daughter and remove her permanently from Nova Scotia. The Father had not had contact with the child since January 2010. HELD: 1)The father was to attend a course in parenting such as those offered by Family SOS so that he would be better prepared to take on these tasks in the future. 2)The mother was to have access supervised for two to three hours per week. 3)The Father was not to be under the influence of any non-prescription drug 12 hours before and while he had the child in his custody. 4)There was no evidence of threats to harm the child or that the Father would physically harm her.
e_1996canlii7080.txt,"FIAT. The Crown applied to have a witness, who was an unindicted co-conspirator and separately charged with drug offences arising out of the same investigation, declared adverse pursuant to s9 of the Canada Evidence Act. She had contradicted her prior video taped statement made shortly after her arrest and had demonstrated hostile attitude towards the Crown. The defence took the position that she was now telling the truth; that the statement was improperly obtained in breach of the confession rules of voluntariness and the statement did not meet the requirements set out in R. v. K.G.B. HELD: The witness' prior statement may be introduced in evidence for the substantive truth of its contents. It will be for the jury to decide what, if any, portions of such statement they wish to accept. 1)A prior inconsistent statement cannot be introduced in evidence for its substantive content, unless the requirement of necessity, and a threshold of reliability arrived at on a balance of probabilities are established. When, as here, a witness recants, the requirement of necessity is established. The real issue is whether the prior statement meets the test for reliability. When, as here, there is only one demonstrably false piece of testimony in the statement, which does not implicate anyone but rather attempts to exonerate someone, the Court was not prepared to say ipso facto the statement is unreliable. 2)The independent evidence sufficiently corroborated her statement in enough different particulars that, but for the demonstrably false portion, it met the threshold of reliability.","FIAT. The Crown applied to have the witness declared adverse pursuant to s. 9 of the Canada Evidence Act on the basis that in the course of giving her evidence, she has demonstrated ahostile attitude towards the position of the Crown, and hascontradicted in a substantial way, her prior video-taped statement to police officers made shortly after her arrest. HELD: 1)The statement was improperly obtained in breach of the Confession rules of voluntariness.  2)The oath was not administered prior to the taking of the statement, and there was no warning provided at that time, of the perjury consequences of not telling the truth. 3)Annette Cook concluded she could help herself, as opposed to hurt herself, in making the statement she did. It was a business decision regularly made by accused persons who are asked to cooperate. As such, it follows that Annette Cook's prior statement maybe introduced in evidence for the substantive truth of its character. It will be for the jury to decide after receiving appropriate instructions with respect to the evidence of an individual who has provided credible testimony, what, if any portions of such statement they wish to accept."
e_1999canlii1479.txt,"The respondent was recruited by the respondents. Her job was to start quality assurance practice. She accepted an offer of employment, giving up her own company to do so. After 15 months she was dismissed. The trial judge in her action for wrongful dismissal and negligent misrepresentation did not find any negligent misrepresentation but awarded damages equivalent to five months notice for wrongful dismissal.

The respondent cross-appealed the damage award, claiming the trial judge failed to take into account the appellant's failure to mitigate. Appeal and cross-appeal, that the evidence supports the trial judge's findings, and he did not make any errors in law.",HELD: The appeal was dismissed. The trial judge did not accept the appellant's submissions that the respondents misrepresented the nature of the employment opportunity. The evidence did not support the trial judge's factual finding that there had been such misrepresentation. The Court of Appeal reversed the judgment and dismissed the action on the basis that the misrepresentation was not 'negligent' and the term in the contract providing for dismissal on notice was an effective disclaimer precluding any separate action in tort.

The conduct of examination for discovery and undertakings can provide the defendant with particulars of allegations to be made by the plaintiff in order to permit it to properly defend the action.  3) The Government demanded full particulars of the breach of trust and breach of fiduciary duty. The plaintiff's response does not lay a foundation for either and the paragraphs are struck.  4) The court was satisfied that exemplary damages and punitive damages were synonymous and therefore only one of them should be pled to avoid confusion. The court directed that any reference to exemplary damages should be read as to include punitive damages and that only one phrase should be used. 5) As the cause of action clearly predates the coming into force of The Pre-judgment Interest Act, the provisions of that Act have no application to the plaintiff's claim.","The Government sought an order pursuant to Rule 164(4) of the Queen's Bench Rules requiring the defendant to provide better particulars in response to its demand for particulars and in default of so doing striking the offending portions of the statement of claim.
