Allowing the application, that although the wife upgraded her education during the marriage with encouragement and financial support from the husband, she was entitled to maintenance for an indefinite period. The court reviewed the means and needs of the parties and awarded spousal in addition to child maintenance. The court recognized the indirect financial consequences to a custodial parent in raising children.","The wife sought a divorce, as well as maintenance for herself and the five year old daughter of the marriage. The parties had been married 10 years, and had been together for 10 years. The wife sought to have the Separation Agreement and Minutes of Settlement incorporated into a Corollary Relief Judgment. The husband, who had recently retired from his work as a bar manager, sought reasonable access upon reasonable notice. The mother, who was the primary caregiver to the child, was an innately intelligent and ambitious person. The Court awarded monthly maintenance to the wife to terminate in years; the support deadline should not be placed upon her when she has the direct responsibility of raising the child and when the availability of more gainful employment within the foreseeable future is uncertain. On the basis of the $1,500 monthly maintenance, the combined maintenance should not exceed $2,200 and cease in June 1995 and continue only for the child at the rate of $600."
1994canlii4796.txt,"The Applicant participated in a group retirement savings plan ('GRSP') created by Crown Life for its employees. The GRSP provided for an annuity income on retirement for each participating employee. To finance her contribution to the GRSP, she secured an interest-free loan from Crown Life and pledged her interest in the GRSP as security for the loan. Subsequent to leaving her employment with Crown Life, she refused to repay her loan and requested that her contributions to the GRSP be transferred to another carrier. When Crown Life refused, she applied under s.63 of the PPSA for an order declaring that Crown Life's security interest in the GRSP offended s. 146(2)(c.3) of the Income Tax Act which prohibits the taking of security in an RRSP in certain circumstances. She also sought orders requiring Crown Life to comply with her request to transfer her contributions and restraining Crown Life from realizing on its security. HELD: Application dismissed. 1)The terms of the GRSP and the security agreement in this case did not offend s.146(2)(c.3) of the Income Tax Act. 2)If the terms of the GRSP were breached by Crown Life, damages would be an adequate remedy. The Applicant's request for a restraining order was therefore refused. 3)Under the terms of the GRSP contract, Crown Life was not entitled to collapse the Plan. 4)No amount was due out of the Plan to the Applicant until she retired or made a proper request for a transfer. In this case her request for a transfer did not comply with the terms of the Plan. There was therefore nothing to which the security interest of Crown Life could attach until a proper request for a transfer was made or until the Applicant commenced her pension.","The applicant sought a declaration under s.63 of the Personal Property Security Act that her interest in a group registered retirement savings plan (later defined as the ""Group Plan"") was not subject to a security interest she granted to the applicant. She further sought an order restraining Crown Life from arbitrarily cancelling her participation in the Group Plan. HELD: The application for a restraining order was denied. 1)The provisions of s.146(2)(c.3) of the Income Tax Act do not apply to the application. The taking of security interest by way of a loan agreement contravenes s. 146(2) and s.147(3). 2)The applicant had not retired and there appeared to be no evidence of her having retired or of any other benefits arising from the retirement plan. The proposal to transfer the interest in the group plan as directed by her did not comply with s.7.03 of the Plan Contract. 3)Since the applicant was not a party to the planned contract, the provisions of the plan contract did not apply. The provisions of S.146/2(3) and the Income tax Act were of no assistance in light of the provisions s.8.03. 4)The loan agreement contained no provision enabling Crown Life to collapse the applicant's account in the plan and thereby create an attachable pension refund. 5)Since Ms. Corscadden has not retired the benefits from the plan will be payable immediately upon her reaching the age of 65, there appears to be aproper request for a transfer. The Group Plan falls squarely within the provisions in s.150(2(a) and (13)of the IncomeTax Act and the reasons in Phenix are similar. 6)The provision that Crown Life is entitled to attach the resulting proceeds pursuant to the terms of the loan agreement in the same manner as the secured party did in Re Dowe and Re Berman. 7)The application for restraining order is denied. 8)Whether Crown Life can realize on its part that the taking of the security interest that was granted to her in the form of a letter to the effect that the proceeds of the sale are to be paid to the designated Transferee are to that purpose. 9)Whether the applicant has complied with the requirements of the Part II Plan Contract relating to transfers is a question for determination. 10)Whether there was a breach of the terms and the arrangements in the Plan contract between the applicant and Crown Life. 11)Whether it can realize that the applicant is paying the"

Under the terms of the collective agreement in force, the employee was actually paid 4 hours pay in excess of the Act's requirements for each of the weeks in question.

The petitioner had agreed to pay $3,000 per month which included child support but the support was reduced to $1,000 and was irregular and late. The two children were living with the petitioner and although old enough to hold jobs, had been unable to find employment. The petitioner's income exceeded $80,000 annually but he had been suspended with pay and the status of his employment was uncertain. HELD: 1)It was premature to fix the amount of spousal maintenance as asked for by the applicant. There were too many unknowns including the future of the petitioner's future job and income and how much the applicant would require should she go to university in the fall and what the children would do about future education. 2)The petitioner was not entitled to unilaterally reduce the maintenance. 3)The petitioner was directed to pay $1,500 plus $200.00 per month until the shortfall was paid in full.  4)The applicant was awarded costs of the application.","FIAT. The parties separated in the summer of 1994. All other issues raised in the divorce proceeding were left in abeyance including the issue of spousal maintenance. The husband had reduced the monthly support to $1,000 for the months of September through December 1995 and then reduced it to $900 per month in April and then to $3,000 in May. HELD: 1)The application was premature. There were too many unknown factors surrounding the future situation of either party to conclude that what the applicant asks for is fair and reasonable. There was uncertainty of the husband's future job and income. There is uncertainty as to what he will require if he does go to a university this fall. There are uncertainty asto what the children of the marriage might do about future education. 2)The petitioner had unilaterally reduced the child support from $1 million to $500 for the month of September and then $1 in April. 3)The respondent was not entitled to unilaterally reduce the $1500 maintenance he consistently paid up to December 1995 to $800 without at least consulting with the applicant. She was entitled to vary the amount of maintenance he had consistently paid in the interim. 4)Since the petitioner had not consulted with the husband on the matter, the application should have been directed to the petitioner. 5)The court was of the opinion that the petitioner was entitled only to direct the court to take the appropriate steps in the direction of rehabilitation and/or maintenance."
1997canlii787.txt,"After a sub-contractor failed to complete its contract work, the plaintiff, a supplier of materials to the sub-contractor sued the general contractor and the surety under the terms of a labour and Material Payment Bond for payment of a balance owing to it by the sub-contractor. The Bond contained a provision limiting the liability of the surety and the principal to make payment to any claimant not having a contract directly with the principal. Dismissing the action with costs, that there was no evidence of intention to contract, valuable consideration, or binding promise to pay between the general contractor and the supplier. With respect to the principal, as the Bond limits the liability of the surety and principal to make payment to a claimant such as the plaintiff not having a contract directly with the principal, liability is limited by the Bond to the amount which the principal would have been obliged to pay to the plaintiff if the provisions of the Mechanics' Lien Act applied to the work. As the contract was with the Crown, and the Act is not binding on the Crown, the general contractor was not obliged to pay anything to the plaintiff. Therefore, the supplier was not entitled to recover against the surety under the Bond.","After a sub-contractor failed to complete its contract work, a supplier of materials to the sub contractor sued the general contractor and the surety under the terms of a Labour and Material Payment Bond for payment of a balance owing to it by the subcontractor. The contract stipulated that the respondent would be entitled to recover any amount owing to the subcontractor. In the absence of a contract, the respondent could not have obtained a contract directly with the principal. The Mechanics' Lien Act does not expressly state that it binds the Crown. Therefore, the contract did not apply. The respondent was relying on the statutory liens to avoid paying under the Bond while, at the same time, resists paying the statutory lien fund on the basis that there is no money owing to All Ports until such time as it completed the subcontract. HELD: 1)The claims of the plaintiff against the respondent and London Guarantee were dismissed. 2)If the Mechanics'Lien Act had been applicable, the plaintiff would not have been entitled to recovered anything due to the third party statutory liENS. 3)If it was not applicable, then the respondent's claim against the subcontractors would be dismissed. 4)The respondent would pay the costs of Rideau Construction and London guaranteeee which, because they are represented by the same counsel, will be single amount as may be agreed upon between counsel or, if agreement is not possible, will set by the Court at the time an Order for Judgment is taken out."
1999canlii12427.txt,The accused was charged with sexual assault and touching contrary to s.271(1) and 153 of the Criminal Code. The alleged offences occurred in the complainant's home when she was between the ages of 13 and 15. HELD: The accused was found not guilty on both counts. 1)There was insufficient confirmatory evidence for proof of guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. The evidence showed an escalating pattern of intrusive behaviour by the accused who admitted to touching her on two occasions and to have been on top of her once. His explanation that he fell on her was farfetched but the other explanations were not outlandish. None of the complainant's allegations involved alcohol nor was drunkenness alleged to be a factor. The evidence of the complainant's depression or withdrawal could have other explanations.,The accused was charged with offences contrary to s. 271(1) and s. 153 of the Criminal Code. The evidence of the complainant was that the accused touched her vagina and breasts numerous times on a regular basis. He often slept on the couch or in the living room adjacent to the room where the family watched TV. There was a couch or love-seat in the house adjacent to where the complainant usually stayed up at least until midnight. Sometimes he would walk into the bedroom and have sex with her. She called the police. The accused was convicted of both charges. HELD: 1)There was insufficient evidence to confirm the accused's innocence. The circumstantial evidence was not strong enough to confirm his evidence. The Crown's evidence was found to be beyond the reasonable doubt. 2)The accused is not guilty of either charge. His behaviour is not dangerous. His explanations are not questioned. His anger and frustration are with the Court and not with the Judge. There is insufficient evidence surrounding the Crown's guilt. The Court cannot conclude that his behaviour is dangerous. It would be perverse to have the Court believe that his evidence is not supported by the evidence surrounding his allegations. There would not be sufficient evidence to convict the Judge of his or his other crimes. The Judge would not have taken judicial notice of this evidence. His explanation of his behaviour and the fact that he is prone to sexual assault is beyond the scope of this article. 3)The Court was unable to take judicial notice because of the repeated assaults by the accused.

2001skqb485.txt,"The accused was charged with ten counts including robbery, aggravated assault, assault causing bodily harm, possession of stolen property and trafficking in narcotics. She raised s.9 and 8 of the Charter in objecting to the arrest and seizure of the duffel bag. The voir dire occupied 5 days. HELD: 1)The four requirements set out in R. v. Feeney for a warrantless search were satisfied. The arrest was lawful. The search of the house and seizure of the duffel bag was incidental to the arrest and therefore lawful. 2)The accused had no expectation of privacy with respect to either her friend's residence or the bag. The decision in R. v. Edwards was squarely on point. There was no evidence tying the accused to the gym bag. It was of a different description than the one used in the drugstore robbery. The accused never asserted ownership of the bag or made any claim to any interest or right with respect to it. The gym bag constituted non-conscriptive evidence. 3)If there were any violations of the accused's Charter rights (and it was concluded there were not) they were of a minor nature and not sufficient to engage the provisions of s.24(2) of the Charter. To exclude the evidence would bring the administration of justice into disrepute.","The accused objected to her arrest and to the seizure of a duffel bag containing a quantity of narcotics. The police conducted a voir dire as result at the opening of the trial. A great deal of evidence was presented, the majority of which was elicited in very detailed and extended cross-examination. The accused also called evidence on the voir dave but did not testify. HELD: The arrest was lawful. The search of the house and the seizure were incidental to the arrest. The Court found the accused's arrest was justified. The restriction that the search must be truly incidental in the arrest means that the police must be attempting to achieve some valid purpose connected to the arrested. Whether such an objective exists will depend on what the Crown were looking for. 1) The search must not affect a personal right of the accused. If the Crown is relying for authorization is the common law doctrine of search incident to arrest, then the limits of this doctrine must be respected. If there were any violations of the individual's rights under the Charter, the accused had no expectation of privacy in Moose Jaw. The evidence in question was a bag of dark narcotics. It was of a different description than the one used in the Nordon robbery. The bag constituted non-conscriptive evidence, another factor which must bear in mind in light of the suggestion that the evidence should be excluded under s. 24(2) of the Charter. 2) If there have been any breaches of an accused's rights, and the accused has been here before, there must be a valid objective served by the search. To exclude the evidence in this case would, in fact, bring the administration of justice into manifest disrepute. 3) The Court held that if there were some violations of this accused's s. 8 Charter rights under it, they were of a minor nature and certainly not sufficiently egregious to engage the provisions of s.24(2)(2) within the territorial jurisdiction in which the person is found. The reasonableness of the expectation in question must be reasonable one. 4) The police must have one of the purposes for a valid search incident in mind when the search is conducted. Further, the officer's belief that this purpose will be served must be reasonably one. The court also held that the gym bag constituted a noncriptive piece of evidence. The appeal court dismissed the appeal."

The plaintiffs' counsel was under extreme pressure and lot of stress lately with respect to this file and others and therefore had prepared three motions which were fairly similar to one another. In his confusion he had filed some and not filed others.

Ace had been subpoenaed and had been sitting in the Court listening to other Crown witnesses. Defence counsel objected and claimed the Crown had not disclosed this witness. Ace was also a client of defence counsel and so defence counsel would not be able to cross-examine Ace.

After hearing evidence from the home owners, co-accused and peace officers who investigated the incidents, the Crown advised the court of its intention to call one Ace Carlos Whitecap to the witness box.

The Crown counsel argued that although the Crown's specific intention was to call Whitecap as a witness had not been disclosed to the defence and therefore, he would not be able to cross-examine effectively or at all. HELD: The accused was not permitted to give evidence in this trial. A stay of proceedings was ruled out. The accused's right to full answer and defence had been prejudiced only with respect to the cross-examination of Whitecap.

2005nssc364.txt,"The Agency applied for permanent care of a young child, with no access to the parents. Each of the mother, the biological father and the psychological father sought to have the child placed in their care. The child had been apprehended due to unsafe and unhealthy living conditions. The mother and psychological father no longer lived together and for the past few months, the mother had been maintaining a clean and tidy apartment and attempting to improve her education and had taken parenting courses. The psychological father, with whom the mother had ended a tumultuous relationship, wanted the child returned to his care, stating that he planned on residing with the mother who would assist him in caring for the child. The mother was against this plan. The biological father only reappeared on the scene after the child was taken into care and acknowledged that the child did not know him as her father. Child placed in the permanent care of the Agency with no access to the mother or the psychological father; access ordered to the biological father for a period of six months at which time the access order will expire automatically unless an application to vary is made; the Agency is to arrange for a parental capacity assessment of the biological father. The child continued to be at substantial risk of physical harm due to neglect if she was returned to the mother's care and the child would be at risk of exposure to violence if returned to the psychological father's care due to the tumultuous relationship between the mother and him. Although some improvements had recently been made in the mother's life, she had a history of frequent changes of residence and did not appear able put the child's needs ahead of her own. The Agency had not had an opportunity to assess the appropriateness of a placement with the biological father.","The agency applied for an order of permanent care and custody with no provision for access to the child. The mother opposed the application and requested an order returning the child to her care. The biological father who had minimal contact with the child was added as a party to the order. The Agency alleged that the child had been in the care of the Agency for more than three years and that there had been a substantial risk of physical harm caused by the mother and psychological father's failure to supervise the child and that the risk of her safety had not gone away. The child had a long history of involvement with the Agency. The agency alleged that its child was at risk of harm because of instability in the home, its repeated moves and its repeated incidents of violence. The respondent mother alleged that her daughter had been touched inappropriately by her father and that her relationship with him had changed. The Respondents denied any involvement with her daughter and suggested that counselling be ordered with the mother's assistance. The father's application for standing was granted on September 15, 2005. HELD: The burden of proof in proceeding such as this was clearly on the Agency as it had regard to the seriousness of the consequences of the decision and the agency's claim that the agency had failed to protect the child due to its failure to conduct proper child protection and supervision. There was no evidence that the Respondents had obstructed the child's path to freedom or that they had failed in any meaningful way in order to protect their child. No evidence was obtained as a result of the application nor of any subsequent subsequent access by the Respondent or any other agency. The only evidence was that the respondent mother and her daughter were unable to contact each other and there was a risk that the biological father would harm the child if he were to contact her and the mother would suffer harm if he did not have access to her daughter. There were no credible allegations of domestic or sexual abuse against the respondent parents and the evidence did not support the respondent father's allegations. The court ordered the respondent to attend and complete anger management counselling. Counsel for the Agency was not able to represent either party. The applicant was granted standing on the basis that she failed to comply with certain conditions of the protection order."

2006nssc139.txt,"The wife sought to have the terms of the parties' separation agreement incorporated into the corollary relief judgment following a four year marriage. The husband sought to vary the provisions of the agreement regarding spousal and child support on the basis that the particulars of the agreement did not reflect his net business income derived from self-employment. The husband argued that he had entered into the separation agreement (which provided for joint custody of their young child, gave the wife all of the matrimonial assets with the exception of the husband's vehicle, and provided for spousal support in the amount of $600 per month for 15 years) only as an attempt to have the wife stay in the local area with the child. The wife had since moved with the child to New Brunswick where she was living with her parents and attending university; she was renting out the matrimonial home. Pursuant to the current court order, she was contributing the sum of $140 per month to the husband's access costs. Husband's current income set and child support awarded; the husband shall be responsible for 50 percent of the after tax child care costs; an additional $300 of spousal support ordered per month while the child remains in New Brunswick to address the access costs in the mother's budget; spousal support is reviewable in the event that these circumstances change, and at any rate, upon the completion of the mother's current degree; the mother shall not remove the child from the Province of New Brunswick to live in any other province without the father's consent. Although the court could not interfere with the agreement under s. 29 of the Matrimonial Property Act, the spousal and child support geared at keeping the wife in the local area and ensuring that her needs were addressed had all changed and a new arrangement was necessary to reflect the access costs among other issues. The wife had chosen to move away from child care services provided by the family that were practically free, as well as significant financial support and the ability to work in the furniture business with her father-in-law; she was not now pursuing a line of education which would build on her previous skills. Her educational expenses ought not be the basis for assessing spousal support and the duration of support set out in the separation agreement far exceeded what might be imposed by a court given the years they were together and their income disparity. The court reviewed the husband's history of income and expenses in setting his income for child support purposes.","The wife commenced divorce proceedings in November 2004.She sought custody, access, child support, spousal support and costs with a division of property. The husband sought a variation of the provisions regarding child support and child support. It was his position that the particulars of the agreement did not and do not now reflect his net business income derived from self employment. The father sought an increase in access. The mother filed an answer and counter petition seeking custody/access, child care and costs. He sought to vary the provisions of the Separation Agreement. HELD: 1) The Separation agreement clearly favours the mother. It is clearly unequal favouring the father. There is no evidence to suggest it was unconscionable. It's entirely foreseeable that mobility would become an issue at some point. No one prevented the father from expressly addressing this point before the agreement was entered into. The court ought not to interfere with the agreement between the parties. However, in light of the fact that there are significant changes in the circumstances of the parties the court can review the terms of the separation agreement in this divorce proceeding and set an appropriate amount of support. 2) The parties agreed to a mobility restriction clause which allowed the father to have access to the matrimonial home. He was prepared to pay child and spouse support in an amount that was not justified by his actual income or the circumstances surrounding his residence. There was no evidence of undue influence, fraud or evidence that would affect the parties ability to retain and instruct counsel. 3) The father agreed to the terms in order to keep his child in the home. The Court was satisfied that all jurisdictional elements had been proven. There were no adverse impacts on the mother's ability to manage her time and resources in a traditional manner. 4) The mother had the opportunity to consult with independent counsel. She had the option to opt out of the punitive elements (spousal, child and drug costs) if she wished. She received the support she needed from the paternal grandparents and they were prepared to provide her with the equity in their matrimonium home. She did not have to pay any of the household expenses. 5) There was nothing that would allow the Court to intervene if the contract was not in accord with their true financial circumstances."
2006skqb382.txt,"The petitioner seeks child and spousal support. The parties signed a separation agreement and interspousal contract in July 2004. With respect to spousal support the agreement provides that it is the intention of the parties that spousal support will be based on a division of income until July 1, 2011.HELD: 1) The petitioner seeks a spousal support order in which the court is asked to impute income and then apply the provisions of their interspousal contract to determine quantum. The interspousal contract does not contemplate variation of the spousal support obligation in the event of a material change of circumstance. It will be for the trial judge to determine the intention of the parties when the agreement makes reference to the adjustments which 'will consider Technologies likely future earnings based upon whether Paul's contract is renewed with the Provincial Government'. This is not an appropriate case in which to make an order for interim spousal support. The petitioner is entitled to support under the agreement and in the circumstances as they presently exist. 2) With regard to child support, there is no question that Melanie remains a child of the marriage while she is attending her educational program. Insofar at the respondent's income is concerned, the gross income to the corporation is $65,000 per year. The respondent provided a pay stub for May 2006. It is not really a pay stub, but extrapolating from that statement the court concluded that the respondent's gross taxable income from the corporation as a result of the $65,000 contract is approximately $53,000. Child support will be ordered based on $53,000 on an interim basis.","The petitioner sought child support and spousal support pending trial. The parties signed a separation agreement in July 2004. The agreement provided that the respondent was to pay one half of the net income to the petitioner by way of equal monthly payments of spousals. The interspousal contract provided that support would be based on division of income until July 2011. The petitioner had been taking home study courses toward certification in the practice of homoepathy although she had done little of this since December 2004. She hoped to complete the program in the fall of 2006. The respondent and the petitioner had signed a comprehensive agreement which dealt with parenting, child support, spousaling, and the division of family property. The sole source of revenue of the corporation was revenue earned by the respondent's efforts as a computer consultant. In 2005 he earned revenue as computer consultant of $124,128. In 2006 he earned income as a shareable amount of Technologies. The wife brought an application to set aside the settlement agreement on the grounds of undue influence and duress or alternatively that the agreement was unfair and unconscionable. HELD: The application was dismissed.  1)The agreement was not in breach of the terms of the contract. 2)The petitioner was entitled to support under the agreement and the circumstances as they presently existed. The court would be careful not to pre-judge the issue and thereby usurp the role of the trial judge. 3)There were no circumstances in which it was appropriate to vary an agreement that the parties had relied upon in structuring their affairs on an interim basis. If interim relief is granted which flies in the face of an agreement, and that agreement is subsequently upheld at trial, the fairness and equity of the interim order may be brought into question.  4)The parties agreed the agreement would constitute a full and sufficient waiver of all rights. It would include any changes either foreseeable or not foreseeable, radical changes or changes that may be causally related to the marriage.  5)The respondent was ordered to pay $65,000 in spousousal and child support in the amount of $741 per month for the support of their two children. The amount payable shall be reduced in an amount equal to 40% of the petitioner's income that she has earned. The adjustment will consider Technologies likely future earnings based upon whether the respondent has renewed his contract with the Provincial Government or not. Should there be a discrepancy between the actual income and anticipated income, the amount will be adjusted when the final amounts are"
2007skqb376.txt,"The respondent applies for an order varying the custody order by changing the primary residence from the petitioner to the respondent. HELD: 1) The present circumstances are remarkably similar to the circumstances in Bzowey v. Bzowey, 2005 SKQB 12. In both cases, the Court is asked to make the change based solely on the wishes of the child. There is even evidence from the custody and access report from 2005 that the children, or at least the older child, Jill, expressed similar sentiments about living with her mother. It cannot even be strenuously argued that the wishes of the child, Jill, have in fact changed. Those considerations were before the Court in the form of the custody and access report when the decision was made in 2005. 2) The Court should be loathe to make a variation order solely on the expressed wishes of a child of 11 or 12 years of age without some evidence as to why that current expression of interest has been stated. It may well be that the child truly does wish a change. It may also be that the child, as was referred to in the custody and access report, may be simply reflecting the views and therefore the pressures placed on the child by the non-custodial parent. 3) No evidence has been put forward about the negative impact of the continuation of the current order. There is no information before the Court to suggest that the current situation is no longer in the best interests of the children. No material change has been demonstrated. The application is dismissed.","The petitioner asks the court to vary the child support order granted to the respondent by changing the primary residence of the child to be with the father. The father argues that there has now been a clear declaration in two separate writings of the oldest child's desire to have primary residence change from her father to her mother. Further, there is some evidence that the younger child wishes to also live with her mother or, at the least, live in the same residence as her older sister. HELD: The application is dismissed. 1)As no material change has been demonstrated, this application must be dismissed. 2)There is no principle of law that the wish of a child is absolute and in itself determines the issue of custody. Such an approach would ignore the statutory mandate to take into consideration only the best interests of the children. 3)The children were born, have grown up, and continue to live, go to school and have friends in Nipawin. There is no information before the Court to suggest that this is no longer in the best interest of these children. 4)The test for variation has been set out in cases such as Talbot v. Henry (1990), 151 Sask. R. 168 (Sask. Q.B.) Gerein J. succinctly states the current approach of the court. In each case, the court is asked to make the change based solely on the wishes of the Child. There was a strong indication that at the time the decision was made in 2005, the child had expressed a desire to try living with the mother. She now expresses this desire in stronger terms but it is not change. 5)The court found that as no change had been demonstrated it dismissed the application."
2009skqb36.txt,"FIAT: This is an application to determine interim parenting for the child, Kaira, who is 2.5 years old. There is conflicting information about the nature and extent of the petitioner father's parenting duties. The respondent has chosen to move to Victoria to attend school. She applies as the primary parent to have the child go with her. The petitioner would like Kaira to remain in Saskatchewan and have regular contact with each parent on alternating weeks. HELD: 1) The residence status quo in this case is Regina and Kaira shall, pending trial, reside in Regina. The Court cannot determine on conflicting affidavits what the primary parent status quo is. 2) It is in the best interest that the child see both parents. There was a similar course in Saskatoon that the respondent could have taken which would have made more frequent changes possible, but her affidavit indicates she thinks the Saskatoon course is inferior to the one she is taking in Victoria. 3) Pending trial the child shall be parented by the petitioner for 28 days, and thereafter by the respondent for 28 days and such parenting shall continue to alternate for each 28 day period thereafter until further order. The costs of transportation shall be born primarily by the respondent.","FIAT: This is an application to determine interim parenting for the child. There is conflicting affidavit evidence respecting the nature and extent of the father's parenting duties while the parties lived together. The mother, Lesly, has chosen to move to Victoria to attend school. She applies as the primary parent to have the child with her. The issues of parenting and mobility are clearly unresolved and may go to trial. HELD: 1) The residence status quo in this case is Regina and Kaira shall, pending trial, reside in Regina. The primary parent status quo is Lesly. Lesly has chosen not to take school in Victoria but that does not mean that even if Lesly is theprimary parent that the child will continue to live in Regina or that she will have regular contact with each parent alternating each week. However it is fair that Lesly contribute something to this cost. 2) Lesly will pay for each occasion that Kairsa travels to Victoria for parenting time with Lesly and only for the trip from Regina to Victoria. The costs of transporting Kairas to and from Victoria shall be borne primarily by Lesly; however it was fair that Mike contribute something. 3) Costs in the cause were in the amount of $10,000. 4) The residential status quo was Regina and the child would, pending trials, reside there. The status quo would continue pending trial because Lesly had made some unilateral decisions about her education and the primary child had chosen to take her school course a third month longer than expected. The secondary child would reside with Lesley. 5) The distance from Regina and Victoria should not be in the way of any alternate location. The child had a strong bond with the father and his family. The support network is in Regina and not in Victoria. 6) The respondent shall pay for the costs of transport and the travel to Victoria by 9:30 a.m. of the 28th day of Lesly's parenting time. The respondent will contribute something in the cost. 7) The number of telephone numbers will be provided to the other parents. Each parent shall have telephone access to the child and the respondent shall contribute a portion of the cost to the cause."
2009skqb445.txt,"The accused is faced with a 24 count indictment associated with allegations of involvement in the sale of controlled substances. The motion, made pursuant to s. 7, 11 and 24 of the Charter of Rights is for an order that the accused 'be provided with full disclosure in a useable format'. The motion has two components. The first relates to the method in which disclosure has been provided, the 'useable format'. The second is whether full disclosure that would allow the accused to provide a full answer and defence has been provided.  The second issue is to be dealt with by a 'Laporte inventory', name for the procedure in R. v. Laporte (1993), 113 Sask. R. 34 (C.A.).HELD: 1) There are some 30,000 to 40,000 pages of disclosure made to the defence. In addition, there are 275 audio file, 50 video files and a large series of photos. The defence seeks photocopies of all officers' notebooks organized by date and officer. The basis of the defence's argument is firstly, equality of use or a level playing field should be created with respect to the provision of documents used by the Crown and, secondly, trial fairness requires the particulars of the police officers' notes be provided in the format requested. The defence argues that if the Crown is going to be using paper copies of some documentation because it finds that use more convenient and effective, then the defence should be provide with the same paper copies to level the playing field. 2) The defence has candidly advised that the issue surrounding the defence of a serious drug charge usually starts with the validity of the search warrant, and the information used by the police in obtaining the search is crucial, not just the information that was provided to the official issuing the warrant but any information that may have been withheld. The affidavits in support of the search warrants in this case are easily found in the database, and cross- referencing to the police officers' notes in support of that information is available. What is not easily available and, for the purposes of the Crown, not relatively important is the balance of the information that may have been obtained by the officer not disclosed by affidavit. This information is often crucial for the defence. 3) In this case, given the nature of the charges, the number of police officers involved in the investigation leading up to the issuance of the warrants and cost of obtaining hard copies, the Crown should provide hard copies of the notes made by police officers in the notebooks. It is ordered that the notebooks of those officers who will be testifying at trial are to be provided to the defence in hard copy in chronological order. In all other respects, the nature and format of the disclosure provided to date is appropriate in that it has been provided in a reasonably accessible manner which does not detract from the right of the accused to make full answer and defence.  4) A useful discussion of electronic disclosure and the issues involved is found in R. v. Piaskowski, 2007 MBQB 68, in which the Court reviews extensively the use of electronic disclosure as opposed to paper disclosure.","HELD: The motion was granted and the accused was to be provided with full disclosure in usable format. The issues were whether full disclosure would allow the accused to provide a full answer and defence and whether the format was appropriate. The issue to be dealt with by Laporte inventory was whether the Crown should embark upon an inquiry and make the appropriate order regarding further disclosure or should that issue be left to the trial judge. 1)The accused had been provided with all documents involved in the prosecution by way of electronic data stored on a hard drive. There is no need for the Crown to provide copies of any officers' notebooks in hard copy and chronological order that postdates the laying of the charges or the issuance of search warrants, whichever is dated later. In this case, the nature and format of disclosure provided to date is appropriate in that it has been provided in a reasonably accessible manner. This appears to be a reasonable resolution on the issue of trial fairness. 2)The disclosure provided was appropriate given the nature of the disclosure provided. The format was reasonably accessible and the amount of time it would take the defence to digest and re-examine the documents was minimal. The disclosure was appropriate because it allowed the defence an opportunity to review and review the relevant documents. 3)There was no need to provide hard copies of all documents. The Crown had the skill, sophistication and equipment to access the electronic data. The court was able to obtain hard copies in full. 4)The notebook format would be appropriate as well. The notes of those officers who provided information related to the issuing of the warrants were to be supplied to the defence in a hard copy format. 5)The format was reasonable as well as the nature. Sections of documents dealing with the provision of documents, including the officer's notes, would be provided to the court in a reasonable accessible manner and should not detract from the defence's right to make full answer. 6)The use of hard copies for trial preparation was appropriate in the circumstances of this case. 7)The nature of a document to be reasonably accessible, it would have to be in usable form. The notebooks of those officer who were involved in gathering information involved in obtaining the search warrants and those not testifying at trial are to be given to the defendant in hardcopy in a fashion that is reasonably accessible by the defendant."
2009skqb506.txt,"The appellant landlord and mother appeals from a decision of the Hearing Officer of the Office of the Residential Tenancies dismissing her claim for possession. The landlords are mother and son. The mother lives out of province for a number of years. She returns in summers to reside in the premises. This year she wanted to return to her premises on a full time basis. She found that her son had rented out a portion of the house to a Tenant and had signed a 3 year lease. She sought an order that the Tenant vacate the premises. The Hearing Officer found he had no jurisdiction to deal with the dispute between the two landlords. He found he could only deal with the situation between the landlords and the tenant and found that the tenant had signed a lease in good faith and is entitled to the rights the lease affords and is entitled to remain in the premises. HELD: There was no valid tenancy agreement. The Act only applies to tenancy agreements and to circumstances where rental units or residential property is validly rented by a landlord to a tenant. In the circumstances, the Hearing Officer did not have jurisdiction to deal with this dispute. However, the Hearing Officer did err in law in determining that the tenant was entitled to the rights that the lease affords. 1) A room in a house is a rental unit capable of being the subject of a tenancy. 2) Clearly there was no participation by both owners in entering into this lease agreement. Mr. Koch's evidence would lead to the opposite conclusion. There was no express consent of principal and agent.  3) The facts as described by the Hearing Officer do not support an agency by estoppel. This can arise where one person has acted so as to lead another to believe that he or she has authorized a third person, without any actual authority, to act on his behalf and that other person, in such belief, enters into a transaction with that third person. The tenant here was not aware that the mother was an owner and the mother did not lead the tenant to believe that her son was authorized to act on her behalf.","The tenant appealed a decision of the Office of Residential Tenancies. The tenant had signed a 3-year lease in the landlord's home and had attempted to rent it for the past three years. The landlord had refused to vacate and the tenant sought an order for possession pursuant to s. 20 of The Residential Tenancy Act. The hearing officer found that she did not have the jurisdiction to deal with the matter. Therefore, the tenant appealed. Allowing the appeal, that there was no valid tenancy agreement between the landlord and tenant and that the hearing officer erred in law by failing to make an order respecting the rights that the tenant had. The Hearing Officer also made an error in law in determining that the landlord was the sole owner of the property. HELD: The appeal is dismissed. 1) The tenancy agreement was found to be valid.  2) There was no breach of the tenants' rights by the hearing officers. 3) The Hearing officer did not err in determining the tenant was entitled to the rights of the rental unit. 4) The tenant was not prejudiced by any error or omission in the written agreement.  5) Section 70 of the residential tenancy agreement provides that a landlord may enter a tenancy agreement with a tenant if certain conditions must be met, including the right to share in the rent. 6) Section 7 of the tenancy agreement prohibits the use of the term tenancy by another person except in exceptional circumstances. 7) Section 8 of the Act provides for the equitable sharing of the rent between the tenant and landlord. 8) The tenants had entered into a written tenancy agreement in good faith and believed the landlord, their son and the landlord were the sole owners of the home. 9) Section 10 of the Charter provides that the tenants have the exclusive right of tenancy to rental units. 10) The Act applies to tenancy agreements, rental units and other residential property. 11) The Court held that it was in the interest of the tenant to have the property seized by the landlord in order for the landlord to have it returned to its rightful owner. 12) Section 13 of the Trade Union Act provides that certain goods and services be given to the tenant by means of Section 7 and the Trade Unions Act. 13) Section 20 of the CEA provides that to create fixed term tenancy of three months or longer, the landlord must enter a written agreement and the Hearing Officer made an errors in law finding she had no jurisdiction. 14) Section 21 of the Saskatchewan Act gives the powers to a landlord to create a rental unit and to"
2010skqb145.txt,"The parties were in a relationship for over 5 years though they never married. The petitioner now seeks access to the respondent's daughter from an earlier relationship. The parties' relationship was tumultuous and included some incidents of domestic violence, which the child may have been exposed to. There are concerns regarding the interactions between the respondent's daughter and the petitioner's own children. The petitioner must establish, firstly, that he has 'sufficient interest' to bring this application, per s. 6(1) of The Children's Law Act, 1997. HELD: The application for access is dismissed. In determining whether a non-family applicant is a person with a sufficient interest, the Court must consider a variety of factors including: the extent or degree of the applicant's involvement in the child's life, the duration of that involvement, the level of intimacy and the quality of the relationship between the applicant and the child, how the relationship between the applicant and the child was represented to the world, and whether the applicant provided financially for the child. The petitioner has demonstrated that he is a person of sufficient interest; the relationship between the parties was not short and, during its lifespan, the petitioner formed a close bond with the child and was involved with her life. The community viewed them generally as father and daughter. However, the Court cannot conclude that requiring the child to visit the petitioner would be of any benefit to her. This child has already had to contend with multiple 'fathers' and multiple 'siblings', many of whom have been only temporary or fleeting personalities in her life. The confusion that this has no doubt caused her should not be further compounded by requiring her to make even more adjustments in her understanding of what 'family' means. Access to the petitioner is not in the best interests of this child.","The parties, who were together for seven years, were permanently separated. Now, the petitioner seeks access to their 11 year old daughter from an earlier relationship. The petitioner alleges that because he is a'step-parent' to the child, he does not need to establish that he falls within the category of persons having a'sufficient interest' to bring this application. HELD: 1) The petitioner has already had to contend with multiple parents and multiple siblings, many of whom have been only temporary or fleeting personalities in her life. The court must consider the quality of the relationship, the personality, character and emotional needs of the child and whether the relationship is one that is represented to the world by the mother and the applicant. The respondent has demonstrated that he is capable of providing that much in the way that he did during the seven year relationship. However, this evidence does not support the conclusion that he has a sufficient interest in this matter. The Court must also consider the circumstances of the petitioner, the father of the children, the circumstances in which the petitioner lived, the parenting arrangements of the parties, the factors affecting their ability to jointly care for the child (and the court's obligation to them in such a fashion as to ensure their continued access). 2) The relationship between the petitioner and the respondent has spanned the years 2000 to 2007. The relationship spanned time when the petitioner was barely a toddler and her two young children were conceived while she was separated from the respondent. The father of these two children, who resided with the petitioner at the time of the separation, is intermittently involved in their lives. 3) In this case, the respondent demonstrated he was a person of sufficient interest with respect to the petitioner. While the relationship was characterized by bickering, fighting, verbal and domestic abuse, it was also characterized by disruption in the home. Separations and disruptions in the family were the norm. There was also the fact that the petitioner's two younger children were involved in a series of activities while living with the respondent and they were in the same home. The presumption that it is in the best interests of the respondent to have access to them was also at play."
2011nssc455.txt,"The accused, who was charged with 21 counts under one indictment relating to events on two separate dates, applied to have the counts severed. First, on the basis of the dates of the occurrences and, secondly, to separate the so-called 'status offences' based on a pre-existing firearm prohibition order. It was argued the Crown had combined all the counts into one indictment to improve its evidentiary position with regard to the unproven connection of possession of the gun on the two separate dates and to be able to cross-examine the accused on the events of both days should he choose to only testify on the events of one day. The Crown argued that expert evidence showing a match between the gun used in the shooting on the first date and that found by the arresting officers on the second date showed a temporal and continuity nexus between the two events. The accused's  videotaped statement to the police was also a common piece of evidence to both dates. Application for severance dismissed. The most significant issue was the possibility of the accused being subject to cross-examination for events of both days if he chose to testify only concerning the events of one day but his position that he had no association with the gun and that it was not in his possession on either day indicated that his decision on whether to testify would most likely be the same in relation to both sets of counts and, given that there was no jury involved, there was no risk of improper inferences being drawn. The Crown should not be limited in the presentation of its evidence through a severance of counts because of the tenuous nexus between the two events.","The accused is charged with 21 counts under an indictment dated September 1, 2010 consisting of one count of attempted murder, several charges pertaining to the unlawful possession and use of a firearm, and a number of status offences based on a pre-existing firearm prohibition order. The charges relate to events which occurred in April and April 2010 respectively. The accused seeks severance of the 21 counts in the indictment on two bases: to reduce the number of counts to three and to separate for trial all of the so-called status offences (pertaining to the events of both April 8th and April 14th). Defence counsel argues that this strategy works unfairly to the accused, necessitating an evaluation of the relevant factors set out in Last at 4. The decision of the voir dire is set out on the admissibility of the accused's statement which was crafted broadly enough to serve as factual summary for this application as well. HELD: The application for severance is dismissed on both the bases proposed. 1) The absence of a true nexus between the counts (a) the complexity of the evidence and the length of the trial having regard to the evidence to be called; and (2) the potential of the defendant deciding to testify on one set of counts (i.e., those pertaining to April 8 and April14th) could not be reasonably balanced against the interests of justice. This is a case where it would be beneficial to have all the counts tried together and thereby be avoided while the accused is in custody. The interests of the justice encompass the accused’s right to be tried on the evidence admissible against him, as well as society”s interest in seeing justice be done in reasonably efficient and cost-effective manner. The only possible link conceded is the firearm which assumes an unproven connection of possession of the gun on both days. 2) The evidence that the gun was recovered near the spot where the accused was arrested would be admissible on prosecution of April 8/April 8/14 events if it supported an inference that the accused or defendant was in possession of that firearm on both occasions. If found guilty of possession in relation to that date, certainly the evidence would be Admissible. The Crown sees both temporal and continuity nexus between these two events from which it may draw inferences as may be appropriate. The videotaped statement to police (which the court has since decided to be adadmissible) is a common piece of evidence to both events. 3) The applicant will be required to participate in a single trial.

2_1999canlii12669.txt,"The respondent seeks an order for interim spousal support. The parties were married in January 1991 with three children and ceased to cohabit in December of 1996. The respondent is 52 years old and unemployed. In the past, he has been diagnosed as paranoid schizophrenic and suffering from a personality disorder but is currently, according to his physician, of sound mind. He qualifies since 1987 for a disability pension under CPP by reason of his mental disability which provides for a basic income of $580 plus GTS rebate for a total of $630 per month. The petitioner lives on a section of farm land which was brought into the marriage by the respondent, of which one quarter contains the matrimonial home. The petitioner and children live in that home. The petitioner is 39 years old and is also unemployed because she is an incomplete quadriplegic. The farm land is rented out from which the petitioner receives rental income. The petitioner enjoys an income of $3,400 per month while the respondent receives $630 per month. HELD: The petitioner is ordered to pay the respondent the annual sum of $6,000 paid in monthly installments of $500. There is no juridical reason why the petitioner should obtain the total revenue owned by the respondent particularly when he brought the land into the marriage. In fact, fairness and equity would suggest just the opposite, at least in respect to one half of the revenue. Accordingly, the Court makes an order on the basis of the respondent's ownership of the land rather than order payment of spousal support.","FIAT. The respondent sought an order for interim spousal support. HELD: The Court concluded that relief should be granted but in the circumstances it should not take the form of spousAL support. The relief should take from the pension income of the respondent, who is 52 years old and is suffering from a personality disorder. The disability pension income provided by the respondent is $580 per month. When adjusted for inflation the total monthly income is $4,086. This includes mortgage and land tax payments. There is another source of revenue and that is the farm land. The petitioner has de facto possession of the land and receives the entire rental. The difference in value relates to certain farmland which the respondent brought into the marriage. In total there is a section of land one quarter of which contains the matrimonial home. The amount of the rental is $2,292.58. The Court noted that the respondent's pension income was $1,000 less than his total income of $3,474.33. The two parties were married for 22 years and ceased to cohabit in 1996. The husband qualified for a disability pension under the Canada Pension Plan by reason of his mental disability. This provides his basic income of$580.00 a month. The wife has three sources of income: CPP Disability Pension, Disability Insurance, and Pension Benefits. Any payment order will not affect the welfare of the children. The claim for relief is grounded in the fact that the husband does not need financial assistance. He can live in a group home and the cost of living will be relatively low. The related income exceeds $150,000. The court awarded the costs of the application in the event the respondent obtains a Section D pension or G.S.T. credit along with the whole of his rental income. On that amount, the Federal Child Support Guidelines would stipulate a payment of $442.00 month. In fact, they are receiving $508.00 by way of CPP Benefits. The administration of the tax consequences of an order such as this will not be jeopardized by it."
2_2010skpc149.txt,"The accused were both charged with assault contrary to s. 266. The complainant admitted that he threw the first punch but said that he did so because the male accused had already broken the windows in his car and punched his passenger and was not 'coming to apologize.' HELD: The accused were convicted of assault. Whether the physical altercation was precipitated by jealousy or a drug deal, there is no doubt that the accused was the aggressor throughout. He smashed one, if not two, car windows. The accused's behaviour was threatening and the Court accepted that the accused had not attended the house to apologize. The complainant took necessary and lawful action to protect himself and his family under s. 37 of the Criminal Code.  While the Court did not believe that either complainant used a weapon, if it did occur it would have been justified in the context of the assault. The accused was acquitted of mischief because the Crown failed to prove the value of the broken windows.","The two accused were charged on separate informations with assaulting the complainant contrary to s. 266 of the Criminal Code and with wilfully damaging the windows of a car. HELD: The accused were found not guilty of the first count on information 24414281. The Court found that both accused were the main aggressors throughout. He smashed in one, if not two, car windows, he chased after the complainant with the help of his girlfriend, and then rushed up the stairs toward the complainant. This was threatening behaviour and the complainant said he felt threatened. The accused both admitted to breaking the window and breaking the rear window but denied any involvement with the alleged assault.  1) The two accused admitted to hitting the complainant in the face. They both testified that they got into a fight in the parking lot of a strip mall. 2) The accuseds admitted to getting into a fistfight. The assault was unnecessary and unnecessary. The complainant's injuries would have been far more severe if the altercation had actually occurred. However, even if the assault was justified, it was unnecessary for the accuseds to use unnecessary force.  3) The Court concluded that the second count of wilful damage to the car was not justified as the complainant and the accused both supported each other with their own evidence. The Crown and the defence were allowed to call all of their evidence at the trial on one information and the evidence on the other information was applied over to the other evidence. 4) The physical altercation in this case was precipitated by jealousy or by a drug deal gone bad. There is no doubt that the actions of the accused and the manner in which they were used in the assault are justified. The words of the complainant were used to describe the physical assault and the impact upon the victim when he said that he was afraid of the person he was going to contact. The statement of defence did not refer to any substance used by the accused nor did it confirm the allegation that they choked the victim. 5) The injuries were not severe.  6) The assault did not occur in the context of the alleged altercation between the accused men. The actions of both accuseds were aggressive and the judge accepted all of the witnesses' testimony, including the complainant's testimony that she choked him and that the complainant had choked her at one point during the altercation. The judge accepted the evidence that the parties were involved in a verbal altercation and that they both choked and punched each other until the complainant was forced to leave the courtroom."
2_2010skqb402.txt,"The defendant applied for dismissal of the plaintiff's claim for want of prosecution. The claim was issued November 1, 1999 and is based in debt for goods and services provided to the defendant. The value of the claim is $521,283.99 and refers to provision of materials, products and services in 1995 and 1996. The statement of defence was filed November 12, 1999 and amended in 2002. In the intervening years, the Chief of the defendant Indian Band died as did the person who had been appointed the proper person to be examined on behalf of the defendant.HELD: The decision to dismiss an application for want of prosecution is discretionary. A three step process was set out in International Capital Corporation v. Robinson Twigg &amp; Ketilson et al., 2010 SKCA 48. In this case, a delay of in excess of 5 years does not constitute inordinate delay when compared to the progress in comparable cases. The amount claimed is significant and there is no suggestion in the amended defence that the goods, products and related services were not provided. Subject to compliance with undertakings, the matter is ready to be referred to pre-trial settlement conference. There is no legal excuse offered on the part of the plaintiff for the inordinate delay in this case. The plaintiff bears the onus of convincing the Court on a balance of probabilities that the delay was excusable and its materials fall short. While there may be some prejudice to the defendant in mounting a defence because of the death of some of the people who were intimately involved in the dealings between the parties, there is an individual available who is intimately familiar with the dealings between the parties and there are discovery transcripts that might be of assistance. Both parties have records and documentation that can be tendered at a trial. The Court concluded that the interest of justice favored continuing with the action. The application to dismiss the action for want of prosecution was denied.","The defendant applied for the dismissal of the plaintiff's claim for want of prosecution pursuant to the inherent powers of the court. The defendant had issued a consent order in 1999 which authorized the appointment of a Band Councillor as the proper representative of Ochapowace to be examined for discovery on behalf of the defendant. The consent order was amended in 2002 to order that the defendant return the $40,000 paid by Ochampowace and retained by the plaintiff. In addition to the consent order, the defendant brought an application for discovery in 2009 seeking an order returning the money that was paid by the defendant to the plaintiff in relation to the settlement claim and the purchase of mobile homes. In this application the defendant sought to have the plaintiff examine for discovery return the amount owing by the respondent and for an order requiring compliance with undertakings given and remaining outstanding from the examination for discovery. HELD: The plaintiff was granted costs on a party/party basis notwithstanding the costs that may ultimately be ordered in the cause. 1)The delay was inexcusable and it is in the interests of justice that the plaintiff be permitted to pursue its claim.  2)The respondent was found to have committed grave errors in law and in the conduct of its own investigation. 3)The plaintiff was awarded its costs on party and party basis. 4)The applicant was found not to have suffered serious prejudice.  5)Although the respondent had undertaken extensive communications with the other, it did not provide a 'lawful excuse' for its delay in pursuing the claim. The respondent, either because it considered the matter settled or alternatively was content to do nothing to encourage a more timely disposition of it until the 2009 correspondence, is not blameless respecting its contribution to the delay.  6)It was in the interest of justice to grant the plaintiff its costs in a party and a party-party manner notwithstanding the delay and that it will not suffer serious prejudice at trial. 7)The application for dismissal for the want of criminal prosecution should be granted in the circumstances. The question of whether or not settlement was reached, the circumstances under which this payment was made and the reasons offered for the delay do not reach the level of serious prejudice having regard to the factors listed in the ICC case. 8)Costs in the Cause."
2_2011nssc486.txt,"The parties were married almost nine years and have two children, ages eight and 10.  The mother was highly critical of the father's ability to parent, and opposed his application for shared custody. She accused him of abusive behavior, using drugs/abusing alcohol, and claimed he did not help parent when they lived together. The level of conflict between the two was high. Each lived with new partners. They both filed expense statements showing significant monthly deficits but, since they had declared bankruptcy, there was no evidence of how they were meeting the shortfall. The mother sought a share of the father's pension, including his pre-marriage contributions, spousal support and child support. She worked through most of the marriage, but earned a lot less than the father did. Interim shared parenting, with a review in eight months. This is not an ideal arrangement, but the alternatives will leave the children worse off. The father was more credible; the mother's allegations are unsubstantiated. While he's contributed to the conflict in the past, he is making an effort while the mother and her partner are not. The mother will have the final say on health related matters, and the father will have the final say on the choice of childcare and helping with homework (because he is francophone and better able to help). If the mother is unable to learn how to work with the father, the court will consider awarding him custody. On review, the court will consider the parties' ability to communicate and cooperate, including whether or not they are able to agree about extracurricular activities for the children. The father will pay child support in the set-off amount. While he has twice her income, the mother hasn't proven the set-off amount is insufficient to enable her to meet the children's needs while they're with her. It's impossible to have a deficit without disclosing the debt instruments used to support debt accumulation. Her partner is either meeting her shortfall or her expenses are overstated. It would be unfair and unconscionable to award her half of the pre-marriage pension contributions based on the length of the marriage and the fact she wasn't economically dependant on the father. She's not entitled to spousal support. Even if she was, the father has no ability to pay given his obligations to the children.","This was a divorce proceeding and the parties were in a shared parenting regime. The mother sought custody and primary care of the children, while the father was a regular user of marijuana and alcohol. The father was to pay a proportionally greater share of the cost of care for the children. The evidence showed that the children needed counseling to adjust to the separation, to cope with the conflict created by their parents, and to deal with the consequences of their repeated moves from one parent to the other. The parties were to obtain a date on their docket for a return to this court eight months from the date of this decision for a review to determine whether the conflict between the parties has ceased, or at least been substantially reduced, and whether, as a result of that analysis, any change is required to the terms of the order. Children to be in the joint custody of the father and the mother. The information provided by the Father and his witnesses, is credible. However, it is not enough to conclude that the child need counseling because of anything their Father has done. The Court retains the discretion to modify the set-off amount where, considering the financial realities of the parents, it would lead to a significant variation in the standard of living experienced by the children as they move from one household to another."
2_2011skpc80.txt,"The accused was found guilty on a charge of assaulting a police officer contrary to s. 270.01(1) of the Criminal Code. The Crown applied under s. 752.1(1) for an order remanding the accused for an assessment by an expert for use as evidence in an application to have the accused declared a dangerous offender. The defence opposed the application on the basis that the predicate offence was not a serious personal injury offence and it was not within the realm of possibility that the accused could be found to be a dangerous offender. The accused was 50 years old. He had a criminal record commencing in 1976 which included 58 Criminal Code convictions. Fifteen of his prior convictions were for violent offences and six related to police officers. He had violated mandatory supervision orders on three separate occasions and had breached a conditional sentence order. The crimes of violence on his record involved the use of a weapon on more then one occasion. The facts of the predicate offence involved swinging a branch at a police officer. The officer had tasered the accused, but it had no effect. The accused grabbed a branch and swung it in sufficient proximity to cause the officer to back up, drop his taser and draw his sidearm. The officer provided a victim impact statement outlining the fear he experienced and the psychological impact the offence had on himself and his family. HELD: The offence is a serious personal injury offence as defined in s. 752. The accused picked up the branch with the intention of using it against the officer and it was of sufficient size that if the accused had struck the officer it would have caused serious damage. The accused's actions were found to have endangered or been likely to endanger the officer's life or safety and to have inflicted or been likely to inflict severe psychological damage. Given the number and nature of violent offences on the accused's record, the fact that many of the offences involve violence against police officers and the accused's prolonged issues with alcohol, a pattern of behaviour has been established. The best predictor of future behaviour is past behaviour and there is likelihood that the accused will cause injury in the future. The accused has demonstrated indifference to the reasonably foreseeable consequences to other persons of his behaviour. Given the serious nature of the offence and the accused's prior record for similar offences, a sentence of two years or more is possible.  It is not beyond the realm of possibility that the accused could be found to be a dangerous offender. The assessment under s. 752.1 was ordered.","The Crown applied for an order remanding the accused for an assessment performed by an expert for use as evidence in an application to have him declared a dangerous offender. The accused was convicted of assaulting a peace officer. The offence was a serious personal injury offence as defined by s. 752 of the Code. The offences were violent and the accused appeared to be in a combative or assaultive stance. The officer drew his taser and yelled for the accused to get down on the ground. When the accused was not moving, the officer fired his tasers. The victim was cornered by the police and shot by another officer. At paragraph 41 of the sentencing hearing, the Crown referred to R. v. Kolarava, 2007 MBPC 66 (CanLII), in which the Court reviewed various decisions made about whether or not to impose a life sentence on an accused. The Court found that given the serious nature of the offence, which included 58 Criminal Code convictions, and the fact that the accused had entered a half-way house with a sawed-off rifle, the accused swung the weapon at the officer, coming so close to the officer that it caused him to back away and pull his sidearm. The police officer was injured by the accused when he tried to load a cartridge on his gun. In this case the accused pled guilty to assault with a weapon and was sentenced to three years in prison. The Crown appealed the sentence as being too lenient. Appeal dismissed the appeal. The court found that the sentence imposed was a'serious personal injury' offence, and that the prospect of the accused being found to be dangerous or long-term offender was 'within the realm of possibility or beyond it'."
3_1995canlii4402.txt,"The respondent expropriated a parcel of land owned by the appellant. Prior to a hearing, all claims for the case were settled for the sum of $20,000. The appellant's solicitor presented solicitor and client accounts of $19,420 plus taxes. The respondent directed taxation, and the appellant's solicitor submitted further accounts for services and disbursements of the taxation hearing amounting to $7,212.24. The taxing master received expert opinion that a reasonable fee for the services, exclusive of taxation costs, would be $10,000. He proceeded to tax the account at $14,000, disallowed any costs of the taxation hearing, and disallowed a claim for interest on interim accounts submitted by the solicitor. The appellants appealed. Dismissing the appeal and confirming the taxation, that the taxing master did not make any errors in law. He was entitled to consider as one of the relevant factors the relationship of the total account to the recovery.","The expropriation of land by the City of Halifax City Council in 1993 was a result of a resolution to expropriate the land for widening the Bedford Highway. The land was originally intended to be used as a retaining wall. The construction of the retaining wall began in February 1994 and was completed in June 1994. In October 1994, the City Council abandoned the expropriated land retaining only an easement necessary for the footing. The solicitor for the appellant appealed the decision, which the City held was an error. Allowing the appeal and the taxation of costs, that the errors by the Taxing Master were minor and not indicative of the overall position of the appellant. The appellant's solicitor-client account was taxed by Arthur Hare and in a decision in August 1995 he reduced the account to $14,000 plus taxes. The TaxingMaster was correct in declining to award the sum of $5,855 to the appellant solicitor. This amounts to $19,420 plus taxes representing approximately 100 hours time spent on the file."
3_1995canlii6053.txt,"The accused was charged with failing to appear at his trial on a charge of impaired driving. The impaired driving charge was subsequently stayed. When the charge of failing to appear came on for trial the accused claimed a 'lawful excuse' for his failure to appear on the impaired driving charge. His excuse was that the next shift at work had failed to arrive on time and that this had made it impossible for him to get to court on time. This excuse was rejected and he was convicted. He appealed. HELD: Appeal dismissed.  1)Whether an accused has a lawful excuse is determined with reference to common law principles. It normally includes all of the defences which the common law considers sufficient reason to excuse a person from criminal liability. 2)The Court was unable to say that the finding by the trial judge that the accused had no lawful excuse for failing to attend court, was not supported by the evidence; nor could it say her conclusions were clearly wrong so as to make the decision unreasonable.","The accused sought to overturn his conviction for failing to attend court by arguing that the trial judge ought to have accepted his excuse for not appearing. At issue was whether the accused advanced a 'lawful excuse' for not attending court. HELD: The trial judge rejected the accused's submission that he had a 'lawsful excuse'. 1)The Crown had stayed the original impaired driving charge against the accused stayed. The defence argued that the judge should have accepted the defence's submission of a lawful excuse for failure to attend. 2)The Supreme Court of Canada commented on comments made in R. v. Holmes which indicate that a common law excuse includes all of the defences the common law considers sufficient reason to excuse a person from criminal liability. 3)The accused relied on comments of the Supreme Court in R v. (1988), 41 C.C.C.(3d) 497. 4)The common law defences are not frozen in time. They can be developed and tailored to fit changes in the law and new offences. Parliament can redefine the meaning of 'excuse' for example by expanding it to provide new excuses or excuses specific to a particular offence, or by narrowing it to include only certain excuses."

The Partnerships sustained heavy operating losses since 1989 and the petitioners had made large capital contributions on behalf of the defaulting partners in order to prevent the Partnerships from defaulting on the mortgages. The defaulting partners obtained the benefits of business losses which they used to offset their other sources of income and to decrease their personal income tax liability by significant amounts, obtaining benefits without paying for them. The petitioners alleged that Ashton had committed three acts of bankruptcy within the six months prior to filing the petition including ceasing to pay liabilities as they became due in failing to make payments to the petitioners, making a fraudulent conveyance to his wife and disposing of his property with intent to defraud or defeat his creditors by permitting his interest in the Securities to be purportedly seized by his wife. HELD: A receiving order was granted. 1)No adequate explanation was offered by Ashton who was a wealthy individual for his failure to pay his partnership obligations. It was common ground that Ashton had paid nothing toward his partnership obligations since 1993. The defendant admitted that he was indebted to the petitioners in the amount of approximately $278,758 and that he had received substantial tax advantages as a result of his involvement in the two partnerships.  2)The majority of the respondent's wealth consisted of the Securities purportedly seized by his wife in 1996. The preservation order was continued for 30 days to permit the Trustee in Bankruptcy to determine whether the bankruptcy estate wished to challenge these transactions.","The petitioner brothers were three brothers from the District of Perdue, Saskatchewan who carried on a family farm operation and operated a farm implement dealership business. In 1985, the accountant for the petitioner firm recommended that they become involved in certain real estate partnerships in order to derive certain tax advantages.

HELD: The receiving order was granted. 1)The petitioner was indebted to the petitioner in the amount of $1,000.00 and he had not done so within the six months prior to the filing of the petition. 2)There was no extenuating circumstances which would warrant the Court refusing to grant a receiving Order.  3)The material discloses very substantial financial hardships visited upon the petitioner as result of the respondent's refusal to pay the indebtedness owed. Further, the petitioner has received substantial tax advantages as a result of his involvement in the two partnerships.

Although both parents genuinely love the child and were equally competent caregivers, neither demonstrated that sole parenting offered an advantage to him.

3_2002skca56.txt,"A complaint was made in 1991 to the Human Rights Commission that the Gallery could only be entered by stairs and was inaccessible to wheelchair users. A Board of Inquiry appointed under the Saskatchewan Human Rights Code concluded in 1993 that the appellant's complex impeded physical access to the premises, facilities and services and lacked proper amenities for persons who are wheelchair-reliant. The Board specifically ordered it remained seized of the matter and the hearing would be reconvened to hear further evidence. The Court of Queen's Bench confirmed the Gallery continued to discriminate against disabled members of the public by failing to provide access and accessible services and ordered the appellant to construct or renovate washrooms to meet requirements of the National Building Code of Canada. The Court of Appeal set aside the Queen's Bench decision and restored the Board's decision. During those proceedings, the property was transferred to HKR, which undertook further renovations. In 1997 upon request by the Commission, the Board reconvened and concluded there had not been compliance, which was confirmed by the Court of Queen's Bench. This was not appealed. An appeal of the Board's 1998 order to construct or renovate the bathrooms was dismissed and it was found the Board did not err in adding HKR as a party nor exceeded its jurisdiction in finding the appellant had not complied with the original order. The appellant appealed that judgment principally on the ground of error in not finding the Board exceeded its jurisdiction in making the order as the original order did not include a requirement that it construct wheelchair accessible washrooms.

No trial had been held on any issue as all matters had proceeded to this point with the consent of the parties. The time for trial had been extended to allow the mother to retain counsel. Application dismissed; the court had not lost jurisdiction; trial to proceed. The Court of Appeal decision stands for the proposition that, once a trial at any stage of the Act is held, no order can have effect beyond the next statutory deadline; however, this is so only when the extensions are included in an order which follows trial. When the best interests of the child require it, an extension of a statutory deadline can be made in order to have a trial completed in respect of any stage of the Act. When the plan of care changes from reunification to permanent care close to the particular deadline, it is not in a child's best interest for the court to order a rushed trial date.","The mother sought a dismissal of the motion under the Children and Family Services Act by which the court had lost its jurisdiction to hear the case because the trial was to commence tomorrow. The trial had been approaching the first disposition deadline under section 41(1) of the Act and the original agency planning for the reunification of the mother and child required some psychological counselling. The agency had then proceeded to devise a plan that called for permanent care. The mother had made a protection finding and a disposition hearing, which was successful. At trial, the mother had argued that the time limit exceeded the overall deadline and that the court should be allowed to extend the trial to allow time for that final disposition hearing.

HELD: The accused was found guilty of impaired driving. The evidence did not support the argument that he was in the throws of a panic attack. The blood-alcohol readings show he was below the legal limit but the signs and symptoms of impairment by alcohol proved beyond a reasonable doubt his ability to operate a motor vehicle was impaired by alcohol. As stated in McCallum, the fact that the effects of alcohol may have been exacerbated by the accused suffering from fatigue does not provide a defence to the charge.",The accused was charged with having the care or control of a motor vehicle while his ability to operate a motor Vehicle was impaired by alcohol or drugs. The accused's evidence raised a reasonable doubt as to his guilt. HELD: The accused was found guilty. 1)The accused's blood alcohol content was.60. The court found that the accused's symptoms of impairment were the result of a panic attack not from the consumption of alcohol. 2)The evidence did not support the defence argument that the signs and symptoms were either consistent with or equally consistent with a Panic attack.

His students helped him to the faculty lounge. He was found in the faculty washroom unconscious and not breathing approximately 30 minutes later. Emergency medical technicians were not able to resuscitate him and he was pronounced dead at the Royal University Hospital. An application for dependants' benefits was submitted over 3 years later. The Workers' Compensation Board denied the claim finding that the deceased was not found dead at work and because of the delay in bringing the claim. The applicant brought an application for an order of certiorari pursuant to Queen's Bench Rule 664 and mandamus pursuant to Queen's Bench Rule 674. HELD: 1) The Board acted outside of its jurisdiction in denying dependant benefits to the applicant based upon a determination that the deceased was not found dead within the meaning of s. 30 of The Workers' Compensation Act, 1979. The case law clearly precludes an analysis of s. 30 of the Act as in any way representing a rebuttable presumption. 2) The Board acted outside its jurisdiction in not applying the presumption in s. 30 of the Act in favour of the applicant. 3) The Board waived the right to rely upon the delay in bringing the claim after the Board participated in a variety of levels of proceeding, including two hearings, and only raised the issue of delay at the final hearing. 4) The application was allowed with costs to the applicant on a party and party basis.","The applicant sought an order by way of certiorari pursuant to Rule 664 of the Queen's Bench Rules of Court, to quash the decision of the Workers' Compensation Board which denied the applicant's application for benefits based upon its finding that the deceased spouse was not found dead within the meaning of s. 30 of the Worker's Compensation Act. The applicant had become aware of the potential benefits in early July 2001 during a casual conversation at her workplace and suggested that the death took place while he was performing work duties at the University of Saskatchewan. The Board denied the application based upon two alternative grounds: the delay in bringing the claim, and the fact that the respondent was not 'found dead at work'. HELD: The application for dependants' benefits was denied. 1)Section 45(1)(b) of the Act provides for a review of the reasons for the delay. 2)Section 47(1) does not bar the Board's decision from judicial review when the Board exercises its discretion to decide a matter but the legislation did not 'intend to commit the matter exclusively to the Board' (see Baker v. Canada). 3)The standard of review is the correctness standard, rather than the patent unreasonable one. 4)Section 46(1(b) provides for the equitable distribution of benefits. 5)The respondent Board did not properly or impartially apply the presumption in s.30 that it did not apply in favour of the applicant. 6)The trial judge properly considered the privative clause, the privatives clause and the non-consecutive clause, and found it to be patent unreasonableness. 7)The appeal was allowed on the basis that s.45 did not bar access to the respondent Board's files. 8)The court was satisfied that the applicant had rebutted her husband's claim based upon the evidence in the circumstances. 9)The evidence did not support the respondent board's decision to deny benefits. 10)Section 11(3) provides that the board shall have the exclusive jurisdiction to make decisions regarding the application of dependant benefits. 11)The Supreme Court of Canada considered s.22 and noted that the following could be interpreted to mean that the trial judge's decision should not be interfered with with the board's determination of the cause of death (e.g., whether the deceased was found dead in the workplace, whether the board acted in breach of its fiduciary duty by failing to disclose relevant notice to the board. 12)The applicant failed to disclose any relevant information."

HELD: Appeal allowed. 1)Because the accused had no related record and given the circumstances of the assault, the sentence of imprisonment was reduced to time already served (15 days). 2)The trial judge erred in imposing the 10 year fire arm prohibition under S.100 of the Code. S.100 requires a conviction on an indictable offence involving violence against a person where the maximum sentence available is 10 years imprisonment or more. 3)The maximum sentence for assault under S.266 is 5 years if the Crown proceeds by indictment and 6 months if, as here, the Crown proceeds summarily.","The accused was convicted by a summary conviction plea of guilty to a charge of assault contrary to s. 266 of the Criminal Code.

By this fiat an order was granted pursuant to Queen's Bench Rule 344 itemizing the household contents and personal items removed by the respondent from the matrimonial home in order to allow for a Writ of Delivery and prohibiting the respondent from disposing of any of the assets that the respondent had removed from the matrimonial home and also requiring him to pay all outstanding utility payments and other expenses associated with his occupation of the matrimonial home. The judge declined to cite the respondent for contempt.,"FIAT. Following a trial before me in November 1993, the Courtissued a judgment dealing with a number of issues including the division of matrimonial property. The judgment dealt with the division into two parts: the first part sought an order pursuant to Rule 344 to prevent the respondent from violating the prior order of November that nothing be removed from the matrimononial home or any assets disposed of. HELD: The motion was motion denied. 1)The Court was left with no alternative but to assist the petitioner in regaining the assets taken out of the house by granting the order sought subject to one or two modifications. 2)The law permits the court to vary its judgment and to give directions on how the judgment should be carried out whether or not a formal order is issued by the Court. This has long been the law in this province. 3)The prayer for relief in the second part of the motion sought to vary the judgment to different levels. The Law permits the Court to vary their judgment and give directions as to how and if a formal Order is issued. 4)The court was satisfied that no formal extension of the judgment of December had ever been issued."

HELD: Appeal dismissed and conviction accordingly affirmed.  1)Great deference to findings of credibility made at trial should be shown. 2)The trial judge did not say that he found the accused guilty only upon the credibility of the complainant and the accused. He said that he found the Crown's evidence to be credible, and the accused's evidence not to be credible. The Crown's evidence was comprised of both the complainant and the witness. 3)The trial judge's findings are supported by the evidence and his conclusions are not clearly wrong so as to make the conviction unreasonable.","The appellant contended that the Provincial Court judge so concerned himself with the question of the credibility of the evidence of the complainant and the accused that he overlooked his duty to consider such evidence with a view to determining whether it raised a reasonable doubt of the appellant's guilt.

4_2007skqb438.txt,"The parties have two children, a son born March 1990 and a daughter December 1991. A trial on the issues of the son's residence in 2006, the parties' income for the purposes of child support and any s. 7 expenses was held. HELD: 1) From September 2006 to February 2007 the parties shared custody of the son. This is a period of no more than 5 months. Thereafter he resumed living with his grandmother and was supported by his mother. The father does not meet the threshold provided for in s. 9 of the Guidelines.  2) The father's income from employment shows earning of $108,629. The mother's income consisted only of investment income of $1,672.37 and allowance of $2,000. 3) The parties have been divorced since 1998. The son has played baseball since 2004. The daughter has speed skated since 2001. The mother has paid the extraordinary expenses of both children, without reimbursement from the father. It was only in 2006 that the father paid any of the son's expenses. Accordingly, 2006 is not the appropriate year to begin reimbursing the father for expenses he may have paid for him. To do so would be exceedingly unfair to the mother who has borne the expenses of both children on her own for many years.  4) The children's expenses related to fees, registration and equipment for baseball and speed skating are extraordinary expenses within the meaning of s. 7 of the Guidelines. The expenses may be estimated at $2,000 for baseball and $1,000 for speed skating, annually. The orthodontic work, which is estimated at $2,522 should be amortized over two years. The alternative acne treatment, proposed by the mother for the daughter is not an appropriate health related expense in the absence of a medical referral or prescription. The father's proportionate share is 80% and the mother's is 20%. Paid monthly the father's payment is $284. 5) Although the mother did not bring an application to vary child support upward, the filing of the application to vary by the father is sufficient to re-determine the issue of child support based on current incomes. The current support order is based on the father's income of $87,794. His income is considerably higher now. His child support payments are adjusted accordingly.","The respondent father applied to vary an order made May 14, 2002 for child support payable to the petitioner mother on behalf of his two youngest children, Michael, born March 15, 1990, and Jessica, born December 30, 1991. The parties had separated in 1998. The petitioner mother had the use of his mother's vehicle because she was in Viet Nam. In 2006, the father decided to move from the west side of Saskatoon to bigger, more expensive apartment to accommodate what he understood to be Michael's interest in moving in with his sister and Jerrilyn, his older sister. The father initially believed that it was necessary for the children to live on the east side of the city, but in reality, the child's schedule was very busy and he needed a vehicle to keep up his activities. For the past four years, Michael had lived with his mother only 40% of the time. These expenses were extraordinary and should be considered in accordance with s. 7 of the Guidelines. HELD: 1)The parties did not speak to one another. It was not practical to order the mother produce receipts for reimbursement from the father. Two incidents illustrate why not. The mother's payment of $1,065.00 for dental appointments in the fall of 2006 was based on the father's income at the time of $87,794.00. The current s. expenses total $4,261.00 yearly. 2)The father's proportionate share is 80% and the mother's is 20%. 3)The alternative acne treatment proposed by the mother for Jessica was a health related expense, covered by s.7 in the absence of a medical referral or prescription. Therefore, the total ongoing s. expense was $4 million. 4)The mother was entitled to costs in the amount of $500."
4_2007skqb51.txt,"FIAT: The respondent applies for an interim order granting her sole custody of the parties' two children and child support retroactive to the date of separation being October 2005. The petitioner seeks joint custody with specified access. The petitioner acknowledges an obligation to pay child support but there is an issue with respect to his income and whether the interim order should be retroactive. The children are ages 3 and 2.HELD: 1) Section 3 of The Children's Law Act 1997 provides for a presumption of joint custody where parents of a child have cohabitated after the birth of the child. That is the situation here. There is nothing in the evidence to rebut that presumption on an interim basis. In making interim orders, the Court tries to disrupt the lives of the children as little as possible. The status quo in this case is represented by the verbal agreement between the parties entered into after their separation. That is the petitioner would have the children every third week during his week off from Saturday to Tuesday. This seems reasonable on an interim basis. This agreement did not address the fact that the petitioner shall be laid off for two months in the spring. It is reasonable that during this period his contact with the children should be increased. The petitioner has not seen the children for 10 months. He will have to be re-introduced to them. A phase in period is required. 2) The petitioner has worked for the same drilling company for about 6 years. His gross income in 2006 was $112,064. This is verified by his year to date income statement from his employer. The petitioner attests that $9,600 of his income is a 'living allowance' paid to cover expenses for his truck, fuel, vehicle maintenance and meals and should be deducted from his Line 150 income to arrive at his current income for child support purposes. This is a matter for the trial judge who will have the benefit of the 2006 tax return and notice of assessment and better evidence of the expenses and their purpose and make any retroactive adjustment deemed necessary. The petitioner's income for child support purposes is $112,064. 3) The claim for retroactive child support is a claim for child support payments which pre-date service of the notice of this application. The petitioner was served with the application in September 2006. The petitioner lived up to the parties' verbal agreement to pay child support of $1,200 per month starting October 2005. He unilaterally stopped paying child support in January 2006. He attests that his reason for doing so was because he was not having access to the children. The obligation to pay child support is not contingent on a payor's ability to see their children.  The respondent's income is substantially less then that of the petitioner's. The child support was necessary to meet the children's basis ongoing needs. The petitioner knew he had an obligation to provide child support and there is no evidence that a retroactive order would cause him undue hardship. There is evidence that a request for change in child support preceded the commencement of this application. A retroactive adjustment of child support to January 2006 is warranted.","FIAT: The respondent applied for an interim order granting sole custody of the parties' two children and child support, including s. 7(a) child care expenses retroactive to the date of separation, October 2005. The petitioner requested joint custody with specified access. While he acknowledged an obligation to pay child support and there was an issue as to his income and whether the interim order should be made retroactive, the evidence before the trial judge indicated that the parties had verbal agreement that the petitioner would have the children in his custody every third weekend during his week off from Saturday to Tuesday as per their verbal agreement. HELD: 1) The respondent was granted retroactive child support of $8,107 for child support purposes.  2) The petitioner was ordered to continue to pay $185 per month directly to the child care provider which represents one-half of the respondent's current child care costs (before tax considerations) for employment purposes. Retroactive support was warranted.  3) The parties' verbal agreement regarding joint custody was not changed. The respondent did not pay any child support for the past 3 years. The Court was not prepared to vary the terms of that agreement. 4) The Court found nothing in the evidence that rebutted that presumption on an interim basis. 5) The court ordered the respondent to continue paying retroactive support to January 2006. 6) As the results of the within application are mixed, costs of this application shall be in the cause."
4_2008skqb174.txt,"Accused pleaded guilty at opening of trial to one count of distributing child pornography in the form of written works. The accused was active on a pedophile website and posted 11 stories describing sexual activity between men and infants and pre-teen girls. HELD: Accused received 15 months imprisonment followed by 3 years of probation with addition orders including providing DNA samples and being added to the Sex Offender Registry. The Court accepted that the internet has led to the accelerated proliferation of child pornography, making it an increasing social problem. The social harm of such material is borne almost exclusively by infants and children, the most defenceless members of society. For this reason, denunciation and deterrence are the dominant sentencing principles. The defence submitted that the writings do not actually harm children in their making and, therefore, should not be subject to the same denunciation as pornographic images. The Court rejected this argument because it cannot be assumed that the writings do not stimulate the demand for images and since not all pedophiles are voyeurs only some will act on their desires and anything that stimulates this desire places children at risk in the real world. Aggravating factors in this case were 1) the fact that the accused extolled pedophilia and wrote hard core child pornography and encouraged others to the same. 2) The accused was a high profile contributor to the web site and he remains unrepentant Ã» he does not believe there is anything wrong with writing these stories and only stopped because the law requires it. A conditional sentence would not represent sufficient denunciation or deterrence. Mitigating factors in this case included a lack of criminal record, the guilty plea and the fact that the accused is looking after his elderly mother.","The defendant pled guilty at the opening of trial to distributing child pornography contrary to s. 163.1(3) of the Criminal Code. The defendant had 1,200 postings on the website, which included 11 stories that were the subject of the charge. The site encouraged stories, and the defendant encouraged others to submit stories. The sentencing judge found that the defendant was more of a voyeur than actively sexual with girls and that denunciation and deterrence were the dominant principles of sentencing. The accused was sentenced to 15 months imprisonment to be followed by a term of probation of 3 years, as well as the addition of an order requiring him to comply with the Sex Offender Information Registration Act, 2004. The terms of the three-year probation order were amended to include a period of 20 years from attending public park or public swimming area where persons under the age of fourteen are present or can reasonably be expected to be present; a requirement to participate in psycho forensic psychiatric/psychological evolution for a person convicted of distributing childpornography. In committing the offence, the defendant wrote hard core child pornography in several of his stories, which on the scale of 10 words touched on the idea of a missing girl, placed it in the upper half of the scale. The fact that the accused had no criminal record and did voluntarily enter a sex offender treatment program did not deter others who might be inclined to engage in the same activity."
4_2009skca102.txt,"The respondent pled guilty to a charge of manslaughter arising out of fatal injuries she inflicted on her 7 month old daughter. The sentencing judge awarded the respondent 26 months credit for 13 months in pre-trial custody and then imposed a sentence of 2 years less 1 day to be followed by 2 years probation. The Crown seeks leave to appeal the sentence imposed as demonstrably unfit. HELD: Appeal allowed. 1) Taking into account the mitigating factors and in particular the respondent's post-sentence rehabilitative potential and the absence of evidence of prior acts of violence, a sentence slightly below the range as the one imposed in R. v. Bighead, 2003 SKCA 44 leads the Court to conclude a sentence of 6 years is appropriate, with 26 months credit for remand as imposed below.  2) The sentencing judge was directed to a very narrow range of authorities. In these circumstances this Court cannot find that the judge failed to give proper weight to the gravity of the offence and the degree of the respondent's responsibility. It would be helpful if a more detailed analysis along the lines suggested in R. v. Laberge (1995), 165 A.R. 375 had been given in order to enhance meaningful appellate review. However, this Court is not satisfied the judge failed to properly consider this factor. The Court is satisfied that the limited framework presented by counsel led the judge to err by failing to observe the need for parity in sentence and as a result, the sentence imposed was not similar to sentences imposed on other offenders for similar offences committed in similar circumstances.","The Crown appealed a sentence of 26 months in pre-trial custody and 2 years probation imposed following the death of their 7-month-old daughter. The respondent had been diagnosed with Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) and had previously been convicted of manslaughter for the same offence. The Crown argued the sentencing judge erred by failing to give proper weight to the gravity of the offence and the respondent's moral culpability in it. HELD: The appeal was allowed on the basis of this latter ground. 1) The essential facts were not in dispute. The mother was in good standing with her children and was doing well in school. 2) The father had a troubled history of abuse, domestic abuse and sexual abuse. She had failed to take steps to protect her children. 3) The mother's dysfunctional upbringing or dysfunctional life was put forth as aggravating factors. 4) The sentencing judge failed to give appropriate weight to both the seriousness of the offences and to the respondent’s moral responsibility. The factors set out in R. v. Schoenthal were not considered. 5) The court was satisfied the appeal should be allowed because these particular issues were considered and given appropriate weight by the sentencing court. 6) The sentence imposed was far too lenient for an adult who had a child of the same age. The father was sentenced to four years less a day, followed by two years probation."
4_2011nssc71.txt,"The judge declared the defendants could pay legal fees from third party loans without offending two prior execution orders that prevented them from disposing of any property. The declaration was explicitly made on the assumption that the loans would not be secured against the defendants' existing assets. Later, the defendants' counsel wrote to the court essentially indicating he could not confirm the loans would not be secured against any assets. The court issued this supplemental decision. In the absence of any evidence the loans will not be secured against assets already subject to the execution order, or will not otherwise reduce those assets, the order and declaration sought can no longer be granted.","The defendants sought an order confirming their ability to pay certain amounts for billed and unbilled time without violating the terms of two execution orders previously issued against them, as Hfx No. 190408 against the judgment debtors to the plaintiff and the defendants, who were successful litigants in this action. HELD: The defendants were ordered to pay the retainers and legal fees referred to in the decision. The court was unable to grant the order that accompanied the notice in the matter of costs."
4_2015skca111.txt,"Family – Child Support – Arrears – Appeal The appellant appealed from the decision of a Queen’s Bench judge ordering him to pay retroactive child support to the respondent in the amount of $21,645. The order indicated that the period in question would include support from January 2009 to August 2012 (see: 2014 SKQB 334). An original support order was issued by consent in 2006. It required that the appellant pay the respondent $1,220 per month in child support and that the parties would exchange their financial information yearly in order to adjust the amount of child support payable. In 2008, the appellant applied to vary the order because he had lost his position and his income was reduced to $1,500 per month. In his affidavit, he swore that his annual income would be $18,000. The application was allowed and the amount of support reduced to $769 per month based upon the judge setting the appellant’s income at $55,000 and directing him to provide his financial information to the respondent each year. One month later in 2009, the appellant regained his former employment position and began earning as much as he had in 2008 but he continued to pay $769 per month without informing the respondent of the change in his circumstances. In February 2011, the respondent served a notice to disclose. The parties met and made an oral agreement that the appellant would pay $950 per month based upon the appellant’s claim that he was still financially strapped and the respondent acquiesced because she was unwilling to engage in further court battles with him. The appellant’s lawyer provided the respondent’s lawyer with financial information that showed that the former was earning a substantially higher income. The respondent also indicated to the appellant that she would forgo about $7,200 in arrears. The terms of the agreement were submitted to the court, without the financial information or the respondent’s forbearance to sue, and a variation order was issued based upon them. In July 2012, the respondent applied to vary the 2008 order and the 2011 variation order claiming arrears from January 2009. Eventually the issue of retroactive child support went to trial. The trial judge found that the appellant had not given the respondent financial information as was required and his failure to inform her of the material change in his circumstances in 2009 constituted blameworthy conduct. The appellant’s income for the years 2009 through 2012 was assessed by the court and the amount of arrears established. The appellant argued that: 1) the trial judge did not have the jurisdiction to vary the 2011 variation order. He maintained that the 2011 order was final and could not be varied on an interim basis; 2) it was necessary to find a material change in circumstances before it could be varied; 3) the respondent had been advised of the change in circumstances; and 4) the trial judge had erred in failing to find unreasonable delay on the part of the respondent.  HELD: The appeal was dismissed. The court held with respect to each issue that: 1) a court can vary an interim or a final order on an interim basis for child support under the authority of ss. 15 and 17 of the Divorce Act. Although it might be necessary in some cases to determine whether an order is final or interim, it was not necessary to do so here because the nature of the terms of the orders in question and the circumstances surrounding the granting of the 2011 variation order. The trial judge had not erred in concluding that he had authority to vary it and to order the appellant to pay arrears before the agreement and compelling him to pay the Guideline amount for the period following it; 2) the terms of the 2011 order left it to a future court to finalize the amount of child support based upon the appellant’s income. Therefore the court retained the power to vary or rescind the order without searching for a change in circumstances; 3) the trial judge’s findings of fact on this point were supported by the evidence; and 4) the trial judge found that the respondent had not received disclosure and thus there had been no unreasonable delay.","HELD: The appeal was dismissed. The court found that Turcotte J. had the jurisdiction to vary the 2011 Variation Order for retroactive child support and that the trial judge had not erred by misapprehending the facts or by failing to find unreasonable delay. In the context of family support orders, the court drew a clear distinction between interim orders, which can be varied on an interim basis as a matter of jurisdiction, and final orders. In this case, the Court held that the court had not shown that the parties had jointly agreed on the material change in circumstances before the 2011 variation order could be varied. In other words, the defendant had not been advised of changes in circumstances prior to the 2011 order."

The Plaintiff called several expert witnesses who testified that, in their opinion, the leaking fuel line was the cause of the fire. Ford called one witness who was the designer of of the truck's fuel system and a Ford employee. He testified that the defective fuel line could not have leaked sufficient fuel to cause the fire. He also admitted, however, that his prior written report contained errors. Rebuttal evidence called by the Plaintiff indicated that the check valve in the fuel pump designed to prevent siphoning from the fuel tank in the event of a leaking fuel line did not operate as the Ford witness had testified. HELD: Judgment for the Plaintiff. The Plaintiff had proved on a balance of probabilities that the leaking fuel line was the cause of the fire. The Plaintiff's experts' evidence was accepted over that of the Ford expert. No independent experts had been called by Ford.","The plaintiffs claim against the defendant for damages from a fire in their garage which they allege was caused by combustion of vapours from gasoline leakage from the fuel tube of a new truck they purchased from Ford.

HELD: 1)The plaintiffs have proven beyond a balance of probabilities that the fire was caused caused by an electricstatic discharge throughthe U- shaped fuel tube. Due to extreme weather conditions the electrical insulating qualities of the nylon fuel line were reduced to an extent that the vapours would settle to the bottom of the garage and would be attracted to the pilot light on the furnace. 2)The defendants claim damages in the amount of $50,000 awarded to the plaintiff for general damages, $5000 for the cause of the fire, and $1,000,000 in damages for failure to take appropriate steps to prevent the spread of the flames. 3)The plaintiff was awarded a portion of the $12,500,000 judgment in the fire prevention and control cases as well as general damages for loss of valuable time, money spent on repairs, and the loss of profits due to improper or defective maintenance. 4)The court accepted the expert testimony of the plaintiffs and the defendants in preference to the defendant in that it accepted the evidence from the other witnesses and ruled out any other possible cause for the fire. 5)The evidence from other witnesses was accepted, as it was the plaintiffs' theory as to how the fire started."

The theft was reported to police by a passing motorist who saw the vehicle being driven off the car lot early in the morning. The vehicle was spotted on the highway, and when stopped, was exited by two individuals. Two officers followed tracks through a wooded area, and noted that in two areas the tracks broke through ice on a brook. Shortly thereafter the appellant came out of the woods on a nearby road; his lower body was wet and chunks of ice and snow clung to his clothing.

He argued there was no evidence he was in recent possession of the stolen vehicle. Dismissing the appeal, that there was sufficient evidence to support the findings of fact made by the trial judge. The judgment of the trial judge was consistent with R. v. Kowlyk (1988), 43 C.C.C.

The applicant suffered soft tissue injuries to his cervical spine when his vehicle was struck from behind by an uninsured driver. He received a partial income replacement benefit from SGI on the basis he was not able to perform some but not all of his farm duties. HELD: 1)SGI was not entitled to terminate Sawkiw's benefits pursuant to s185(d), (e), (f) or (g). SGI's failure to make a suitable rehabilitation program available to Sawkiw prior to October 1/97 and its failure to reassess his level of income replacement benefits as at September 14 where significant factors contributing to his desperate circumstances. SGI was requiring Sawkiw to attend daily physiotherapy of 3 to 4 hours duration with approximately 2-1/2 hours of additional travel time. It is common knowledge that pain can be exhausting; that daily physiotherapy can be exhausting; that daily travel of 2-1/2 hours can be exhausting; that the physical demands of farming can be exhausting; and, that the mental demands of managing a farm and coordinating and organizing the work of others on a farm can be exhausting. It was far from clear how SGI expected Sawkiw to devote approximately 6 to7 hours per day to his treatment program and still have the mental and physical reserves to devote any time or energy to his farming oprations. He could only reasonably be expected to participate in daily physiotherapy if he was receiving a full, rather than a partial income replacement benefit. 2)The benefits were properly terminated pursuant to s129(1)(e) the first day of his full time employment in Alberta. However, from September 14/97 to the date of termination Sawkiw was entitled to be paid full income replacement benefit without adjustment for a partial return to work. Sawkiw was entitled to the difference and interest from the date such additional benefits should have been paid until the date of this judgment. 3)SGI was to arrange for an assessment by the rehabilitation centre forthwith. If it is found that as a result of the accident Sawkiw is not able to hold the employment he held at the time of the accident, SGI is encouraged to consider his condition as a relapse under s142(1)(a). Under the terms of this judgment the final income replacement benefit will be other than one made pursuant to s139 or 140. 4)Sawkiw was entitled to his solicitor and client costs respecting services rendered and disbursements incurred from the date of filing his notice of motion to the date this judgment is received. He was also entitled to his costs associated with preparing and filing his notice of motion set at $600 being the maximum amount payable under the Personal Injury Benefits Regulations.","The respondent SGI terminated the plaintiff's income replacement benefits pursuant to s.185 of the Automobile Accident Insurance Act.

Following the accident, the plaintiff sought and was granted a secondary assessment at a physiotherapy clinic in Yorkton. The defendant applied for an order setting aside the termination. HELD: SGI's termination was appropriate. It was not reasonable to expect the plaintiff to be able to continue his farming activities with the assistance of the physiotherapist and the court found that SGI was not entitled to terminate the benefits. SGI shall pay the plaintiff the difference, if any, between the amount paid to the plaintiff for the period September 24 to October 23, 1997 and the amount required to be paid pursuant to the judgment for the September 24 date to the date of his commencement of employment in Alberta.  1)Sawkiw's benefits were terminated pursuant to ss.185(d), (e), (f) or (g) of the Personal Injury Benefits Regulations. 2)The plaintiff was found to have suffered serious injuries to his cervical spine, neck and back and the injuries sustained when he was hit by a drunk driver were a contributing factors. 3)SGI's failure to make a suitable rehabilitation program available to plaintiff prior to and after the accident was considered. 4)The court was not prepared to find that the plaintiff caused his early discharge from the Yorkton Physiotherapy Secondary Treatment Centre or failed, without valid reason, to attend his scheduled assessment at Wascana. 5)Saskatchewan Government Insurance was not awarded costs associated with preparing and filing notice of motion."
5_2000canlii3680.txt,"After being sexually assaulted, applicant was voluntarily released from Canadian Armed Forces. She applied for and was denied a pension. Civil proceedings were commenced and the Crown defended on the basis that before initiating civil proceedings, applicant was obliged to appeal denial of pension or seek review by Minister of pension rejection. Applicant applied to strike out that portion of defence application allowed. The applicant applied for and was denied a pension. Therefore no pension was at this time payable to her. A review by the Minister would require new information and the appeal period had expired. The applicant should not be denied her right to proceed against the Crown in such circumstances.","The plaintiff was voluntarily released from the military after a seven year period following the sexual assault. She applied to Veterans Affairs Canada (VAC) for a pension under s. 111 of the Pension Act. The Minister of Defence later reversed the decision and the plaintiff was barred from bringing this proceeding. She also failed to appeal. The limitation period for appealing the Minister's decision had expired and she was not in receipt of pension benefits. The Crown appealed the decision. In giving the plaintiff the benefit of a pension, the court noted that s. 11 of the Pensions Act provides a mechanism for the plaintiff to bring an action for damages against the Crown where a pension is being paid or is 'payable'. It was also inconceivable that having been denied the application for pension the plaintiff is precluded from bringing the proceeding because she failed to attend court in time. The court concluded that the section of the Act which provides for the equitable exchange of benefits between the employer and the defendant and for the purpose of this case, could not be read as imposing an obligation on the employee to apply for pension, and a further obligation upon him to prove that pension is not payable. The plaintiff must prove facts to bring the case within the ambit of the legislation."
5_2001skqb463.txt,"This judgment applies to both QBG No. 1040/98 and QBG No. 1041/98 respecting the contract between the city and Triple P Holdings and the January 21, 1997 contract between the plaintiffs and the defendants. The first breach of contract concerned a failure to apply the rotation of truckers described in the arrangement between the city and Truckers Association. The second breach alleged the defendants took too many hours on the total contract. Both matters were tried together. The defendants pleaded there was no privity of contract between the city and plaintiffs, therefore the plaintiffs could not enforce terms agreed to by the city and Triple P. HELD: Both actions were dismissed. 1)The case did not turn on the issue of privity. While the plaintiffs were not actual parties to the contract with the city, certain benefits were intended to pass through the general contract to members of the Truckers Association. 2)There was no contractual obligation in the 1997 agreement which required the defendant to adhere to any particular arrangement on the rotation of work. The contract between the defendants and city was not incorporated by specific or general reference. The first sentence of s.9 of the 1997 tender for rental of truck specifications was more consistent with what was actually done by the defendants than with the interpretation put on it by the plaintiffs. They failed to make out a case that the contract term was as alleged or that any breach occurred.  3)Had a case been made out, further evidence of damages would be required. The damages claimed were excessive and did not properly take into account actual operating expenses, the net affect of mitigating factors, and reliable calculation of the administration of the rotation of work.","The two contracts that play in this case are the contract between the City of Regina and Triple P Holdings operated by the defendants and the same two defendants. While the plaintiffs were not actual parties to the contract with the City, the general thrust of all of the evidence was that certain benefits were intended to pass through the general contract to the members of the Independent Truckers Association. The plaintiffs failed to make out a case that the contract term was as alleged on that breach and that any breach occurred. HELD: Each case was dismissed. 1)The plaintiffs had constructed their cases in reliance upon the overall affect of both contracts with a specific emphasis on the contract of January 21, 1997. The factual evidence was in conflict but found that the defendants made some effort to include the plaintiffs in the rotation. Problematically, for the plaintiffs, there is no contractual obligation in the agreement of January 20, 1997 which requires the defendants to adhere to any particular arrangement on the rotation of work. The contract goes on to specify the contractors obligations to pay in the event of a breach.  2)The issue of privity of contract could have been a critical issue in different circumstances but in the end this case will not turn on the question of adequity. 3)The Court must decide the case as presented; that the plaintiffs are entitled to damages from the defendants for breach of contract dated January 21/97 and with reference to the Contract between the defendants, Regina and the Cityof Regina."

He appealed the dismissal of his application in March 2000 to vary the support order by suspending payment until he gained employment and by reducing arrears. HELD: The appeal was allowed in part.

5_2003skpc19.txt,At issue in the negligence suit was whether the defendant ought to have seen the plaintiff's vehicle in front of him and stopped his vehicle to avoid the motor vehicle collision. The only material difference in testimonies was whether there was a half-ton truck in front of the plaintiff's vehicle when the collision occurred. HELD: The plaintiff's claim was not proven on a balance of probabilities. The physical evidence did not assist and the court was unable to conclude that one version was correct and the other incorrect.,"An action in negligence arising out of a vehicle accident. A tractor-trailer slowly inched up to a Honda Corrolla automobile operated by the plaintiff and nudged it causing damage to the back bumper, a slight denting on the trunk lid and some damage to tractor unit. The ultimate disagreement was over the issue of whether the defendant ought to have seen the plaintiff's vehicle in front of him and therefore, stopped his vehicle thus avoiding the collision. HELD: The plaintiff's claim was dismissed without costs to either party. The physical evidence did not support either version of the facts put forth by the parties.  1)The scales of justice were evenly balanced and the evidence was, at the end of the day, equivocal. The scales were not weighing persuasively in favour of either the plaintiff or defendant based upon the oral evidence given by the witnesses at the trial. Each version contains an equally rational explanation for what transpired. 2)The physical evidence was not dispositive of either side of the issue. The testimony of the plaintiff 'cutting in front' a half-ton truck in frontof the plaintiff was not relevant.  3)The plaintiff was unable to conclude that one version of facts was correct and the other was incorrect. Each statement contained an equal rational explanation. 4)The evidence could support either versions of the events related to the court by the defendant and the plaintiff respectively."
5_2004skca60.txt,"The applicant applies for leave to appeal a decision of the Assessment Appeals Committee of the Saskatchewan Municipal Board on a question of law pursuant to s. 33.1 of the Municipal Board Act. The issues raised by the applicant relate to abnormal obsolescence for size and the refusal of the Assessor to apply abnormal obsolescence to the owner's property. The issues also relate to 15 other properties and as the issues are the same for each property they were decided by the Assessment Appeals Committee on one appeal. The Assessment Appeals Committee dismissed the appeals, finding the issue not to be a matter of the Assessor's Discretion but a matter of professional interpretation of data. The Committee found the Board of Revision did not err in its decision to dismiss the appeals and found the Board did not err on the issue of abnormal obsolescence for size. HELD: Leave to appeal was granted on two questions of law.  1) Did the Committee err in its interpretation and application of the Saskatchewan Assessment Manual by failing to find that economic obsolescence for size must be categorized on a MAF by MAF basis? 2) Did the Committee err by failing to find the Assessor should have used the comparable unit method to determine whether an adjustment for obsolescence for size should be applied to the applicant's property? 3) On the use of invalid sales leave was denied on the basis the question of the sale is a question of fact and in argument the applicant said for its purposes the impugned sale did not matter. 4) Leave to appeal was denied on the issue of the standard of proof that there was no error demonstrated.","The applicant applies for leave to appeal a decision of the Assessment Appeals Committee of the Saskatchewan Municipal Board on a question of law pursuant to s. 33.1 of The Municipal Board Act. HELD: Leave to appeal is denied. The issue is the use of invalid sales and the alleged improper onus or standard of proof. The sales were representative of many different MAF neighbourhoods and the issue of the aggregation of the MAFs merits consideration. The Assessor had determined the specific MAF neighborhoods based on industrial property sales. However, the determination was necessary because the market operated differently in each neighbourhood and properties had to be segregated in order to value accurately. The factors of economic obsolescence are considered when the Assessor determines the Maf for each neighbourhood. The MAF in a given neighbourhood might capture all of the economic and financial obsolescences but there is only some of it such that the abnormal economic obsolescentence could be a significant factor. The Committee did not err in its decision to dismiss the appeals and found the Board did not erred on the issue. Leave to appealed was denied."

The issue is whether the plaintiff's claim is a liquidated demand within the meaning of s. 3(1) of the Act, and if so, whether the affidavit filed in support of the issuance of both of the pre-judgment garnishees complies with s. 3(2) of the Act. HELD: The plaintiff has not strictly complied with the provisions of s. 3(2) of the Act, and the garnishee summons are a nullity.  1) In an application to set aside a pre-judgment garnishee, the court is not to consider potential defences to the action or the existence of triable issues as grounds for setting aside a garnishee summons. 2) The court examined whether or not the affidavit showed, with the required precision, the amount of the debt or liquidated demand. Although there is reference in the statement of claim to an agreement that interest would be paid at 2.0 % per month, compounded monthly, there is no mention of interest in the Operating Agreement. 3) Of more concern is the four-page invoice attached to the affidavit supposedly attached to confirm the amount of the debt owed by the defendant. The invoice is vague and is of no assistance to the court in clarifying the precise amount of the debt owing. Unlike the information provided in the affidavit of Kuznitsoff v. Hilltop Ford Equipment Sales Ltd. (c.o.b. Hilltop Equipment Sales), wherein the affidavit charted the alleged gross profits by listing the equipment, date of sale, model number, sale price, cost and gross profits on a line by line basis, the contents of the affidavit here is severely deficient in showing with precision the amount of indebtedness owing.","FIAT.

The issue was whether the claim was a liquidated demand within the meaning of s. 3(1) of the Act and if so, whether the affidavit of the plaintiff filed in support of the issuance of both the pre- and garnishees complies with s.3(2).

5_2006nsca41.txt,"The plaintiff company commenced an action against a former employee/shareholder for breach of fiduciary and employee duty. The shareholder defended and claimed that one of the directors had misappropriated funds from the company. The shareholder later retained a new solicitor, who successfully applied to amend the defence to withdraw certain admissions and amend the counterclaim to add a shareholder oppression remedy and for leave to bring a derivative action. The court found that, in the circumstances, the new counsel's assessment of his client's case was sufficient to allow the admissions in the defence to be withdrawn, the implied undertaking against the collateral use of discovery evidence did not apply because the pleaded material facts were the same facts material to the shareholder oppression action and the applicant bore an ordinary onus to establish the three statutory prerequisites. The court also directed the employee to retain an expert and for the company to pay that expert and make all reasonable disclosure that the expert reasonably required. The plaintiff company appealed. Appeal dismissed; there was evidence before the trial judge on which he could conclude that it was just that the admissions be withdrawn; with respect to the oppression remedies and the employee's status as a complainant, the wording of the earlier consent order could be interpreted as not suspending his rights as a former shareholder; there was a temporal connection between the impugned acts and his ownership of the shares and he had a sufficient interest in the oppression remedies. The terms the judge imposed were within the broad discretion conferred by the Third Schedule of the Companies Act and there was no breach of natural justice by the imposition of them.","The appellants sought an order permitting the respondent to commence a derivative action against the defendant and to add a claim for an 'oppression remedy' pursuant to s. 5.03 of the Companies Act. The respondent had previously been a shareholder and the appellant had filed a defence and counterclaim admitting certain allegations in the statement of claim. When the respondent left the company he transferred his shares to the appellant, who was now a director. The appellant subsequently retained new counsel. The new counsel sought to amend the admissions and add a claimed for an “oppression remedies” to the counterclaim. The judge granted leave to appeal, but dismissed the appeal. The appellants had relied on the Supreme Court of Canada decision in dismissing the appellant’s application. The court found that new counsel was available to advise the defendants on the various grounds of appeal and dismissed the application.

5_2006nssc43.txt,"The plaintiff alleged that a small piece of metal seen dangling from beneath the defendant's tractor trailer flew out from under the trailer as it passed the plaintiff's vehicle and hit her engine hood, bounced in the open window and caused her to lose control of her vehicle. She suffered injuries to her hands, arm and shoulder as she brought her vehicle under control. The defendant applied for summary judgment, presenting expert's reports to show that the metal did not come from his vehicle, nor upon inspection was there any location from which it might have dangled. Application for summary judgment granted; the defendant met the threshold test and the plaintiff failed to adduce any evidence beyond a bare allegation that this claim had a chance of success. The plaintiff cannot resist a summary judgment application by simply asserting that there are matters of the plaintiff's credibility that can only be decided by a trial judge.","The plaintiff was driving from Halifax to Seabright when a tractor-trailer passed her vehicle. She alleged that when the defendant's vehicle passed hers, a piece of metal fell off of it, fell to the pavement, bounced on to the engine bonnet of the vehicle, hit the left front fender near the aerial and then the wind blew it in through her open driver's side window. The defendant engaged two experts who examined the piece of Metal and reported that the metal did not come from the tractor- trailer. The experts' reports showed that the piece had not flown from the trailer and therefore there was no issue to be tried. The plaintiff argued that her discovery evidence was not bare allegation, but a material fact that if accepted at trial would give the plaintiff a real chance of success. She also argued that there was a connection between the alleged rate of speed and the mishap of the flying metal piece and that the experts' report did not show any such connection.HELD: The defendant was found liable. 1)The court found that the defendant had met the threshold test of establishing that there is no material fact requiring the court to make a determination of credibility. 2)The plaintiff failed to demonstrate that the object that she saw hit her vehicle was not from the truck and that it was not lodged in the trailer. 3)The evidence from the accident reconstruction company did not support the bare allegation. 4)The defendant had no liability for the accident nor for the loss of the plaintiff's eyes or hearing. 5)The experts were not required to testify as they had no experience with truck parts of this type. 6)Costs were not available to the plaintiff to plead on the pleadings."
5_2006skpc2.txt,"The accused is charged with care or control of a motor vehicle while impaired contrary to s. 255(1) and s. 253(a) of the Criminal Code and care or control while over .08 contrary to s. 253(b) of the Code. HELD: There is no remedy of exclusion of the Certificate of Analysis. Accordingly, the accused is guilty of care or control while over .08. The evidence does not prove impairment beyond a reasonable doubt.  1) It is clear from the evidence that the accused's vehicle was inoperable and immovable due to the damage from the accident and its location in the ditch. The defence raised the issue of whether a person can be 'in care or control of a motor vehicle' when there is no risk that the vehicle in question can be put in motion so that it can become dangerous to the public. The Court reviewed the cases. The first person to come upon the accident scene found the accused alone in the vehicle seated in the driver's seat. He saw no visible signs of anyone else at the scene. Upon approaching the vehicle, he observed the accused turn the ignition key to try and start the vehicle. There was no other evidence which established that the 'accused did not occupy that seat for the purpose of setting the vehicle in motion'. The accused has failed to rebut the presumption of care or control under s. 258(1)(a) of the Code and the Court finds that the accused was in 'care or control' of the motor vehicle. 2) Considering the case law and after objectively considering all the indicial of impairment known to the officer, together with the circumstances of the accident itself (which indicate driving error) there can be no doubt the officer had more than reasonable and probable grounds to form the requisite opinion pursuant to s. 254(2) of the Code to make a demand for samples of analysis.  3) The officer was sensitive to the immediate concern of the physical well-being of the accused. Though he may have formed his opinion in the ambulance, he wisely waited until medical personnel had made an initial assessment at the hospital before making any kind of demand. In the circumstances, the Court finds the officer made the demand at the first practical opportunity in relation to the entire investigation. 3) The officer, in coming to his conclusion to make a blood sample demand, considered a number of relevant factors, including time limits to obtain a breath sample, the severity and magnitude of the accident, the potential seriousness of the accused's head and neck injuries, the need for immediate emergency assessment and length of time it would take to treat the accused and keep him under observation. He believed the accused's condition was potentially serious and was completely justified in holding that belief. The evidence has proven the accused required immediate and emergent medical attention which made it obviously impractical to put the accused before a breathalyzer instrument within the time limit fixed by the Code. The officer had reasonable and probable grounds to believe that by reason of his physical condition, the accused may be incapable of providing a sample of his breath, or it would be impracticable to obtain a sample of his breath. All the requirements of s. 254(3) of the Code have been proven beyond a reasonable doubt. 4) The evidence discloses that the police officer made numerous efforts to ensure the accused actually spoke to a lawyer in private. After that, the accused made no further requests whatsoever to further speak to a lawyer. Following the principles set forth by the Saskatchewan Court of Appeal in R. v. Leedahl, 2002 SKCA 5, the evidence clearly establishes the accused was coherent and understood the right to counsel enunciated to him by the police officer. He in fact spoke to a lawyer and made no other requests. Further, there was no suggestion that the accused was incapable of understanding his right to counsel or that he was incapable or prevented from acting on his right. To the contrary, the evidence proves the exact opposite. The Court finds the accused has failed to demonstrate his s. 10(b) right to counsel was denied or infringed in any way.","The accused was charged with two counts of impaired driving and one count of having consumed alcohol in such a quantity that his blood alcohol content exceeded.08 contrary to s.255(1) and s.253(a) of the Criminal Code and with having consumed food in a manner that was in excess of.08 while operating a motor vehicle. The accused cursed at the police officer and asked to get out of his car. The officer responded by calling an answering service and the accused spoke to his mother. At the scene of the accident, the accused was found alone in the vehicle seated in the driver's seat with his seat belt on. An ambulance attended and police officers arrived within minutes and observed the accused in the car with the vehicle keys in his hand. The police officer made numerous efforts to ensure the accused actually spoke to a lawyer. There was no other evidence that established the accused did not occupy that seat for the purpose of setting the vehicle in motion. The court found that the accused had failed to rebut the presumption of care or control under s.258(1)(a). HELD: The accused was convicted of both charges. 1)The accused had reasonable and probable grounds to believe that he may be incapable of providing a sample of his breath or that it would be impracticable to obtain a sample. All of the requirements of s. 254(3) had been proven beyond a reasonable doubt. The totality of the evidence would lead any reasonable person to that conclusion. The Court found that it was not necessary to exclude the Certificate of Analysis as the accused's s.10(b) right to counsel was denied or infringed in any way. 2)Since the vehicle was inoperable as a result of an accident, with no risk of setting it in motion, the evidence proved it was vehicle as contemplated by the Criminal code for the purposes of care and control. 3)The Court found it was in good standing with respect to the other charges."
5_2008nssc113.txt,"The mother of two boys, ages 12 and 13, applied to vary access to add a condition that the father only be allowed to drive with the boys in the HRM, on roads with a speed limit of 80km/hr and under. She asked the Court to continue conditions that prevented him from consuming marijuana less than 8 hours before driving, and required him to consider the boys' wishes regarding access and transportation. The father argued that all restrictions relating to the transport of the children should be removed. The father had MS, and a medical marijuana licence. His driving was evaluated yearly, and the report arising from the latest evaluation did not appear to address his marijuana use. An independent assessment of the children's wishes showed they enjoyed time with their father, but worried about his ability to drive under the influence of marijuana. The unrepresented mother sought costs. Conditions continued; variation granted. If he leaves the HRM, the father is to arrange for public or other transportation. Costs awarded to the mother in the amount of $800. In terms of the driving issue, it was not fair to place the entire burden of the transport issue on the children. The Court was not satisfied from the evidence that the father's marijuana use was benign, and there was also a concern about the symptoms of his MS, especially on long trips. While in the HRM, if the boys became concerned about driving with their father, they could take a bus home or call their mother. If outside of the HRM, it would be more difficult for them to get home. In terms of costs issue, the mother was the successful party. Although she was unrepresented, she did have to take considerable time off work. She was also inconvenienced because the father was late in filing documents, despite having been given clear time-lines by the Court.","The father applied for a change to the Corollary Relief Judgment, alleging that the mother had denied him access and communication with his 3 and 12 year olds. He had been denied access for four years and had been using marijuana since the time he was denied access. The father had been diagnosed with multiple sclerosis since 1998 and was now facing the prospect of losing his ability to drive. He requested that all restrictions on his access be removed including the provision restricting his marijuana use to eight hours prior before driving. The mother objected to the access restrictions and requested that the matter be set aside for a further organizational pretrial to be held in November 2007. HELD: The court found that the father’s use of marijuana was no risk to the children and that his evidence of its benefits was not tainted by his past use of the substance. However, concerns relating to the medical condition and its possible effect on his driving had been raised by the father. The court was not satisfied that the evidence showed that his use was benign and without potential risk for his children. The doctor indicated that his doctor had renewed his prescription to use marijuana and that the marijuana use was not a risk to his children but it was unlikely that his drug use would result in a loss of mobility caused by his disability pension and the prospect that his children would not be able to exercise their right to drive safely. The evidence did not support his contention that marijuana would not provide the benefit without the side effects of anxiety and depression."
5_2008skca56.txt,"The accused was convicted by a jury of sexual assault and assault with a weapon. He was sentenced to 2 years in a federal penitentiary plus 2 years probation. He appeals both conviction and sentence. The accused and complainant met in a bar for the first time and then went to the accused's apartment. The complainant is a sex trade worker and was of the view that the accused was prepared to pay for sex. The accused stated that he did not know the complainant was a prostitute and thought she had 'picked him up'. Upon arriving at the appellant's home, he refused to pay for sex and the complainant refused consensual sex, at which point the appellant forced himself upon her, forcibly restrained her, removed her clothing and touched her body in a sexual manner, choked her and struck her in the face. As she tried to escape, the appellant struck her three times in the back with a baseball bat. The appellant argues there were two problems with the jury charge: 1) that the trial judge should have addressed the jury further with respect to the various types of inconsistencies and contradictions in the complainant's testimony and explained their significance, and 2) the trial judge should have mentioned a number of additional inconsistencies. HELD: Appeal against conviction dismissed. The issues with the jury charge do not give rise to intervention by this Court. While there is a general obligation on the trial judge to instruct the jury by reviewing the evidence and addressing inconsistencies, how the obligation is fulfilled will vary from case to case. There is no absolute formula automatically giving rise to a new trial. Much depends on the context of the whole trial and such things as the nature of the inconsistency and whether it goes to the essence of an element of the offence. The trial judge's charge was entirely correct in the circumstances of this case. Appeal against sentence is allowed and a sentence of 2 years less 1 day is substituted. The sentence imposed by the trial judge was based on a consensus between the crown and defence counsels. Both were of the view that a sentence in the federal system was more appropriate since it would permit the appellant to access sex offender treatment. After sentencing, the appellant, who is an immigrant, was informed that with a sentence of 2 years, he would have no appeal against an order declaring him inadmissible to Canada. If a sentence of less than 2 years is imposed, he will be guaranteed the opportunity to appear personally or by counsel on his appeal of such an order. The jurisprudence supports the proposition that a sentence's unintended effect on immigration status can be a relevant factor on sentence appeal.","The appellant appealed his conviction for sexual assault and using a weapon contrary to s. 271 of the Criminal Code and s. 267(a) of the Code. He was tried by a jury, which convicted him.  He appealed both his conviction and sentence. HELD: The appeal against conviction is dismissed. 1) When one assesses the case through the lens of the Yebes test, it is not unreasonable to conclude that the verdict isn't unreasonable. The trial judge here generally related the evidence of the complainant and the accused to the elements. 2) The jurisprudence supports the proposition that a sentence's unintended effect on immigration status can be a relevant factor on a sentence appeal. The Court concluded that the loss of the appellant's immigration appeal rights is a disproportionately severe collateral sanction, which was unforeseen by the appellant and his counsel at the sentencing hearing and apparently unintended by the sentencing judge. 3) The charge that followed 2 days later was entirely correct to the circumstances of this case. The conviction appeal was dismissed."

He had a previous record for non-violent offences., defendant sentenced to nine-and-a-half years imprisonment; aggravating factors included the defendant's possession and use of a handgun in an area where a number of people were close by and that a bullet had found its way into a nearby residence.","The two accused were jointly charged with two counts of murder and one count of attempted murder in relation to shootings in the early morning hours of December 10, 2006.

Both remained in custody until October 29, 2008 when they were released on judicial interim release under the Adult Bail Supervision Program. In this case, the accused served approximately 17 months of pre-trial custody while on remand and he should be credited 34 months for this dead time. HELD: The accused was sentenced to 9 years in prison with a credit for time spent on pre- trial custody. A sentence of 4½ years less credit for remand time and further credit for months spent on post-trial release would be appropriate. The court must consider the nature and circumstances of the offence and the character of the accused in order to arrive at a fit and proper sentence."

The defendant had residences in both Alberta and Nova Scotia but his Halifax residence was now up for sale and he travelled extensively around the world for his work. Although he had no criminal record and had been on a recognizance for 16 months prior to sentencing, the Crown argued that he was a flight risk given that his convictions would result in a mandatory three-year prison term and he had only a tenuous connection to the jurisdiction. Application for bail pending appeal granted provided the defendant enter into a recognizance of $25,000 with conditions. The defendant's actions bore no resemblance to the known problem of indiscriminate firearm use locally as he was a middle-aged professional and gun hobbyist and the circumstances that purportedly made him a flight risk had nothing to do with these charges but rather with his professional obligations.","The appellant appealed his conviction for offences relating to careless use of a firearm and unlawful possession of a weapon. The appellant contended the trial judge erred in failing to find a breach of the Charter when the police entered the appellant’s condominium and failed to grant remedy as a result. He also contended the minimum sentence provisions of s. 95(1) were unconstitutional. In his appeal, the Crown argued that the appellant was a flight risk because he had not established that he would surrender himself into custody as required by s. 679(3)(b) of the Code and had suffered credit card fraud as result of his convictions. In addition, the appellant argued that he had a tenuous connection to the jurisdiction and that his recent arrest and detention had resulted in a callous and in some cases violent assault. Allowing the appeal, setting out the factors leading to the release of an appellant, that the Crown did not allege that the grounds of appeal were frivolous, and that they were not seeking to disturb public confidence in the administration of justice. The issue on appeal was whether the appellant should surrender his passport, surrender his gun, or surrender his custody on the basis that he is a flight flight risk. The Crown argued the applicant had no criminal record, substantial assets, a favourable pre-sentence report, and a favourable conduct trial. As the appellant had indicated in his affidavit that he was not seeking a release, it was not unreasonable for him to assume that his release would be in the public interest. The applicant had a prior criminal record which included convictions for trafficking in stolen goods and possession of firearms contrary to s. 8(1), 88(1)(a), and 95(2) offences. He had a previous conviction for possession of stolen goods, which included a prohibited or restricted firearm at his dwelling, a condominium, and possessing firearms in an unauthorized place (the latter two being in Nova Scotia). The Crown also argued that there was a high risk that the applicant would be flight-trapped because of the seriousness of the charges, travel restrictions, and his failure to comply with his release terms. The court gave the order for the release on the condition that he surrender the gun to the appellant within 24 hours of the filing with the Registrar of Court the order dismissing or quashing the appeal or the notice of abandonment of the appeal as well as his right to a copy of the police affidavit filed at the time of his release and that he be released on an undertaking to appear within two business days after that date.

HELD: The appeal was of sufficient merit and it was not prima facie frivolous or vexatious. The appeal, however, was not found to be of sufficient importance to the practice of law or the Court of Queen’s Bench to warrant determination by the Court of Appeal.

The application for leave to appeal was dismissed. The applicant had not considered whether the chambers judge had exceeded his discretion in exercising his discretion within the criteria set out in Rothmans, Benson &amp;amp;and in the absence of any objection, her application proceeded on that basis alone, with her notice of appeal deemed to be 'draft notice' of appeal. HELD: Appeal dismissed. 1)The proposed appeal does not raise a new or controversial or unusual issue of practice, nor does it raise a valid question of law based on the facts of this matter, it does not bear heavily or potentially prejudiced the prospective outcome. 2)It is not pertinent to conclude the proposed appeal is of sufficient importance to the proceedings before the Court of Queen's Bench or to the field of practice or the state of the law or to administration of justice to warrant determination by a panel of the court. The Court's function at the outset is one of review only: review to determine if the judge abused his or her discretion. 3)While the proposed Appeal might be of sufficient merit to warrant the Court's attention at a later time, it might not have the potential to succeed while the whole field is still under investigation. 4)The applicant might have the benefit of a fair hearing."

Dismissing the application, that (1) pursuant to s. 32 of the Charter, the Charter did not apply to these employees since the university was not a subordinate body of government, and was not being controlled by government, but was an independent institution; the fact that the university's governing statute provided that teaching staff were 'deemed to be persons employed in the public service of the Province' for the purposes of their pension plan did not constitute governmental control such as to warrant the application of the Charter; and (2) the proper forum for this application was the Human Rights Commission. The court also considered the retroactive effect of the Nova Scotia decision in Sniders v. Nova Scotia (Attorney General), which struck down the provision in the Nova Scotia Human Rights Act precluding anyone 65 years or over from making an age discrimination complaint. The court concluded that the Sniders decision did have a retroactive effect to the date when s. 15 of the Charter came into force.","This was an application under s. 15(1), 24(1) and 52(1)(b) of the Charter of Rights for an order declaring that the mandatory retirement of the applicants by the respondent was invalid and infringes, denies and is inconsistent with the rights of the applicant as guaranteed under s15 and s7 of the Canadian Charter of rights and Freedoms and that the applicants be reinstated as full-time members of the respondent immediately and that pay to the applicants all compensation due to them as employees since the date of their mandatory retirement plus interest, and costs of the proceeding.

6_1996canlii6791.txt,"Allegations by the former wife and a child and family counsellor that the father and his new wife had physically and sexually abused the two children were found by authorities to be baseless. The co-defendants, the mother and counsellor, protested that they were under a duty to report the disclosures of abuse. At issue was whether the publication of four reports was libellous thus causing damage to the plaintiffs' reputations, whether they conspired to libel them in order to obtain custody, and whether the counsellor was incompetent and unqualified to assess and counsel the children and negligent in the preparation of the reports. HELD: Judgment was awarded against the defendants jointly and severally in the amount of $27,000. Aggravated damages of $1,000 was awarded against the mother and $15,000 was awarded against the counsellor and her company.  1)To prove that each defendant published written defamatory statements likely to injure their reputations, three presumptions must be made: the statements were published maliciously (malice in law); the statements were false; and the plaintiffs suffered damages. 2)Every publication of a defamatory statement is a new publication. It is no defence that the mother merely distributed the counsellor's reports. 3)Counsel conceded that the allegations in three of the reports, on their face, were defamatory.  4)The mother enjoyed qualified privilege prima facie because parental duty is so compelling. Two reports containing untrue and degrading allegations were in themselves intrinsic evidence of malice. The long history of the mother's attempts to discredit the plaintiffs was extrinsic evidence of impure motive or malice. The taping of the phone calls was considered to be just another trick to try and advance her cause. 5)The counsellor's reports tendered in court enjoyed absolute privilege but that privilege was lost when she published them to various social workers, the police and the doctors. This is true whether the reports were of an ordinary or expert witness. 6)Both criteria, making a report maliciously and without reasonable grounds, must be satisfied before an action will lie pursuant to s.12 of the Child and Family Services Act. Three reports were slanderous. 7)The conspiracy claim was dismissed. 8)The counsellor had extensive educational background but no clinical training in counselling or interviewing children and 45 sessions were excessive. 9)The counsellor owed a fiduciary duty to the children as their counsellor but owed no corresponding duty to their parents. The negligence claim was dismissed. 10)The long-lasting mental distress of the plaintiffs was clear and they were entitled to aggravated damages. They were not awarded punitive damages as there was no need of further deterrence.","The parties were involved in a dispute regarding the custody of their two boys. The mother, who had been the mother's counsellor, and the father, who were both medical professionals, claimed that the mother, his ex-wife and child and family counsellors had wrongfully accused them of physically and sexually abusing the children. HELD: 1)The mother's admission and evidence did not relieve the father of his responsibility to look after the children and to assist in the investigation of the allegations. 2)The evidence was so rotten that a written apology could not be accepted. 3)The court dismissed the application. It held that the statements were made with express malice and that the evidence was not credible. 4)The co-defendants were ordered to pay $600 costs. 5)Costs were left to the court."

6_2000skqb355.txt,"FIAT. The applicants, charged separately, plead not guilty to cultivation and possession of marijuana and sought to have the evidence obtained pursuant to the authorizations for electronic surveillance and search warrant be excluded from trial and requested a stay of proceedings on all charges.  They argued the search warrant, which resulted in the seizure of 365 marijuana plants, should be set aside on the additional grounds police officers allowed two news media camera crews onto the premises to film during the course of the search thereby rendering the search unreasonable pursuant to s.8 of the Charter. The primary ground was that the police did not try any available investigative procedures before applying for a surveillance authorization. As the matter was not urgent s.186(1)(b) of the Criminal Code was not complied with. The Crown objected to the defences' reliance on portions of the preliminary inquiry. The Crown produced an edited copy of the affidavits in support of the electronic and video surveillance warrants wherein all dates and other information were deleted to protect the identity of a principal source of information. HELD: The application for a stay of proceedings was dismissed. The evidence obtained pursuant to the electronic surveillance and the video surveillance warrant were ruled inadmissible at trial. The search warrant respecting the residence was set aside. The seriousness of the charge combined with the real evidence of the 365 marijuana plants outweighed the breach of the Charter s.8 right to be secure from unreasonable search and seizure. The exclusion of the evidence obtained from the search of the premises would bring the administration of justice into disrepute. 1)The portions of the preliminary inquiry transcript were allowed by way of affidavit subject to the right of the Crown to call amplification evidence.  2)The affidavit in support of the authorizations were considered solely on the basis of the edited copies. 3)The affidavit did disclose a current offence. It was not obvious why the Crown edited out the dates. 4)The 1997 authorization was set aside. The search was unreasonable and in breach of s.8 of the Charter. The s.186(1)(b) pre-conditions for granting an authorization were not met. There was no information contained in the affidavit or the amplification evidence which could support an objective standard that other investigative procedures were unlikely to succeed. The impression given the issuing judge was false and misleading. The fact pattern was the reverse of that in Dosch. The information was limited to the existence of a marijuana grow operation on a rural acreage owned by Derksen with whom Begrand-Fast was alleged to be involved. Neither had a criminal record. The boilerplate paragraphs as to why other investigative procedures were unlikely to succeed had no factual basis.  5)The information submitted to establish reasonable and probable grounds was exclusively information obtained from the electronic surveillance authorization. A good faith argument was not available because the information submitted in support of the warrant was tainted by the conduct utilized to obtain the authorization. The evidence obtained was equally a product of a serious infringement of the applicant's s.8 Charter rights because once the tainted evidence was excised for the affidavit in support there was no evidence supporting the issuance of the warrant. The privacy interest was comparatively high. The nature of the constitutional breach was major. The means of obtaining the authorization was misleading because the reasons offered for not conducting a further investigation lacked a factual basis. 6)The residence search warrant was set aside. The affidavit provided no indication of the source of the informer's knowledge. The issuing justice was therefore unable to assess the reliability or the credibility of the information. The fact the source is credible does not mean the information provided is reliable. 7)The seriousness of the breach was not at the high end of the scale. There was an attempt to comply with the Criminal Code and two of the three requirements were met. While good faith was not found with respect to the information offered in support of the electronic authorization, there was nothing in the information presented with respect to the search warrant that lead to a conclusion of bad faith. On balance the administration of justice would not be brought into disrepute with the admissibility of this evidence.  8)The Criminal Code makes no provision to add the names of civilians to a search warrant. The reasoning in R. v. West applied and the search of the Derksen residence was conducted in an unreasonable manner contrary to s.8 of the Charter. A Collins analysis favoured the inclusion of the evidence including the plants. The police were attentive to privacy issues in supervising and restricting the television cameras. The officer set grounds rules that the residence could not be identified in any broadcast. The drug section was not the initiator of inviting the media along. It was coincidence that the corporal did so on a search where the warrant was subsequently held to be invalid. The two events did not amount to a course of conduct. 9)The improper seizure and retention of personal property of the accused was a collateral matter and did not affect the fairness of the trial.","FIAT. The applicants, charged separately with cultivating marijuana and possession of marihuana, were scheduled for separate trials this fall before Judge and Jury. As is the practice in this jurisdiction, defence brought a Charter motion in advance of jury selection to set aside two provisions of the authorization: a section 186 CCC 60 day authorization for electronic surveillance and a search warrant authorizing the observance of the applicant Begrand-Fast. A search warrant to search the applicant's residence in April 1997 primarily directed at their residences and their cell phones; a section 487.01(4) video surveillance authorization permitting the interception of private communications at the residence of each accused authorizing the observation of the other applicant. The Crown argued that this authorization should be set aside as it was a derivative of the electronic authorization which is alleged to be unlawful. HELD: 1) Leave must be obtained to cross-examine. The granting of leave must be left to the exercise of the discretion of the trial judge. Leave should be granted when the trial is satisfied that cross-examination is necessary to enable the accused to make full answer and defence. As information obtained from the electronic surveillance was utilized in obtaining the video surveillance warrant and the subsequent search warrant both of these warrants should also be set Aside on the basis they are derivative of that authorization. It would appear to be an absolute waste of time and money to require duplication of such evidence on the Charter hearing. 2) There is no reason that leave to cross examine should be the preserve of a trial judge given the 1993 amendments to s. 187 of the Code. There is a strong directive to that end which should not be considered as a usurpation of the judge's function. The discretion of that trial judge should be interfered with on appeal except in cases in which it has not been judicially exercised. 3) Leave to examine is not the general rule, it is justified in these circumstances in order to prevent an abuse of what is essentially a ruling on the admissibility of evidence."
6_2003skqb170.txt,"The appellant, who received a suspended sentence with a one year probation order, appealed his conviction of assault (Criminal Code s.266) on the grounds the trial judge erred in law in making findings of fact and credibility based on evidence that did not exist (photographs of injuries that were not introduced into evidence at trial); by misapplying the appropriate standard of proof; although correctly articulating the test in R. v. W(D), misapplying that test in determining credibility; by failing to apply the appropriate test for a defence of necessity. The complainant, frightened by the sudden verbal outburst of the appellant, fled into the bush and refused to return because his mood had not changed. The trial judge did not accept the appellant's testimony that he used force only to protect the complainant from natural hazards in that location at night. HELD: The appeal was allowed. The conviction was set aside and a new trial was ordered. 1)Finding that there were photographs to corroborate the testimony of the complainant relating to her injuries was an error of law. No miscarriage of justice resulted from that error, as it was immaterial.  2)The trial judge clearly preferred the testimony of the complainant to that of the appellant but did not state why. It could not be concluded that his belief in the existence of photographs influenced the findings of credibility. Even if it did, there was still ample evidence to support a prima facie case of assault. Again no miscarriage of justice resulted. 3)The trial judge erred in law by failing to properly consider the defence of necessity. The three elements that must be present for a defence of necessity, as determined by the SCC in Latimer, include imminent peril or danger; absence of reasonable alternatives; proportionality between the harm inflicted and the harm avoided. The defence of necessity is considered in cases where there is an air of reality. The only evidence relating to the defence of necessity came from the appellant. It would not be appropriate in the circumstances of this case to substitute an acquittal. Had the trial judge applied the appropriate test, he may have come to a different conclusion.","The appellant was convicted of an assault contrary to s. 266 of the Criminal Code. His sentence was suspended with a 1-year probation order. He appealed from the conviction. HELD: The appeal was allowed and a new trial ordered. 1) The court found no error of law or miscarriage of justice. 2) The trial judge erred in law by making findings of fact based on evidence that did not exist; 3) The judge misapplied the test for a defence of necessity and 4) Although correctly articulating the test in R. v. W. (D.) (1991) 1 S.C.R. 742, the trial judge failed to properly consider the test. 5) It would not be appropriate in the circumstances of this case to substitute an acquittal for a conviction. Had the trial court applied the appropriate test, he may have come to the same conclusion. 6) The conviction was set aside because the appellant's belief in the existence of photographs enhanced the credibility of the complainant. That was an error."

I mentioned during the opening of this appeal that members of the panel had followed the usual practice of carefully reviewing the trial record and written arguments before this hearing.[2] We are all of the view that there is no basis to interfere with the decision of Mr. Justice Smith. As his extensive reasons for decision disclose he addressed the matter thoroughly. [3] This was a difficult case in which the trial judge was required to carefully address the competing claims for custody, but mindful of the 'best interests of the child'. Throughout the trial and in his reasons the learned trial judge focussed on this predominant issue. And in our view he addressed it as required by law. [4] We cannot say that the learned trial judge erred in any material respect when weighing and considering the evidence. Since the parties were unable to resolve the issues to their mutual satisfaction, it fell to the trial judge to make a 'hard choice'. He had the distinct advantage, that we do not have, of seeing and hearing the parties and being able to form an impression of them. [5] We dismiss this appeal with costs on double Column 5. [6] We cannot part from this appeal without noting the acrimonious history of litigation concerning custody and access. The welfare of [B.E.] would be better served by a spirit of compromise. The time, energy and expenses incurred in protracted litigation could be put to better use in advancing the welfare of this young child.","The appellant appealed the trial judge's decision regarding custody and access.

The Crown filed a certificate of analysis pursuant to s. 258(1)(g) of the Criminal Code for the purpose of proving the accused's blood alcohol level. The word and symbol 'Breathalyzer' had a line drawn through them and above the same was written 'Intoxilyzer'. There was no symbol with it. In the blank that followed was written '5000C'. This change was not initialed. The issue was whether s. 258(1)(g) of the Code requires that the approved instrument be identified by way of make and model. HELD: The charge was dismissed. The Court found the Crown could not rely on s. 258(1)(g) of the Code and there was no evidence of the accused's blood level. 1) The Court found that in order for a certificate of analysis under s. 258(1)(g) of the Code to constitute evidence as set out in that subsection, the make and model of the approved instrument has to be set out in the certificate or be proven by other evidence.  2) It was not possible to know who made the alteration. The use of a certificate is a shortcut afforded to the Crown. If it is to be employed, it must be employed correctly. In the circumstances, the approved instrument was not adequately identified as to make and model.","The accused is charged with driving an automobile with a blood alcohol level exceeding eighty milligrams of alcohol in 100 millilitres of blood. The police observed the accused blowing into something that she described as an 'intoxilyzer' at the detachment. The Crown filed a certificate of analysis pursuant to s258(1)(g) for the intended purpose of proving the accused's blood alcohol levels. It indicates that the samples were taken at 2:40 and 3:01, with results of 120 and 110 milligramrams, respectively. There is an initialled change to the expression of the year from 19 to 2003. HELD: The accused's charge is dismissed. 1)It is not a requirement of subparagraph 258(2)(g)(i) to constitute evidence as set out in that subsection. The make and model of the approved instrument has to be set out either in the certificate or be proven by other evidence. 2)There is no evidence of blood alcohol content. 3)The accused's model was not properly designated. 4)There was insufficient evidence to establish her expert qualified technician did not adequately or adequately report the model or the ability to identify the instrument or model of which she was qualified. 5)The certificate may be used to prove facts, not law. The instrument or type of instrument used is matter of fact; whether such an instrument is an approved instrument is a matter of law. While it is probably the same person made the alteration that is not initialled, one cannot adequately be sure of this. `Probably' is rarely, if ever, adequate to meet the burden borne by the Crown in a criminal trial.

6_2005nsca65.txt,"Following the close of the Crown's case on a trial of several weapons related offences, the defence moved for a directed verdict on the basis that there was no evidence that the offences occurred on the date alleged in the Information. The Crown sought to amend the Information to change the date of the offences. Without ruling on the motion to amend, the trial judge granted the motion for a directed verdict. The Crown appealed. Appeal allowed; acquittals set aside; new trial ordered. The directed verdict should not have been granted as, in this case, the date of the offences was not an essential element of the offences. If the directed verdict was not based on the discrepancy with the date, than the appeal would have to be allowed on the basis that the trial judge gave insufficient reasons which prejudiced the Crown's right of appeal.","The Crown appealed the acquittals entered by the Provincial Court judge on five charges relating to the possession and storage of prohibited weapons. The Information alleged that police officers who were in attendance at a residence as a result of a fire were advised by firefighters of two sawed off shotguns in the home. The defence admitted that on May 30, 2003, the resident of the home where the firearms were found, was subject to an order prohibiting possession of firearms and that he was not the holder of an firearms licence. At trial, defence counsel brought a motion for a directed verdict on the basis that there was no evidence of one of the elements of the offence, that is, the date of May 2003, which was an error of law. The trial judge granted the motion because the Crown had failed to prove that the date as alleged in the Information. That was an incorrect of law error. The appeal was allowed and the acquittalals were set aside and a new trial ordered."

The parties have agreed to an order of joint custody with the child residing primarily with the petitioner. The petitioner wishes to move from Saskatoon to Edmonton. HELD: Based on the loss of the respondent as an active co-parent and the petitioner's vague and uncertain plans for the child's care in Edmonton, it is not in the best interests of the child that he be allowed to relocate to Edmonton with the petitioner.","The petitioner and the respondent are the parents of the child. The petitioner separated in October 2003. They agreed to an order of joint custody with the child primarily residing with the respondent. The respondent opposes the petitioner's move to Edmonton. The issues on the proposed relocation are: 1) is it in the best interests of the baby to relocate from Saskatoon to Edmonton; and 2) what is an appropriate access schedule for the child to be with the petitioner. HELD: The respondent is to have joint custody of the Child with the mother. The Court reviewed the factual background in these decisions and found it was not in the children's best interests to allow the petitioner to relocate. Based on the loss of Harley as an active co-parent coupled with Charlene's vague and uncertain plans for the future, what is the best interest of the respondent to relocate to Edmonton? The Court considered the factors that may affect the child's ability to meet his needs. The evidence showed that the respondent would become an access parent and the child would lose the bond he now had with Harley."
6_2007nssc119.txt,"Two teenaged children were placed in the care of the father, who resided in Alberta, under the joint supervision of the Nova Scotia and Alberta agencies. Unknown to the court, the father's common law partner had an extensive child protection history. There were significant problems in the father's home, resulting in the older child removing herself from her father's care and going to live with an adult relative who also had a child protection history and the younger child disappearing for a time until the mother, who lived in Nova Scotia, finally tracked him down. The mother now sought the return of both children. The Nova Scotia agency sought to have its involvement terminated, arguing that both children were now old enough to self-protect. Although the younger child wished to return to the mother, the older child threatened to run away if removed from her current living situation. Children removed from the supervised care of the father and placed in the temporary care of the Nova Scotia agency with access to the mother and services to be provided to the mother and the children; the agency misled both the mother and the court by failing to disclose crucial information about the father's common law partner and the circumstances of the children once they were placed with the father and this failure was both inexplicable and inexcusable; costs are the appropriate remedy against the agency. Although the mother had completed some counseling, there was a substantial risk that both children would suffer physical harm if returned to her care due to her inability to supervise and protect them adequately. The mother continued to require professional intervention.","The issue in this case was whether the Agency failed to disclose relevant information to the petitioner and to the court. The petitioner had been apprehended by the Agency and placed in the supervised care of her father, who was now the custodial parent of the three children. Upon L.M.'s application, an ex parte order issued pursuant to the provisions of the Maintenance and Custody Act prevented the petitioner from leaving Cape Breton until further court hearing. The children were placed with the father's common law spouse (C.B.) who was to be the guardian of the children (L.M.). The parties agreed that the child should be returned to Nova Scotia, but the outcome resulted in an out of province courtesy Supervision Order from Cape Town Victoria. The mother, who had been involved in a rocky common law relationship between the parties, wanted the supervision order dismissed as the Agency wanted to assume sole responsibility for K.B. and the children. The common-law spouse (who had recently moved to the province from Alberta) opposed the order as it was based on concerns that her children would not be able to participate in community services and the protection order had been lifted in Nova Scotia. The father and the woman who had placed the children in the foster care of his common law partner (C.) were not aware of the child protection history until they moved to Alberta. They had discussed it with each other in person and had not been told of it until recently. The woman who was responsible for the children's adoption had confirmed that she had reviewed the file of the applicant and that she believed it contained relevant information. She also confirmed that the applicant had provided a letter to the Court which summarized the concerns of the parties regarding the children and that the evidence had not supported the Agency's position that the children would no longer be children in need of protective services. HELD: The court found that the information concerning the petitioner was simply not germane to the decision made by the agency. The court ordered the preservation of the petitioner’s child protection record, as it had been made known to the Agency prior to the children’ s. 39, s. 40(1) proceeding. The Court ordered the disposition of the two children, who were to be placed in care of the common law husband (C.). The Agency refused to disclose the information until it had exhausted all of its resources and had refused to provide any further assistance. The remaining children were to remain in the custody of the father until the completion of the probation order in Nova."

6_2008skca156.txt,"The Crown appeals an order from Provincial Court declaring that the accused is unfit to stand trial. The accused was charged with 29 offences arising out of failures to comply with multiple bail conditions. He was also charged with two indictable thefts. He is 22 years old and suffers from fetal alcohol spectrum disorder, attention deficit disorder and substance abuse. He was diagnosed as mildly mentally retarded and is considered incapable of handling the responsibilities that would enable him to live independently and will always need a protected living environment and sheltered employment. He was found unfit to stand trial on some previous property offences and is still under the supervision of the Provincial Review Board. The trial judge was satisfied that the accused met the first two criteria for fitness to stand trial Ã» he understood the nature of the charges against him and the possible consequences of being found guilty and he understood the difference between a guilty and not guilty plea. The focus of the decision was whether the accused had the capacity to communicate with counsel. The judge found that the accused would not be able to provide instruction to counsel during the trial process due in part to the fact that he is very distractable and could not sufficiently follow court proceedings to instruct counsel. HELD: Appeal allowed. The verdict of unfit to stand trial is set aside and a new trial ordered. The trial judge applied too stringent a test on concluding that the accused was unfit to stand trial and when the proper test is applied, it is apparent that the accused has the capacity to instruct counsel within the meaning of the Code. The trial judge's concern about the accused's distractable nature does not accord with the limited cognitive capacity test. The Courts have applied a test of 'limited cognitive capacity' for determining fitness. This test requires that, with respect to communicating to counsel, the accused is only required to be capable of recounting the fact of the alleged crimes. Limited cognitive capacity does not require analytic ability or the need for the accused to appreciate his own best interests. The authorities establish a very low threshold for fitness to stand trial in keeping with the policy objectives of the Criminal Code and the right of the accused to make full answer and defence.","The Crown appealed an order of a Provincial Court judge declaring that the respondent was unfit to stand trial for offences committed between March 2006 and August 2007. The Crown contended the trial judge misapprehended the evidence, misstated the evidence and applied the wrong legal test for fitness, applied the incorrect burden of proof and made a finding that was unreasonable and not supported by the evidence. HELD: Appeal allowed. The limited cognitive capacity test (LGB) test is an effective balance between the objectives of the fitness rules and the constitutional right of the accused to choose his own defence and to have a trial within a reasonable time. The respondent had not been convicted in relation to any of the alleged offences and had not shown that he possessed the capacity to reason on higher cognitive levels, because of his lack of abstraction, and because of being 'locked in his delusional system'. The respondent did not meet the objectives set out in R. v. Taylor (1992), [1993] and [1994] and was still under the supervision of the Provincial Review Board."

M. a person under the age of fourteen years directly with a part of his body contrary to s. 151(a) of the Criminal Code. After reviewing the circumstances of the offence and the offender, in addition to sentencing principles as set out in the case law and statutes, the Court found that this was not a case where a conditional sentence served in the community is available or appropriate. The Court found the appropriate sentence, given all the circumstances, is a term of 9 months to be served in a correctional institute in Canada, to be followed by a 1 year term of probation containing the standard conditions. HELD: The accused is sentenced to 9 months incarceration. Pursuant to s. 109(1) of the Criminal Code, a firearm order was made for 10 years prohibiting the accused from possessing any type of weapon. The accused shall also supply a sample of his DNA for analysis. There is an order under s. 490.012(1) that the accused comply with the Sexual Offender Information Registration Act. The accused is also prohibited, pursuant to an order under s. 161(1)(a), from attending a public park or swimming area where persons under the age of 14 years are present or can reasonably be expected to be present, day care centre, school ground, playground or community centre for a period of 3 years.","The 37 year old accused was convicted of sexually touching a person under the age of 14 years, contrary to s. 151(1) of the Criminal Code. He had been in a residential school for three and one-half years and had previously been convicted of sexual assault. He lived with his step-grandmother (a.M.) for some time. His sexual touching occurred at his residence on the Muscowpetung First Nation Reserve on occasions when she would visit with him and her mother on weekends. HELD: The accused was sentenced to 9 months to be served in a correctional institute.  1) This is not a case where a conditional sentence served in the community is available or appropriate. The maximum sentence in case such as this is 10 years but it also provides a compulsory minimum sentence of incarceration of not less than 45 days. 2) The accused did not have any significant or related criminal record. He appeared to be well settled in a new relationship. His mother was a good person and her support of his family was significant. 3) The Court found that the accused had not shown any remorse or lack of concern for his stepmother."
6_2009skqb394.txt,"The plaintiff bought a house. She used the services of Cecilia Mui, a realtor associated with the defendant 100% Realty Associates Ltd. operating as Re/max Saskatoon. The house was purchased from the defendants Edward and Verl Karpinski. The vendors' realtor was the defendant, Mario Jacobucci, owner of the defendant Trevi Holdings Ltd. The house did not meet the plaintiff's expectations. She now sues the defendants seeking recovery of damages for alleged latent defects. She claims Ms. Mui fell below the standard of care required of a realtor representing a purchaser. She claims Ms. Mui was negligent in misrepresenting certain facts and breached the fiduciary duty expected of her. The plaintiff claims the Karpinskis misrepresented facts to her, negligently and fraudulently. The plaintiff claims that Mr. Jacobucci and his company are liable to her in damages, both in negligence and as parties to the misrepresentations made by the vendors. Special and general damages are claimed as are aggravated damages and punitive damages. The trial took place over 22 days, spanning several years and included testimony from 14 witnesses. Two main issues are raised. The first is the liability of each of the defendants. The second issue is quantum of damages. The credibility of the parties is at the forefront of the determination of the issues. HELD: The vendors are liable to the plaintiff for breach of contract. Each of the defendants is a tortfeasor, each having breached an obligation or duty owed to the plaintiff, whether through negligence or misrepresentation. Their wrongful acts and omissions all contributed to the same damage. In that respect their liability is concurrent. The liability of the vendors and Mr. Jacobucci is joint, and that of Ms. Mui is several. As concurrent torfeasors, the fault for the damage shall be apportioned equally among the four of them.  1) Credibility is not a science, see R. v. Gagnon, 2006 SCC 17. It is not always possible to articulate with precision the complex intermingling of impressions that emerge after watching and listening to witnesses and attempting to reconcile the various versions of events. The principles and tools to be used in assessing credibility are summarized in Novak Estate (Re), 2008 NSSC 283. 2) Certain of the evidence of the Karpinskis and Ms. Mui is so unreliable that the whole of their evidence is cast with doubt. 3) The opinions and conclusions of Mr. Loraas and Mr. Epp are accepted by the court. They are professionals with no interest in the outcome of the action. Their evidence was largely unchallenged. The Court finds that the pine shakes were rotten, sealant had been applied to the shakes on at least two occasions and prior to the plaintiff offering to buy the property, the shakes were not properly installed allowing water to seep into the house, the skylight leaked and caulking had been applied to stop the leaking before the plaintiff offered to buy the house, there was improper and inadequate venting which resulted in moisture damage to the interior of the house and mold in the attic, the moisture damage in the house included damage to drywall and paint blisters. Nail pops throughout the house were largely the result of the house being moved. No inspection was done after the house was moved. 4) The Court finds the Karpinskis did not speak truthfully or completely when they answered the questions in the Property Condition Disclosure Statement (PCDS). The Court does not accept that the vendors were not aware of water and moisture damage arising from the improperly installed shingles, the missing ridge caps, the leaking skylight or the lack of venting. The sealant on the roof was sufficiently old to predate the plaintiff's purchase of the house. The vendors repaired the sink holes and moisture pockets and effectively concealed the problems. It should have been disclosed. Although the vendors denied knowing of the structural damage to their house, they knew the house had been cut in half and moved 300 kilometers and had sustained damage. The structural problems were concealed by the vendors through repairs to the dry wall, reinforcement at stress points, and repainting and patching of wall paper. The fact that the house had been cut in half and moved should have been disclosed on the PCDS. 5) It is not only current defects or ongoing problems that need to be disclosed on a PCDS. A prospective purchaser does not look to the PCDS only to ascertain that the roof is not leaking on the day it was signed, see Kaufmann v. Gibson, [2007] O.J. No. 2711 (Ont. S.C.) (QL). The Karpinskis are liable to the plaintiff for breach of contract for failing to disclose the existence of structural defects, damage due to water and roof leakage. The terms of the PCDS formed part of the agreement between the parties and the deliberate withholding of this information amounted to a false representation as to the condition of the home. With respect to damage arising from these defects, the doctrine of caveat emptor does not apply. 6) The requirements for negligent misrepresentation have been established by the plaintiff. The failure to disclose, or silence as to a known defect, amounts to an act of concealment of a material fact and has the same effect as an express misrepresentation and is sufficient to attract liability, Thomas v. Blackwell, 1999 SKQB 168. 7) The false representations knowingly made by the vendors and their silence as to material facts were fraudulent. 8) Ms. Mui was negligent and her conduct and advice to the plaintiff fell below the standard of care expected of a realtor acting for the purchaser of a rural property in 1999. She did not conduct any preliminary background checks with the Rural Municipality, which would include determining if proper permits had been obtained, prior to the plaintiff's offer to purchase. Ms. Mui did nothing more than merely mention a home inspection to the plaintiff on one occasion. At no time did she recommend a home inspection even after she knew the house had been moved and before the condition regarding a satisfactory PCDS was removed. Another reason to strongly recommend a home inspection would be in circumstances where the realtor knew that a rural municipality did not require building inspections and Ms. Mui knew this to be the case. The plaintiff relied on the representation of Ms. Mui to her detriment. Had Ms. Mui disclosed all material facts to the plaintiff and explained and recommended a home inspection, the Court is satisfied that the outcome for the plaintiff would have been different. Knowing the house had been moved and had not been inspected the plaintiff would have most likely reconsidered her decision to purchase. 9) The Court is satisfied that Mr. Jacabucci is liable to the plaintiff for negligent misrepresentation. He represented that the home was of 'quality construction'. This was incorrect. Mr. Jacobucci was also complicit in, and party to, the negligent misrepresentations made by the vendors in the PCDS. He knew the house had been moved and sustained damage. He also knew the skylight leaked. The plaintiff relied on these misrepresentations and damages resulted.  10) The costs incurred by the plaintiff to repair the house total $17,613. She is awarded $15,000 as compensation for personal time and effort that she expended in repairing the home. There is no evidence that the distress the plaintiff experienced constituted a physical injury, or a recognized psychiatric illness and she cannot be compensated for mental distress, whether under tort or breach of contract. She is awarded $10,000 for aggravated damages. Her claim for punitive damages is dismissed. Her claim for solicitor and client costs is dismissed. Corrigendum received dated December 3, 2009 and added to fulltext.","The plaintiff purchased a country home in 1998. She engaged the services of a defendant realtor who had worked with her for several years as a result of her desire to buy a house. The defendant sold the property in 1999 and had its realtor, Cecilia Mui, take over as realtor in 1999. The realtor then proceeded to damage the plaintiff's home by cracking, nail pops and sink holes in virtually every room of the house, the vapour barrier in the crawl space was improperly installed, the wood paneling was rotten, and there were cracks in the eaves. The plaintiff sued the defendants seeking recovery of damages for alleged latent defects in the house. She alleged that Mui and her husband, Mario Jacobucci, were negligent in misrepresenting facts and breached the fiduciary duty expected of them. HELD: The plaintiff sues the defendants for recovery of $250,000 in damages. The Court found that the defendant and Ms. Mui fell below the standard of care required of a realtor representing the purchaser of a residential property.

6_2010nssc154.txt,"The corporate defendant moved (under Rule 44.10 of the 2008 Rules) for an order terminating an attachment order made against it, and under Rule 32.02(3) to change the venue from Halifax to Windsor. The latter was not opposed. There was also an issue regarding an affidavit filed by the respondent, which referenced but did not attach the applicant's defence. The respondent argued it was unnecessary to attach a document already filed with the court. Change of venue granted in part: the applications will continue to be heard in Halifax, but the trial will be held in Windsor as requested. Neither party has a connection to Halifax. The respondent operates from Stewiacke and the dispute arose in Hants County. The attachment order is terminated, with costs of $1,000 to the applicant. An attachment order is an intrusive pre-trial remedy and will hinder the corporate applicant's attempts to resume/expand operations. Here there is no conduct to justify maintaining the order. The mere allegation of a connection between the individual and corporate defendants is insufficient to cause the court to pierce the corporate veil. The respondent has failed to establish any of the relevant grounds governing attachment orders. The Rules require facts, not allegations or suspicions. The affidavit in question was flawed. It should have attached the defence in order to properly incorporate the references to it.","The plaintiff, Sierra Forestry, moved for an order terminating an attachment order against it pursuant to Rule 44.10(b) of the Civil Procedure Rules (1972). The plaintiff sought a change of place of the proceeding, from Halifax to Windsor, in the area where the dispute arose. The defendant, Sterling Farm, argued that the attachment order caused Sterling Farm to shut down and that it interfered with the plaintiff's timber harvesting contract so that the contract was stopped. Sterling Farm argued that it had not established the necessary intent under the Rules. HELD: The 2007 attachment order was terminated.  1)The affidavit of February 28, 1991 did not properly incorporate the contents of the statement of claim. The mere allegation of a connection between the individual and corporate defendants is not sufficient reason to dispose of the corporate veil. 2)Sterling Farm did not establish any of the grounds available under the rules governing attachment orders. The plaintiff failed to establish facts, not allegations or suspicions. 3)Costs to the applicant were awarded in any event in the cause."
6_2013nssc256.txt,"Rule 14.01 – Meaning of “relevant” in Part 5 The plaintiff brought a negligence action against the defendant, stemming from a 2007 fire in premises that the defendant had rented from the plaintiff. The plaintiff sought production of documents related to a 2009 fire at another location rented by the defendant. The defendant resisted on the basis that the documents were not relevant. Held, motion dismissed. Under Rule 14.01, the motions judge must decide relevancy based on the pleadings and evidence produced on the motion as if the matter were raised at trial. The party seeking production must establish relevance. Here, the only evidence was regarding the occurrence of the fires; there was no evidence as to the manner of the defendant's operation of the business in the second location that would establish relevance to the action regarding the first location. The commonality of a fire in separate buildings two years apart does not, by itself, justify disclosure of documents relating to the second fire.","The defendant operated out of a leased premises in the plaintiff's building two years apart. The building was damaged by a fire in October 2007 and the plaintiff commenced an action against the defendant seeking damages, alleging negligence. After the fire the defendant moved to another location. In May of 2009 another fire occurred at the defendant's location resulting in destruction of that building. The defendant moved out of the premises in May of 2013. The plaintiff moved to a new location and in May 2009 another building was destroyed resulting in the destruction of another building. In August of 2013 another fire in separate buildings 2 years apart did not, by itself, justify disclosure of documents relating to the second fire. The commonality of two buildings 2.5 years apart does not, in itself justify disclosure. The fact that the defendant relocated to another building 2 years ago only served to further support its claim for negligence. To order disclosure of the documents at this stage of the proceedings without further evidence would only serve to sanction a fishing expedition, as stated by Justice LeBlanc in Murphy vs. Lawtons Drugs Stores Limited, 2010 NSSC 289 (CanLII). As a result the motion is dismissed. The court awards costs to the defendant."

She did not seek spousal support as part of her original application to the Court. In August of 2013, the petitioner sought to amend her petition to include a claim for spousal support based on the Spousal Support Advisory Guidelines. In January of 2014, the petitioner filed an application for interim spousal support retroactive to the date of separation. HELD: The petitioner was awarded spousal support, but the award was not retroactive to the date of separation. The petitioner was entitled to spousal support from the date that she put the respondent on notice of her application for spousal support. The respondent, at age 61, should not be forced to work overtime in order to meet his spousal support obligations. The Court found there was economic disparity between the income of the petitioner and the income of the respondent and awarded an interim award of non-compensatory spousal support in the amount of $400 per month, retroactive to November 1, 2013, until further order of the Court.","FIAT: Following the provisions of the Divorce Act for awards of spousal support, the court considers the economic disparity between the respondent and petitioner's incomes that is $79,320.00 versus $56,103.00, is sufficiently disparate and upon which an interim award of non-compensatory spousAL support is appropriate. HELD: 1)Following the provisions in the D.B.S., v. S.R.G; and the decision in Malinowski v. Malinows, [1999] 1 S.C.R.(4th) 577, the Court considers the Economic disparity between respondent and the petitioner's income that is approximately $79/320. This is sufficiently diverse to warrant an interim order of non sequitur support. 2)The respondent is 61 years old. His regular hourly rate of pay is $28.50. The respondent argues that he cannot keep up the pace of working overtime hours as he did in previous years. In assessing support, whether child support or spousals, court does not compel the payor to work more than a 40 hour work week by attributing to him an income which is based upon significant overtime income. At the respondent's age and given his state of health, this Court will not compel him to work any more than 40 hours. This Court will only compel the respondent to work less than a 60 hour workweek. The income of the petitioner in the year 2013 to his pay period ending December 14, 2013 was $95,275.73.

It does not apply to other areas of the law, such as financing, conveyance of property or insurance, where a more precise and predictable delineation may be appropriate. The Board is interpreting s.37 for the purposes of labour law alone. Appeal Allowed.","This was an appeal from an order setting aside, as premature, an order of the Labour Relations Board directing that a vote be held to determine which of two unions should represent the employees of the applicant. Two health care institutions, one residential lodge and one hospital, each of whose employees were represented by a different union, were to be integrated into one new institution, this Centre. This was undisputed that the long term intent was this integration. The application to the Board, by the appellant C.U.P.E. to determine if it represented a majority of the employees, was made under s. 37 of The Trade Union Act and on an application to quash, the first question to be asked by the reviewing court is whether the interpretation is patently unreasonable. This does not, as noted, apply to other areas of the law, such as financing, conveyance of property or insurance, where a more precise and predictable delineation of the moment of transfer may be appropriate. HELD: Appeal allowed. 1)The transcript evidence was used to emphasize facts which were significant and were not in dispute. The Chamber judge turned his attention to these facts and concluded that they were not adequate to engage s.37. 2)The fundamental question was whether the Board's interpretation of s.38 was patently unreasonably unreasonable. 3)The evidence suggesting that the Board was not prepared to limit itself to indicia of transfer of title or assets of nature which might be more pertinent in the context of, for example, financing arrangements, insurance contracts or other such matters was not accepted. 4)There was no evidence that any of the factors raised by the Chamber judge were at issue. The transcript evidence did not support its conclusion that the application was premature. 5)The standard of review in the Court of Appeal was not unreasonable. 6)The Board was bound by all orders of the board and all proceedings had and proceedings were continue as if the business had not been acquired. Further administration was being carried out in the name of the Centre and residents had moved into the new building.  7)It was not appropriate to jump immediately to an analysis in the facts premised on different interpretation."

HELD: The provisional order was confirmed but the monthly child maintenance was reduced from $300 per child to $50 as the respondent earned approximately $12,000 per year gross. Based on federal guidelines she would be required to pay $142 for the two children but had unusually high costs for exercising access as the former husband lived in Alberta.","The Maintenance Enforcement Office ordered the respondent to reduce monthly child support from $300 to $50 and the former husband to $285. The respondent had unusually high costs for exercising access as she lived in Saskatoon and Calgary, Alberta, and her former husband lived in Calgary. HELD: The provisional order was confirmed and the child support reduced to $100 per month or $50 per month per child.  1)The respondent earned approximately $12,000.00 per year gross. Based on the federal guidelines for Saskatchewan, she would be required to pay $142.00/month to the father of the children, Cassandra and Anastasia. However, the respondent has unusually high cost for exercising. In light of that cost, reduce the child maintenance to $300.00 (or $50.00) per child; commencing June 1, 1997. 2)The mother was unusually high in the amount of $142 per month. The former husband was in Calgary, Canada. 3)The father was in Saskatchewan and the respondent was in Alberta. 4)Discretion was made in light of the cost of the child care."
7_2010nsca95.txt,"The first defendant was the lessee and driver of a motor vehicle that was involved in a motor vehicle accident with the plaintiff. The second defendant was the lessor of the vehicle. The plaintiff brought an action against both the lessor and lessee, arguing that the second defendant was liable, both as the owner of the vehicle under the Motor Vehicle Act and pursuant to common law vicarious liability, for the lessee's negligence. The second defendant successfully applied for summary judgment, with the court finding that the lessor was not liable under the Motor Vehicle Act as the lease was not a 'rental contract' as defined in s. 62 of the Act and the lessor was not an 'owner' as defined in s. 2(ak) and the current state of the law did not suggest that a claim of vicarious liability had a real chance of success between a lessor and lessee. Both the plaintiff and the first defendant appealed. Appeal dismissed; the reverse onus provision in s. 248 does not apply in this case; the argument that the lease was not a conditional sales agreement but rather a rental agreement had no real chance of success and the fact that a vehicle is subject to a lease does not change the fact that there is no vicarious liability at common law between the owner and the driver of a vehicle.","The appellants appealed a decision granting summary judgment to the respondent, Chrysler, on the basis that it was not vicariously liable for the negligence of the plaintiff. At issue was whether the Chambers judge erred in determining that the action against Chrysler had no reasonable chance of success and whether the lease agreement had none of the characteristics of a rental agreement as contemplated by s. 62 of the Motor Vehicle Act. The reverse onus provision did not apply. The appellants argued that the trial judge failed to apply the law in Bazley, supra, and that the issue had no relation to the one before him. They also argued that there was no evidence that Chrysler exercised the high level of control that is required by the Interpretation Vicarious Liability Requirements. HELD: Appeal dismissed. 1) The Chambers judge did not err in determining there were no material facts in dispute. The lease agreement did not fit within the type of rental agreement contemplated by Motor Vehicle 62.  2) There was no issue on the merits that the plaintiff had not demonstrated entitlement to judgment on the undisputed facts.  3) The issue was the question of whether the appellants had established that the claim for vicarious liability against the respondent was based upon the facts and not on the interpretation of the Act. 4) The lease falls into the 'lease with right of purchase' exception to the definition of 'owner.' 5) In Bazley the Court was addressing whether non-employee corporation, operating two residential care facilities for the treatment of emotionally troubled children, was vicarious liable for negligence of Giffin. The insurer was not a participant in the motion or on this appeal.  6) In summary judgment, the issues on appeal may be summarized as follows: 1) There is no evidence of negligence by the applicant in the operation of the motor vehicle; 2) It must be assumed that the applicant has a real chance to succeed where the loss or damage occasioned by the collision of motor vehicles is; and 7) There must be a material increase in the risk as a consequence of the employer's enterprise and the duties he entrusted to the employee, mindful of the policies behind vicarious negligence. 8) The Court addressed the issue of costs."
7_2011nspc27.txt,"The female driver, the accused and two other men were in a vehicle that was stopped on suspicion of being involved in a robbery. A gun and many of the stolen items were found in the vehicle and all the occupants were charged with a number of offences, including robbery. The accused denied being in the area where the robbery occurred but alleged that they had stopped and picked up the two other men. While at the police station, he pulled a ring that had been reported stolen out of his pants and placed it on his finger. At his trial, one of the other men testified that he had pled guilty to the robbery; the driver testified that she had driven directly from her home to where the vehicle was stopped by the police, without stopping; and the complainant testified that he had been lured to the driver's house, where he was ambushed by her and three men, robbed and threatened. Although his descriptions matched the two other males in the vehicle, he positively stated that the accused was not the third person. Accused found not guilty on all charges; the Crown had not proven that he was involved in the robbery or that he should have known there was a gun or stolen property in the car. Although the circumstances in which the accused was taken into custody were more than suspicious, the fact that the complainant had clearly seen the robbers but had made a positive non-identification created an inconsistency that raised a reasonable doubt.","The accused, a young person, was charged with robbery after police stopped a car suspected of being involved in a robbery with a firearm at a specific address in Sackville. The police found the accused in the car loaded with stolen property, a gun and a ring reported to have been stolen from the accused, and two young men who had pleaded guilty to the robbery admitted to being the people who got in the vehicle when it was stopped. HELD: The accused was found guilty of robbery. The circumstantial evidence did not support the inference that the accused was the person involved in the robbery, but rather suggested that the person who had been picked up by the police might be the person that was in the driver's seat. The court found that the only person who was able to identify the accused through his or her description of the three men was the driver of the car. The evidence of the accused’s involvement would have to be so strong that it would allow the inference to be made that he was not involved with the robbery. There was no doubt that the car was picked up in Fairview, but the evidence also raised a question of whether the accused had a memory of what happened in the house where the robbery took place. Finally, there was the evidence that a witness, who was not sitting on the bench with the accused when the police stopped the car, could have been the person in the description given by the accused. The Crown had proven it was not reasonable to expect the accused to have a memory that was not provided by the other witness. The Court found that both the accused and the driver were in the back seat of the vehicle at the time of the police stop. Therefore, an in dock identification was not the most compelling of evidence. Having a witness who was asked to identify his assailant and for the first time picked up the accused out of the dock and placed him on his finger, and having the witness testify that she recognized the accused from the house in which the robbery was committed, it was logical to assume that the witness was either mistaken or not telling the whole truth."
7_2011skpc143.txt,"The plaintiff filed a number of duplicate claims on behalf of a number of individuals. The issue was whether the claims should be issued. HELD: Section 7(1) of The Small Claims Act provides that a Provincial Court Judge acts as a gatekeeper to insure that claims comply with the Act before they are issued. In this role, the Provincial Court judge is exercising a quasi judicial function. Counsel for the plaintiff has clearly indicated that the claim is a test case. The plaintiff seeks declaratory relief. A substantial amount of the claim involves an allegation of breach of contract, but neither the plaintiff nor the proposed defendants were signatories to the contract. Accordingly, they would not be entitled to the benefit of the agreement. As virtually all of the potential issues raised by these claims are declaratory in nature, they are outside the jurisdiction of the Provincial Court. Any litigation over these issues must be done in the Court of Queen's Bench.","The defendant filed an interim summons requesting the court to issue a supplementary summons. The summons was refused and the plaintiff was sent back to Court to argue the issues. The defendant was not seeking declaratory relief and had not provided any notice to the court. The court had jurisdiction to issue the summons when it was absent from its office. The applicant had submitted 18 Claims for issuing on behalf of the claimants. The issues raised by the claims were important issues to the potential plaintiffs and may well be worth litigating. The litigation, in the court's view, must be done in the Court of Queen's Bench, by either issuing a new claim, or by enforcement proceedings of the claim upon which the agreement referenced above was made. HELD: The application was dismissed. 1)The summons was declined. 2)There appeared to be room to interpret the claim as raising certain constitutional issues. 3)The applicant had indicated that he would like to participate in a hearing on the issues raised. 4)The court was not able to decide on the issue of whether the claim should be issued. The matter had been dealt with in Provincial Court under the Small Claims Act. 5)It was appropriate to have the court provide notice to both the RCMP and the Attorneys General in accordance with s.3 of the Constitutional Questions Act. 6)The application for declarative relief was dismissed because the applicant had not demonstrated a clear understanding of the issues presented. 7)The defendant was entitled to a copy of the supplementary summons as provided in the decision. 8)Section 7(4) of The Small claims Act contemplates a decision such as the present one. It provides an exception to the mandatory issuing of summons in Provincial court pursuant to s.7(1) of the Act. If a judge refused to issue summons, that refusal does not prevent plaintiff from proceeding in the COURT or in any other manner authorized by law."
7_2012skqb338.txt,"Under Part 40 of The Queen's Bench Rules (QBR), the plaintiffs commenced an action in 2009 against the defendant for the return of their deposit and the recovery of their costs for plans with respect to a residential construction contract. The defendant denied the claim and affidavits were exchanged before a simplified trial date was set for May 2012. The trial was rescheduled to June when counsel for the defence withdrew. Just before the trial, the president of the defendant corporation requested that he be allowed to represent his corporation pursuant to Rule 10(2) of the QBR and notified the Court and the plaintiffs that his corporation had just been dissolved. This development raised three issues to be decided before the simplified trial could proceed: 1) did the Court have jurisdiction to hear the simplified trial; 2) what is the status of the dissolved corporate defendant?; and 3) what is the appropriate process during the trial? HELD: Regarding the first issue, the Court held that it had jurisdiction pursuant to s. 219(2) of The Business Corporations Act. With respect to the second issue, the Court held that again, pursuant to its interpretation of s. 219 of the Act, that the trial should proceed and that the dissolved corporate defendant be allowed to defend the action on the ground that if liability continues, so should the right to defend the action. As far as the third issue was concerned, the Court held that simplified trial would proceed and that the president of the dissolved corporate defendant would be permitted to represent it. Since the parties had given notice that they wished to cross-examine the deponents of affidavits filed in each other's case, the Court ordered that the deponents be produced for the purpose of cross-examination.","FIAT: The plaintiffs commenced their statement of claim under Part 40 of The Queen's Bench Rules of Saskatchewan on April 27, 2009. Their claim is with respect to construction contract of purchase and sale. The plaintiffs are claiming the return of their deposit of $25,000 and the costs of plans prepared for them at cost of $3,533.25. The defendant corporation filed a statement of defence on September 17, 2009 denying the plaintiffs claim. In February 2012 counsel for the plaintiffs withdrew and Orion Morgan, president of the defendant corporation, asked for an adjournment of the simplified trial which was granted on May 2, 2012. At that time, Orion Morgan advised counsel/the plaintiffs that his corporation had recently been dissolved. Counsel/the defendant corporation then filed a brief of law opposing the Court accepting that affidavit primarily on the basis that it was filed on the eve of trial. HELD: The simplified trial is to continue on September 5, 2012 in compliance with the provisions of the Rules.  1) The Court is aware that there is case law authority that has found contrary interpretation to similar provisions in other provinces. It is also aware that other case law jurisdictions have found similar decisions. 2) The court is not prepared to follow the decisions of other provinces but to follow other case laws that support the interpretation the Court made in this case of s. 219 of The Business Corporations Act. 3) As agreed by both parties, the Court has jurisdiction to hear the simplified trials despite the dissolution of the corporation.  4) The plaintiff corporation has given notice that it wishes to cross-examine the deponents of affidavits filed in each other's case. Orion Morgan shall be produced for the purpose of cross-examination. If the plaintiffs wish to cross‑examine, they will be produced. 5) The defendants are requesting that the affidavit of Marilee Fehr be considered by the Court on its behalf. She should make herself available for cross- examination. If not, the court will disregard the contents of her affidavit.  6) In accordance with the Rules, arrangements are to be made with the Local Registrar."
7_2012skqb510.txt,"The defendant was charged with unlawfully harvesting forest products contrary to s. 79(1)(a) of The Forest Resources Management Act, unlawfully possessing forest products without a licence contrary to s. 79(1)(c) and unlawfully trafficking in forest products contrary to s. 79(1)(f) of the Act. He was acquitted of the first two charges and convicted of the third. He appealed his conviction. He was fined $1,000 with a 40% surcharge. The Crown appealed the sentence. The appellant argued that since he was acquitted of the related charges, it followed that he should not have been convicted of trafficking. The charges had arisen as a result of a lengthy undercover investigation into the activities of the appellant. He was known to be harvesting fire kill in the Nesbitt Forest, which was Crown land. He stored wood on his property and on that of a relative. If the appellant was using it himself, he did not require a permit. The undercover conservation officer purchased fire wood from the appellant, who told the officer that the wood was from Crown land in an answer to officer's question whether it was cut on private land. The appellant did not testify at his trial nor did his relative and so the evidence of the conservation officer was uncontradicted. The evidence presented on his behalf was from individuals who had purchased wood from the defendant. The trial judge held that the charges against the appellant were strict liability offences and once the Crown had demonstrated beyond a reasonable doubt that the prohibited acts had been committed, the appellant had to establish on the balance of probabilities that he had been duly diligent and took all reasonable care to avoid offending. With respect to the first two charges, the trial judge held that he was not satisfied that during the period described in the indictment that the Crown had proven the actus reus of the offences but that it had on the third count, based on the appellant's own words to the officer. The appellant argued on appeal that his words could have been taken to mean that he was describing where he harvested wood for his own use and therefore his statement was not an admission that he sold wood to the officer or anyone else from Crown lands. HELD: The Court held that the trial judge erred in his reasoning and conclusion that appellant was guilty of trafficking because he had not been duly diligent. It is only if the actus reus was proven beyond a reasonable doubt that the considerations of whether due diligence had been proven would arise. The conviction could not be maintained because the qualifying actus reus was not proven. However, the other aspect of the evidence, which was not expressly considered by the trial judge and which would sustain a conviction, was if evidence established trafficking via another modality. Since s. 2(dd) of the Act defines 'traffic' to mean 'to offer for sale, barter, deal, solicit or tradeÃ ' and s. 79(1) states that it is an offence to traffic in forest products from Crown land without a licence, then the offence is complete by offering the product for sale without a licence. The appellant led no evidence to establish he had either the required permit to harvest forest products from Crown lands or a licence or any other form of authorization to deal in forest products. Thus, the evidence established beyond a reasonable doubt that the appellant was guilty of trafficking in forest products contrary to s. 79(1)(f) of the Act. The conviction was upheld. Regarding sentencing, the Court held that it was important to deter other offenders. The trial judge's sentence of a fine equivalent to the levy avoided (the provincial charge per cord of wood) was inappropriately low. The Court set the appropriate fine at $5,000 plus a victim fund surcharge of 40% as required by s. 3 of The Victims of Crime Regulations. If the fine was not paid within 60 days, the appellant would serve a term of imprisonment of 90 days.","HELD: The court upheld the sentence of $1,000 with a 40% surcharge for the offence of unlawfully trafficking in forest products. The court found that, after considering all of the evidence, it was not satisfied that during the period in the indictment, the Crown had proven beyond a reasonable doubt the actus reus on Count No.1 of unlawfully harvesting forest products, nor Count 2 of unlawfully possessing forest products contrary to s. 79(1)(f) of the Act. The Crown appealed the sentence imposed on the basis of the illegal sale of 211 cords of firewood consisting of 150 truckloads, 58 truckloads and three cords sold to Clarke. The defendant argued that he harvested the wood from Crown lands and not on Crown lands. The evidence presented by conservation officers was uncontradicted. The defence argued that the defendant sold the wood to an undercover officer for his personal heating and firewood business and that since the trial judge acquitted him of related charges of unlawfully extracting forest products and unlawfully possessing wood, it logically follows that he should not have been convicted of unlawful trafficking in such wood. HELD: 1)The court held that the Crown was not entitled to take this as an admission that the wood he sold was from Crown land and that it was unlawfully trafficked. 2)The defendant was entitled to have his conviction quashed. 3)The Court of Appeal would not interfere with a sentence imposed under s. 822 of the Criminal Code. The standard of review applied by an appellate court hearing summary conviction appeal is a narrow one. An appellate court ought not interfere in the decision of a trial judge in the absence of palpable and overriding error in law. The trial judge is to be given proper deference on matters of credibility since the appellant judge has the opportunity to see and hear witnesses. 4)The sentence imposed was an unreasonably low penalty for an offence the evidence established. The Court of Queen's Bench ordered the execution of the sentence on each count."
7_2015skqb352.txt,"Family Law – Custody and Access – Best Interests of ChildFamily Law – Custody and Access – Interim – VariationFamily Law – DivorceFamily Law – Evidence – AffidavitThe parties were in a high-conflict situation and brought five interim applications with various requests. They had three children, the youngest being born five days before a previous application. At the initial application the respondent mother was living in the family home and the petitioner was living at the family cottage and expected to move into the new home when it was ready. The petitioner did move into the home, which was a few blocks from the family home. The youngest child was almost a year old and the petitioner was having increased parenting time with him. The parties agreed to have a custody and access report prepared. The issues were: 1) divorce; 2) registration of the middle child in Montessori school. The respondent opposed the child attending the school because he was not yet potty trained. The petitioner advised that the school was okay with the child not being potty trained; 3) to take the child to a speech therapist. The parties ended up resolving the issue before chambers; 4) varying the existing parenting arrangements.  There was an interim order from January 2015 made shortly after the third child was born. The respondent had since hired a full-time nanny. The respondent did not necessarily oppose the petitioner spending more time with the youngest child, but she wanted to be the one to control the developing of that time. The petitioner wanted the child Wednesday afternoon to evening and Sunday from 11:00 am to 4:00 pm. He also wanted increased time with the two older children so that he could get them to their necessary activities and so that they could continue to develop their bond with him; 5) arrears of child and spousal support; 6) the respondent’s request to return the 2005 vehicle. The vehicle had been at the parties’ farm and was damaged beyond repair without insurance. The petitioner then towed the vehicle to the respondent’s home; 7) objections to one of the petitioner’s affidavits; and 8) costs. HELD: The issues were decided as follows: 1) the divorce was granted because the parties had been separated in excess of a year and no satisfactory reasons were argued for not allowing it; 2) the court held that it would be appropriate for the child to be enrolled in the Montessori school. The cost of the program was ordered to be paid by the petitioner. The parties were to agree on the child’s transportation to the school and if they could not agree the petitioner would transport him; 3) the court kept the issue under its jurisdiction so that either party could bring the matter back upon two days’ notice; 4) the pre-trial conference was months away and the court did not find it appropriate to have the matter of increased parenting time proceed to a pre-trial conference, as a stand-alone issue. The court found that it was in the best interests of all the children to have further time with the petitioner as he requested. The court also dealt with transportation for the hockey and the middle child’s skating; 5) counsel agreed that the issue of arrears due under the support provisions would await further discussion at the pre-trial conference with either party having leave to bring the matter back on two days’ notice; 6) the matter was adjourned sine die on two days’ notice; 7) the complaints were not generally well-founded; and 8) the petitioner was entitled to costs of $1,000 in any event of the cause. The respondent was entitled to costs of $200 in any event of the cause. The court declined to send the matter to the high-conflict mediation program.","HELD: The application was granted. The judgment was granted and the matter of increasing parenting time proceeded to a pre-trial conference, as a stand-alone issue, even an expedited pre- trial conference. There was no reason for the denial of the divorce at this stage. The evidence before the court was that the parties were in some conflict and it was pertinent that the court take this matter into account. As the parties had been separate and apart for in excess of 1 year, the statutory requirements pursuant to the Divorce Act for the granting of a divorce were met. The court reviewed the parenting arrangements in the interim and found they were in the best interests of the children. The petitioner sought to have the child registered in the Montessori program as soon as the program was able to accommodate such an attendance. The respondent was to advise the petitioner and he was to be responsible for getting the child to the program. Regarding the primary residence issue, the petitioner was ordered to have additional time with the child. An application to vary the existing parenting arrangements was also granted. It was pertinent to note that this was an interim matter and not a new one."

7_2018skqb90.txt,"Civil Procedure – Queen’s Bench Rules, Rule 6-75 The applicant insurance company sought an order for interpleader pursuant to Queen’s Bench rule 6-75 regarding premium surpluses it held in the amount of $3,550,800 that were generated between 1990, when it issued a group life insurance policy to the respondent, Agricultural Credit Corporation (Ag Credit), and 2015, when Ag Credit terminated the policy. The applicant requested that the monies be paid into court and that directions be provided as to how the determination of ownership would be decided. Ag Credit took the position that the funds paid as premiums were Crown funds and thus any surpluses were the property of the Crown and properly payable to Ag Credit as its agent. It argued that the interpleader order was unnecessary. The purpose of the group life insurance was to ensure that outstanding loans made by Ag Credit to borrowers were paid in the event of the borrowers’ deaths. Individual borrowers paid the premiums applicable to them by paying those amounts to Ag Credit, who remitted the payments to the applicant. There was no clear direction regarding the surpluses in the policy or in the Superintendent of Insurance Guidelines or applicable legislation. HELD: The application was granted subject to the court hearing further submissions from both parties regarding such things as whether the surplus should be paid into court or left to be administered by the applicant during the proceedings. The court found that the insurance company was entitled to some form of interpleader relief and dismissed Ag Credit’s claim to the surplus. It ordered that a representative be appointed to represent the class of insured clients in the proceedings in order to determine who was entitled to the surplus.","The ultimate issue in the proceedings is who is entitled to certain insurance premium surpluses totalling $3,552,881.00 as of October 31, 2016 plus interest accrued since. Empire Life is in possession of the funds. It claims no interest in the funds but is concerned that the claim of Ag Credit to these funds is not clear and that the rights to refund of such surplus may belong to individual borrowers of the insurer whose lives were insured over the years under the Policy and whom it views as having paid the premiums resulting in the surplus. Thus it seeks to interplead, pay the monies into court and have the Court give directions as to how the determination of ownership will be made. HELD: 1) While interpleader relief is appropriate, the appropriate form and nature of additional relief or direction is not immediately apparent. At this stage the competing claims to surplus are on the one hand Ag Credit and on the other hand Empire Life. The argument that Ag Credit collected monies from its clients for the purposes of paying their insurance premiums, had a fiduciary duty to do precisely that; the fact that the Superintendents' Guidelines governing group insurance provided that no other person had a competing interest to the Ag Credit's right and title was unnecessary. Since no one had a legitimate interest to contribute to the surplus, it was deemed within the meaning of the Act that all monies received by Ag Credit were property of the Crown and should be paid directly to it. 2) While there was an arguable case that the claims to surplias arising under the policy were not necessarily arrears to the Crown, it is in the interests of all parties that the funds actually remain in the hands of Empire Life, with the potential of continuing to earn interest, rather than be placed on deposit with the Court while this matter proceeds forward to final decision. Since the insured clients' class needs to participate in assisting the Court in determining whether Ag Credit or they as a class are entitled to receive the surplus without the necessity of any inter-pleader order or directions from or representation of other persons, the court will appoint a representative party to advance the case and interests of the insureds class."

In 1989 the vessel was based in Lunenburg, Nova Scotia and participated in the Marblehead race. In August 1990 an assessment of $195,785.90 was made against the respondent because the vessel had been registered in Nova Scotia.

The reviewing Judge refused to confirm the order and directed a rehearing as permitted by the section. The matter then came before this Judge for the rehearing ordered.

The defendant argued that there was sufficient reliable evidence to constitute the reasonable and probable grounds for issuance of the warrant. HELD: The evidence found at the respondent's residence was compelling and the application should have been granted by the authorizing judge. There was sufficient reliability evidence to support the warrant and the Court found that the evidence obtained met the test of'reasonable and probable' grounds. The reasons for the finding of 'expert' and 'true' was that the information was based on a tip originating from outside the police, was that tip credible, and the information corroborated by police investigation prior to making the decision to conduct the search. The evidence met the criteria set out in R. v. Debot, [1989] S.C.R. 1140. There were at least three concerns to be addressed in weighing evidence relied on by the police to justify a warrantless search: was the information predicting the commission of a criminal offence compelling; was the informant credible; where that information was a 'tip' originating from an outside source, was it credible; and were the other elements corroborated in the evidence corroborated prior to the decision of the respondent.

HELD: Appeal dismissed orally. The appellant relies on the words in parenthesis 'the Parties being absolutely prohibited from selling, assigning, transferring, conveying or otherwise disposing of any interest other than all of part of its Participating Interest' to establish its case that the voting agreement contravenes the terms of the joint venture agreement. However, subsection 14.01, with the words in parenthesis deleted, creates a complete right of first refusal. In our view, the words in parenthesis, rather than being intended to create substantial new contractual obligations, were intended, as is buttressed by the parenthetical structure, merely to recall to the parties their dedication of assets to the joint venture, and their inability to dispose of them qua separate assets. Thus, the phrase in parenthesis is mere surplusage in that it does not add or subtract substantively to subsection 14.01 or the joint venture agreement as a whole.

These claims related to the actions of an investor formerly employed by the defendant. The matter had languished at a slow pace for many years. The evidence showed the plaintiffs had taken three years to reply to a demand for particulars. There was also delay when the defendant requested a change in the plaintiff's counsel (because of a conflict of interest). The defendant applied to dismiss the plaintiffs' action, claiming want of prosecution under the Rule 28.13 of the old Civil Procedure Rules (1972), and asserting it has suffered significant prejudice as a result of the delay such that it will be impossible to properly defend the claim. Application dismissed. While there has been inordinate delay (eight-and-a-half-years) attributable to the plaintiffs, the defendant is also responsible for some of the delay (another two-and-a-half-years). While the plaintiff's delay could be considered inexcusable if viewed in isolation, the defendant's contribution to the delay is not irrelevant. There were actions on the part of the defendant that could be interpreted as acquiescing to the delay. After considering the case law concerning the circumstances in which a presumption of prejudice will arise as a result of the passage of time, the court found no presumption of prejudice here. On the facts, there is not a sufficient causal connection between the delay/blameworthy conduct and the prejudice. There is a significant documentary record of the transactions. The defendant has been in contact with its former employee and could have taken the opportunity to discover him sooner. The defendant's failure to act to secure the evidence available to them at time mitigates the effects of the passage of time. While there is a possibility of some prejudice should the matter proceed, the defendant has not established it will suffer serious prejudice. Even if there was serious prejudice, the balance of convenience weighs in favour of the plaintiffs given that dismissing the action would leave them with no other recourse.","The plaintiffs filed an Originating Notice and Statement of Claim in 2000. They claimed that the defendant RBC caused them to suffer losses on investments.

The defendant applied to dismiss the proceeding on the grounds of inordinate delay. Application dismissed; the delay was entirely due to the defendant's solicitor and the plaintiff himself was blameless. The delay was of 8 years. Even allowing for the use of RBC's lawyer, this means the delay of was of some eight-and-a-half years, which the court is satisfied is inordinate. The actions of the plaintiffs in suing RBC can and do be found to be inordinable.

The issue that will necessarily drag the proceedings to years is the intended counterclaim by Medusa for as yet undeterminable, possible or potential economic losses allegedly caused by the Respondent's enforcement application. The motion of Medusa was dismissed.  3) The Court considered all of the evidence presented, the applicable Civil Procedure Rules, the jurisprudence referred to and the able and helpful submissions by counsel for the parties and were not satisfied that the initial application could be converted to any action at this time. 4) Rule 7.02 provides a number of other circumstances that could lead to the formation of a separate action for damages. The Court could not predict the outcome of either of these circumstances. 5) The applicant could bring a motion to convert as it failed to meet its burden of proving the proposition on a balance of probabilities."

The petitioner, on the other hand, was found to be a truthful and reliable witness. The court was also impressed with the petitioner’s witnesses because they were close family members, long-time friends, and her live-in partner. By contrast, the respondent’s witnesses were friends seen from time to time, neighbours, and his mother. The court found the respondent’s mother to be evasive and guarded at times. To determine custody the court reviewed the factors set out in s. 8 of The Children’s Law Act, 1997. The petitioner was found to be the primary parent of the child since his birth. The court was left with a degree of uncertainty as to the day-to-day activities of the child when he was with the respondent. The quality of the child’s relationship with the petitioner was found to substantially exceed that of the respondent’s relationship with the child. The court accepted that the child said disturbing things upon his return to the petitioner from the respondent. The child’s need for a stable, reassuring, and positive home were found to be met in the petitioner’s home. The court indicated that decreasing the respondent’s time with the child may ameliorate the adverse effect on the child’s emotional needs. The child was also found to be afforded more social fulfillment in the petitioner’s care. The petitioner also had more constructive plans for the child’s future. The respondent’s negativity towards the petitioner was found to negatively impact his ability to parent. The court concluded that it was in the child’s best interests to primarily reside with the petitioner. The petitioner was granted sole custody of the child so as to minimize further conflict between the parties. The respondent was given unsupervised access every other weekend. The court added $5,000 to the petitioner’s line 150 income for the personal component of her vehicle expense deduction. After determining the respondent’s income the court found that the s. 3 Guideline child support due by the respondent to the petitioner was $676 per month and that he should be responsible for 37 percent of the s. 7 expenses. The petitioner did not request child support but instead asked the court to consider it in the distribution of property. The respondent discharged the onus of establishing a common-law relationship of two or more years. The respondent’s pension value available for division was found to be $11,663.97.  The court did not find an extraordinary circumstance to warrant an unequal division of the family home. The value of the home was $360,000. The court used the date of application to determine the amount owing on the home. The petitioner also had rental properties and was given an exemption of $90,641.43 for those properties. After taking into consideration all of the property and exemptions, the respondent failed to prove that he was entitled to any distribution under The Family Property Act. The petitioner did not claim an equalization payment. Costs were awarded to the petitioner and the respondent was restricted from bringing a further court application until those costs were paid.","HELD: The petitioner was granted interim shared custody with the respondent.

The petitioner’s petition for division of property, joint custody of Z., specified and supervised parenting time and costs were granted. The applicant also brought an amendment to the interim custody order in order to tide things over until trial could be held. The interim agreement provided that the petitioner would have Z. in the interim care of the petitioner and the respondent would have access to his mother. The parties had separated in November 2012. The child was born in December 2012. Throughout the relationship, the petitioner said the respondent had verbally abused the child and had threatened to take it out on him. He denied any contact with the child, claimed that the child was his responsibility, and that he had no money to give him. The evidence showed that the parties followed the interim orders and then ordered an expedited pre-trial conference to have everything put together and sent over before anything else could occur. HELD: 1)The petitioner was concerned that the respondent was holding the child from her and that she was unable to get him to come to her house. She telephoned the respondent the next morning principally to try and get the child back. 2)The respondent was not working and was in constant pain. He refused to take the child to the hospital. 3)All communication went through their lawyers. 4)The parties had been locked out since the December 2012 order. 5)It was clear from the outset that the issues between the parties were not being resolved that a reasonable solution was to have the child live with the petitioner rather than have him move with her to another residence. 6)There was nothing wrong with the basic premise of the petition: that a child should be in the custody of his mother so that she could come pick him up from her house at the appropriate time. The administration of justice was also discussed. 6).The petitioner had no claim to the parenting time of the child. The relationship was fostered by the fact that the two parties had not spoken for some time. There was a significant amount of conflicting affidavit material filed. 7)The evidence was that the father had not been paying child support for the petitioner for the past 3 years. He was using the money he was given to pay the lawyer for the duration of the agreement. The lawyer was not able to contact the child for several days because of the difficulty in reaching the agreed-upon time limit. 8)There were no reasonable"
8_2017skqb249.txt,"HELD: The application for leave to appeal was dismissed. The court found that a term permitting an appeal from an arbitrator’s decision on an error of law did not fall into the category of the obvious and was not the same as an implied term, such as that of good workmanship in contracts for repair. The contractual language used by the parties was clear that they intended to resolve disputes by final and binding arbitration. Even if it had found that the parties had not contracted out of s. 45(2) of the Act, the application for leave would have been dismissed because the proposed grounds of appeal did not raise a pure issue of law.","HAL applied for leave to appeal the decision of an arbitration panel. The arbitration panel had constituted to resolve a commercial contractual dispute between HAL and SecurTek. The dispute concerned the exclusive right to market, licence and distribute HAL's products in Canada. The parties entered into three separate contracts in 2008 that each provided that any disputes which could not be resolved by the parties would be settled by binding arbitration. The contracts each provided an implied condition that allowed the parties to appeal an arbitrators' decision based on an error of law, which the parties clearly intended to avoid. HELD: The application was dismissed. 1)The language of the agreements, particularly in the context and background of contract, is so clear with respect to the arbitration clauses and their finality that it cannot be overridden by vagueness or inadvertent omission. The intention expressed in the arbitration clause of the agreement is clear and it would take an equally clear statement to convey different intention. 2)Leave to appeal on a questions of law simply does not fall into the category of the obvious or something that goes without saying in the factual matrix of this case. Such an implied term is not akin, for instance, to the implied term of good faith in contractual negotiation, or the term of reasonable notice of termination in contracts of employment, and if there is a contrary intention on the part of either party, it must be found. 3)The parties referred to one, and only one, specific instance in which an appeal would be permitted, which was a very narrow issue. There is simply no other reasonable interpretation of such wording."

Pursuance of Rule 10,13, and Rule 5-13, the court exercised its judicial discretion and set aside Sollows' default judgment.

The Crown conceded this was a 'technically robbery' and reduced sentence to 1 year incarceration with a 10 year section 100 order; the Crown appealed the conviction. HELD: The appeal against conviction was dismissed. 1)The Crown conceded the incident was technically robbery and was at the low end of the scale of seriousness. 2)The sentence appeal was allowed and a sentence of 1 year imprisonment was imposed along with a 2010 s.100 order.
9_1998canlii1737.txt,"The plaintiff paid its municipal property taxes as assessed for three years. On appeal it was held to be entitled to a refund for each of the three years in the total amount of $420,000. The plaintiff, pursuant to s. 41(I) of the Judicature Act, sought payment of interest on this amount from the date of the payments. Awarding 5 months interest, that the date from which interest is calculated in this type of action is upon completion of the appeal process. An appropriate interest claim under s. 41(I) therefore only exists for the five month period between the Court of Appeal's assessment determination and the refund of the property tax five months later.","The plaintiff municipal tax payer paid its property taxes as assessed for the years 1994, 1995, 1996 and 1997 but on appeal was held entitled to a refund for each of the three years in the total of $420,177.13.  The plaintiff sought interest pursuant to s. 41(i) of the Judicature Act, supra on the refund from the date it made the overpayments in response to HRM's tax invoices requiring payment of those amounts on the due dates. The Nova Scotia Court of Appeal upheld the Utility and Review Board's assessment determination which translated into $420 million overpayment of taxes. HRM paid the refund of overpaid real property taxes to Canada Trust, pursuant to S. 90 of the Assessment Act, and sought an interest rate of 8.75% being a rate equatable to the interest charged by HRM on overdue taxes (prime plus 4.75%). HRM was under a direct mandatory statutory obligation, under s. 90, to refund any amount overpaid as soon as the appeal process concluded. It sought a refund of the overpayment as well as on the unpaid interest until September. HELD: 1)The Court found the utility and review board's determination was correct and an appropriate interest claim did exist under s41(i)(i)of the Judicial Act. 2)The interest rate was 8.25% being an equal rate equated to the rate charged by Canada Trust on overdue tax and was an appropriate rate on the principal amount for the five month period between the Nova Scotia court of appeal assessment determination in March 1997 and the payment of the property tax refund in September 1997 and on the outstanding interest until the date of judgment. 3)Taxpayers were not entitled to compensation for the deprivation.  4)Costs in the amount of $410,177 were calculated using the table below. 5)The court did not intend other statutory provisions, like s. 40(i), to apply or to be read in conjunction with the Assessment act."
9_2000skca87.txt,"An appeal under s.33.1 of the Municipal Board Act from a decision of the Assessment Appeals Committee of the Saskatchewan Municipal Board, one in a series of appeals heard at the same time dealing with the application of a newly introduced market adjustment factor (MAF) to assessments for municipal tax purposes. In issue was whether the assessor erred in law by misconstruing or misapplying the provisions of the Assessment Manual in determining the MAF for the appellant's shopping centre properties by using a single sale to calculate the MAF; and by creating as a commercial building neighbourhood the grouping of fully enclosed shopping centres which encompassed the entire city. HELD: 1)The assessment was set aside and the matter was remitted to the assessor to be dealt with according to the manual. Both issues were dealt with in Cadillac Fairview v. Saskatoon (TWL CA00074) and the same reasoning applied. 2)The appellant conceded that the question of whether the various expansions of the shopping centre resulted in abnormal functional economic obsolescence was a question of mixed law and fact and was thus beyond the scope of this appeal. 3)The second branch of the appeal was dismissed. Whether the committee erred in law by saying the definition of functional obsolescence did not apply to an add-on type of construction was beside the point since that was not the ground for the decision. The decision was not the result of any wrong interpretation of the manual but was the result of the appellant's failure to establish to the committee's satisfaction the facts on which it based its case. The decision was therefore beyond the Court of Appeal's jurisdiction to review.  4)There was no order as to costs as success was divided.","The appellant appealed a decision of the Assessment Appeals Committee of the Saskatchewan Municipal Board which held that the use of the MAF to be used in calculating the assessed value of a shopping centre was justified. Appeal allowed on the same basis as those in Cadillac Fairview v. Saskatoon. The issues raised in this case were exactly the same as those dealt with in another judgment, issued concurrently with this one in respect of the assessment of Midtown Plaza in Saskatoon: Cadillac FairVIEW and T. Eaton v. City of Saskatoon; and created as a commercial building neighbourhood the grouping of fully enclosed shopping centres which encompassed the entire city of Saskatoons. HELD: The appeal was granted on the basis that: 1) the assessment Appeals Committee erred in law by concluding that functional obsolescence does not apply to an add-on type of construction or by finding that there must be an inability of an improvement to perform the function for which it is used; 2) the committee failed to establish to the satisfaction of the committee the facts on which it based its case; 3) the decision was arrived at not as a result of any wrong interpretation of the manual but as a consequence of the failure to establish the facts of the Committee on the evidence or lack thereof. The present method of assessing the common area, therefore, is reasonable.  4) Market Mall was the oldest enclosed shopping centre in the mall and underwent expansions in 1979, 1982, 1987 and 1992. The business decision of building a parkade along with the lack of above ground parking are not in the category of abnormal functional obs obsolescences for the improvement. 5) The appeal must be allowed on a same basis in respect to these grounds of appeal. The Court did not err. The ground of appeal to the Committee was unique to this case as it was confined to whether the committee had erred by saying that the definition of functional obsolescentence did not apply only to add-ons type construction, or by using a single sale to calculate the market adjustment factor; or 6) that the Committee failed to accept the appellant's argument that economic utility should govern, rather than the ability of the improvements to perform that function. As the mall was built in 1966 and underwent expansion in 1979 and 1982, 1982 and 1992, its MAF would have been 0.94. In this case, the appellant only raised two issues: 1. Did the assessment appeal committee erred; 2. Did it err in law in concluding that the definitions of abnormal and abnormal obsolescolescence did"

Accused not guilty of assault causing bodily harm. The confrontation between the accused and the complainant was one continuing episodic event and the complainant's actions were provoked by the accused. However, no causal relationship was shown between the blows of the accused and the broken nose sustained by the complainant. There were too many variables and probabilities as to how the complainant's nose might have become broken.","Six persons shared an upstairs apartment. The complainant was the boyfriend of another tenant. The parties had been drinking in the basement and had stumbled into a fight in the living room. The accused, who had invited the complainant to join them in the fight, advanced and struck the complainant in the face. HELD: The accused was convicted of assault causing bodily harm. The Court found that the accused could not rely on the Criminal Code s.34(1) for his defence as he did not have the means to do so. The evidence suggested that the complainant had a hostile attitude towards the accused and that he was afraid of the accused. Therefore, the Court concluded that the assault was a consensual one and that the evidence did not support the accused’s defence of self-defence."

It is uncontroverted that Brina has disabilities that necessitate certain tools such as a computer for her to be successful in her post-secondary training. HELD: 1) The respondent accepts responsibility for his proportionate share of the girls' dental and orthodontic expenses and there shall be an order accordingly. 2) The September 2004 consent order provided that computer repairs and equipment were included in Brina's s. 7 expenses. Accordingly the costs relating to the computer are legitimate s. 7 costs. 2) The crisis prevention class was a reasonable expense incurred on Brina's part and will assist her with her future plans. 3) The Zeller's supplies would normally be covered under the Table support and that expense is disallowed. 4) Brina's s. 7 post-secondary expenses are $7,123.72 and include tuition, crisis prevention class and books, required university books, bus pass, black cartridge for the printer, Shaw internet, Microsoft licence, computer repairs and updated virus protection.","FIAT: The petitioner applies to have arrears fixed with regard to s. expenses related to her daughter's post-secondary education and in addition requests that the amount of the ongoing s. 7 expenses be specified.

HELD: The appeal is dismissed. 1) New evidence will not be admitted on an appeal if, by due diligence, it could have been adduced at trial. Further, new evidence will be admitted only if it bears upon a decisive or potentially decisive issue in the trial. Neither of these requirements is met. 2) The constitutional challenge is not properly before the Court as notice is required when the constitutionality of a bylaw is impugned. In any event, the uncertainty on which the appellants rely in attacking the bylaw does not exist. 3) The appellants misunderstand the use of the word 'hamlet' in the bylaw. 4) Whatever definition of 'livestock' is used, the definition always includes cattle.","At a June 2, 2006 trial in Provincial Court, the appellants were found guilty of breaching a bylaw of the Rural Municipality of Vanscoy No.345. The trial justice convicted them of breaching Bylaw 2-1995, which provides that no poultry or livestock be permitted in districts zoned hamlet. The appellants did not lead evidence at trial. They did not dispute that they were keeping cattle on their property. Their defence related to points of law. HELD: The application to admit new evidence was dismissed. 1)The appellants had not given notice under the Constitutional Questions Act. Notice is required when the constitutionality of bylaw is questioned. 2)The uncertainty suggested by these appellants does not exist. Under the no livestock policy no livestock is permitted in the district. Cattle are livestock, and so cattle are not permitted in that district. The three bylaws tendered by the appellans do not bear upon a decisive or potentially decisive issue at trial as the zoning bylaw does. The amendments to the bylaw address other topics. 3)There was no basis on the trial decision as the three bylaw bylaws were not reference to a particular type of livestock. The bylaw referred to an operation relating to keeping livestock and its relevance to the issues was not apparent. The second bylaw, which prohibits livestock in district zoned Hamlet, purports to be an amendment to Bylaws 2-1993 and 2-1994. The amendment to 2-1996 does not refer to livestock. 4)In the absence of a specific definition of 'livestock', the appellant's arguments on the merits related to the use of the word 'hamlet' in the bylaws. 5)Cattle were not permitted on the appellant's property. 6)The trial justice made no error in law.

The plaintiff requested that the defendant hold a show cause hearing to determine whether certain producers had contravened their licence but when a procedural breakdown occurred as to how that hearing would be conducted, with the plaintiff seeking and being denied an adjournment, the hearing was held without the plaintiff's participation. The plaintiff brought an application for mandamus to compel the defendant to hold a new hearing and filed two affidavits providing some detail and background information as to its reasoning for its failure to attend the hearing and the parties' differing positions regarding their respective roles in the application of the management plan. The defendant brought an application to strike certain of the affidavits filed by the plaintiff on the basis that they were an attempt to put evidence to the court on matters not forming part of the record. Application to strike affidavits dismissed; the Rules do not preclude the admission of affidavits on an application and, in the present circumstances, reason and fairness militated against ruling the affidavits inadmissible. There was no authority for denying the parties the use of affidavits should this application proceed as a jurisdictional dispute and, should it proceed by way of an error of law on the face of the record, the affidavits were also admissible to complete the record.","The applicant board applied pursuant to an interlocutory Notice seeking to have the affidavits of two of the applicant directors struck out as an attempt to put evidence to the court on matters not in or forming part of the Record of the Council Panel.

Both organizations had refused to appear at the hearing because their request for adjournment had been denied. The hearing then was held as scheduled without the participation of the Board, with the result that the Merks license was not suspended. Flowing from that decision and the differing conceptions of the board and Council regarding their respective roles and or jurisdiction in the process, the Board initiated this proceeding.

The contestation between the Marketing Council and Turkey Board is not a hypothetical issue. The Merks brothers are turkey producers and all the other licensed producers in the province who are represented by the Board. The Board's application for a declaratory judgment relating to the validity of a license was dismissed by the Attorney General in August 2007. 3)The applicant argued that affidavit evidence is only admissible if the record is incomplete.

The trial judge had found that both parties had exhibited a lack of interest in their child and there was little to distinguish either of them as the better custodial parent. As the mother had facilitated the father's access to the child and he had not demonstrated the same willingness and that the most important relationship in the child's life was with his sister, who resides with the mother, the trial judge found that it was in the child's best interest to foster that relationship and grant custody to the mother.

The father was directed to perfect his appeal and the stay of proceedings arising from Court of Appeal Rule 15(4) was also lifted.","The applicant mother sought a lifting of the stay of execution on the judgment of the trial judge pursuant to s. 8(a)(i) of The Children's Law Act.

The court found that it would be in the child's best interests to lift the stay on the basis of the evidence as to the father's lack of involvement with the mother and his seeming inability to facilitate access to his mother and sister, especially where access had been ordered by the court, that the lifting of this stay would allow the child to settle into routine and schedule during the school year without the interference of the mother.

The price of the canary seed escalated substantially during 1993. The defendant thought that as he did not have a copy of the contract signed by the plaintiff it was not a valid contract and sold the seed to a third party for more than double the contract price. HELD: Johnson Seeds was awarded judgment for $50,850.05 and pre-judgment interest together with costs of the action. 1)There was a valid contract between the parties. Damages were assessed as of January 1994 when Johnson Seeds knew that the defendant was in breach of the contract. 2)The issue was whether communication by delivery of the fully executed contract was necessary to complete the contract. The parties communicated by fax, mail and telephone. There was no doubt that the defendant verbally confirmed that a contract did exist. Discussions prior to May 1993 were pre-contractual negotiations. 3)Johnson Seed knew that it was prepared to pay 10 cents only if delivery occurred after January 1/94. The formal contract did not expressly set forth these conditions. Both parties knew these terms were absent when they executed the contract but both considered that they had a legally binding contract in 1993.  4)Farr took a calculated risk and sold the seed which alleviated his immediate cash-flow problem. Johnson Seeds waited until the last possible day under the written contract terms to call the contract in an effort to position itself to claim increased damages for breach of contract.","The plaintiff Seeds sought damages from the defendant for an alleged breach of contract. The plaintiff entered into a verbal contract with the defendant that required the defendant to deliver the canary seed. The defendant had limited storage capacity so it was not possible for the plaintiff to take delivery from the growers as soon as the crops were harvested. The contract stipulated that the defendant would receive a fully executed copy of the contract by the end of January 1994. Although the defendant did not execute the contract, the plaintiff telephoned the defendant and found out that he had a contract with Johnson Seeds and that he wanted to hold the canaries for a better price. At issue was whether communication by delivery of the fully executed contract was necessary to complete the contract so that it could be legally binding and enforceable.

b_1999canlii13927.txt,"The issue was whether it was appropriate for the court to require the accused to commence the trial by calling evidence on a Charter voir dire, where the accused gave notice of a Charter application. This would differ from the usual procedure, wherein the Crown commences the trial by calling its witnesses in the trial proper, and thereafter the accused applies for leave to apply the Crown evidence to the Charter application, where it is appropriate, in addition to calling other defence evidence on the application.HELD: In R. v. Kutynec, the court made the following determinations: 1) whatever procedures are used should not unnecessarily interfere with the inherent jurisdiction of the trial judge to control the conduct of the trial; 2) instead of creating procedures for Charter applications in provincial court, it is better to leave judges the discretion to determine matters such as sufficiency of notice and the extent of the offer of proof; 3) counsel should give timely notice to the Crown of the Charter issue, and at trial, the accused should be able to state with reasonable particularity the grounds upon which the application is made; 4) objections to admissibility of evidence must be made before or when the evidence is proffered; 5) the onus is on the accused to demonstrate on a balance of probabilities that he or she is entitled to a Charter remedy; 6) the trial judge should insist defence counsel state his or her position on possible Charter issues, either before or at the outset of the trial; 7) failing timely notice, a trial judge is entitled to refuse an application to assert a Charter remedy; 8) fairness may require the accused be given some latitude to explore potential Charter issues which he or she had no opportunity to develop prior to trial; and 9) the trial judge must control the proceedings to ensure this legitimate exploration does not become a fishing expedition. In R. v. Loveman, the court said the trial judge must ensure fairness and preserve the integrity of the trial process. This may require a judge to refuse to hear a motion where insufficient notice has been given, even when the motion involves an application to exclude evidence under s. 24 of the Charter. In R. v. Habhab, the court was asked to consider a procedure which involved entering into voir dire at the start of the trial and the Crown proceeding to lead their evidence at the outset regarding the Charter application and substantive issue. The court dismissed this proposal and stated that the case law implies it is the accused's obligation to lead the evidence on the voir dire. The court was not able to justify the proposed procedure. If the authorities imply there is an obligation on the accused to call evidence first on the Charter voir dire, this can occur by the application of some or all the evidence which is already on the record on the substantive issues. The admissibility of evidence can be reserved by the court pending judgment on the Charter and any s. 24 remedy. An advantage of having the Crown evidence on record at the outset is it removes uncertainty as to the nature of the testimony as it relates to the Charter application. This is preferable to the accused calling the Crown witness at the outset on the voir dire, discovering aspects of the evidence are contrary or unfavourable, and then having to convince the court to grant leave to cross-examine. It avoids a scenario where the Crown witness evidence is led by the defence on the voir dire, and then the accused must impeach the creditability of this witness in cross-examination as it relates to the proof of the substantive issues. The court concluded the fairness of the proceedings and public confidence in the administration of justice, were best served by the Crown first leading its evidence on the charge alleged and the accused having leave to request the evidence be applied to the Charter issue, if appropriate.","The issue was whether it was appropriate for the Court to require the accused to commence the trial by calling evidence on a Charter voir dire, where the accused has given notice of a Charter application. This would differ from the procedure which is usually utilized, wherein the Crown commences the trial in the trial proper and thereafter the accused applies to the court for leave to apply the Crown evidence to the Charter application, where it is appropriate to do so, and in addition to calling other defence evidence on the application. HELD: The Court held that it was in the interest of conducting an orderly trial that it would be appropriate to have the accused's evidence put on the record at the outset of the trial. All issues of notice to the Crown and sufficiency of disclosure can be sorted out at that time. This is a common sense proposition applicable to Charter applications to exclude evidence.  1)This can quite properly occur by the application of some or all of the evidence which is already before the court and on record on the substantive issues. The admissibility of that evidence can be reserved by the Court pending the determination of the Charter issue on its merits and the application for s.24 remedy, if any. 2)The accused is entitled to have his/her own witnesses as witnesses. However, it must be left to defence counsel to have these people to attend as witnesses if, in their assessment, the testimony of such witnesses is required in support of the application to exclude. There is no common sense principle applicable to applications to exclusion. In light of these observations and what has been said in the cases, one cannot see any justification for the procedure presently proposed."

Accused guilty of operating a vehicle when his blood alcohol level exceeded the prescribed limit; there was no violation of the accused's right to counsel. The officer had valid grounds to make the demand, having been advised that the accused was in an accident, that someone had said the accused was either high or intoxicated, having smelled a mild odour of alcohol on the accused and the accused having advised him that he only had three beer. Even if the accused's claim to amnesia for all the events around that time was believed, there was no medical evidence to suggest that he could not understand what the officer said to him at the hospital. Although his degree of alertness may have fluctuated, he displayed an understanding of the situation by showing appropriate concern for how much he had been drinking and asking questions which showed an understanding of his situation and what speaking to counsel would entail.","The defendant was charged under s. 253(b) of the Criminal Code with operating a motor vehicle when his blood alcohol level exceeded the prescribed limit. The Court found that the accused had sufficient understanding of the circumstances surrounding his offence and that his condition at the time of the incident was such that if the accused did not understand his right to counsel when informed of the blood demand, the onus has to be on him to prove that he asked for the right but it was denied or denied any opportunity to even ask for it. HELD: The accused was granted s. 10(v) Charter rights at time when he was capable of appreciating and understanding the rights and that the evidence showed that he appreciated and appreciated the rights.  1) The accused demonstrated an understanding of his situation through words and actions spanning a significant period of time.  2) His level of alertness may have been fluctuating but he nevertheless displayed an understanding through actions and words that span a significant time. 3) The Court discounted the weight of the accused's evidence considerably as it relates to his ability to comprehend events at the hospital.  4) There is no evidence of mechanical defects or failures in the defendant's vehicle. The medical technician at the RCMP Forensic Laboratory testified that he could smell liquor on the defendant’s breath and he thought the driver had hit the gravel on the shoulder of the road and then lost control of the vehicle. 5) There was no other evidence from medical personnel at the scene.  6) The medical evidence showed the defendant had only had three beer in the brief time he was in the hospital and then consumed three or four at a time. 7) The officer was aware of poor road conditions, weather conditions, or any unusual hazards that might contribute to an accident. The accused had been in the vehicle prior to the accident and he was aware that someone, two people had let him know that the defendant was either high or intoxicated. The trial judge made an error of law in his interpretation of the import of s. 9(b)."
b_2002skpc50.txt,"An application for a DNA warrant on the basis s.487.05 (the general warrant provision) of the Criminal Code with respect to DNA warrants does not refer to a form. The applicant suggested a tape recording would avoid the potential problems in bringing the application before a Provincial Court Judge. HELD: These concerns were raised in the January 21 decision concerning potential prejudicial or negative effects, which outweigh any requirement to swear the Information before a judge. An oath taken before a commissioner or notary is as valid as it is before a provincial court judge and avoids all the possible problems that relate to personal attendance. The intention is to make protocol work as flexible as possible, not impeding the police in their legitimate role, while making sure the court maintains its independence. Form 5.01 is specifically set out in the Code. Section 487.1 does not have a form, but even if it did and used the same words 'taken before me', that would elevate form over substance in a significant way.","The applicant Provincial Court Judge swore the Information to Obtain a search warrant. The applicant had applied under Provincial Court Rule 487.1 which required that the Information be sworn before the Provincial Court judge. The judge had refused on the grounds of personal attendance that it would result in prejudicial or negative effects of a personal attendance before the judge. Granting the application, that the officer was allowed to swear the Information on the basis that s.487.05 of the Code with respect to DNA warrants has reference to a form and Form 5.01 which is related to that section. The form indicates that it's an Information that's 'taken before me' or, in the alternative, a Commissioner of Oaths or Notary Public. The court was of the view, especially because s.485.1 doesn't have a form, but the form is incorporated into the section itself. It seems to me that the better practice is to put as much as you can in the Information as possible in order to avoid the potential prejudicial, negative, or embarrassing effect on the judge's personal attendance. This is not an application to have the Information sworn before a provincial court judge. It's an information that's been taken before me personally."
b_2006nssc221.txt,"Two years after the divorce, the wife applied to vary the spousal support provisions of the parties' Corollary Relief Judgment, which incorporated the terms of Minutes of Settlement. Pursuant to the Corollary Relief judgment, the husband was currently paying the wife $4,350 per month as spousal support. The wife now wished to increase the monthly support to a figure which would more closely resemble that assessed pursuant to the Spousal Support Advisory Guidelines, along with a substantial lump sum to compensate her for the underpayment of spousal support for the past two years. She also sought removal of a clause which provided for the discontinuation of support if the husband's professional income dropped below $80,000. The parties had been married for approximately thirty years and had one child, who was now independent. Application dismissed; the parties' current circumstances did not constitute a significant departure from the range of reasonable outcomes anticipated by the parties when the Agreement was signed. Both parties' income had increased since the divorce and the wife was not deeply in debt, as she alleged; there was no pressure exerted and no oppression during the course of negotiations; the Spousal Support Advisory Guidelines are not law and allow for exceptions to the general formulas provided, one such exception being the assumption of debt by one of the parties (the husband in this case); the spousal support figure recognized the husband's reasonable expectation of retirement and the fact that he was experiencing health problems; it was completely foreseeable at the time that the Agreement was signed that, given the wife's age, she might experience difficulty in finding employment in her narrow field; the subsequent increased value of one of the husband's properties was not a reason to vary the spousal support provisions of the Agreement.","The applicant applied to vary spousal support provisions of the Corollary Relief Judgment. Although the parties were married for over 29 years prior to their separation, the divorce settlement and the agreement incorporated the terms of the parties' settlement of the property division issue, the applicant had previously obtained a Bachelor of Arts degree in 1992 and her Masters in 1994. The respondent moved from the matrimonial home and was divorced in February 2003. The parties exchanged financial disclosure and provided the court with their affidavits and financial statements and both counsel were given the opportunity to cross-examine the opposing parties. Application allowed; the onus is on the applicant to satisfy the Court that the Agreement was not in substantial compliance with the objectives of the Divorce Act and that the Respondent did not take advantage of any vulnerability of the applicant. Although both parties were expecting retirement and were trying to avoid the necessity of future court proceedings, the Agreement provided for an approximately equal division of assets and debts. The rental income from the sale of a home and a bank account was double the amount paid by the respondent. The Respondent assumed responsibility for the mortgage and the student loans, a significant portion of which were borne by the applicant as part of her university education and a significant sum of money borrowed on line of credit, using her home as security and to purchase mutual funds as an investment. HELD: The application was dismissed with costs. 1)The Agreement was sound when signed and there have been changes in circumstances since it was signed. The applicant was left essentially debt free while the respondent was assuming debts in excess of $300,000. 2)There was no pressure exerted upon the applicant and no oppression during the negotiations or the signing of the Agreement and the rental income more than covered the mortgage payment. There was no evidence of coersion or anything of that nature.  3)There had been no change in the circumstances of either parties. There were no changes in the applicant's circumstances and the circumstances were not in any way different from that contemplated by the parties. The Agreement was based on a genuine mutual desire to finalize terms of their separation and as indicative of their substantive intentions. 4)There were no adverse consequences to the application in light of the fact that the parties had signed the agreement (although the applicant was still in debt) and the respondent had taken steps to ensure that her s. 15.2(4)(a) and (b)credit union benefits were paid in full. 5)The Court was unable to conclude that the agreement was in substantial"
b_2007nsca75.txt,"A single vehicle accident occurred when the driver swerved to avoid hitting a dog that ran onto the highway. An action was brought against both the driver and the farmer who owned the land on both sides of the highway on the basis that the farmer owned the dog in question and was negligent in failing to keep it off the highway. The farmer contended that although he owned a dog, it was tied to a tree at the time and his was not the dog that had run onto the highway. When his application for summary judgment was dismissed, the farmer appealed. Appeal dismissed. At this stage of the proceedings, it was not necessary for the plaintiffs to prove that the defendant's dog contributed to the accident or the truth of the statements and evidence attached to the affidavit. It was only necessary to show that the facts were contested, there was some evidence to support their version of events and, if their evidence was accepted by the trier of fact, their action had some merit. Although the judge appeared to blur the two parts of the test on a summary judgment application, the Court found that the farmer failed to meet the first part of the test; namely, that there was no genuine issue of fact for trial as there was conflicting evidence as to the identity of the dog involved.","The defendant was found guilty of second degree murder and three passengers were killed when his car veered off the road and struck a power pole. The defendant was charged with second degree manslaughter. The evidence presented by the plaintiff on summary judgment application was that he was not the owner of the dog that ran onto the highway and therefore the claim against him should be dismissed summarily. The chambers judge dismissed the application for summary judgment on the grounds that the affidavit was not properly filed. The issues on appeal were whether the chambers judge erred in his application, whether the judge properly applied the test for summarily dismissing the application, if the issues were genuine issues of fact requiring trial, and if so, if there was a genuine issue of fact."
b_2010nssc125.txt,"The plaintiff bus driver was in a serious bus/motor vehicle accident that killed two people. He was charged with dangerous driving. His employer offered the services of its lawyer, who eventually transferred the file to the defendant who represented him at trial. At trial, the Crown introduced a video of a purported accident re-enactment. The defendant chose not to object to its admission, saying he felt it was a perfect example of the Crown's 'doomed to failure' theory. As for the problems (it was recorded in the daytime, while the accident happened at daybreak; it assumed the vehicle that was struck was stopped, although there was no proof it was; and it didn't show all of the vehicles at the original scene), he felt these could be addressed by cross-examination. The plaintiff was convicted. He retained a different lawyer to represent him on appeal, and won. Eventually, the charges were dropped. The lawyer's competence was not raised as an issue on appeal. In their decision, the Court of Appeal criticized him for not objecting to the admission of the video and other evidence. They found this evidence was inadmissible, highly prejudicial and should never have been put to the jury. The plaintiff sued in negligence and breach of contract. The parties introduced conflicting opinions from criminal law experts to support their respective positions. Action dismissed. The standard of care is that of a reasonably competent lawyer. Lawyers make strategic decisions and exercise judgment, but are not responsible to ensure a certain result. Sometimes the decisions are wrong: it is only negligence if it was outside the realm of acceptable possibilities in the circumstances of the case. The appeal panel had the benefit of hindsight - it is improper to judge the plaintiff's actions in light of their conclusions. While the experts were not helpful in establishing what a reasonably competent lawyer (as opposed to a specialist in the field) would do, their differing opinions illustrate how the admissibility of evidence can be the subject of much debate.","The plaintiff's employer suspended him from work without pay following the laying of criminal charges. They offered, however at their expense, the use of their legal counsel to defend the plaintiff. The plaintiff objected to the admission of the video re-enactment and the still photographs, as well as the opinions given by the RCMP Traffic Analyst regarding the amount of time that someone would have had to see the Chrysler and stop their vehicle. At trial, the plaintiff argued that the Crown's theory of the accident was fatally flawed and that his expert's opinion should not have been introduced by the Crown. He also argued that there was a conflict of interest between the plaintiff and his employers. Dismissing the action for negligence and breach of contract, that the video was a very good example of how the facts presented to the jury could be explained. It was also a very timely appeal, which allowed the Court to review the expert's report and find that, in some respects, the video's admission should have been made sooner rather than later."
b_2010skqb343.txt,"A class action was certificated at Queen's Bench on the basis of breaches of The Consumer Protection Act and a breach of duty of care. The defendants were granted leave from the Court of Appeal to appeal the portion of the certification order dealing with alleged breaches of The Consumer Protection Act only. The certification on the basis of duty of care was upheld. As a result, a situation existed where the class action process could continue on only part of the claim until the appeal of consumer protection act issues was heard. HELD: Rule 15 of The Court of Appeal Rules is engaged and the entire certification judgment is stayed pending the disposition of the appeal. If the plaintiffs wish to apply to lift the stay they must do so to a judge of the Court of Appeal.","The defendants sought leave to appeal the certification order of the Consumer Protection Act (CPA) pursuant to s. 39(3)(a) of the Class Actions Act. They applied to leave the matter to proceed concurrently with the appeal on the CPA cause of action.

The matter was pending before the Court of Appeal and it was not known whether the class action would proceed on the basis of one cause of actions or two. The plaintiffs sought to stay the action pending the appeal of the Cpa certification order on the ground that there was an appeal pending on only one aspect of the order. HELD: 1)Leave was granted to appeal. Steps can now be taken to move this action forward concurrently with this appeal. 2)The situation that now exists is that the class actions will definitely advance, although until after the appeal concerning the CAA cause of Action is finally determined, it is not known if the class offense will proceed on a basis of a one causeOf Action or two group. Steps were taken to proceed. A decision on the leave application was rendered on September 16, 2010 at which time the parties were given the opportunity to discuss the next step. A number of grounds of appeal were advanced including that relating to the breach of duty of care cause. 3)The plaintiffs were granted leave on the portion of the certification ordered that pertained to the cause for action relating to alleged breaches of the consumer protection act, S.S. 1996, c. C-30.1 (the CPA) were dismissed.

b_2011skpc30.txt,"The accused was charged with impaired care and control of a motor vehicle and care and control of a motor vehicle while his blood alcohol level exceeded .08. The accused was found in the driver's side of a vehicle with his legs near the pedals. His body was slumped over into the passenger side. The vehicle had collided with a power pole and sustained significant damage. The engine was running when the police arrived. There was no one else in the vehicle. The accused was transported to hospital where the doctor suspected he had a brain bleed and recommended the police obtain a blood warrant. The officer who swore the Information to Obtain the warrant indicated that the interior of the vehicle smelled strongly of beverage alcohol and the accused smelled of beverage alcohol. The Justice of the Peace did not sign the Information to Obtain. The issues before the Court were whether there had been a breach of the accused's s. 8 right to be free from unreasonable search and seizure and whether the Crown had proven beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused was in care and control of the motor vehicle. HELD: The blood warrant was found to be invalid, meaning that the blood samples were obtained as part of a warrantless search in breach of s. 8. The Information to Obtain the blood warrant did not depose that the officer believed the accused was the driver of the vehicle which had crashed into the power pole or that the accused was in care and control of the motor vehicle. The officer should have included information about the accused's position in the vehicle and that the accused was unconscious. Without this information, the Information to Obtain did not contain reasonable grounds to believe that the accused had committed an offence under s. 253 of the Criminal Code. However, the blood sample evidence was admitted after a s. 24(2) analysis. The Court held that the officer was acting in good faith and that he honestly held the belief that the accused was drinking and driving when he swore the Information to Obtain. The impact on the accused was technical in nature and did not seriously undermine the accused's rights. The Court held that the truth seeking function of the trial process would be better served by admission of the Certificate of Analysis. The Court found that the accused was in care and control of the motor vehicle at the time of the collision. There was no evidence that anyone else was in the vehicle and the position of the accused when discovered suggested he had been driving the vehicle. The accused was found guilty of driving while his blood alcohol level exceeded .08. The Court held that his blood alcohol level was between 236 mgs% and 283 mgs%.","The accused was charged with two counts being driving over.08 contrary to s. 253 of the Criminal Code and one count being impaired by alcohol. The accused was granted leave to cross-examine on the information to obtain blood samples as a condition of being free from unreasonable search and seizure. The issues before the court were whether the Information to Obtain Blood samples contained sufficient grounds to warrant a search warrant, whether the information contained in the information was a reasonable grounds for the belief that the accused had committed an offence under s.253, and whether the Certificate of Analyst and the report were evidence of probative value. HELD: 1) The information was not sufficient to establish on a balance of probabilities that the warrant to seize the accused's blood would be invalid. 2) The officer did not depose that the driver of the vehicle (who was not wearing a seat belt) was unconscious when he was extracted from the vehicle and the rest of his body was slumped across the passenger's seat. The Certificate of Analysis was not required to be admitted into evidence. The officer omitted a crucial ground for his belief which was not a reasonable ground for an allegation of an offence. 3) Blood samples were to be taken from the accused pursuant to a warrant. The information must be assessed against the 'totality' test, looking to the whole information and excising any misleading parts. 4) The accused's s. 8 rights were breached. 5) The oath sworn by the officer testifying at the swearing hearing was not fatal to the warrant as it did not include the source of his belief in the driver's belief that he was the driver.

b_2016skqb297.txt,"HELD: The court found that both parties were significantly involved in the day-to-day parenting of the children such that a conclusion that one parent or the other was the primary caregiver could not be made. The court also found that the respondent responded positively and appropriately to the petitioner’s concerns regarding masturbation and pornography. The respondent indicated that he had not watched pornography since December 2014 and that software on his cell phone and computer provide assurances that he had not watched pornography to the petitioner. The petitioner did not dispute that evidence. The court could not reasonably give weight to the petitioner’s opinion evidence regarding the respondent’s alleged addictions. The court listed numerous problems with the petitioner’s evidence of addiction. The court was unable to conclude that there was a risk of harm to the children caused by the respondent. With respect to the petitioner’s allegation of the respondent’s anger management problem, most of the incidents were dated. The respondent had since taken anger management counselling, accepted that he suffers from ADD, and began taking medication for ADD. The court held that it was in the best interests of the children to continue to reside in the family home and that it would not be in their best interests for one parent to be classified as or be the primary parent. It was also in the children’s best interests that their parenting be shared on an equal basis. A nesting arrangement was found to be in the best interests of the children. The court ordered that the parties would have joint custody of the children and each party had exclusive possession of the family home when they were enjoying their assigned periods of parenting. The parents would alternate weeks living in the family home with the children.","HELD: The application was dismissed. The court found with respect to the issues that were not addressed that: 1) the respondent’s anger management problems made it impossible for the children to stay in the home; 2) the petitioner’d given evidence that the respondent had been significantly involved in his children’ lives, well beyond the level of most fathers who have normal work commitments; and 3) the evidence did not support the conclusion that increased contact was in the best interests of the children because of the petitioner and her allegations of sexual abuse of the respondent father. It was unnecessary for the petitioner to rely on the opinion evidence of a psychologist or psychiatrist as she had no expertise in the area; and 4) all of the allegations were based on speculation, conjecture, suspicion or unreliable testimony and evidence, which the court could not reasonably attribute to the respondent. All of these factors weighed against the petitioner."

When his federal government management position was declared redundant, the applicant received a retiring allowance of $75,646 in May 1997. The respondent opposed the application on the basis there had been no change in circumstances since the judgment was granted; she had no other income than the support payments and child tax credit; alternatively, there were special provisions in the parties' separation agreement which would permit the court to award an amount that differs from the amount prescribed by the Guidelines.HELD: 1)The judgment the applicant sought to vary was made after the coming into force of the Guidelines. It did not however include a determination of child support made in accordance with the Guidelines. There was no change in the childrens' or mother's circumstances. The applicant was unemployed but was still benefiting from his retiring allowance at the time of the order which he no longer enjoyed.

The provision for child support in a specified amount greater than that provided in the Guidelines was not a 'special provision' as contemplated by s17(6.2) of the Divorce Act given the change in circumstances of the applicant whose annual income had dropped from $55,500 to $24,000 a year.  3)No order was made as to costs.","FIAT.

The father was ordered to pay child support of $405 per month but had made only one voluntary payment of $100. He agreed to abandon his appeal of the order for sale of the matrimonial home. He had been unable to obtain financing to buy out her share. The father, unrepresented by counsel, sought to have selected portions of 14 hours of taped telephone conversations with the children and wife admitted into evidence. He insisted the tapes were of central importance to his case; that they discredited the conclusions of the custody and access report and demonstrated abuse was occurring in the mother's home. HELD: 1)Sole custody was awarded to the mother. The father was to have access Friday from 5:00 p.m. until Tuesday at 9:00 every second weekend. 2)The tapes were admitted in their totality, unedited. The two lines of cases respecting the admission of audiotapes in a custody hearing were reviewed. The tapes had the opposite effect to the father's intent. The father 'alternatively interrogated the children about their mother; prompted them to make unfavourable comments about her; magnified every incident of childish squabbling into a crisis; magnified the children's distress over the marital breakdown, encouraged the children to run to his home at every opportunity; and generally undermined the mother's parental authority at every available turn.' The petitioner's depression had been ascribed to environmental stresses rather than innate. The father acknowledged that his drinking had lessened but not discontinued as he suggested in the custody and access report. 3)The property was to be sold. The father was responsible for mortgage payments from July 1998 until the date of sale as he had stopped making mortgage payments after the previous order while continuing to reside in the home. A corresponding adjustment in the net sale proceeds was to be made in the wife's favour. Child maintenance was to be satisfied from the father's share of the sale proceeds. 4)The mother's employment pension was to be divided equally and one half rolled into an RRSP designated by the father. RRSP's were to be divided equally. Furniture, furnishings and personal effects in their possession would be retained by each party. Hunting clothes or supplies and one half of the family photographs were to be returned to the father. The loan from the respondent's mother was statute-barred. No repayments had been made in 10 years. The debt for the half ton acquired after separation was the father's sole responsibility. 5)The prior order of $405 for child support remained in effect. The father made no income disclosure until trial and evidence of his 1991 income was unsatisfactory. Rental income was deemed to his 1998 income. No order was made for day care costs due to inadequate proof. The parties could seek a review if more comprehensive evidence were produced. 6)Judgment for divorce would be made final on the expiration of 31 days.","Although custody was the most conspicuous issue in the proceeding, there were also questions of child support and division of matrimonial property that required resolution before the parties could put an end to their acrimonious marital breakdown. The father was unrepresented at trial. HELD: The tapes were admitted to their entirety and went in unedited. 1) Although custody was of central importance to the case, there are also questions regarding child support, division of the property and the abuse that was occurring in the mother's home. The tapes have the opposite effect. They speak volumes about the father's character and motivations while shedding little light on the mother. They are primarily conversations between the father and the children, either individually or all together. There is really very little involving the mother directly. The parties have been struggling since early on in their relationship. There has been aprotracted pattern of dysfunctional, conflictual communication and the mother is mentally ill and abusive to the children. 2) Although the father was without legal counsel, he was insistent that the children should have access to all available evidence when considering the children's best interests, notwithstanding the court's'repugnance' with respect to such conduct as voiced in the Reddick case. 3) After listening to the tapes in their entirety, the court was of the view they have the contrary effect. The mother's voice is heard throughout. It is clear that the father is seeking out disagreement, no matter how trivial, and will try to blow things out of proportion or attempt to turn them to his own advantage. The court was also of the opinion that the assessor never obtained an honest opinion from the children and the Court should not avoid the opportunity to hear the children in their own words."

This arrangement was not to exceed one year unless agreed to by the mother.

The mother had been unable to obtain a translator in Nova Scotia and had spent considerable time trying to contact the father. The father had recently moved away from Nunavut and had difficulty obtaining a translator. The child had been in the mother's home all the time and was doing well in school. An order issued in November 1999 confirming the mother was not giving up her parental rights, ordered that the child be sent to Nova Scotia to live with his father and that an interim agreement be agreed to for a period of time to allow for the adoption of a new child. Counsel for the father called a number of witnesses and testified to some of the difficulties the mother had had in finding a permanent place to live.

The court accepted the evidence of the accused where there was a discrepancy between the testimony of the officer and the accused. The mental element of the offence of refusal consists of intentional non-compliance. The officer in his conversation with another officer said he could not understand why he was not getting a proper sample. There was a reasonable doubt that the officer did understand why he was not getting a proper sample and could not provide the accused with adequate instructions.,The accused was charged with failing to comply with a demand to provide a sample of his breath by a peace officer pursuant to s. 254(2)(a) of the Criminal Code to enable proper analysis of my breath to be made by means of an approved screening device. The accused argued that the 'ride along' had no duties and was simply with the accused. He chose not to disclose in his disclosure information the name of theride along nor even that there was a ride along. HELD: The accused was found guilty. 1)The accused's testimony was preferred over that of the officer. 2)The officer's lack of cander in giving his testimony raised doubts in the mind as to his forthrightness in respect to other important details in this matter.  3)The evidence of the accused who argued that he was not intentionally trying to avoid providing an adequate sample was found to be in contradiction to the officer's evidence. The officer gave forthright manner and accepted it without reservation. 4)The mental element of the offence of refusal created by s.254(5) consists of intentional non-compliance.

Appeal dismissed; the judge's reasons disclosed that he applied the reasonable doubt standard to the evidence as a whole; although the reasons for judgment were very brief and open to criticism, they did not preclude meaningful appellate review. The test for legal error in a judge alone case is not the same as would apply to a judge's charge to a jury on the issue of reasonable doubt. It was not an error for the judge to assess the credibility of the appellant in relation to that of the complainant as long as he went on to take the next step, as he did in his 'short-hand reference' to the evidence.","A cocaine fuelled encounter between the appellant and the woman with whom he was living resulted in his conviction for assault and sexual assault.

c_2005nsca147.txt,"The parties separated shortly after relocating from the United States to Nova Scotia. As part of the divorce, the Supreme Court ordered a division of assets. Both parties appealed the asset division; in the process, both parties sought to introduce fresh evidence.

Appeal and cross-appeal dismissed with the exception that the wife is to be given immediate access to her personal belongings; both applications to introduce fresh evidence dismissed; on the sparse record before him, the trial judge did not err in his division of assets and did not offer the husband unwarranted assistance as a self- represented litigant. Faced with two competing claims as to the amount of the proceeds of sale, if any, of one of the parties' properties, the trial judge committed no error in finding the amount owed to be half-way between the two claims and then setting it off against the amount owed to the other party.","The parties were married for four years and had two children. The wife sought a more favourable division of assets and an entitlement to health insurance. The husband sought to have the matrimonial home divided into two equal parts: a camp property and an adjoining 100 acre lot. The parties separated in 2001. The primary contest related to the disposition of the 'camp property' and its value. The trial judge found that the value of the assets retained by the wife exceeded those retained by husband; this resulted in credit to the husband for the home purchase and the sale of the adjacent property. The judge found no palpable or overriding error in this regard. The evidence, if available, should have been rendered at trial. There was no basis for the Court to exercise de novo trial functions for the consideration of evidence which was available for the trial."
c_2005nsca7.txt,"The defendant obtained a tender to bank, blend and load coal at the plaintiff's coal preparation plant. In performing the contract, the defendant experienced equipment problems resulting in the plaintiff having to rent other equipment. The plaintiff terminated the contract without any prior warning or notice to the defendant and brought an action for reimbursement of monies advanced under the contract and expenses incurred for the equipment rentals. The defendant counter-claimed for damages arising out of the termination of the contract, for services performed under the contract and for extras which had not been paid. The court found that the plaintiff was entitled to reimbursement for overpayments and equipment rentals and that the defendant was entitled to fair and reasonable compensation for extras for which the court awarded the sum of $10,000. Both parties were found to be in breach of the contract, the plaintiff's breach occurring because the volumes of coal supplied did not approximate the tonnages represented in the contractual documents. The clause excluding liability for errors in the forecast did not excuse the plaintiff because the actual volumes were not even approximate to the forecasted tonnages and the rates bid by the defendant were directly related to the anticipated tonnages. Absent evidence as to how the plaintiff arrived at the information used in the calculation of the forecasted tonnages, no negligent misrepresentation could be found, as there was no evidence that the information was negligently obtained. Both parties appealed. Appeal and cross-appeal dismissed; the trial judge's finding that the defendant had fundamentally breached its contractual obligations which entitled the plaintiff to terminate the contract without notice should not be disturbed; thus, the trial judge did not err in awarding the plaintiff damages for the defendant's breach of contract. The defendant did not establish that the plaintiff had been negligent in making the tonnage estimates and thus, the judge did not err in dismissing the defendant's claim for negligent misrepresentation. Although the trial judge found that the plaintiff had also committed a fundamental breach of the contract (in failing to provide the approximate tonnages referred to in the contract), the defendant had not chosen to terminate the contract and the plaintiff's breach did not undermine its right to terminate the contract as a result of the defendant's breach.","The plaintiff brought an action for breach of contract and negligent misstatement. It claimed that the defendant had negligently estimated the quantities of coal to be handled under the contract and, as a result, induced the plaintiff to enter a contract from which it was unable to derive anticipated profits and operating losses. The defendant also alleged various breaches of contract including wrongful termination. The plaintiff appealed. Appeal dismissed; the plaintiff's claim for damages for negligent misrepresentation was dismissed; defendant's appeal dismissed. Although the plaintiff failed to provide the approximate tonnages sought in the contract, plaintiff's evidence showed that the plaintiff was not negligent in failing to perform the contract; plaintiff's breach was not proven; defendant was not liable to the plaintiff for negligent misstatements; plaintiff awarded $10,000 for added work; defendant awarded nothing; plaintiff did not suffer any loss as result of defendant's termination of the contract."

The defendant applied to strike the pleadings, for summary judgement and for costs and disbursements.

In many other applications where the results bring finality the court has utilized Tariff A. The solicitor and client fees to the date of the hearing were approximately $2,000,000. The sale price of the property which was approximately $ 2,500,000 was not, in the court's view, the appropriate amount involved. The hearing was less than 2 hours in duration and there were a number of steps taken prior to the application including filing a list of documents, exchange of documents and apparently two days of discovery. The plaintiff made an offer of settlement in the amount of $5,000 inclusive of costs, which take to be an attempt to have the action simply go away due to the heavy costs of litigation. However, it was also difficult and in fact impossible for the plaintiff to really get a handle on what amount of loss of profits was being pursued or to what extent the defendants were monetarily at risk.

At no time was she advised in any detail what was expected of her and that a failure to meet a particular standard could result in the termination of her employment. It would appear that the employer attributed the misfiling of a paper in an income tax return to the plaintiff and he decided to summarily dismiss her. In the circumstance, it can not be said that it is more probable than not that the plaintiff was guilty of serious misconduct or a breach of a fundamental nature respecting office policies, policies that may not have been made known to her, that there was just cause for her dismissal. Therefore the defendant was dismissed without just cause.  2) The contract of employment was a term contract extending from May to August 31, 2004. The plaintiff was dismissed on July 12. But for her dismissal, she would have worked for the rest of July and for the month of August or 36 days. 3) In this case the plaintiff made reasonable effort to seek and maintain employment.

She claimed that the previous receptionist that had trained her advised her to ignore the documents in question.

The plaintiff claims general and aggravated damages of $5,000 for these injuries. Both the plaintiff and the defendant were elected to their positions. The plaintiff is a councillor. The defendant determined that the plaintiff was in a conflict of interest and asked the plaintiff to remove himself from the Chambers pursuant to s. 45(1) of The Rural Municipality Act. There was a further determination by the defendant that the plaintiff had misrepresented his situation to the council. The defendant then prepared a letter to the plaintiff in which she advised that until such time as he apologized to council and remedied the 'deficiencies' that created the conflict of interest he would not be recognized by the chair to speak or to move motions. HELD: The claim is dismissed. 1) Even if the defendant's decision did infringe on the plaintiff's Charter right to expression to some limited extent and could not be upheld pursuant to the section of The Rural Municipality Act (the Court made no conclusions as to which of the competing legal opinions is right) the Court was not prepared to award damages to the plaintiff pursuant to s. 24(1) of the Charter. While the plaintiff's decision might have been politically advantageous to her and her supporters in council, it was not without some justification because the plaintiff was in breach of the Building Bylaw, there could be a perceived conflict of interest, and the Reeve did have some evidence before her that the plaintiff had misrepresented his situation to council. The Court was not prepared to award damages to the plaintiff so he could gain a personal benefit from a limitation which only had a small effect on his right to represent his constituents. The dispute between the parties is a political one. A court should be reluctant to get involved. 2) With regard to the tort of misfeance in public office, even if the defendant acted without lawful authority in imposing the sanctions in order to be actionable, the defendant had to be aware that her conduct was unlawful. This requirement has not been met. The defendant was acting on legal advice from legal counsel to the municipality. There is no evidence, nor even the suggestion, that legal counsel did not act in good faith in providing advice to the defendant. As a result, the plaintiff has failed to establish that the defendant acted with knowledge she had no legal authority to do what she did in imposing sanctions on the plaintiff. 3) With respect to the tort of negligence, the Court found that because the defendant was acting on the advice of legal counsel when imposing the sanctions upon the plaintiff, she has not breached the standard of care. Her actions were not negligent.","The plaintiff sought general and aggravated damages for injuries suffered as a result of her actions as Reeve of the Rural Municipality of Sherwood. The R.M. councillor alleged the defendant had injured his reputation and feelings, and caused him humiliation, distress and distress through her actions. She alleged the damages should be awarded to the plaintiff pursuant to s. 24(1) of the Charter. HELD: The application was dismissed. The court found that because the defendant was acting in her personal capacity and did not have a pecuniary interest in imposing sanctions upon the plaintiff, the court was not prepared to award damages to her. The plaintiff did have another remedy open to him which he could have taken immediately. It could have applied to the court for judicial review."
c_2006skqb335.txt,"FIAT: The former vice-president of the Saskatchewan Labour Relations Board commenced an action for damages alleging wrongful conduct by the Government of Saskatchewan. He alleges his term was not renewed through the influence of certain unions with the Department of Labour. He participated in an interview where he suggested that the Department of Labour required members of the Board to read the newsletter of the Saskatchewan Federation of Labour. When Wal-Mart became aware of these circumstances, it filed this application. Wal-Mart alleges the Board is biased or, at the very least, there is justification for a reasonable apprehension of bias against Wal- Mart. It argues that the only way to rectify the situation is to prohibit the Board from holding hearings involving Wal-Mart. The Union applies pursuant to Rule 319 of the Queen's Bench Rules to strike almost all the material filed by Wal-Mart. HELD: The application of Wal-Mart is dismissed. The Union will have taxable costs, but only of the application by Wal-Mart and the Union's application to strike the material filed.  1) The affidavit filed by Wal-Mart swears that the affiant has 'personal knowledge of the facts and matters herein deposed to' and then he goes on to swear that various exhibits are attached to his affidavit. This achieves nothing more than compel the court to examine the exhibits to determine their admissibility. The affiant does nothing more than provide copies of 27 documents. 2) There is no necessity for the admission of the documents. There is no basis upon which to conclude that it is necessary to accept the proffered documents as evidence.  3) It is alleged there was interference with the Board and that it was required to read publications which were highly disparaging of Wal-Mart. Yet there is absolutely no evidence before the court to prove the allegations. Many newsletters contain negative comments about Wal-Mart. However, there is no admissible evidence to prove that these newsletters were provided to the Board, or that any member actually read them. Mr. Matkowski has not come forward to assert his allegations under oath. Without such evidence, it is impossible to conclude that bias exists within the Saskatchewan Labour Relations Board or that there is justification for a reasonable apprehension of bias. To conclude otherwise, this court would be acting on pure conjecture or fantasy. That is not good enough.","FIAT. Wal-Mart brought three applications. The first motion was brought by the applicant Wal-mart Canada Corp. which sought an order pursuant to Queen's Bench Rule 664 and Rule 673 prohibiting the Saskatchewan Labour Relations Board as presently constituted from hearing and/or making any orders involving Wal-Marts. The second motion by the union applied for an order striking and removing virtually all of the material filed in support of the application by Wal- Mart. In the other motion the Union applied for a order striking the transcript of a radio broadcast and the portions of a transcript of the debate in the Saskatchewan Legislative Assembly. The latter application was denied by WalMart. HELD: The relief sought by the Union was granted and the application brought by Wal Mart was dismissed. 1) There is no necessity for their admission. Mr. Matkowski is around and about. He must be available to swear an affidavit. The critical allegations originate with him. Absent any explanation for his absence, there is no basis upon which to conclude that it is necessary to accept the proferred documents as evidence. At no time have the allegations been tested for accuracy and truthfulness. In reality, contradictions are found within the very documents. 2) Wal Mart's position that the actions of the Unions, the interference by the Government and the presence of certain publications demonstrate that the Saskatchewan LRB is biased or, at the very least, there are justification for a reasonable apprehension of bias against it. 3) The affidavits filed by the unions are admissible. They are attached to an affidavit of one Ryan Kraikas who attests that he prepared the transcript. That does nothing more than prove he performed that task. It says nothing about the accuracy, truth or reliability of what is contained in the transcript or of the statements of claim in Walter Matkowski v.

Application to amend the notice of appeal allowed; the amendment is reasonably necessary for the presentation of the appeal and will not occasion prejudice to the respondent. The respondent's opposition to the application fundamentally misconceived the role of a chambers judge who is asked to grant leave to amend a notice of appeal.

Although both she and her husband had good incomes, it would still take several more years to discharge the loans without prejudicing her family's reasonably frugal lifestyle. Relief granted; to require the bankrupt to discharge the loans in a reasonable manner would require an additional 10 or more years on top of the 13 years with which she had already been burdened, and to expect her to pay in a shorter period would cause her continuing financial difficulties.

Although she had good income, it would still take several years to discharge the loans without prejudicing the reasonable frugal lifestyle she and her family enjoy.

c_2012nspc18.txt,"The accused was charged with numerous weapons-related offences, including possession and trafficking. The police had intercepted numerous ambiguous calls between the accused and others and had interpreted the coded language used as involving discussions about firearms. The defence had been unsuccessful in arguing that the inferences drawn were mere hunches and the conversations could not support a reasonable inference that the subjects under discussion were firearms. A search at his parents' residence had resulted in the seizure of several firearms but none were found in the accused's actual possession. One of the issues was whether the accused had constructive or joint possession of the firearms seized from his parents. Accused found guilty on all the weapons' possession charges and some of the trafficking charges, but not guilty of careless storage of a firearm. It was clear that the accused had much more than a passive or quiescent knowledge of the guns seized from his parents' home and there were a number of indicators that he had a measure of control over them, such as his telling his father on occasion to get rid of them, his being notified immediately when one of the firearms went missing, the way he pressed his parents to explain how that could happen and his ability on other occasions to tell his father where in the home a particular firearm was located. However, despite his knowledge of the location of some of the firearms at certain times, the court was unable to find that the accused had stored the firearms in the manner they were found when the search warrant was executed. The evidence also established that he was stashing guns at locations other than his residence and he possessed those guns for the purpose of transferring them to others. The only reasonable inference to be drawn from the intercepts was that the speakers were talking about guns and the communications revealed the commercial nature of the accused's activities. Given that the accused had asserted a privacy interest with respect to an application to exclude the evidence arising from the police search of the cell phone seized from him, he could not now deny that the phone was his.","The accused’s stepmother had called the accused prior to the search of their home and the accused was charged with possession of a prohibited firearm. The evidence at trial had revealed that the accused had constructive and/or joint possession of the firearms at the home with the accused. At issue was the validity of the Crown”s s. 8 Charter application and whether the accused could assert a privacy interest in order to obtain protection of s.8 of the Charter and then, when that application went badly and the evidence is admitted, turn around and claim to be a stranger to the item in which the privacy interest resided. HELD: The accused was found guilty.  1) The evidence led by the Crown had established that the phone with the number 229-4400 was the accused“s. 8”. The intercepts were also of significant importance to the firearms trafficking charges. 2) The accused” s. 9 Charter application was not dispensed with. The accused did not have a Firearms Acquisition Certificate or any other kind of license for possessing firearms nor did he have a valid registration certificate for the firearms.  3) There was nothing to suggest that the guns and ammunition introduced as evidence in this trial were not the ones located in the accuseds and Lewis” home. 4) The Crown had not resorted to evidence of reasonable expectation of privacy in the Samsung cell phone in determining that it was his. 5) The Court was unable to accept that the guilty pleas of the accused were relevant to the issue of Kyle”S.8” and that they and the two magazines had been correctly identified and classified in the charges against the accused and the co-accused. 6) The admissibility of the intercepts was not addressed in the R. v. Cater decision. 7) The entire exhibit was deposed."

The applicant’s proposed grounds of appeal were not questions of law but of fact.,"The defendant company appealed the Small Claims trial decision, which was found to be unreasonable and unsupported by the evidence and that the trial judge had improperly interfered with one of the defendant's witnesses. HELD: Leave to appeal was denied. 1)Leave to appeal should not be granted to the defendant company.  2)The essential facts are relatively straightforward. The contract was signed on May 29, 2014. The next evening, the defendant telephoned the plaintiff and asked if he was prepared to do only portion of the seeding and to'seed along side us'. The trial judge refused to allow the plaintiff to refer to exhibit P-5 because it was not a matter raised or dealt with by the appeal judge. It does not relate to an error in the decision. 3)The trial judge did nothing improper in this regard.

As a person who was given a grant in probate, he is obligated to carry out the directions contained in the Will.

The affidavit evidence satisfies the Court that this is something that Evan will not do.  3) The court ordered the respondent to be removed as a executor."
d_1990canlii4118.txt,"In a contract of employment, which involved an agreement changing the plaintiff from 'expatriate' to 'local' status, a termination clause providing that the agreement could be terminated upon 3 months' notice was held to be inadequate language to abrogate the implied term of reasonable notice. The plaintiff had correctly interpreted the clause as relating to the termination of the agreement, not of his employment. The agreement provided that it was governed by the laws of the province of Alberta. The plaintiff had been employed by the defendant for 12 years and was awarded compensation in an amount equivalent to 18 months notice less the three months pay he already received and any income from his new employment over the balance of the 15 months. He was also awarded the loss resulting from the difference in vacation and loss of an auto allowance for the 15 months. For emotional trauma, which lasted only briefly, he received $500.","This was an action for wrongful dismissal. The plaintiff was assigned to work for the defendant company as an expatriate for four years. He received a salary of $60,000. In return, the defendant offered him a position in the private sector, which he refused, saying he had a number of things to settle up with. The defendant refused to give him three months notice of termination. He went on to become a senior surveyor for several years, until he became redundant and then transferred to Halifax. Halifax was a good location for the plaintiff, but his employment there was limited to five months notice. He applied to the Federal Civil Service for a position as regional manager in Nova Scotia, but was denied. He claimed the dismissal letter was never sent to him, and that he had no right to ask for it. Dismissing the action for dismissal without reasonable notice, that the defendant had not expressly and clearly stated that the contract would terminate on 30 days notice. This was not sufficient to abrogate the doctrine of law that reasonable notice must be given."

He had successively served three Crown Corporations over a period of ten years. On appeal held the award of damages was not inordinately high. The court however reduced the damages by $16,500 as it disagreed with the trial judge's determination regarding mitigation of damages. Appeal allowed to the extent of reducing the damages from $165,000 to $148,500.","This was an appeal from an assessment of damages in a wrongful dismissal action brought against Saskatchewan Transportation Company (STC). The plaintiff was the former president and chief executive officer of the provincial Crown corporation. STC awarded damages against the corporation in the amount of $165,000. For the most part we can find no tenable basis for concluding that the award of damages was inordinately high. The trial judge assessed the damages on the general principles, that the object of these awards is to compensate for the loss of income sustained in consequence of the wrongful dismissal; second, that their measure is prima facie the amount that would have been earned had the employment continued subject to deduction of such amounts as were either earned or should have beenearned in light of the duty upon persons suffering losses to keep them to minimum; and third, that all of the plaintiff's Crown corporation service had been for one year rather than three, or two instead of five or even ten. The plaintiff resisted the attribution on pragmatic grounds arguing that the company had not paid any salary, that there was no guarantee the company was going to earn profit, that it needed working capital, and that it was mere fledging."

d_1995canlii4259.txt,"This was an appeal from a Supreme Court decision on an interpleader application by the respondent Shubenacadie Band to determine which of several parties was entitled to be paid a sum of money owed by the Band to the respondent Francis, an Indian residing on the Eskasoni Reserve in Cape Breton, for the construction of residential homes on the Shubenacadie Reserve. Francis had made a number of assignments of book debts, some general and some specific, to the various claimants. The trial judge concluded that he was bound by s.89(1) of the Indian Act, which holds that the real and personal property of an Indian or a band situated on a reserve is not subject to charge, pledge, mortgage, attachment, levy, seizure, distress or execution in favour of or at the instance of any person other than an Indian or a band. He concluded that the money owed Francis by the Shubenacadie band was the property of an Indian on a reserve, and that assignment of book debts, both general and specific, were included within the meaning of s.89(1). He found that the respondent Eskasoni Band was the only Indian entity among the several claimants and ordered the money paid to them. The appellants appealed. Allowing the appeal on the issue of the Indian Act, that s.89(1) does not prevent an Indian from assigning book debts of his construction business to secure business loans. When Indians are in business they hold and deal with their business property in the commercial mainstream on terms no different than those applicable to all Canadians. Nevertheless, the Eskasoni Band is still entitled to the money owed to Francis by reason of having obtained the first general assignment of book debts from him and having registered it prior to Francis making further assignments. The registration of a general assignment of book debts is constructive notice of the assignment to subsequent assignees falling within the provisions of s.3 of the Assignment of Book Debts Act.","This was an appeal from a decision in an interpleader application by the Band Council to determine which of several parties was entitled to be paid a sum of money owing by the respondent under a construction contract entered into with the respondent. The respondent made a number of assignments of book debts, some general and some specified to the various claimants. The agreed upon terms of the contract for the construction of residential homes were as follows: 1)The respondent was an Indian Band member but resided on the Eskasoni Reserve in Cape Breton. He had made a series of assignments under the respondent's direction. 2)Each assignment was subject to registration under the Annex Act. Section 89(1) of the Act provides that general assignments of books by persons engaged in trade or business are void against creditors and other purchasers as defined in the Act. 3)The act does not expressly or impliedly confer any greater right upon an assignee of a chose in action that he had before. All it does is to make general assignment of property in the commercial mainstream on terms no different than those applicable to all other Canadians. By registration the plaintiff has preserved whatever rights it acquired by virtue of the assignment and no more In other words its rights are to be determined exactly as if the Act had never been passed."

The deceased and applicant who had been living together purchased residential property in 1997. Their lawyer prepared a written agreement for the sellers and purchasers as well as the mortgage describing the purchasers as joint tenants.

Rochon were satisfied. There was an obvious mistake which required rectification. The deceased and the applicant intended to purchase the property as joint tenants and instructed their lawyer accordingly. The lawyer acknowledged that it was a mistake that the title issued as it did. 2)Although the applicant had an alternate remedy of seeking damages for any loss from her conveyance lawyer, damages were not a reasonably convenient remedy in this case as title would remain registered in the names of strangers, neither of whom could be compelled to sell to the other.","FIAT.

d_2002skqb80.txt,"The Credit Union loaned $37,700 upon security, inter alia, of a 1999 Chevrolet Blazer owned by McMillan. A security agreement was registered at the Personal Property Security Registry in September 2000 and re-registered in November 2001. After McMillan died in June 2001, payments fell into arrears and a demand was made for possession of the Blazer. His widow, the respondent, was shown as co-buyer on the purchase agreement but was never the registered owner until she acquired it from her husband's estate. She sought to defeat the security interest on the grounds she was the real owner at all times, made the payments and was always in possession. At issue was whether the registered owner of a vehicle has the power to grant a security interest enforceable in priority to the interest of a person whose claim, though substantial, is not registered or otherwise of record in any place where the lender has or should have notice of it. HELD: The claim of the Credit Union was enforceable. Judicial notice was taken of the fact there is no title registry in Saskatchewan other than that maintained by Saskatchewan Government Insurance. The licensing function was assigned to SGI under the Vehicle Administration Act. That Act and the Highway Traffic Act are clear the person named in a registration certificate is regarded as the owner of the vehicle. Motor vehicles are unique in that their registration creates a presumption of ownership and follows a declaration of ownership by the registry. Reliance upon the registration system is an important facet of our commerce and would create chaos if reliance is taken away. Ownership does not depend upon registration. However, once a vehicle is registered following a declaration of ownership, a presumption arises in favour of the holder of the registration certificate and as a matter of commercial efficacy lenders, the police, insurers, repairmen, etc. are justified in relying upon the certificate as proof of ownership. A transfer of ownership would defeat the Credit Union's claim only if it were undertaken for value and with notice. No costs were awarded on either motion.","The applicant Credit Union loaned the respondent $37,700 upon a security of a 1999 Chevrolet Blazer. The respondent's wife had apparently been the person who used the vehicle under the registration agreement but she was never the registered owner of the vehicle until she acquired it from her husband's estate. Prior to the expiry of the registration the Credit Union made the respondent aware of their claim and of their intent to realize upon their security. The vehicle was not sold or charged in favour of a third party during the period between September 11, 2001, to November 14, 2001 when the security interest was unperfected. The wife sought to defeat the securityinterest upon the ground that she was at all times the real owner of her vehicle, had made the payments and was always in possession of it.

At the conclusion of the trial, the defence brought a motion to exclude the certificate of analysis as the demand flowed from an invalid approved screening device demand. HELD: The defence application to exclude the certificate of analysis based on a breach of s. 8 and s. 9 of the Charter was granted. There being no evidence upon which to convict in regard to the .08 charge, it was dismissed.  1) The Court found a distinction between 'had consumed alcohol' and 'has alcohol in the person's body'. The Court found the words 'had consumed alcohol' to be insufficient for the Court to conclude that the officer had a reasonable suspicion there was alcohol in the accused's body at the time of the demand. 2) There was no objective basis upon which a reasonable suspicion of alcohol in the body could be made. The evidence of alcohol on the breath was not reliable in the circumstances of this case. The admission of having had her last drink was possibly made after the demand and could not be relied on to formulate the required reasonable suspicion. The evidence of bloodshot eyes, empty beer bottles in a plastic bag with three persons in the car and the smell of alcohol coming from the vehicle could not alone support a reasonable conclusion of reasonable suspicion of alcohol in the body of the motorist.","The accused was charged with impaired driving and driving with a blood alcohol content greater than.08. At the conclusion of the Crown's case, the defence brought a motion to exclude the Certificate of Analysis, such evidence flowing from an invalid approved screening device demand, which infringed the accused's s.8 and s.9 Charter rights. At trial, the Crown conceded that if such Charter breaches were found, the appropriate remedy would be to exclude them. At issue was whether the arresting officer formed the requisite belief necessary to make roadside demand pursuant to s. 254(2) of the Charter, as well as whether the officer's opinion, so formed, could be objectively upheld on the evidence leading to such demand. HELD: The words 'had consumed alcohol' are insufficient insufficient for the court to conclude that the officer had a reasonable suspicion of alcohol in his body at the time of the ASD demand. 1) Evidence of consumption manifested by physical observation and/or through dialogue with the motorist may well provide such a reasonable person's reasonable suspicion. The threshold is far lower than the required belief to make a formal breath demand. 2) The wording of the section, however, is clear and unambiguous. It does not leave a trier of fact with the necessity of drawing inferences that consumption of alcohol at some point in itself equates to having alcohol in the body. Legislative priority has removed the process from the consideration of the degree of impairment that is displayed before the demand is made. The test is consumption alone and not its amount or behaviourial consequences. The Court was persuaded that the words had consumed alcohol were indeed insufficient for it to conclude they had been formed by the officer to bring it within the parameters of this section.  3) The words had been raised on the basis of a previous admission by the accused that she consumed alcohol and together with the other evidence he had on hand, they could not be relied upon to formulate the required reasonable suspicion, Objectively, these grounds alone cannot support a conclusion of reasonable belief of reasonable suspicion in the self of a motorist. 4) The Court found no error in the definition of 'consumption alone' as suggested by R. v. Hendel, [1997] O.J. No. 3297 (Ont. Gen. Div.)."

He required extensive rehabilitation and would not regain his pre-accident physical and intellectual capacity. The mother successfully applied for a reinstatement of child support which had been discontinued by consent, pre-accident, when the son was residing with the father. The son, now 23 years old, was upgrading his high school marks at the time of the hearing and hoped to be admitted to a community college program. The father appealed. Appeal dismissed; the judge's decision to award support was not premised upon a finding that, pre-accident, the son had made a clear decision to pursue a further course of study but on the fact that the son intended to pursue his education and had not withdrawn from parental charge at the time of the accident. There was no evidence to support the allegation that the usual Guideline amount was 'inappropriate' in this case; the Act prohibited the consideration of public income assistance when fixing child support; given the uncertainty about the son's future, this was not an appropriate case for a time-limited order.","The appellant father was ordered to pay maintenance for his son pursuant to the Maintenance and Custody Act. The mother had a previous relationship with the father prior to the accident. The father had been paying child support since the accident, but had abandoned his plans to pursue post-secondary studies and was taking a hiatus from work to pursue his studies. When the father told the mother that he was going to move out, the mother, who had taken leave from her job at the time of the incident, believed that the child was not intending to work or further his education. She later applied for provincial income assistance. The appellant father appealed. Appeal dismissed; he did not have an ongoing obligation to provide support.

The court found that the appellant had attempted to portray himself as being good to the children but had admitted on cross-examination that the children had been removed from the home due to allegations of physical abuse and lack of food. There was no evidence before the court as to the truth of these allegations and the appellant had stated in his evidence that everyone thought that he treated the children badly. The appellant appealed. Appeal allowed; conviction set aside; new trial ordered. The trial judge misapprehended the evidence because she attributed to it a relevance that it could not have in law or in logic. The appellants evidence about the involvement of Childrens Services did not permit the judge to draw any inference that the children had, in fact, been badly treated or that the appellant was responsible for such treatment. The misapprehension, examined in the context of the judges reasons as a whole and the entire record was substantial, material and played an essential part in the judges reasoning leading to the conviction; the misapprehension had given rise to a miscarriage of justice.","The appellant appeals his conviction by Crawford, J.P.C. on a charge of sexual assault. The appellant testified at trial denying the charge, but the trial judge disbelieved his evidence. On appeal, the appellant says that his conviction is a miscarriage of justice because the judge based her rejection of his testimony on material misapprehensions of the evidence. HELD: The conviction is set aside and a new trial ordered. 1) The court found that the judge's reasons for rejecting the appellant's evidence were based on misapprehendions of evidence. 2) The appellant's arguments were substantial and material. The judge ascribed to the evidence about the involvement of Children's Services, relevance that it simply could not have, and the inference drawn from this evidence could not be more unjustified. 3) The judge misapplied the evidence by failing to give proper effect to its evidence.

The plaintiff was making a significant claim for damages but she suffered from numerous previous injuries and conditions relating to her health; any damage assessment would depend largely upon credibility and the medical evidence at trial; to assess interim damages in this case would be a most difficult task and would only be a haphazard guess. The plaintiff's claim was also complicated by the fact that it could possibly be subject to the 'minor injury' cap on damages.","The plaintiff in a rear end motor vehicle accident applied for summary judgment and an interim payment. The defendant argued that there was an arguable issue to be tried in that even if one accepted the plaintiff's evidence that there were no brake lights on the vehicle, one had to consider the issue of contributory negligence; the defendant's affidavit did not disclose the existence of an actual or probable defence and could not fend off an application for summary judgement. The plaintiff also argued that she had not been able to establish that her injuries were not caused by the accident. Application allowed; there was no 'air of reality' to the defence; any amount of assessed damages which might be arrived at would largely depend upon credibility and medical evidence at trial. To strike the plaintiff’s vehicle from behind on these facts meant that the defendant was travelling too close or didn’t have enough care or control of his vehicle and consequently the collision occurred."
d_2006nsca124.txt,"The accused successfully challenged the sufficiency of the grounds to issue a search warrant that was used to search her residence. Although the Information to Obtain was based on information from an anonymous, unproven source, the source's information was corroborated by independent information as to the accused's employment and residence. The only corroboration of the presence of a crime (a suspected marijuana grow operation) was from a FLIR test. The court found that the evidence did not rise above the level of suspicion, albeit strong suspicion. Corroboration of the employment and residence of the accused did not provide particular support for the informant's credibility; neither were results of the FLIR test and the presence of covered windows sufficient corroboration. The Crown appealed. Appeal allowed; new trial ordered. Although the trial judge articulated the proper test and began by analyzing whether the warrant could have been issued, the issue was later mistakenly transformed into whether he, himself, would have issued it. By weighing the probative evidence, the trial judge effectively substituted his views for those of the issuing justice and wrongly required the issuing justice to draw proper inferences as opposed to reasonable inferences.","The Crown appealed the conviction of the respondent, who challenged the validity of a search warrant issued by the judge who excluded evidence obtained in the search of her home. The Crown alleged the judge misapplied the legal standard upon which he was to review the decision. Allowing the appeal and ordering a new trial, that the judge erred in law by failing to apply the proper standard of review. The warrant had been valid, the search was lawful and there was no allegation that it was otherwise unreasonable. The evidence obtained as a result of the search had been wrongly excluded and, in the result, the trial would not have been the same. The appeal court found that even had the warrant been quashed, the findings of the FLIR testing and observations about the covered windows were still insufficient to support the respondent's belief that there was evidence of the grow operation. Furthermore, the evidence obtained through the searches was wrongly excluded from the trial result because of insufficient information. The court found no breach of s.8 or s.9 of the Charter and found that the trial judge properly applied the test set out in R. v. Garofoli (1990). The court applied the standard for assessing whether a warrant could have been issued, but instead substituted its view of the evidence for that of the issuing judge.

Although the father will be stretched, the mother's evidence disclosed that the father had commenced making reasonable child support payments as of February 2007. The school fees were an amount equal to 71% of the total cost. Although it was clear from the evidence that the mother had not filed enough evidence regarding her special needs, the father did not have the ability to pay. The preschool fees were necessary, reasonable and within the range of $1,000 to $2,500 per month. The Learning Centre costs were within the father's means to contribute to. 2)The mother's claim for retroactive child support was made pursuant to s.7(1)(d) of the Federal Child Support Guidelines. Section 15.3(1) ordered that the Court give priority to child support in determining child support applications. In the matter before me, the Court found that s.8 of the $4300 ordered by the Court in July 2007 was sufficient to cover all of the costs of the two children. 3)The cost of child care in the summer of 2007 was approximately $1 million. The cost of Sylvan was $8,650. 4)There was significant conflict on the evidence regarding the payment of loans and the issue of whether or not the mother refused to accept payments being offered. The mother was required to bring this motion to obtain an appropriate sharing of s. expenses. 5)Although the father is not opposed to the Kody receiving some additional educational assistance, he did not provide any evidence regarding his ongoing support payments.  6)The Sylvan Education expenses were appropriate and reasonable, although not in the amount of $472 per month, and the father was ordered to contribute in the order of $843."
d_2009nssm48.txt,"The tenant's year-to-year lease ran from September 1 to August 31. Four months before it was set to automatically renew, he notified the landlord he wished to convert to a month-to-month tenancy. The landlord refused, saying vacancies were hard to fill at any time other than September 1st. The three bedroom rental was in an area with a large university student population and was targeted at individuals sharing not families. It was a high-end rental, and would not necessarily appeal to students. The landlord provided evidence that the last time it was on the market in winter, it was vacant for several months. After a Residential Tenancies Board hearing, an officer declared the tenant successful. The written decision did not mention the landlord's reasons for refusing consent, nor did it say they were arbitrary or unreasonable. The landlord appealed, but offered to compromise by allowing the tenant to terminate the lease any time between May 31 and August 31 without penalty. The officer erred in law. The Act allows the landlord some discretion to refuse a request to convert to month-to-month, providing the refusal is made reasonably. The landlord's reasons were neither unreasonable nor arbitrary, given the reality of the market and his past experiences with a winter vacancy. There may be other situations where consent could reasonably be withheld. The tenancy is declared to have been renewed for another year (with the understanding the landlord will allow the tenant to terminate at any point after May 31). Both parties acted in good faith and, while it might seem unfair to lock the tenant into a lease he believed had converted to month-to-month, the court must make the order the officer should have made in the first place.","This was an appeal by the landlord from an order of the Director which effectively permitted the tenant to convert what had been a year to year lease into a month to month tenancy, but also denied the landlord's request that the tenancy be deemed to have terminated because the tenant effectively refused to renew for another year. The landlord appealed. Allowing the appeal, that the lease has not been converted into a Month to Month tenancy because the landlord refused his consent in a timely manner, for reasons beyond the control of either the landlord or the tenant, who have been operating in a state of uncertainty, not knowing the status of the tenancy, and having no credible rationale behind it. An arbitrary decision would be one that is random or based on purely personal whim. In the unique circumstances of this case, it was appropriate that the tenant and not the landlord incur that risk."
d_2011skpc108.txt,The accused was charged with committing a common assault against his step-sister being the complainant. The question was whether the Crown's evidence was sufficiently credible to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the only physical contact he had on the complainant was for the purpose of defending himself from the alleged aggression of the complainant and whether the Crown was able to prove non-consent beyond a reasonable doubt. HELD: The Court did not know whom to believe and the accused was acquitted.,The accused was charged with common assault. The issue was whether the evidence of the Crown was sufficiently credible to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the only physical contact he had on the complainant was for the purpose of defending himself from the alleged aggression of the complainant. HELD: The accused was found not guilty. The Court found nothing which would indicate that the complainant had consented to the application of force which had allegedly occurred and that the accused must receive the benefit of the doubt in that regard.
d_2012nsca52.txt,",  motions granted. Both appeals are dismissed as a result of the appellant's failure to perfect, including her failure to file necessary materials or comply with the court's directions to do so. While a dismissal of the criminal appeal is a serious remedy, since it means it will never be heard on its merits, the appellant has made it clear that she cannot provide certified transcripts unless the court orders the respondents to pay. The court has already declined to do so. There is no suggestion a further extension of time will result in the appellant perfecting the appeal.","The appellant appealed the June 29, 2011 decision of the Criminal Appeal Court dismissing her two appeals and ordering the respondents to pay the cost of certifying the transcripts of her appeal. At the time of the appeal, the appellant had filed a notice of appeal in the Provincial Court and was in receipt of a copy of the Chambers' Notice of Appeal. At that notice, the Chambers judge dismissed the appellant's motion to consolidate both appeals and to have the respondents pay to certify the transcripts. The respondents' motions to dismiss both appeals were granted. The appellant had not provided the respondents with the necessary time to prepare and file the transcripts and requested that they pay the costs of certification.  She also failed to comply with certain provisions of the Rules, including the payment of the respondents' costs to the appellant for the production of the transcripts; the AGNS motion to have them paid for the transcription was dismissed for failure to perfect; in addition, both appeals had dragged on for almost a year and were no closer to having the required materials filed and the appeal set down and heard. Given that dismissal of her Criminal Appeal prevents the appellant from having the merits of her Appeal determined, which she makes clear are of vital importance to her personally and which she believes are also of great public importance because they involve finding that she was not criminally responsible with respect to the public mischief charge, the Court has not ordered copies of the transcript to be produced and be provided to the parties; and there is no authority under the Rules for the respondents not to pay for the transcript certifications, which the appellant has indicated they are not prepared to do. The Court dismisses both appeals with respect respect to their respective motions for dismissal on the same basis. The appellants, in particular, motion to compel the respondents, in their entirety, to pay their costs to certify transcripts, which they have not done. In addition, the respondents are responsible for the actions of the Crown in arresting and charging the appellant and the Province in continuing to conduct trials involving her."
d_2013skqb348.txt,"HELD: The Court dismissed the application. The information contained in the affidavits was uncontroverted and a matter of public record. MLG was unable to explain how cross-examination would assist the Court. As well, the application to cross-examine did not appear to rest on a real need to clarify any issues relevant to the application for which the affidavits had been filed and focused on the relative merits of legal issues rather than on evidentiary issues.","The defendants applied for carriage of the proceedings in Saskatchewan and for leave to cross-examine on affidavits filed by the plaintiff and the defendant in opposition to the defendants' application for carriage. HELD: The applications were dismissed. The court emphasized the importance of providing a proper evidentiary record for the resolution of the issues raised by the application, including clarification of ambiguous evidence, expanding or narrowing the scope of what is said in an affidavit, or exploring matters going to the credibility of the affiant. The fundamental questions were not raised in the affidavits but in the brief of law. The affidavits were not filed in relation to an application for certification. The defendants filed affidavits in support of the certification application and in opposition against the defendants’ application for the stay and carriage of proceedings."
d_2016skpc75.txt,"HELD: The application was dismissed. The court found that the 51 months between the charges and the scheduled trial was sufficiently long to warrant an inquiry into the reasonableness of the delay. As the accused had specifically and voluntarily waived almost five months of the delay, the court deducted that amount, leaving 46 months to be considered. The various types of delay were considered by the court: 11.5 for inherent delay; 15.5 months to be attributed to the actions of the accused; 10 months to be attributed to the Crown; and 10 months to institutional delay. The court found that the accused had not suffered prejudice and as most of the delay was attributable to adjournments sought on his behalf, the court found that the overall delay in this case was not unreasonable.","The accused, charged with 56 offences, including conspiracy to commit the indictable offence of fraud by printing and/or cashing forged cheques, defrauding or attempting to defraud contrary to s. 380(1)(b) of the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act and possession of a counterfeit mark contrary to section 376(2)(b). The accused alleged that his right to a fair trial had been infringed. He sought a judicial stay of proceedings alleging that his rights to a review of material obtained as a result of the charges had been violated. HELD: The application was dismissed.  1)The accused had no interest in an early trial and society's interest would not parallel that of the accused. 2)The Court distinguished between the interests of society as a whole and those of the Crown. The accused had not established on a balance of probabilities that there had been a breach of his rights within reasonable time.  3)Individual rights were by their very nature adverse to the interest of the individual. The Court distinguished the accused from the general public in that society had an interest in seeing that the least fortunate of its citizens who are accused of crimes are brought to trial and dealt with according to the law. 4)The court balanced the interests and interests of the defendant and society in law enforcement. 5)Individual and collective rights were to be balanced. The court found that society's interests were by- and were not to be opposed to the accused’s. 6)Individual right to fair trial included the right to security of the person, to liberty and to hearing readiness. The secondary societal interest was by its very nature negative. 7)Individuals were to have access to information, counsel, training and other relevant material. 8)Rule 11(b) was amended to include the following: disclosure delays, change of venue applications, changes of solicitor, challenges to search warrants, and adjournments which are directly attributable to the defence and which are voluntarily undertaken and do not count toward the unreasonableness of the overall delay. 9)Rule 10 was not breached. 10)The Charter was not violated. 11)The law is not unreasonable. Society has an intrinsic value. As the seriousness of the offence increases so does the societal demand that the accused be brought to court. The law is formulated to ensure that information is provided to the public in a timely fashion. The principles of the Charter and the context of the legislation apply to this application."

The Legal Profession Act, 1990 provides for an order for an inquiry into the conduct of members of the Law Society of Saskatchewan as they progress through criminal matters. The hearings were held intermittently, often by telephone conference calls, and the matter was adjourned from time to time. HELD: The application was dismissed. 1)The respondent's jurisdiction was limited to the hearing of the complaint by virtue of the fact that the decision of the Hearing Committee was not provided to the chairperson within 45 days of the hearing. 2)The applicant had been working at establishing an international consulting business and had completed his undertaking to refrain from the practice of law prior to being granted an inactive membership. 3)Although stay of proceedings was ordered for the period from August 1989 until January 1990, it was incumbent upon the respondents to move without delay before the stay was granted and after it was lifted on the application of the respondents.

e_1999canlii12492.txt,"The Minister of Social Services sought an order under s.37(2) of the Child and Family Services Act to permanently commit all three children to the Minister. The Department of Social Services had been involved with the family since the birth of the oldest child. The children had been in the care of the Minister at various times and parent aides provided help to the parents when there was child or children at home. The Minister called 18 witnesses. HELD: All three children were committed permanently to the Minister. 1)The mother appeared to be more anxious about excusing the father, who was an abusive alcoholic, than about protecting the children. The mother was unable to parent any of the children on her own. It was concluded under s.11(b) of the Act that there was no adult person able and willing to provide for the children's needs and physical or emotional harm may come to the children if it had not already. 2)The father had recently pleaded guilty to sexual assault on an eight year old girl which could, depending on the facts be a ground under s.11(a)(iii) of the Act for a finding of need for protection.","The Minister of Social Services sought an order permanently committing to the Minister all three of the children of the Department permanently committing them to their mother. The Department had been very much involved and had acted negligently by failing to protect the children. The mother, who had been diagnosed as having Attention Deficit Disorder (ADD) and had been placed on medication, had shown signs of some improvement in some areas of her ability to manage her children. For the past six years, the Department had struggled to overcome the dysfunction in the family and the risks to the children that it would bring if the mother were to be removed from the home and returned to her abusive and neglectful former husband. The father had been physically abused and had continued to be in denial of this or to excuse it. The foster parents had been much too irresponsible to have the care and control of all of their children. HELD: The application was reserved and all three children to be permanently committed to the mother was to be paid for.  1)The mother's attitude and ability to interact with the children at the hearing was clearly not in accord with the father's. She chose alcohol over both and ignored the children's exposure to domestic disharmony and violence that was part of the ongoing pattern of living of and L. 2)The father could not be faulted for his failure as a parent but the mother simply did not have the competency to parent the children on her own.  3)The evidence showed that the mother had a domino effect as she did not act on the recognition that she was the only person who could supervise and protect the family. The children were in need of protection as provided by s.11(a)(ii) and (vi) of the Act."
e_1999nsca134.txt,"The appellant was granted release pending appeal, on conditions. The Crown applied for a review. The Crown contended that the Chambers judge misinterpreted the definition of custody in granting the application, as the appellant was on day parole at the time of the application. Dismissing the application, that day parole with a requirement to return to a halfway house each night is a form of custody which allows for an application and release under s. 679 of the Code.","Following an application for release pending appeal pursuant to s. 679 of the Criminal Code, the Crown applied for a review under s. 680(1) of the Code. The original written decision granted release with conditions, pending the appeal scheduled to be heard January 26, 2000. An amended order in October 1999 issued a written decision granting the release with condition. On the same date the Crown application for review was applied for s. 670(1). The Crown applied to the Chief Justice of the Court of Appeal for direction that the decision be reviewed by that Court and no review will be held. Counsel for the Crown relied upon his submission that Wood, who was on day parole at the time of his application, was not in custody and therefore, was in custody. He raised a number of issues raising issues including whether the Chambers judge erred in law in ruling that at the relevant time the application was on release from the federal penitentiary on a day parole granted by the National Parole Board under Part ll of the Corrections and Conditional Release Act, and that the Crown should return to custody all of the other cases cited in the 679 decision. The Crown appealed the decision. Allowing the appeal in part, that the Court should return a decision of this decision in the form of a letter of direction, a direction in the direction of the Supreme Court of Canada, and a direction to the Crown in light of the numerous other cases that had come before it. In addition, the Court could not find any other cases on this issue."

The accused is paraplegic. He moved to British Columbia after his release. He did not appear for trial, and a Canada wide warrant was issued for his arrest. He was arrested and returned to stand trial. The Crown applied to have bail and the surety forfeited. It took the position that the accused had deliberately left the province to avoid trial, and therefore should be responsible for the full $1,000. It also contended that the sureties had a responsibility to ensure the accused's attendance at trial, and that they should also be responsible for the full $1,000. The surety testified that the conditions of the recognizance were not explained to him, and he did not understand the potential consequences of default. Dismissing the applications for forfeiture, that the surety had no concept of his obligations under the recognizance, and was not made aware of those obligations by the authorities. In these circumstances, it would not be just to order forfeiture. With respect to the accused, he is impecunious. His failure to pay any amount ordered against him could lead to imprisonment. As the accused already faces the prospect of imprisonment for failing to attend trial, this would create the potential of double liability for what is in essence the same offence.","The Crown applied pursuant to s. 771 for an order forfeiting the amount of bail set out in a recognizance entered into the the accused in the respect of a twelve year old girl. The accused was charged with four criminal matters, of sexual assault under s. 271(1)(a) of the Criminal Code, uttering a threat, sexual touching under s.(151) and unlawfully having a weapon. The surety denied any wrongdoing and contended the accused did not have a criminal record. HELD: The applications for forfeiture were dismissed. 1) The accused had no concept of his obligations under the recognizizance. He mistakenly believed that his responsibilities or liability ended with the accused's first appearance in Court following his release. Certainly he was not aware that he himself could be subject to imprisonment under s773 in the event of default and was not made aware of that fact.  2) It would not be just and appropriate to order forfeiture on the part of the surety. He had not had an opportunity to read the document prior to signing it. He should have had had the opportunity to make an informed decision. 3) The evidence did not show that the accused had a serious disability or that he might be in danger of suffering injury or suffering a loss of income.

The registered owner applied for an order declaring her interest in the vehicle was not affected by any forfeiture order. The owner was passenger when 28.3 pounds of marijuana was discovered in the trunk of her Lincoln. She was found not guilty of trafficking and possession of marijuana for the purpose of trafficking. The driver was found guilty of possession for the purpose of trafficking. The trafficking charge against him was judicially stayed. HELD: An order of forfeiture issued pursuant to s.16(1). The application for relief was dismissed. 1)It was not necessary to address the Charter submissions with respect to s.19(3) because Crown counsel consented to the respondent's application being viewed as an application for relief from forfeiture under s.20. 2)It was impossible to conclude the respondent 'appeared innocent of any complicity' in the offence for which the driver was convicted and that she 'exercised all reasonable care to be satisfied' that the Lincoln was not likely to be used in the commission of the offence. 3)Section 11 of the Charter applies only when person has been charged with an offence. There was no charge against the respondent at this time. 4)The Act distinguishes between three types of persons who might own, or have an interest in, conveyance which is 'offence-related property': the interest of person convicted of the offence is forfeitable pursuant to s.16(1); if the person has been neither convicted nor charged and appears innocent of any complicity in the offence; someone charged with the offence which gave rise to the forfeiture application (as here). The forfeiture is not, except with respect to an offender, arbitrary. In view of the provisions available under the Act to obtain relief from forfeiture it cannot be concluded that empowering a court to grant an order of forfeiture constitutes cruel or unusual punishment.",The Crown applied pursuant to s. 16(1) of the Controlled Drug and Substances Act for an order forfeiting the Lincoln. Fair was convicted of trafficking in marijuana and possession for the purpose of trafficking and Brooks was found not guilty on both counts. The Crown alleged that Brooks had consented to Fair's submission being viewed as an application for relief from forfeiture pursuant to S. 20(4) of The Controlled Drugs and Substance Act. Brooks had previously been charged with trafficking in marihuana and possession of cocaine. She had also been convicted of conspiracy to transport controlled drugs. Brooks' application to have her interest in the Lincoln struck because it was being used to facilitate the commission of a designated substance offence against her husband. HELD: The Lincoln was found to be owned by Brooks and not by Fair. The Court found that Brooks' admission that it was in two plastic blue tubs was not in any way connected to the offence and that she exercised all reasonable care to be sure the property was not likely to be used in the commission was not subject to cruel and unusual treatment. The admission that the Lincoln was being loaded with drugs was not supported by the evidence at trial and it was not clear from the affidavit that the drugs were in the blue tub.

All seven applicants are parents of children attending the two school systems. The applicant has seven applicants who have children attending one of the schools. The school system has determined that the declining use of classroom space is costly with respect to the maintenance expense of schools. HELD: 1) The applicants have been directly affected by the closure of the school system. It is the position of the board that the applicants are aggrieved persons. There is no basis in this proceeding to exercise such discretion. 2) There has not been been established the applicants were directly affected. The recommendation from the School Review Committee, that the 79 students would be transferred from Notting Park to Northbrook, permits it to be said the applicants' persons are remote when there is nothing before me but the evidence of only recommendation that the Board establish a school advisory council for each of the sixteen high schools in the area is that there is a significant amount of space that is essentially vacant. There was no evidence that those persons have not joined in this application. The applicants are certainly directly affected and in the absence of good reason, do not consider it appropriate to proceed in what is less effective way to bring this issue before the Court. 3) The applicant obtained standing for different reason the judicial discretion to find he had public interest standing.

The defendant acknowledged the plaintiff fell in its produce department, but did not concede the water on the floor caused her to slip; the cause was, in part, her worn running shoes without laces. Liability and degree of personal injury were in issue. The claim proceeded under the simplified procedure under Part Forty of the Queen's Bench Rules. HELD: The claim was dismissed with costs. 1)The defendant had a duty of care to the plaintiff as owner and occupier. The courts have most often based the duty of care on the invitor/invitee standard. Maxay v. Ramsay Drugs proposed four-part inquiry to determine whether or not an occupier has breached its duty of care. 2)The plaintiff established on a balance of probabilities that she slipped because of water on the floor. The evidence did not support an inference that her footwear caused the slip or was a contributing factor. 3)An adverse inference was not drawn from the defendant's failure to adduce evidence confirming its employee had in fact cleaned the floor. The employee was no longer employed by the defendant. Neither party was able to locate him. 4)Some of her injuries were, in part, the aggravation of pre-existing conditions. The most significant injury was sprain to her left ankle, which had not been resolved primarily because the plaintiff declined to accept available treatment and failed to follow medical advice. The inconsistencies in her affidavit and the physician notes or medical reports respecting her injuries and treatment were not relevant to this decision. 5)A 'sweep log' was kept for each department and employees made regular inspections of the sales floor area in every department. The plaintiff slipped and fell about an hour after the last sweeping. A regular program of maintenance was conducted in the area. The overall policies and practices of regular maintenance and responsibility of each employee were substantially the same if not identical to those considered in the Mollenhauer and Libel group of cases. The defendant met the legal standard of care imposed in the circumstances and was not liable for the plaintiff's injuries. To find otherwise would be to impose a standard that is inconsistent with that previously imposed by this court in almost identical circumstances.","The plaintiff sought damages for injuries sustained when she slipped and fell while grocery shopping in the defendant's Superstore. The plaintiff had been in the produce department of the store at around 3:45 pm. She had been to the store's maintenance department at 4:52 pm. The maintenance department was dry and wet. At 5:00 pm. the plaintiff was taken to the Pasqua Hospital Emergency Department where she was bandaged, given painkillers and advised to rest and see her family doctor if her injuries did not improve. At 6:00 am. the defendant was preparing a report to the Court as to the condition of the plaintiff's shoes. An inspector had attended to the scene of the accident but was not able to locate them. At 8:00 a.m. the sweep log showed that floors in the store had been swept at least once per hour. A regular program of maintenance had been conducted by the defendant in that area. The overall policies and practices of regular maintenance of the floor areas combined with the responsibility of each employee to carry them out were substantially the same. HELD: The claim was dismissed with costs. 1)The defendant met the legal standard of care imposed upon it in the circumstances and was not liable for the injuries suffered by the plaintiff. 2)There have been many cases that have found slippery substance such as water or produce on the floor of grocery store to constitute an unusual danger. The defendant did not know the water was there, but did know that water and other substances could be on the Floor of the Produce Department and also knew that reasonable steps must be taken to safeguard against the very type of accident experienced by the general public. 3)There were numerous cases that found slippery substances such as rain, snow and produce on a floor of a grocery store. Some of the injuries were at least in part the aggravation of pre-existing conditions. 4)The plaintiff did not submit to any of the requested medical treatment or follow the medical advice she received. The affidavits filed by two assistant managers confirmed the cleaning regimen in place at the store.  5)There was no evidence filed by the defendants that any of their employees had worked on the floors prior to or during the incident. The logs did not raise any adverse inference. The defendants did not file separate affidavits or prepare any evidence as to whether any of them had been filed prior to, during, or after the sweep.  6)The Court held that the defendant met its legal standard for care in the circumstance and was, therefore, not"

The evidence of impairment was too weak to convict the appellant. The officer told the accused that if he passed the ALERT test, he would be sent on his way.

At trial the Provincial Court judge dismissed the refusal count as the officer had failed in his testimony to give evidence of the words used in the 'alert' demand. That decision was not under appeal. The appeal was allowed and the conviction quashed.

The law is well-settled that the pursuit of post-secondary education may be a sufficient reason for an adult child's inability to withdraw from their parent's charge or to obtain the necessaries of life. A change in circumstances would not constitute a 'other cause' as contemplated in the definition of 'child of themarriage' as determined by the Queen's Bench Rule 608(2) and the decision was made without prejudice to the husband if his unemployment continued for an extended period of time."
e_2004nspc8.txt,"The defendant applied for a stay of proceedings on the basis of a violation of his right to be tried in a reasonable time. There had been delay of approximately 14.5 months from the time that he was charged with exceeding the breathalyzer and impaired driving to the date of his trial. Stay of proceedings granted. At his first court appearance the defendant requested the first available trial date and there was no evidence to suggest that an institutional delay of 13 months was the norm in other metro provincial courts. Given the nature of the charges, the technical nature of breathalyzer law and the defendant's stated intention to raise ss. 8 and 9 of the Charter, prejudice could be inferred on the basis that the length of delay was likely to interfere with the quality of evidence tendered.","This was an application for a stay of proceedings based on a violation of the right to be tried within a reasonable time pursuant to s. 11(b) of the Charter. The accused was charged with exceeding the Breathalyzer and impaired driving. He was arraigned on the information and requested the first available date for trial. The Defense had verballyized an intention to raise s. 8 and s. 9 Charter motions and lead evidence. The Crown objected and the accused waived his right to a fair trial. HELD: The application was stayed.  1)The length of the delay was well outside the 8-10 month guideline established in Morin. 2)The applicant asserted his rights to a speedy trial and waived any of his rights, explicitly or implicitly. Given the nature of the charges and the technical nature of Breathalyzers, the fact that the Defense has verbalized an intent to raise ss.8 and s9 Charter motions, the delay is likely to interfere with the quality of evidence tendered given the passage of time that has occurred since the charges were filed. 3)There was no evidence before this court that the applicant waived any rights, implicitly. The applicant retained and instructed counsel, entered his plea at arraignment and set the matter for trial in December 2003. The length of delay was little better than 14 months. 4)Prejudice can be inferred on the length of this delay from the time the information was sworn, September 29, 2002 to the date set for commencement of trial December 18, 2003. 5)The longer the delay the easier it may be for the court to infer prejudice. The longer it delays the greater the risk that the evidence given by witnesses may not be as reliable as it might otherwise be, due to fading memories. 6)There is no evidence that the accused waivered any rights. The court must do is to determine judicially whether the delay exceeds the inherent time requirements of the case. 7)There could be no greater frustration imaginable for innocent persons charged with an offence than to be denied the opportunity of demonstrating their innocence for an unconscionable time as result of unreasonable delays in their trial. 8)The court must be forever mindful of the rights s.11(b). 9) and 10(a) require a minimum of 14 months in order to protect and uphold and the purpose of those rights. 10)The reasonableness of 13 months is an inferred prejudice. It can not be remedied in any other way than by entering a stay in proceedings"
e_2004skca31.txt,"This was an application to lift the stay imposed by Rule 15 of The Court of Appeal Rules. HELD: The Court declined to lift the stay. While a chambers judge acting under s. 20 of The Court of Appeal Act may not have the independent authority to make a maintenance order, a chambers judge has the authority to stay a judgment in its entirety in the Court of Queen's Bench in certain cases as long as doing so does not decide the appeal. The Court of Appeal stayed the decision of Klebuc J., which left the order of Wright in place, which maintained the existing maintenance obligation.","HELD: On this application to lift the stay imposed by Rule 15 on the judgment of Klebuc J. dated February 25, 2004, the Court declined to do so for these reasons. The application parallels that of Gerwing J.A., who decided on February 25th, prior to the final reasons being filed, not to lift or to maintain the schedule existing prior to their decision under appeal. Since oral argument, when the mother assumed that maintenance would be paid, the father's counsel filed a detailed brief arguing that staying the execution of Klebbuc J.'s judgment did not revive the prior maintenance order and that a Court of Appeal chambers judge does not have the authority to make such an order. HELD: The application to stay the execution by Rule15 on the judgement of Kleebuc J., which gives the mother custody of the children for slightly more than 50% of the time, leaves the effect of the order declining to lift it. The Court of Queen's Bench Chambers judge cannot make a determinative decision in light of the relatively short time period between the appeal date and time."
e_2004skpc82.txt,"The accused youth is charged with driving a motor vehicle while his ability to do so was impaired by alcohol or drug contrary to s. 253(a) of the Criminal Code. The issue was whether the evidence was sufficient to prove impairment beyond a reasonable doubt. HELD: The only reliable indicia of impairment were a very strong odour of alcohol and a flushed face. Beyond that, the indicators are either inconclusive, non-existent or the accused offered a reasonable explanation for them. The evidence is so frail as to leave a reasonable doubt as to impairment and the accused was acquitted. 1) The accused was exceeding the speed limit and failed to signal lane changes. His vehicle wandered somewhat in the lane, but did not stray into the other lane. The observations of his driving were made over 2-minute period. The aspects of the driving that were observed may have been the result of driver inattention. 2) The bloodshot eyes may have been the result of chain smoking. Further, the evidence of glazed eyes is inconclusive in the absence of reliable evidence of bloodshot eyes. 3) The evidence of flushed face was reliable evidence of impairment. 4) The evidence of strong odour of alcohol is reliable indicia of impairment, due to the consumption of alcohol by the accused. 5) The accused did not have any problem with balance, but was moving in slow and deliberate manner. If the accused was not displaying difficulty with balance and coordination, then the suggestion that he was moving slowly is not a credible indicator of impairment. The accused did not display slurred speech and appeared to comprehend his legal rights and obligations. He did not display any mental confusion or inappropriate behaviour. In the absence of expert evidence to explain the scientific basis for the physical tests administered, the proper method of application and their reliability the Court could not rely on them. 6) The accused blew 80 milligrams on two occasions. However, regardless of the alcohol consumption and the accused blood alcohol concentration, the only reliable indicia of impairment were a strong odour of alcohol and a flushed face.","The accused was charged that he did operate a motor vehicle while his ability to do so was impaired by alcohol or a drug, contrary to s. 253(a) of the Criminal Code. The issue was whether the evidence was sufficient to prove impairment beyond a reasonable doubt. HELD: The accused was acquitted of all charges.  1)The Court found that the accused was not displaying any symptoms of impairment. The only signs of impairment were his blood alcohol consumption, a very strong smell of alcohol and a flushed face. 2)On the Crown evidence, the accused did not display slurred speech. He appeared to fully comprehend his rights and obligations in his communications with the peace officer and legal aid duty counsel. However, his response in stopping was somewhat delayed and he braked abruptly. The opportunity to make the observations was only during roughly 2 minutes. 3)The accused suggested that his bloodshot or watery eyes may have been the result of his previous consumption of alcohol or drugs. 4)The court concluded that in the absence of expert evidence to explain the scientific basis for these tests, the proper method of application and to comment on their reliability, it was not appropriate for the court to rely upon them on the issue of guilt or innocence, to the prejudice of the accused."

HELD: 1) On the charge that the accused endangered the life of the complainant by attempting to strike her with a motor vehicle, the Court had strong suspicions that the accused did intend to strike the complainant with the vehicle but could not convict. 2) There was no doubt that bodily harm was caused to the complainant. The accused admits he slung her on the ground and kicked her and, as a result, the court find the accused guilty of assault causing bodily harm. 3) There is no doubt that the accused was operating a truck and that he drove it toward the complainant, who was lying on the concrete, and her daughter. It is unnecessary for the Crown to prove that the lives or safety of others were actually endangered. The offence is proved where the Crown establishes that the driving complained of was dangerous to the public. The offence requires a marked departure from prudent conduct. The offence of dangerous driving was established and the accused was found guilty. 4) The accused was found guilty of two counts of assault.","HELD: The accused was found guilty. The court found that the accused was guilty of both charges. The Court believed that the evidence of the accused who had been assaulted by the complainant and had been drinking and the victim of a domestic dispute had been found to be unreliable. Therefore, the Court found the accused guilty."
e_2005skpc8.txt,"The accused is charged with committing a sexual assault contrary to s. 271 of the Criminal Code. The accused was police officer with the Regina Police Service for 25 years until he retired in 1999 with the rank of Deputy Chief of Police. In the fall of 2001, he was appointed Justice of the Peace. The Crown proceeded summarily. The first incident involved the accused bringing the complainant's hand to his crotch. The second incident involved the accused touching the complainant's breast and crotch and trying to kiss her. The issues are whether the Crown proved the actus reus and mens rea of the offence. HELD: The accused is guilty of sexually assaulting the complainant in both courtroom 10 and the Youth Court general office. 1) The alleged touching occurred and it was of a sexual nature. The complainant did not consent to the contact. 2) The parties, along with most of the employees in the building, were often subject to or the source of numerous crude jokes and comments of a sexual nature. The accused believed that his discussions with the complainant about such matters were serious. However, at no time did the accused express his desire to get to know her or to see her outside of the workplace. He did not raise the possibility of physical relationship nor did she express any interest in sexual liaison. When he suggested it, she was not enthusiastic. The interactions described by the accused are more consistent with normal interaction between persons in that particular workplace than with an indication of consent to sexual activity. Looking at all the evidence, there is nothing to support an honest belief on the part of the accused that the complainant consented to the sexual contact. The accused's suggestion that he had an honest but mistaken belief in consent cannot be considered because the Court could not cobble together from the totality of the evidence sufficient evidence from which it could be said that the accused could have drawn an honestly held belief or from which he could have honestly inferred that the complainant had consented to his touching her.","The accused was charged that he committed a sexual assault on the complainant contrary to s. 271 of the Criminal Code. HELD: The accused was found guilty.  1) The complainant was employed as clerk at the Provincial Court Building. She assumed her duties in 1998 and although she testified that she knew the accused in 1999, it was much more likely that she met him in the spring of 2002 after he assumed his duties as Justice of the Peace in the same building. The Court found that the accused had not been detained and that his right to counsel under s. 10(b) had been infringed. 2) The accused's evidence was examined. It was clear that the complainant had been sexually assaulted by the accused and that he had responded in the negative. 3) There was some consistency as to the incidents that occurred prior to August 21/2003 but the same cannot be said about the events of August 2003. The accused gave his evidence in an honest and straightforward fashion. He was vigorously cross-examined. While his recollection was not perfect and his evidence was not consistent on every point, the court believed that he did his best to relate his evidence as accurately as he could and believed that there was never ever any indication that she wasn't consenting to it. 4) The statements of credibility were not tender to the Crown."
e_2006skqb231.txt,"The plaintiff applies for certification pursuant to The Class Actions Act on behalf of himself and the other passengers of an international flight from the Dominican Republic to Regina. The flight was delayed for about 1.5 hours at the Dominican Republic airport as result of several mechanical difficulties. The claim is with respect to alleged negligence, unlawful confinement and breach of contract. HELD: The applicant has failed to establish the first criteria as set out in s. 6(a) of the Act. The application for certification is dismissed on that basis. 1) The court accepts that all of the defendants are governed by the provisions of the Montreal Convention of 1999. The wording of Article 29 of that agreement is clear. Any claims for damages of passenger of an international flight can only be brought within the ambit of the Montreal Convention of 1999. The court reviewed the cases and found that the plaintiff's claims outside the ambit of the Montreal Convention of 1999 in negligence, breach of contract, unlawful confinement and punitive damages do not disclose a cause of action. 2) The sole exclusive remedy available to passengers is set out in Article 17(1) of the Montreal Convention of 1999. strict liability regime has been set up with cap of damages where passenger sustains 'bodily injury' as result of an injury that occurs in the course of embarking or disembarking. It is settled law that for a passenger to have access to Article 17(1), the individual must have suffered a bodily injury as opposed to mere mental anguish. It has not been established that any bodily injury has been sustained by any of the passengers on Flight 361. It is plain and obvious that the claim does not raise a reasonable cause of action. Corrigendum received dated July 20, 2006 and added to fulltext.","The plaintiff applies for certification of this action pursuant to the Class Actions Act on behalf of himself and the other passengers of an international flight being held in Canada. The flight was delayed for about an hour and half at the Punta Cana airport as a result of several evolving mechanical difficulties referred to by the pilot as 'creeping delay'. The defendants opposed the certification application on the basis that none of the five criteria as set out in s. 6(a) of the Act had been met by the applicant. The plaintiff states that the plaintiff was negligent in not taking appropriate precautions and should have made alternate arrangements or taken additional precautions to ensure that there were no excessive delays. The airline was also negligent in failing to provide water and other essential supplies. Corrigendum received dated July 20, 2006 and added to fulltext. The court found that although the applicant's claim did not disclose a cause of action, it was not very high onus on him to satisfy the Court that the pleadings disclose cause of Action. The test to be applied in certification applications is similar to those used in applications to strike statement of claim as disclosing no cause of actions. HELD: The certification application was dismissed. The Court held that although it would have dismissed the certification applications on the sole basis of not meeting the criteria as outlined in the Act, the Court should be reluctant to deny plaintiff his or her day in court. The generous approach to be adopted on this application was specifically spelled out in S. 4(2)(a) in s4(2) of The Class Actions legislation. Although no specific case law was provided to the Court concerning the Montreal Convention of 1999, there is ample case law with regard to its predecessor, the Warsaw Convention, as to its exclusive remedy for passengers. Those cases include the decision of Akehurst and Others v. Thomson Holidays Ltd., which involved a claim against commercial passenger airline (Britannia) and package operator (Thomson) arising from a crash landing. Although the court would not normally dismiss a claim such as that of a flight attendant for psychological injuries, for reasons that will be thoroughly canvassed in this judgment, it did so pursuant to s. 4 of the CAA. The defendant's pleadings disclosed a cause for action. The portions of the statement that were pleadings which were not part of the certification Application were amended to include the terms of a contract between the plaintiff and the airline. The amendments were not incorporated into the amended Statement of Claim, but rather incorporated into a separate action."
e_2006skqb508.txt,"The Crown appeals the decision of the Provincial Court judge that found the respondent's rights under s. 10(b) of the Charter has been violated and in excluding the certificate of analysis, acquitted the respondent. The Crown argues that the trial judge misapplied the reasoning of the Supreme Court in R. v. Prosper in his analysis of the circumstances surrounding the police officer's demand for the respondent to provide his breath sample. The issue on this appeal is whether Prosper requires the police in the Saskatchewan jurisdiction, where faced with a detainee that has changed his mind and declined legal advice, to inform that detainee that he has a right to a reasonable opportunity to contact a lawyer and that the police have an obligation not to require the detainee to participate in any incriminating process until the detainee has had a reasonable opportunity to contact a lawyer. HELD: 1) Prosper addresses the issue of the police's obligation in jurisdictions where free, preliminary legal advice is unavailable. Oppositely, Saskatchewan has Brydges duty counsel available to detainees and no such obligation exists. Having reviewed the law as stated in Prosper, the Court concluded that the trial judge erred in finding that this case was analogous to the facts in Prosper, and in finding that the police officer had an obligation to provide a 'Prosper warning' to the respondent once the respondent had changed his mind and declined legal advice. 2) The police in Saskatchewan are required to provide any detainee with information so that detainee may access that legal advice. Once the police are confronted with detainee who changes his mind and declines legal advice, this waiver must be clear and unequivocal. 3) The evidence falls far short of proving that the respondent was frustrated, impatient probably, but not frustrated. The exchange lasted about minutes. The evidence shows a detainee who chose to neither wait for the telephone line to be available nor to telephone a private lawyer.","The Crown appeals the decision of the learned Provincial Court judge that found the respondent's rights under s. 10(b) of the Charter of Rights and Freedoms had been violated and, in excluding the certificate of analyses, acquitted the respondent. HELD: 1) The trial judge failed to address the issue of whether the respondent required the police in the Saskatchewan jurisdiction, where faced with a detainee that has changed his mind and declined legal advice, to inform that detainee that he has a right to retain counsel and an obligation on the part of the police during this time to refrain from having them participate in any potentially incriminating process until he has had that reasonable opportunity to contact counsel. The respondent's waiver of the right to seek advice from a lawyer was not supported by the evidence. 2) In reviewing the evidence that was before the trial judge, the judge could not have reasonably reached the conclusion he did, and the evidence falls far short of proving that the respondent was frustrated. Impatient, probably, but not frustrated. The evidence shows a detainee who chose to neither wait for the telephone line to be available nor to telephone a private lawyer. The Crown argued that the ratio decidendi in Prosper required Cst. Lerat to provide the respondent with an additional component of information once the respondent, after first asserting his right to counsel, waived that right. 3) The holding-off requirement in R. v. Prosper flows logically from the two implementation duties of s. 7 and s. 9 of the charter. The trial court concluded that the breach of the accused's right to free, preliminary legal advice goes directly to his right against self-incrimination. The receipt of the breathalyzer certificate in this case was a direct result of the breach and because of that it must be kept out, as it would be unfair to proceed with the trial without it going in, given the circumstance. The certificate is excluded."
e_2006skqb534.txt,"The primary issue in this application is the respondent's claim to retroactive support. HELD: 1) The Court reviewed the cases from the Supreme Court of Canada regarding retroactive child support and in particular D.B.S. v. S.R.G. et al, 2006 SCC 37. 2) The respondent has been content to accept $380 per month as fair level of child support for both children. What precipitated the respondent's review in July 2006 was Meghan's departure from his home where she began to live independently with the prospect of attending college. What further propelled the continued action on the respondent's part was the publicity attendant with the Supreme Court of Canada's release of its judgment in July 2006. There is no reasonable excuse as to why the respondent did not seek a variation earlier, other than concluding that the respondent accepted $380 per month as reasonable in the circumstances that prevailed from July 2003 to July 2006. 3) There is no evidence of blameworthy conduct on the petitioner's part. There was no agreement or obligation to disclose tax returns. No written request was made pursuant to s. 25 of the Guidelines. No verbal request was made by the respondent which might fall within the definition of 'effective notice'. The increase in the petitioner's level of income over the years 2002 to 2005 is not so dramatic as to constitute blameworthy conduct that privileges the petitioner's own interests over her children's right to an appropriate amount of support. In 2002, the petitioner earned $32,800 and, by 2005, she earned $43,310. An increase of these proportions would not lead the Court to conclude that the petitioner was not contributing to her children's support in a satisfactory manner. The Court's view of the evidence is that the annual increases equivalent to roughly 10% per annum, when adjusted for the annual rate of inflation, are not so significant that the petitioner would have reasonably thought that she was feathering her own nest at the expense of her children. 4) There was no evidence that the children's standard of living was compromised as a direct consequence of the petitioner not taking the initiative to adjust her child support payments annually. Nor was there evidence of financial hardship experienced by the children. 5) To order retroactive support of $4,322, whether payable in a lump sum or by installments over time, would represent a hardship to a wage earner in the petitioner's category. The application for retroactive child support is dismissed.","The respondent applies to vary the child support orders of the Chief Justice of the Divorce Act and/or the alleged agreement struck by the petitioner and the respondent in or about July 2003. The respondent seeks this variation pursuant to s. 17(1) of thedivorce act and pursuant to the Family Maintenance Act. HELD: 1) The Court does not find that the petitioner's conduct blameworthy. To order retroactive support of $4,322, whether payable in a lump sum or by installments over time, represents a hardship to a wage earner in the petitioner’s category. 2) The respondent has not engaged in blamed conduct. The Court reviewed the circumstances of each child over the span of 3 years and found no such agreement or obligation to disclose. 3) There is no evidence that an agreement was struck. The petitioner and respondent agreed that Meghan should complete her course of studies by the end of February 2007. 4) There was no agreement that the respondent would pay $380 per month as fair level of child support for both children. 5) The petitioner was not required to use tunnel vision when interpreting the evidence. The court reviewed the situation in DBS. 6) The court found that the annual increases equivalent to roughly 10% per annum are not so significant that the mother would have reasonably thought that she was feathering her own nest at the expense of her children. 7) The applicant did not engage in blameness. The annual increases are not such a significant proportion of the child's income. 8) The annual decrease in the number of days the petitioner spent with the children was insignificant. 9) There were no breaches of the 2003 agreement or obligations under the terms of the Agreement. 10) The conduct of the petitioner as payor parent was not a reasonable excuse for inaction.  11) The parties did not reach an agreement on costs. 12) The costs of exercising access to the children were minimal."

The AG agreed the applicant had acted in good faith, but contested whether he was (and would continue to be) unable to pay the debt. Application allowed. Permitting the applicant's family a reasonably frugal lifestyle, which the court found they had, would mean he could not pay off the loan.

e_2009nssc204.txt,"An unrepresented university student appealed his conviction for uttering threats after he sent an email to his computer science professor requesting his assistance to de-bug a program contained in an attachment. The attachment was text file with lot of extra characters, including messages that read 'good job, but am going to kill you' and 'I am so horny.' Although the professor had not taken the content of the attachment as threat, he had sent it on to university officials as he had been requested to alert them to any odd or unusual behaviour by the student. The student later advised the professor that he had typed the messages because he thought someone was monitoring what he was typing and he was trying to get reaction out of them. He also testified that he had not intended to send that particular attachment to the professor. Appeal allowed; conviction quashed. The trial judge erred in permitting inadmissible evidence to be adduced from the university administration to the effect that the accused had a psychiatric illness and, in failing to intervene when the Crown assumed that the student had put his character in issue and cross-examined him as to alleged prior acts of misconduct and other extraneous matters, the cumulative effect of which was fatal to the trial judge's findings of credibility. The case against the student was entirely circumstantial and it was equally open to infer that the words had been typed in the file to get a reaction from people that the student, rationally or otherwise, believed to be monitoring his keystrokes and did not constitute a threat to cause death to the professor.","The appellant was a student at a university when he sent an email to his computer science professor with an attachment. Although the professor did not take the content of the attachment as a threat, he sent it to university officials as he had been requested to alert them to any odd or unusual behaviour by the appellant. The police were contacted and a charge was laid against the appellant of uttering a threat to cause death to the professor. The appellant contended the Crown had not properly explained the sender's intent and that the sender was a computer program. The Crown alleged the sender sent the email to the student in the Math Resource Centre in Nova Scotia and that it was intended to intimidate the student and to get reaction from the student.

e_2009skca40.txt,"This is an appeal from a judgment in which the trial judge held that the sale of farm land by the then 79 year old appellant was valid and that her solicitor in the transaction was not negligent. The appellant widow agreed to sell four quarters of farmland, including residence and some grain bins on the land, to the respondents by lease option agreement. The total price was $120,000. The terms were favourable to the purchasers, the monies being paid over years with most deferred until the final year. There was no interest. However, the appellant was permitted to reside in the house for her lifetime if she paid the utilities and the property taxes. The trial judge noted that the appellant resided on the land for years and there was no complaint made until the appellant's daughter, from whom the contract had been concealed by joint agreement between the appellant and the purchasers, found out what had happened. The sole issue on appeal was the applicable standard of review in H.L. v. Canada (Attorney General) [2005] 1 S.C.R. 401. HELD: Appeal dismissed. 1) There is no doubt that the central facts as found by the trial judge regarding the contract, the competence of the appellant and the relationship with and the conduct of the purchasers was supported by probative evidence. It is impossible for an appeal court to interfere with those findings, even if the Court had wished to. 2) With regard to the allegation of negligence against appellant's lawyer, contrary to what the appellant suggest, an independent meeting is not absolutely necessary for the solicitor to ensure comprehension of the contract. It is of course desirable, but the critical matter is for the solicitor to satisfy himself that the client comprehends the transaction. The trial judge found that the appellant understood all aspects of the contract. The matter of the timing of the private meeting between the appellant and her lawyer is not relevant, given that the appellant after the meeting continued to be prepared to enter into and perform the contract. If she had manifested some unease after she signed the agreement and then met with her lawyer but before the delivery of the contract to the purchasers, other issues and no doubt other evidence would have been considered in determining when the contract became effective in the circumstances. The claims against the appellant's solicitor are without a factual basis.","This was an appeal from a judgment in which the trial judge held that the sale of farm land by the then 79-year-old appellant was valid and that her solicitor in the transaction was not negligent. The appellant sought to set aside the transaction under various heads of contract law including duress, undue influence, unconscionability, equitable fraud and mistake. The trial judge made critical findings of fact, including comprehension and desire to provide benefit to the Clements. These findings were supported by candid admissions at trial. HELD: The appeals were dismissed. 1)The timing of the meeting was irrelevant. It was of no moment in determining the issue of the solicitor's negligence. 2)The central facts on the terms of the contract, the competence of the appellant and the relationship with and conduct of the Clement brothers, were all supported by probative evidence. 3)No case of appeal was made in the circumstances under which the appeal could have been taken. 4)No evidence of undue influence or favouritism was discernible in the meeting place. The central facts were fully comprehended. The Clements brothers had no influence on the appellant. They were fully prepared when she entered the contract for the benefit of their daughter. The timing was irrelevant as the matter had not been decided until after the meeting had concluded.  5)The trial judge was generous in his analysis of the central facts. The issues were clearly not in dispute. 6)The court was unable to interfere with these findings."
e_2010skca79.txt,"The RCMP conducted search of farmland near Canora. They were also shown pictures of the accused who was likely driving white Tempo. The search revealed marijuana grow-op. The accused was later seen by officers driving. The officers chased the Tempo for 41 kms, but the vehicle was driven into the ditch, and the driver escaped on foot. Four years later the accused was arrested in British Columbia and brought to trial. The accused was convicted of three drug offences and two driving offences following a jury trial. He was sentenced to a total of 35 months in prison. The accused appeal both the convictions and the sentence. HELD: The accused argued the convictions were unreasonable and not supported by the evidence. The grounds were: (a) the officer's eye witness identification evidence cannot support a conviction; (b) the trial judge made inappropriate comments about whether the accused could have outrun the officer at the end of the car chase, if he was the driver; (c) an adverse inference should been drawn from the Crown's failure to call the second officer; (d) the trial judge's treatment of the photographs of the accused misled the jury about what had to be proven to establish the accused was driving the Tempo; (e) the jury was improperly lead to place reliance on an assessment of a witness's credibility made by an officer who questioned him about his possible involvement in the grow-op. The Court found: (a) the jury was alerted to the frailties of the officer's identification evidence, and the convictions were not unreasonable in light of the evidence as a whole; (b) it was open to the jury to consider whether the accused could have outrun the officer, and the judge's caution about changes in physical condition over time put the issue into a proper perspective; (c) the judge told the jury that it could draw an adverse inference from the Crown's failure to call the second officer, but the decision lies with the jury and the judge is not obliged to tell the jury that it must draw the inference; (d) when the charge is considered as a whole, the jury was not left with the impression that if it concluded the pictures were of the accused that it somehow followed that he was the driver of the Tempo; (e) the judge's remarks did not improperly influence the jury's assessment of the witness's credibility. The imposed sentences fall within the standard range for similar offences and were not demonstrably unfit.","Following a jury trial, the appellant was convicted of three drug offences and two Criminal Code driving offences. He was sentenced to 35 months in prison. The appellant appealed his convictions and his sentence, arguing that the former were unreasonable and the latter was too severe. HELD: The appeal was dismissed with written reasons.  1) The issues identified by the appellant do not operate to make his convictions unreasonable. The trial judge warned the jury about the dangers of eye witness identification evidence. She underscored that an honest and apparently convincing witness can be mistaken on identification issues. 2) When the charge is considered as a whole, the jury was not in any way left with the impression that, if the appellant could have outrun the Constable, this would suggest that he was the driver of the vehicle. The evidence raised by the trial judge was not so tainted as to warrant an unreasonable sentence. The appeal court was unable to conclude that the appellant's convictions were unreasonable in light of the evidence as whole."
e_2011skqb134.txt,"The accused plead guilty to one count of using credit card data to fraudulently obtain services contrary to s. 342(3) of the Criminal Code, one count of fraud over $5,000 contrary to s. 380(1) of the Criminal Code for defrauding Sasktel of telephone services and one count of fraudulently personating various persons with intent to gain advantage for himself contrary to s. 403(a) of the Criminal Code. The accused was incarcerated at the time that he committed the offences. The accused opened 52 false accounts with Sasktel, at times using names he obtained from obituaries and at other times using fictious names. He then used the accounts to obtain telephone services. The total loss to Sasktel was $25,915.44. The second scheme involved obtaining credit card information from people outside the prison, ordering goods via telephone to be delivered to third party and using the fraudulent credit cards to pay for the items. The total loss to the credit card companies was $22,695.18. The accused was 47 years old and had spent much of the last 30 years in jail. He had 121 prior convictions on his record, mostly for fraud, property related offences and non-compliance with court orders. In addition to the financial losses, huge amount of resources were expended to investigate the accused's activities. He plead guilty. HELD: A fit sentence in global terms for these offences would be 8 years and 6 months. The accused was given credit for 4 years and 9 months for the time he spent in custody. The accused was sentenced to 2 years and 3 months for the s. 342(3) offence, 1 year and 6 months consecutive for the offence under s. 380(1) and 2 years concurrent for the personation offence under s. 403(a). The Court gave the accused double credit for remand time that was the result of system delays, but imposed 1:1 credit for the 393 days of remand time that were attributable to the accused. The Court held that the high dollar value involved, the pre-meditation and planning involved, the lengthy period of time over which the accused committed the offences, the number of transactions involved and the fact that the accused committed these offences from prison were aggravating factors. In mitigation, the accused offered a guilty plea. The primary factors to be emphasized were denunciation and deterrence.","The accused was charged with two counts of fraud. The Crown stayed the counts and imposed a global sentence of eight years and six months. The accused pleaded guilty to three counts. The sentences were both increased. The Court sentenced the accused to two years and three months imprisonment, followed by one year and one year imprisonment. Payment of a surcharge was waived as the accused had no income for some time. HELD: The global sentence was increased to eight years six months and a credit of four years nine months was given for time spent in custody. The offence occurred while the accused was in custody on the subject charges for 2 years and 11 months. It was decided that a fit global sentence would be 8 years and 6 months. In the result, the Court gave the accused a credit for four years and nine months and the global sentence should be reduced accordingly. The discretion to grant the credit remains with me despite s. 719(3) and (4) of the Criminal Code because the offences were committed and the charges brought before enactment of the section. The gravity of the offences was very high because of a number of aggravating circumstances. The offences were motivated by unlawful conduct, a desire to gain advantage for himself or another person, and a disdain for the administration of justice. The two schemes were pursued over a lengthy period of time and involved scores of transactions. There were many individuals and businesses subjected to embarrassment and anxiety. The serious offences were also motivated by real arrogance on the part of the accused and real disdain for government. The defendant pled guilty to one count of fraudulently and without a colour of right, use credit card data that would enable a person to use a credit card or to obtain the services provided by the issuer of a Credit Card to credit card users, contrary to s. 380(1)(a) and s. 342(3). The Court noted that the offences fell within the definition of offences under s.786(3), s.719(4) and ss.718(4). It was also found that the defendant had an incredible criminal record. It is lengthy and continuous, commencing in 1979 and running to the present. There are 121 convictions, 39 being for property offences, 50 being for fraud and several for non-compliance with court orders. The time actually served on remand was 1,336 days. For that period, he should receive a credit worth 4 years and 9 months."
e_2011skqb244.txt,"The appellant was convicted of impaired care and control and acquitted of a charge of care and control with a blood alcohol level exceeding .08 because of Charter violations. The appellant was senior member of the Saskatoon Police Force who was charged by members of his police force. The trial judge based his conviction on the evidence of two officers who testified that they observed signs of impairment including bloodshot, red eyes, flushed face, slurred speech, strong smell of alcohol on his breath and dry lips and mouth. In convicting the accused, the trial judge rejected the evidence of third officer who testified that the only sign of impairment he noted on scene was that the appellant had alcohol on his breath. The issues on appeal were whether the trial judge erred in his treatment of the evidence of the third officer, whether the trial judge erred in considering the observations of the other two officers as evidence to be admitted on the impaired driving count and whether the conviction for impaired driving was an unsafe verdict. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. The trial judge did not ignore or reject the evidence of the third officer. He provided extensive reasons why he preferred the evidence of the other two officers to the evidence of the third officer. The trial judge is in special position to assess the credibility of witnesses by being able to observe the witnesses as they testify and compare their observations to the testimony of the other witnesses. The findings of fact in regard to the testimony of the three police officers are supported by the transcript of their evidence and do not amount to conjecture of speculation. The trial judge made express findings of credibility with respect to the two officers and preferred their evidence to that of the third officer. There is no inherent improbability that would justify interference with the trial judge's findings on credibility. The appellant argued that the officer's evidence that the appellant had slurred speech should have been excluded because the trial judge excluded the actual statements made by the accused as violation of the accused's Charter rights under s. 10(b). Slurred speech is known physical indicator of impairment absent evidence of another cause. While statements made by an accused may not be introduced to prove impairment unless the accused has been advised of his Charter rights, physical manifestation such as slurred speech may be introduced to prove evidence of impairment. The appellant's argument that the verdict is unsafe or unreasonable was also rejected. The trial judge concluded that the Crown had proven beyond a reasonable doubt that there was evidence of impairment sufficient to meet the standard in R. v. Stellato. There was no palpable or overriding error in the verdict.","The appellant appeals his conviction for impaired care and control of a motor vehicle while his blood alcohol content exceeded the legal limit of.08 contrary to s. 253(1)(a) of the Criminal Code. The appellant argued that the trial judge erred in considering evidence that was not admissible on the impaired count, namely that the central Crown witness provided exculpatory evidence. The trial judge rejected the appellant's allegations that he had been drinking, had been in poor health, and smelled of alcohol. He also found that the symptoms of impairment he noted on the appellant were not consistent with the symptoms he noted. Therefore, the appellant was excluded from the appeal. HELD: The appeal is dismissed. 1) The appellant was found not guilty of either charge. 2) Although the appellant had not been informed of the right to self-defence or self-incriminating evidence, his observation of slurred speech while he was detained and prior to being granted the right of counsel was found to be inadmissible. The learned trial judge did not err in law in his treatment of the evidence of the Crown witness. The Crown and the defence were that the Crown had excluded the defence that the defence could not rely on conjecture or speculation as suggested by the appellant. The defence was that the evidence which was excluded could not be used as direct evidence to incriminate the driver. 3) The convictions for impaired driving could never be made unless the degree of impairment was great. There was nothing in the record to indicate there was any inherent improbability or any other basis which would justify interference by an appellate court with the findings of the trial court with respect to the trial results. The evidence as a statement of fact was clearly not admissible. It was inconsistent with the decision and reasoning in Stellato."
e_2011skqb444.txt,"In the evening, the accused inmate and his two co-accused inmates placed themselves in close proximity to the complainant inmate at table at the Penitentiary. The co-accused threw hot liquid from the cup directly into the complainant's face and the three inmates commenced stabbing the complainant with weapon. second complainant inmate attempted to intervene to assist the first complainant and the accused and co-accused began to stab the second complainant. The first complainant suffered severe first and second degree burns to his face and to his shoulders as well as numerous puncture wounds and lacerations but was not critically injured. The accused was charged with aggravated assault on the first complainant and common assault on the second complainant. None of the inmates testified at trial other than the accused. The accused testified that he felt he was being shunned in the Block and had received threats from the first complainant and others in the complainant's group who were brandishing shanks earlier that day. The defence argued that the Crown failed to prove that the injuries caused to the first complainant fell within the definition of 'wound, maim, disfigure or endanger life'; and that the acts done to the first and second complainants were in self-defence as contemplated by s. 34 of the Criminal Code. HELD: The accused was convicted of both counts. 1) In relation to the accused's defence of self-defence pursuant to s. 34(2) pertaining to the first complainant, the Court found the accused did not believe that he was being assaulted within the meaning of the law and, even if he did hold this belief, such a belief was not reasonable in the circumstances. Further, the Court did not accept, on a subjective or objective basis, that the accused reasonably believed that the first complainant had the present ability to carry out the threat, notwithstanding that the physical aspect of the assault need not be imminent or immediate. Lastly, the Court found that the accused did not believe that he had no other option. The accused admitted that he had other options but chose not to avail himself of them. 2) The Court found it did not need to assess the application of s. 37 of the Code in relation to the common assault charge. Rather, the Court found s. 27 of the Code applicable and determined that the second complainant was legally justified to use as much force as was reasonably necessary to prevent the commission of an offence which would be arrestable without warrant. The Court found the second complainant was clothed in legal justification and the accused was not entitled to the protection of s. 34(1) because the accused provoked the assault, and the force he used was more than necessary to defend himself as the accused was armed with a shank and the second complainant was not.","HELD: The accused was charged with aggravated assault and common assault. The Court found that the accused’s actions were done in self-defence. The court found that both the accused and the two alleged victims were inmates at the prison and that their actions were motivated by mutual respect and protection. The three elements of s. 34(2) have been established: 1) the subjective perception of the situation is subjective; 2) the accused reasonably believed that the assault was going to happen; and 3) that he believed on reasonable grounds that it did. The accused had a jacket on which he was sitting when the shot was fired. The Crown had determined that the jacket was the subject of the jacket and that it was easy to connect it to the person wearing the jacket in the video. The principles of 'parties to the offence', 'principal offender' and'secondary offender' were considered to be within s. 265(1)(b) of the Criminal Code. In this case, the Crown established that the injuries were objectively foreseeable by the accused as a result of the assault and that his belief in the existence of an actual assault was objectively reasonable on the basis of what he perceives."
e_2012skpc161.txt,"The accused plead guilty to one count of aggravated assault, a breach of undertaking for failure to keep the peace and be of good behaviour and failing to comply with a condition of a youth sentence by failing to report to his youth worker. The victim came out of his house because he was concerned that someone was trying to damage his vehicle. The victim had baseball bat when he confronted the accused and group of young people. One of the accused's friends was pushed and fell backwards hitting his head. The accused said the victim hit him on the back with the bat. The accused got the bat and hit the victim five times in the head. The accused and another youth also kicked the victim while he was down. After the assault, the accused and his friends fled, leaving the victim in the alley. The victim suffered serious injuries including shattered jaw, every bone in his face was broken, his skull was fractured and he suffered brain bleed and lost teeth. He is also going to lose his eye, has memory loss and had to sell his business because he cannot work. The Crown applied to have the offence declared a serious violent offence and sought a sentence of 24 months, being 16 months secure custody followed by 8 months community supervision. At the time of the offence the accused was 17 years and months of age. He identified as Metis youth, but had no connection to cultural activities and claimed he had not been subjected to racism or poverty. His parents were separated. He was not attending school or working at the time of the offence. He had an extensive criminal record including 17 entries for compliance related convictions, previous property related convictions, for obstructing police offences and one for uttering threats. He had served five open custody sentences. HELD: The offence was declared a serious violent offence. The victim will be significantly and permanently disabled as a result of the offence and there can be no doubt that the accused caused intentional and grievous bodily harm to the victim. The court held that the egregious nature of the assault, serious harm done to the victim and the fact that the youth was subject to release conditions with respect to a weapons offence at the time he committed the assault were aggravating factors. In mitigation, the accused had entered a guilty plea, was cooperative with the police investigation, had done well in pre-sentence detention and had expressed remorse for his actions by submitting an apology letter to the court. The accused was sentenced to 24 months secure custody followed by 18 months probation. He was given 2:1 credit for the time he was on remand, leaving 18 months custody of closed custody to serve of which 12 months would be actual custody and 6 months would be community supervision. The court held that a lengthy custodial sentence was necessary to provide meaningful consequences and to achieve meaningful progress for the accused. A period of secure custody and supervision would give the accused access to psychological counselling and programming, an opportunity to work on his education and a chance to engage with support services in the community prior to release from custody. Given the accused's violent response in this case, it was clear that intensive programming is required.","The accused pleaded guilty to aggravated assault thereby endangering the life of a Metis youth contrary to s. 268(1) of the Criminal Code and failing to comply with a condition of a youth sentence that he report to his youth worker, contrary to ss. 137 of the Youth Criminal Justice Act. The Crown applied under s. 42(9) for a determination that the aggravated assault be designated as a serious violent offence. The accused was sentenced to a secure custodial sentence of 24 months to be followed by a period of probation with credit for pre-sentence detention, 6 months of community supervision and 6 months community supervision. On the offences of breach of undertaking (including a weapons offence) and breach of probation (including breaching a promise to provide a DNA sample and a weapons prohibition), the sentence was increased to a total of 40 months, followed by 12 months of custody and community supervision (which would total 24 months). The accused will be permanently disabled by the time he is sentenced. The offence was committed in a secure facility and the accused did not oppose the Crown's application. HELD: The accused is sentenced to 24 months custody followed by 6 months probation. The sentence is an appropriate sentence for an aggravated assault that is consistent with the principles set out in s. 38 of the YCJA. The Court found that the young person had extreme and violent offending and it was important that he be put on probation. As well, the accused had a record of convictions for offences of assault, including aggravated assault contrary to S. 42 of the Code. The young person did not object to the Crown’s application. The court designated the offence a grave violent offence pursuant to s42(9). A period of custody was necessary to provide meaningful consequences and to achieve meaningful progress for the accused."

HELD: The action was stayed pending arbitration. The plaintiff's statement of claim does not rely on the 2000 merger agreement, the claim is based solely on the new partnership agreement and alleges breaches of the partnership agreement. The partnership agreement clearly states that disputes are to be resolved through arbitration.","FIAT: The defendant seeks a stay of the action pursuant to s. 8 of The Arbitration Act, 1992. The plaintiff was a chartered accountant. He joined the partnership of MNP and became subject to the partnership agreement until June 1, 1999. In 1999, MNP gave notice to the plaintiff that his partnership arrangement would be terminated effective September 30, 2009. In May 2011, the plaintiff's solicitor sent a letter to the C.E.O., the predecessor to MNP, requesting his dispute with Meyers Norris Penny LLP to be referred to arbitration. In November 2011 the plaintiff commenced claim against MNP. Relevant portions of the claim are: 6. Effective September 1, 2000, Laidlaw was admitted as a principal partner of the MNP company subject to terms and conditions of the Partnership Agreement. The merger agreement provided the courts of Saskatchewan would have exclusive jurisdiction to determine all disputes and claims arising between the parties. The MNP partnership agreement provided for the creation of a new arbitration clause which would replace all prior agreements entered into between the Parties and replace all existing Agreements.

HELD: The action is stayed pursuant to ss. 8(1)(b) and s. 24.1 of the Arbitration act.  1) The Court shall stay the action pending the commencement of the arbitration proceeding.  2) The arbitration clause is in direct conflict with the choice of law and method of resolution contained in the merger agreement.

e_2013skca1.txt,"The proposed appellants are some of the defendants in an action commenced by Schneider against them on the grounds that he, as representative plaintiff, and others suffered financial losses due to negligence on the part of McMillan. The representative plaintiff and other investors purchased 'cells' in gold exploration prospect owned and promoted by Royal Crown Gold Reserve Inc. based on that defendant's representation that the purchase price was deductible from the purchaser's earned income for income tax purposes and the tax opinions provided by McMillan. McMillan's opinion letters were posted on Royal Crown's website. The representative plaintiff purchased the cells and then filed tax returns claiming deduction, which was disallowed by the Canada Revenue Agency. The representative plaintiff commenced this action claiming that he and others suffered financial losses due to McMillan's negligence. McMillan applied to strike the statement of claim on the grounds that it was devoid of merit pursuant to Queen's Bench Rule 173(c) and opposed the certification of the action on the basis that the relationship between them and the representative plaintiff was insufficient to found a recognized duty of care between a lawyer and a non-client. Their application was supported by affidavits indicating that their tax opinions were not to be given to prospective investors. The plaintiff filed an affidavit from another lawyer, who deposed that when he prepared such opinion letters regarding tax consequences he reviewed all the underlying documents and agreements beforehand to protect the reputation of his law firm, knowing that the opinions were often relied upon as marketing tool to potential investors. The Chambers judge dismissed McMillan's application and it brought this application for leave to appeal under s. 8 of The Court of Appeal Act except as provided by s. 39(3) of The Class Actions Act. HELD: The Court dismissed the applications. It held that the Chambers judge was correct in holding that the action was not devoid of merit or vexatious. The judge had reviewed the affidavits and concluded that a lawyer may owe a duty of care to a non-client in specific circumstances, including those of this case. McMillan should have been aware of the use made by the mining industry of opinion letters and taken steps to prevent their opinion being used inappropriately for the purpose of inducing potential investors to invest with their client. The Court also found that the Chambers judge did not err in certifying the claim of negligence as a common issue that predominated over other issues affecting individual members of a class. McMillan's argument that the factual base pled by the representative plaintiff did not establish a common issue to meet the requirements of s. 6(1)(c) of The Class Actions Act failed because, in this case, the class members suffered real losses allegedly as a result of McMillan's negligence. These facts coupled with the case law stating that a lawyer may owe a duty of care to a non-client and the plaintiff's affiant's evidence, established a common issue that met the requirements of the Act.","HELD: The application was dismissed. The chambers judge dismissed the application and certified the action as a class action against all defendants. The proposed appellants applied pursuant to s. 8 of The Court of Appeal Act, 2000 for an order granting them leave to appeal from the chambers judge's certification order and his dismissal of their Rule 173(c) application. They argued that the Chambers judge erred in law in failing to apply the Ann's test, by conflating foreseeability with proximity, in the first leg of the test, and by failing to consider and apply the policy considerations which may preclude or negate the finding of duty of care under the second leg of that test. They also raised the following grounds: 1) the Chambers lawyer did not apply the test in Re: Collections Inc. v. Toronto Dominion Bank when there was no conflict between the affidavits of the Messrs. Friedman and Scott as to what had transpired between them and the plaintiff; 2) the lawyer should have taken appropriate steps to guard against opinion letters being inappropriately used for the purpose of inducing potential investors to invest with the client; and 3) there was a common issue affecting the manner in which opinion letters are filed on the plaintiff's website and are accessible to potential investors. The Chambers judge did however err in relying upon the lawyer's affidavit on the basis that it was not an issue of sufficient merit to warrant consideration at this time; and 4) the judge did not properly apply the standard of care in the Anns test or consider policy reasons that may prevent the imposition of duty on them, are essentially aspects of their defence and not reasons to strike the negligence claim at this juncture. All of the issues raised by the applicants were those of common law, common sense, and fact-based issues, which warrant consideration. The court cannot be said to have erred by not taking these factors into account when dealing with the Rule173(c). The proposed appeal was prima facie destined to fail."
e_2013skqb264.txt,"The parties had three children during their marriage. After the marriage ended in 1988, the husband respondent, medical specialist, moved from Moose Jaw to Ontario where his annual income was about $175,000. The children stayed with the petitioner wife in Moose Jaw. She was not able to work as registered nurse until she upgraded her education, which she slowly did as she could afford it. She and the children lived on very little income and relied upon social assistance because the respondent often did not pay child support. The parties were regularly in court. In 1994, the respondent left his position in Ontario and moved to Milwaukee, believing his prospects were better in the U.S. However, he lost his position in Milwaukee and opened his own clinic. His income dropped to as little as $15,000 in 2001. In this application, the respondent applied to vary two support orders, one made in 1998 and the other issued in 2001. He sought to expunge the arrears in respect of each and a declaration that the three children are no longer children of the marriage. His reason for seeking to have the arrears expunged was because he, now 72, wanted to retire in the next couple of years. The petitioner, 63, deeply in debt and on long-term disability, was still caring for one of their children because he suffers from schizophrenia. HELD: The Court held that two of the children had ceased to be children of the marriage as of 2002 and 2008 respectively. With respect to the third child, the Court found that as a result of the serious and long-term mental health problems suffered by him, he remained a child of the marriage. The Court then found that the respondent's arrears in respect of the 1998 child support order were $7,000. Based upon the respondent's imputed income of $109,000 per year established by the Court in its 2001 order, and the dates upon which the two children ceased to be so under the Divorce Act, the Court calculated the amount of child support owed by the respondent at $186,300. The Court rejected the respondent's argument that he could not afford to pay the arrears because his expenses left him with an income surplus of only $13,000. The Court discounted most of the claimed expenses and found that the respondent had $58,000 at his disposal and therefore had the ability to pay his arrears. The Court found that the respondent had chosen to minimize his earning capacity by staying in the U.S. in private practice and thus the respondent could not assert that the Court should use his actual income rather than his imputed income to vary the amount of child support he was ordered to pay in 2001. The undue hardship that the petitioner had suffered for 25 years constituted the most compelling reason for the Court to refuse to reduce or expunge the respondent's arrears. The application was dismissed and the respondent ordered to pay arrears and to pay child support in the amount of $927.","FIAT: The respondent seeks to expunge child support arrears that have accumulated as a result of his not paying child support for many years. He is 72 years old and practising internal medicine in the United States. The petitioner is disabled and the father is looking to retire in the next few years. HELD: 1) The respondent will have a few lean years until he has paid off the arrear. But not an undue hardship. Almost every dollar that was applied to child support was taken from the petitioner by garnishment process or the interception of federal government monies directed to him. He should receive the full amount that, but for his dodging his obligations, would have been available to him when she was raising their children.  2) The arsars owed by the respondent are fixed at $183,746. 3) The petitioner has always been a child of the marriage. The respondent did not have the ability to pay the child support at the time that they were incurred. He did not take employment that paid him at least $110,000 a year. He knew that he was expected to maximize his earning capacity but simply chose not to. The Court calculated the arreaars based on his income over the years. 4) The Court found that the respondent had not shown that he could afford to pay child support on a current income of $109,912. 5) The court found that it was impossible for the respondent to have the financial capacity to pay these arreages. The arrearns had mounted considerably over the past 25 years. The court valued the respondent's income at $111,000. 6) It was not appropriate to reduce child support in the circumstances."

The accused’s conduct over the past 18 months satisfied the court on the balance of probabilities that hers was an exceptional case and that a curative discharge would not be contrary to the public interest. The court imposed numerous conditions on her, including that she could not have or consume alcohol and should report to a probation officer, receive addiction counselling, participate in AA meetings and provide proof of her attendance to her probation officer. Her driver’s license was cancelled and she was prohibited from driving for two years.","The accused entered guilty plea to one count of driving a motor vehicle while her blood alcohol content was over 80 milligrams of alcohol in 100 millilitres of blood and asked to be granted a curative discharge pursuant to s. 255(5) of the Criminal Code. HELD: The Court found that the accused was in need of treatment to deal with her alcohol consumption and addiction. She had two prior convictions for drinking and driving and had been through the Impaired Driver Treatment Centre in 2010 and 2006. The Court noted that given the accused's prior record, her abstinence from alcohol was closely related to the connections that she had established in the treatment community. The accused had been prohibited from driving in any street, road, highway or other public place for two years. Based on the evidence, the Court concluded that she was the exceptional case in this regard and that a curatorial discharge would not be contrary to the public interest."
e_2017skqb219.txt,"HELD: The court found the following with respect to each issue: 1) the grandmother was a person of sufficient interest regarding the children pursuant to s. 6 of The Children’s Law Act, 1997 and had standing to bring her application for custody; 2) it would be in the best interests of the children, now aged ten and nine years of age, to have their primary residence with their grandmother as she was their psychological parent. They had resided with their grandmother for most of their lives and it was important to maintain their relationships with their school and friends. The respondent would have regular weekly parenting time with the children; and 3) the evidence was inadequate to consider child support.","The third party in this matter is the maternal grandmother of the two children. The grandmother argues she is person of sufficient interest with respect to the children and that the father should have joint custody with the children but her home should be the children's primary residence. The father seeks an order that he have custody of the children. HELD: 1) There is an interim order designating the grandmother as a personof sufficient interest on an interim basis. This designation was made pursuant to s. 6 of The Children’s Law Act, 1997 and is equally applicable when a family member pursues custody. 2) It is clear there were concerns regarding the father”s use of alcohol and drugs. However, the grandmother testified that she had always been his primary caregiver. She also alleged that alcohol consumption was a factor in his care. 3) The father was granted supervised access to the two boys. He was granted access on two weekends per week. 4) The grandmother was granted sole custody with access granted to the parties” except for supervised access on the fourth weekend. 5) The parties’ eldest son, who was the biological son of the grandmother, was granted one-half of the day-to-day access with the other two boys and was to have regular access on alternate weekends. The mother and father had separated in 2014 and the father had been granted access only sporadically. 6) There was no difficulty determining that the grandmother was a person with sufficient interest in the children given the three-stage analysis and the designation of her was made under s.6 of the Act. The designation of the person of adequate interest on a two-stage basis does not bind the court when considering whether or not to grant person of greater interest status to a non-family applicant. The Court reviewed the various documents filed and the evidence before it and concluded that it would be in the best interests of all children to move from the primary care of the father to his primary care. 7) The Court found that it was not necessary for the father in this case to return to work as he had met all of the evidence at trial and had reviewed the options available to him. The provision of an order providing the father with reasonable and liberal access was not sufficient to determine whether the grandmother is a person of enough interest in these matters. 8) The evidence before the Court was sufficient to establish that the grandparents were persons of sufficient interests in this regard. 9) The proper focus of an inquiry in relation to the “sufficient interest”"
