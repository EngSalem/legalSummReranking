The appellant sought declaratory relief or relief under s. 24(1) of the Charter. Dismissing the appeal that (1) the Charter has no application to this self-regulating body; (2) the panel was properly constituted in accordance with the respondent's by-laws; (3) the panel acted within its jurisdiction; (4) there was no evidence of bad faith on the part of the panel members; (5) the panel complied with the rules of natural justice, and (6) the trial judge, in refusing to grant certiorari, made no errors in so concluding.","The appellant sought relief in the nature of certiorari, attacking the constitution and jurisdiction of the board and claiming it had failed to observe the rules of natural justice. He also alleged nine errors of law in his notice of appeal. Dismissing the appeal, that the appellant did not contend that sections 7 and 11 of the Charter create any new rights, but rather seeks the remedies available under s. 24(1) of The Charter. HELD: Appeal dismissed. 1)There was no error of law on the appellant's part in finding that the Charter has no application in the present case. 2)The appellant's application was dismissed. 3)The respondent was found not guilty."
1991canlii4504.txt,"The defendants applied to exclude the plaintiff grandchildren of the deceased from their respective discovery examinations in connection with an action under the Fatal Injuries Act. Dismissing the application, that there was insufficient evidence to indicate there would be a violation of an essential of justice if the parties were excluded from hearing each other's testimony. The only evidence before the court was that the lines of questioning of each grandchild would be identical. This was insufficient to displace a party's inherent right to attend his co-party's discovery.","The plaintiffs brought an application for exclusion of the grandchildren of the deceased. The deceased had died as a result of a motor vehicle accident. The action was continued pursuant to the provisions of s. 163 of the Revised Statutes of Nova Scotia, 1989, the Fatal Injuries Act. The plaintiffs made various claims including special damages and general damages under different heads. The applicant had not asked for exclusion. HELD: The application was granted. 1)There was no evidence to suggest that there would be a violation of an essential of justice if the grandchildren were not excluded from hearing the evidence of each other. 2)The plaintiff had not shown cause to exclude the grandchildren from their discovery examinations. 3)The evidence did not suggest that the plaintiffs would be prejudiced in the preparation of his defence or in the hearing of any testimony of another witness as the judge considers necessary for the orderly conduct of the proceeding and for reaching just conclusion."""
1993canlii3448.txt,"The applicant sought an order for certiorari quashing a decision of the trial judge granting an adjournment and a prohibition from hearing the trial. In earlier hearings, the Crown and applicant had each sought new trial dates to ensure procurement of witnesses for trial. The Crown sought to subpoena the victim to testify. Due to the delay in obtaining authority to serve an out of town subpoena in New Brunswick, the Crown was unable to serve the victim until three days before trial. The victim did not learn of the trial date until the day before and was unable to attend. An adjournment was granted. The applicant contended the trial judge had exceeded his jurisdiction. Dismissing the application. It is within the jurisdiction of the trial judge to deal with the issue of adjournments in accordance with the provisions of the Criminal Code. Jurisdictional error is not to be equated with error of law. Any decision to grant an adjournment is therefore within the court's proper discretion. If a remedy exists, it is by way of an appeal and not a prerogative writ. In any event, the sequence of events was sufficient to justify the granting of an adjournment. There was neither neglect nor laches on the part of the Crown.","The applicant sought an order of prohibition and certiorari directing that judge Archibald and any other provincial court judge cannot hear the trial of the Queen v. Joseph Glenn Jessome on the basis that the adjournment complained of was an error of law in exercising that discretion. Dismissing the application, that the decision as to whether or not to grant an adjournment was within the jurisdiction of the judge and that any decision in that regard was an exercise of his discretion within that authority."

Prior to being sentenced, he spent 13 days on remand and 2 months under house arrest under s.7.1 of the Young Offenders Act. The Crown appealed the sentence. HELD: Appeal allowed. 1)The accused was 15 years of age and had no record. He assisted the police once apprehended. 2)Although another young offender involved in these offences had received a sentence of 9 months open custody, uniformity of sentence was not a factor to be given great weight in comparing dispositions of young offenders. 3)The sentence was increased to 10 months open custody.","The Crown appeals the disposition arguing it is not fit having regard for the number of offences and the need to maintain the public's confidence in the administration of justice. HELD: Appeal allowed. 1)In addition to the large number of theft offences, the defendant used a stolen vehicle in high speed chase with the police resulting in extensive damage to the vehicle. The defendant pled guilty to 16 counts of auto theft, 1 count of possession of stolen auto and one count of dangerous driving. He spent 13 days on remand and approximately two months under strict parental control under s. 7.1 of the Young Offenders Act prior to receiving a disposition of six months' open custody and two years' probation on September 7, 1994. 2)The defendant's principal partner in these auto thefts was [T.D.] who received eight months open custody for some 19 auto thefts and attempts.

1994canlii4214.txt,"The plaintiff purchased aircraft parts from the American defendant. The plane crashed in Nova Scotia and the plaintiff, claiming negligence by the defendants in the manufacture of the parts, commenced an action in Nova Scotia. The defendants applied to declare Nova Scotia forum non conveniens. Dismissing the application, that there is a real and substantial connection to both jurisdictions and the plaintiff's forum choice appeared reasonable and should not be disturbed.","The plaintiff's primary cause of action was his loss arising from what he was was negligence in the manufacture and inspection of the aircraft parts. The defendant was in the business of manufacturing and selling aircraft parts in Wisconsin, U.S.A. The plaintiff had purchased aircraft parts from the defendant, such parts being parts being Piper PA-11 fuselage. The aircraft crashed in August 1992 and the plaintiff alleges the crash was due to faulty and substandard materials used by the defendant in manufacture or construction of the package. The defendants applied to have the action set aside as this Court has no jurisdiction, or to have it stayed on the basis of forum non conveniens. HELD: The application was dismissed. 1)There was a real and substantial connection in this case to both jurisdictions. 2)The defendant's primary causes of action revolved around the plaintiff's loss arising out of what was his negligence in making and inspecting the aircraft's parts. That places some of the evidentiary situs of the action in Wisconsin or more generally, in the United States. 3)The plaintiff had chosen Nova Scotia as his forum. He had chosen it with recognition of the extreme costs he may face in attempting to obtain the evidence in Wisconsin and elsewhere in the USA to substantiate his allegations and to import that evidence to Nova Scotia. In doing so, he had not apparently indulged in forum shopping."

HELD: The appeal was dismissed with costs. 1)There was clearly no basis for adding the value of the grain on hand to the income of the respondent. There was no indication of any underhanded or inappropriate action on the part of the respondent and the grain was to be viewed as part of his gross income in the year in which it was sold. 2)There was no reversible error by the chamber judge in accepting the respondent's agreement to include 20 percent of his capital cost allowance as part of his income.

HELD: The appeal was dismissed with the usual costs on double Column V. There was no reversible error in the acceptance of the figure by the chambers judge in this instance. [1] There was clearly no basis for adding the value of unsold grain on hand and 100 percent of his capital cost allowance. There is no indication of any underhanded or inappropriate action on the part of the respondent and this grain is therefore to be viewed as part of his gross income in the year in which it is sold. [2] The respondent agreed to include 20 percent of the trial judge who recognized that commercial realities require the replacement of farm equipment. What, if any, portion of the capital costs allowance should be added to establish available income must be based on the facts of each case and we see no reversible errors in the acceptance of this figure."
1998canlii13707.txt,"FIAT. The applicant hotel was charged with five breaches of s.112(1)of the Alcohol and Gaming Act for failing to demand proof of age from minors. The hotel was convicted on one charge and the remaining charges were held in abeyance pending its appeal. The hotel sought an order staying the hearing scheduled by the Commission to review a decision of the Authority suspending the applicant's tavern permit for three days, pending disposal of the criminal charges. Grounds for a stay were that the Commission's hearing would prejudice its defence on the criminal charges because it will be necessary to call similar defence evidence with respect to each proceeding; secondly, it would be manifestly unfair to have a decision for a potential penalty imposed by the Commission which may be contradictory to a finding of fact and a determination of guilt on the same facts and information before the Provicial Court. HELD: The application was dismissed with costs. 1)The second ground raised a substantive issue and in any event was effectively disposed of by R. v. Wigglesworth. There was nothing inconsistent with the Commission considering a form of disqualification of the applicant's license or permit, while the state exercises its criminal law power with respect to the same set of facts. 2)The applicant failed to show any prejudice to its criminal defence. The disclosure of any defence in the Commission hearing will not result in any new facts that were not already known to the Crown.","FIAT. The applicant sought an order staying the hearing scheduled for November 19, 1998 to review a decision of the respondent Authority to suspend the applicant's 'tavern permit' for a period of 3 days, until criminal charges arising out of the same facts were disposed of. HELD: The application was dismissed with costs. 1)There was no obvious prejudice to the applicant in allowing the Commission's hearing to proceed, and certainly none was attested to. The disclosure of any defence in the Commission hearing was not opposed to a procedural one and in any event was effectively effectively disposed of by R. v. Wigglesworth. 2)The respondent Authority and Commission have statutory jurisdiction to administer the Alcohol and Gaming Regulation Act, and the powers of the Commission are restricted to dealing with licenses or permits, to the exclusion of any other type of penalty.

1999canlii12687.txt,"The accused was charged with three offences under the Narcotic Control Act. The accused contests the admissibility of marijuana plants seized by the police. A police officer on highway patrol approaching the Manitoba border noticed a rental van with Ontario license plates stopped on the road. The police officer stated he had no reason to believe an offence had been committed and he approached the accused to see if he required any assistance. The officer stated it was his practice to offer assistance to motorists. The officer asked the accused if there were any problems with the vehicle and the accused answered he was looking for a place to relieve himself. The officer asked him where he was going and was told BC. He then asked the accused what he had in the back of the van and was told two cases of wine. The officer testified the accused was no longer free to go as he had believed the accused committed an offence under the Alcohol and Gaming Regulation Act. The officer searched the vehicle without a warrant and discovered 524 marijuana plants ranging in size from three to nine inches. HELD: The evidence is excluded. The police officer when he pulled up to the van was not in investigative mode but pulled up to see if he could offer assistance. The officer had no reason to suspect the accused was involved in a crime. When he asked what was in the back of the van the officer was fishing to see what answer he got. The Court is satisfied by the cases of Mellenthin, Young and Simpson, that if a person who has been detained cannot be asked what is in their gym bag or their pocket, how can a citizen who is not detained be asked a similar question. The s.8 right against unreasonable search and seizure involves balancing the citizen's reasonable expectation of privacy against the states interest in law enforcement. The police officer's question as to what was in the back of the van was unrelated to the purpose for which he had engaged the accused in conversation. The fact is the officer was attempting to determine what was in the back of the van and searching to see what answer he would get. The Court is satisfied the warrantless search began when the police officer asked the accused what was in the back of the van. The onus of a warrantless search is on the crown which has not established the search was authorized by law. The accused's right to unreasonable search and seizure was violated. The evidence was conscriptive in that the accused was compelled to participate in the discovery of the evidence as a result of the unreasonable search which began when the officer asked what was in the back of the van. The result is the admission of the marijuana into evidence would render the trial unfair and bring the administration of justice into disrepute unless the crown establishes that the evidence would likely have been discovered in any event. The crown suggested no basis upon which the evidence would likely have been discovered in any event.","A voir dire was conducted to determine the admissibility of marijuana plants seized by a police officer as a result of a warrantless search. The officer observed a rental van stopped on a grid road near a tourist information booth and approached the driver. The driver asked if there were any problems with the vehicle and the officer advised him of his right to call lawyer. At this point the accused said he did not require a warrant as he felt that he had no reason to believe an offence had been committed and that by asking the question 'what is in the back of the van?' the officer had reasonable and probable grounds to believe that the accused had consented to the search. HELD: The accused was found not guilty of all charges. 1) There was an arbitrary detention contrary to s. 10(b) of the Charter; 2) The conversation between the accused and the police officer was admissible under common law principles as part of the Crown's case that there was reasonable, probable, and probable cause for a search. Once the accused was detained, nor any search commenced, the officer was fishing to see what answer he got. The question had nothing to do with determining whether the accused required any assistance. The search was unreasonable as it was not authorized by law; 3) There were no exigent circumstances in which the search could have resulted in the arrest of the accused; and 4) The search itself began when the officer turned the roadside encounter into a general inquisition to satisfy his curiosity as to what was in the van. Once he had arrested someone he could perform a search incidental to the arrest."
2000skca99.txt,"See also 150 SaskR 185.In 1998 the Court of Appeal dismissed the applicant's sentence appeal and appeal of his 1997 convictions which consisted primarily of sexual offences involving family members and others. The sentence of imprisonment was increased from 5 to 10 years. The applicant, on advice of two counsel, did not initially seek leave to appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada. He changed his mind 2 years later and sought an extension of time to apply for leave and for leave to appeal. The applicant brought an application for release from custody pending the SCC's decision. HELD: The application was dismissed without prejudice to reapply should leave to appeal be granted. 1)The application was premature. The application pending before the SCC was likely to be determined within 3 to 4 months. The Court of Appeal was not satisfied the appeal as a whole was not frivolous having regard for the requirements of s.679(3)(a) and (c). Some grounds for appeal would clearly fail such as the ground the Court of Appeal erred in failing to give reasons for its judgment. The new grounds of appeal were difficult to assess on the basis of the incomplete material before the court. 2)His continued detention was necessary in the public interest having regard for the whole of the circumstances. His release would undermine public confidence in the administration of justice.","The applicant was convicted of several sexual offences, consisting in the main of sexual offences involving members of his family and others close to him. He appealed his convictions and the Crown appealed against his sentence. In 1998 this Court dismissed his appeal against his conviction and allowed the Crown's appeal, increasing the sentence from 5 to 10 years. In the meantime the applicant wanted to be released from custody. HELD: The application for release was premature. The Court of Appeal erred in failing to give reasons for its judgment. The new grounds of appeal were difficult to assess in their entirety, given the material before me. On the basis of that material, which is incomplete, I am not convinced the grounds relied upon have sufficient merit to satisfy the requirements of clause (a) of the section. Moreover, the prospective appeal as a whole is not frivolous and that the applicant's continued detention for the time being is not necessary in the public interest. The present release of the applicant would be inimical to the general public interest, having regard for the whole of the circumstances, and would tend to undermine public confidence in the administration of justice given the history of the past proceedings, the current state of the present proceedings and the prospect, as a purely practical matter, in the absence of leave to appeal on one or two of the comparatively stronger grounds."
2001skqb148.txt,"FIAT. The infant complainants, who alleged sexual assault and other offences, failed to identify the plaintiff, a former police officer, and a stay of proceedings was entered in 1993.  The plaintiff commenced an action in 1994 for malicious prosecution, negligence, conspiracy and breach of Charter rights and claimed general, specific, punitive and aggravated damages, interest and costs.  Two motions to dismiss the plaintiff's claim were brought under Queen's Bench Rules 173(a) and 188, plus Rule 173(e) in the motion brought by the two chiefs of police. The plaintiff sought several orders in a third motion, two of which were granted summarily; one was adjourned sine die. The applicants submitted the action should be struck, except for claims based on malice, because it was not commenced within the time prescribed by the Public Officers' Protection Act (POPA). Referring to the 2 year and 6 year limitation periods prescribed by s.3(1)(d) and (j) of the Limitations of Actions Act (LAA), the applicants argued a retroactive order for further time was prohibited because a second limitation period had expired. The substantive issues were whether the plaintiff's claim was barred by statutory limitation periods; whether any limitation period should be extended nunc pro tunc; whether a portion of the plaintiff's claim failed to disclose a cause of action against five of the defendants because there was no allegation of malice; whether the plaintiff's claim in tort against the Government of Saskatchewan was barred by statute. HELD: 1)The time to bring the action was extended to September 10, 1994, retroactive to September 8, 1994. The applications to have the action dismissed as having been commenced beyond the statutory limitation period were dismissed. Whether the limitation period was extended was best determined at trial. It was not certain the limitation period was not extended as the statement of claim alluded to subsequent conduct by some defendants. As a general rule, the statutory limitation period created by s.2(1)(a) of the POPA commences to run when a stay of proceedings is entered pursuant to s.579 of the Criminal Code. Although a stay has been entered, actionable conduct of a public officer may continue. The only limitation period applicable in this case is s.2(1) of the POPA. Limitation periods are substantive in character, as opposed to procedural. The LAA does not supersede or replace s.2 of the POPA. The intent and purpose of the LAA is to avoid conflict with other legislation by removing its application from situations specifically dealt with by other legislation. The limitation in the POPA is not necessarily absolute. 2)The application by the chiefs of police to strike the claim in negligence was dismissed. The position in Beckstead v. Ottawa and Reynen v. Canada was adopted. The immunity in s.10 of the Police Act does not extend protection to police officers in general. 3)The claim in negligence against the other defendants was struck without prejudice to amend pleadings. The pleadings as to the Crown Attorneys were struck. They could not be saved, absent an allegation of moral turpitude implicit in malice, bad faith or improper purpose. 4)The Government's application was granted in part, such that all the claims were dismissed except those alleging conspiracy and Charter breaches. The Crown does not enjoy absolute immunity and must bring itself within s.5(6)(a) or (b) of the Proceedings Against the Crown Act which will depend on the particular facts. Immunity does exist for malicious prosecution and negligence. If the decision to prosecute is protected, then the conduct in carrying out the decision should be afforded the same protection. A claim for negligence could not be maintained against the government as employer where it was struck against the Crown Attorneys. Leave to amend pleadings was not entertained as the plaintiff failed to give advance notice.  5)The two applications based on Rule 188 providing for a determination of a point of law were dismissed as there was a factual component. An order should not be granted under Rule 188 in the absence of an agreed statement of fact. 6)The plaintiff demonstrated a prima facie cause of action; provided a reasonable explanation for the delay given the circumstances and his emotional and mental state at the time; and no prejudice will flow to the defendants as they had all actively participated in the litigation from the outset. The only reasonable course was to grant a retroactive order given the time, effort and money already expended. It was not appropriate to require the action be commenced anew.  7)No costs.","FIAT. Three motions were brought. The first motion sought an order pursuant to Queen's Bench Rule 173(a) and 188 that the plaintiff's claim be struck because it was not commenced within the time limit prescribed by the Public Officers' Protection Act. The second motion sought to have the action dismissed. HELD: 1) The plaintiff had a prima facie case. He knew then that the limitation period was extended. 2) Even though the applications are grounded in a limitation period, there still is a factual component and absent an agreed statement of facts there should not be an order granted under Rule 188. 3) The appeal is allowed with costs under double Column V, and the other below is set aside. 4) The claim is not restricted to events prior to the entry of the stay of proceedings by the Crown. The cause of action has fully accrued and the appellant had a case. The limitation period is extended by a year. 5) The application for an order extending limitation period nunc pro tunc is dismissed. 6) The remaining substantive issues which need to be determined can be determined by the Court of Appeal."
2003skqb487.txt,"At issue was the interim custody of the child and child support. HELD: Interim custody was given to the petitioner with access to the respondent. The respondent was ordered to pay interim child support in the amount of $193 per month. On an interim custody application, the Court must take into account the status quo.","At issue on this application is the interim custody of the child of the petitioner and the respondent. The parties began to cohabit in May 1998. In May 1999, the parties would'switch' the child every second day and that after that the respondent had access every weekend until November 2002 when the petitioner ended access. Since that time, the child has resided with the respondent with access and visitation arrangements to the petitioner. The respondent wishes to change the status quo on an interim basis to have the child reside with him every second weekend. Notwithstanding the instances of suspended access, the arrangements for access appear to be in the petitioner's best interests. There is plenty of affidavit evidence to support this: (a) the petitioner admits that “in general, Ryan loves Keanna” and has exercised access to her on fairly regular basis; (b) the respondent has been willing to make arrangements in the past; (c) Efforts have been made by the respondent to make the child feel comfortable, happy while at his home; and (d) evidence that the child expresses content and joy with the mother and his family. The petitioner herself admits that the parties had an arrangement from the outset whereby the respondent would see Keanna every second Friday and every third weekend. Although there is conflicting affidavit evidence with regard to the date of the cessation of access, it is somewhere in the period between October of 1999 and April of 2000 when the respondent ended access; (e) the quality of the relationship between the parties and any other person who may have close connection with the child; (f) the personality, character and emotional needs of the children; (g) the ability of the person who is seeking custody to act as a legal custodian of them; (h) the willingness and acceptance of the parties’ current living arrangements; (i) the current caregiver suitable role model and able to meet the child’s needs; (ii) the fact that the petitioner has been paying interim child support in the amount of $193 per month commencing on December 1, 2003 and a like amount on the first day of each month thereafter until further order; (iii) the surplus of affidavits and their family members and relatives satisfy me that both parties are loving parents to their child. The mutual love and acceptance demonstrated by the families and relatives of each party, along with the overall concern for the best interests of their child, is self-evident and commendable. The purpose of an interim custody order is to give person the right and duty"
2004skca100.txt,"The Superintendent of Pensions seeks leave to appeal an order staying six separate proceedings brought by him in purported exercise of powers conferred on him by s. 8 of The Pension Benefits Act, 1992. HELD: The application was dismissed. It was clear that the judge's finding was for procedural purposes only and was not intended to be definitive. The judge left it open to the Superintendent to proceed with his applications when the McMaster action was finished and that her decision respecting his powers was open to review upon further evidence being adduced.","The Superintendent of Pensions sought leave to appeal an order staying six separate proceedings brought by him in purported exercise of powers conferred on him by s.8 of The Pension Benefits Act. The subject matter of the action and the Superintendent's applications was the same, namely certain monies the wife's husband had paid into the pension plan and in which she had an interest by reason of judicial division of matrimonial property. The respondent corporations applied to stay the proceedings, arguing that the preliminary issue to be determined was the scope of the Act. HELD: The application was dismissed with costs. 1)The respondent corporations were granted leave to proceed with their applications when the McMaster action was finished and that her decision respecting his powers was open to review upon further evidence being adduced. However, the matter was addressed as preliminary issue only without any adjudication on the merits. It is impossible to address the scope and breadth of statutory provision in the absence of a factual context. 2)In an effort to limit the effect of this determination on preliminary issue on merits of the six motions commenced by the Superintendent, find that the letter of August 6, 2002 is not a direction of the Superintendent which may be enforced pursuant to s.of the Act, Section is to assist the Superintendent in carrying out his administrative duties and is beyond the legislative authority of the superintendent and beyond his administrative capacity."
2006nssc158.txt,"The parties, who were the parents of two children, separated after a seven year marriage. For the five years since the separation, their parenting time with the children had been distributed on a two-week basis. In the divorce proceeding, the mother, who planned to remarry and relocate, sought to become the primary caregiver of the children, with the father to have access only every second weekend. The father sought to vary the parenting time so that both parents would equally share their time with the children. Current parenting arrangement to remain in effect with the parties retaining joint custody of the children; table amount of child support set. The parenting pattern followed for the past five years had been working well for the children and appeared to be serving their needs; the mother's proposal would lessen the children's time with their father and the father's proposal would also create a significant change for the children, removing their current home base.",HELD: The court granted the divorce judgment on the grounds that there had been a breakdown of the marriage and the spouses had lived separate and apart for more than a year prior to the commencement of the proceeding. The parties agreed to retain the interest they acquired in their own pensions and to have the father's access to take place every second weekend. The parents agreed to be designated joint custodians of the children. The father sought to become the primary care giver for the children and for the mother to make child support payments by paying a table amount in accordance with his income and by making a contribution to the $800 child care cost.

2007nspc30.txt,"Immediately after the complainant accused the defendant of stealing lumber from his property and directed him to remain off the property, the defendant entered upon the complainant's property in a state of anger to challenge the complainant's authority to issue such a direction. The complainant armed himself with a knife when the defendant entered the property, at which point the defendant grabbed a shovel, moved towards the complainant, struck him on the arm with the shovel and punched him in the ribs while he was on the ground. The complainant suffered a fractured ulna bone and a fractured rib. The defendant, who was charged with aggravated assault, assault by using or threatening to use a weapon and possession of a weapon, claimed to have acted in self-defence. Defendant found guilty of all three charges; conviction entered only on the aggravated assault charge. The actions of the complainant were justifiable as using no more force than was necessary to prevent a perceived trespass; the defendant, who was under no imminent danger, and could reasonably have retreated  upon seeing the knife, instead chose to arm himself with a shovel and strike the complainant.",The accused was charged with aggravated assault contrary to s. 268(1) of the Criminal Code and possession of a weapon for a purpose dangerous to the public peace. HELD: The Court found that the accused was justified in using force to prevent what he perceived as a trespass upon his property provided he used no more force than was necessary to prevent the perceived trespass. The accused was not prepared to heed the obvious meaning of the gesture nor was he intent in prevailing over the complainant's direction to stay off his property and assert what he unreasonably believed to be his right to enter thereon.
2008skqb287.txt,"The eldest daughter, 15 years old, her sister, 14 years old, and their brother, 12 years old, were apprehended from their mother on 2 March 2006. The Minister sought an order pursuant to s. 37(3) of The Child and Family Services Act placing the children in the care of the Minister until each child turned the age of 18 years. The mother opposed the Minister's request for long term orders for the three children, taking the position that the children were not 'children in need of protection' pursuant to s. 11 of the Act, and that the children should be immediately returned to her care. In the alternative, the mother proposed that the court make a short term supervisory order under s. 37(1)(a) of the Act, returning the children to the mother's care under supervision and conditions. The issues were: 1) whether the children were children in need of protection pursuant to s. 11 of The Child and Family Services Act; and 2) if so, the appropriate order to be made, respecting each of the children, pursuant to s. 37 of the Act. HELD: The children are children in need of protection pursuant to s. 11(a)(i),(v), (vi) and 11(b) of the Act. There shall be an order pursuant to s. 37(3) of the Act that the children be placed in the custody of the Minister until each child attains the age of 18 years. There shall also be an order with respect to access. It is well established that child protection proceedings involve a two step process. First, there must be a determination pursuant to s. 36(1) as to whether the child is in need of protection as that term is defined in s. 11. If it is determined that a child is in need of protection the next step is to determine the appropriate order among the options contained in s. 37.The Ministry had a legitimate concern that, based on a prior conviction for assaulting the child of a previous common-law partner, the mother's common-law partner posed a risk to the children. The Ministry acted appropriately by requesting the execution of a parental services agreement (PSA) with a condition therein that her partner should not have any unsupervised time with them. The Ministry had evidence that the partner and the mother breached the terms of the PSA. They received information from the school, neighbours, the children and, importantly, the mother herself, that the partner was having unsupervised contact with the children. The Ministry then proceeded to apprehend the children in light of its concern regarding possible harm to the children at his hands. The Ministry made an appropriate determination that the children were in need of protection as a result. If the court is wrong in the determination that s. 11(a)(i) is applicable, it finds that all three children were in any event in need of protection pursuant to s. 11(v), (vi) and s. 11(b) of the Act. The Ministry had evidence that the mother was having difficulties caring for the two children with special needs. The mother's actions could have, and likely did, impair the development of the children. Further, with respect to domestic violence, the mother herself characterized her relationship with the partner as emotionally abusive. Finally, having reached conclusions that there was risk to the children, the Ministry determined that there was no other adult person able or willing to provide for the children's needs as set out in s. 11(b) of the Act. The mother argues, in addition, that the children are no longer in need of protection. Thus, the court has to determine whether there has been sufficient change since March 2006 so as to conclude that the children are no longer in need of protection and can immediately be returned to the mother's care. Unfortunately, the court cannot reach that conclusion. Indeed, the mother herself acknowledged that it would be a slow process regarding unification of the children into her home. The mother continues to object to suggestions made by the Ministry to improve her parenting abilities. Although the mother appears to have come some distance in understanding she has problems, she continues to resist recommendations for change. She continues to fight the Ministry as opposed to cooperating with it. For these reasons, and the reasons set out above, the children continue to be children in need of protection pursuant to s. 11 of the Act. The Ministry seeks an order pursuant to s. 37(3) that the three children be placed in the custody of the Minister until each child attains the age of 18 years. The mother says that a more appropriate order would be a short term supervisory order pursuant to s. 37(1)(a) of the Act. All three children love their mother and want to continue to spend time with their mother. However, they are doing extremely well in their current foster placements. In this case, the age of the three children is a critical factor. The children are now 15, 14 and 12 years old. There is not much time for the mother to take all the necessary steps she needs to take before the children are returned to her and the time the children will be reaching the age of 18 years. The Ministry has not pursued a permanent order under s. 37(2) of the Act. Indeed, the mother and the grandmother should continue to play a substantial role in the children's lives. An order pursuant to s. 37(3) of the Act, placing the children in the custody of the Minister until each child reaches the age of 18 years is the appropriate order in this case. The mother will, with a long term order, have the ability to make the necessary changes in her life and, if she does so, apply for a variation of this order in the future.","The Minister sought an order pursuant to s. 37(3) of The Child and Family Services Act placing the children in the Minister's care until each child turned 18 years. The mother opposed the request for long term orders for the three children. HELD: The order was granted. The children were placed in the custody of the Minister until they turn 18 years of age. A short term supervisory order was made, returning the children to the mother's care under supervision and conditions. 1)The mother had commenced a relationship with a man by the name of J.M. in the summer of 2002. He was apprehended in early 2006. He is currently residing in a therapeutic foster home with his estranged wife. During this time, the mother is attempting to complete a course at SIAST. The father is ill and is unable to attend trial because he is ill. 2)The Minister seeks an order under s. 11 of the Act declaring Katie, Hannah and Bobby to be children in need of protection. Subsections (a) and (b) of s.11 are the relevant subsections in this matter. The Minister called 18 witnesses including one expert witness. These witnesses testified that the mother was hostile to workers from the Ministry, who were hostile to her and her children. The Ministry continued to stay involved with the family through the execution of number of Parental Services Agreements (PSA's). The mother was advised that she would not be able to attend the trial because she was ill. 3)If the Minister determines that the children are children of the Agency, he must make an order for a short term custody order. If not, the Minister proposes that make a short-term supervisory orders under s37(1)(a)of the Act. The questions I must answer are as follows: 1)Are the children, Katie and Hannah, or any of them, children in Need of Protection pursuant to S.11 of The Agency? If so, what is the appropriate order to be made, respecting each of the children pursuant to the Agency? The Minister is directed by s.37(4) to consider the best interests of the child. This is a legislative framework in mind. It sets out the factors that must be considered when determining the best interest of a child."
2010skqb292.txt,"The plaintiff entered into a contract with the defendant for the sale of organic oats. The contract between the plaintiff and defendant stipulated that the oats were to be delivered at a stipulated moisture content. The defendant accepted the oats from the plaintiff and did not indicate any issue with the moisture content. In turn, the defendant sold the oats to a broker for shipment to Germany. When the oats arrived overseas, the German buyer rejected the oats saying they had heated and did not meet his required moisture content. The defendant refused to pay the plaintiff the amount owing under the contract and argued the plaintiff had failed to meet his contractual obligation. HELD: The contract was between the plaintiff and defendant. The defendant accepted delivery of the oats from the plaintiff and did not object to their quality. The evidence before the Court was that the defendant had no complaint with the moisture content of the oats at the time of delivery by the plaintiff. There was nothing in the contract between the plaintiff and defendant that allowed the defendant to transfer the shipping acceptance risk to the plaintiff. The resale of the oats to Germany was the defendant's responsibility and the plaintiff is not a party to the contact with the German company. The plaintiff was awarded the balance of the contract price, plus pre-judgment interests and costs.","The plaintiff, certified organic farmer, sold organic oats to the defendant who in turn sold the oats through a broker in Ontario to the ultimate destination being a miller in Germany. The German miller rejected some of the oats as having a high moisture content, the plaintiff refused to pay the miller and the defendant refused to supply the farmer. HELD: The plaintiff was awarded pre-judgment interest on the sum of $51,608 from the 26th day of September 2006 until the date of judgment.  1)The testimony before the court established that the contract as described above was validly entered into between Wlaswich and Bio Canada. There were no concerns expressed whatsoever by Bio Canada that there was any problem with the oats delivered by the plaintiff. There was no requirement for such testing in the contract between the parties to be required. The requirement was for oats of certain moisture level. Although the Canadian Grain Commission requirements may be method of determining the appropriate moisture level, certainly those methods are not the only fashion in which the moisture content could be proven. 2)Despite Bio Canada's attempt to place the contractual risk between itself and the German Miller on the plaintiff, it has failed to do so. There is no legal reason why Bio Canada should not have made payment of the entire sum owing to the plaintiff on the basis that the plaintiff is not a party to that contractual obligation which was incurred solely by the defendant. The plaintiff has proven that he has satisfied his contractual obligations to Bio Canada resulting in an obligation by it to pay $61,608 to him to satisfy the contract. The sum of the sum was paid on September 26, 2008. No further amount has been paid. 3)The plaintiff was entitled to pre-jgment interest. He is entitled to those costs to be taxed on a party-party basis under Schedule I(B) of the Tariff of Costs."

There was no tenable basis to interfere with the judgment with respect to the inventory and valuation of matrimonial property and issue of spousal support given the standard of appellate review and the evidence in support of the findings of fact.,"Fulltext of judgment follows: [1] In light of the standard of appellate review (laid down in cases such as Lensen v. Lensen, 1987 CanLII 4 (SCC), [1987] 2 S.C.R. 672 and Fontaine v.

The Court found that the accused had not shown any violation of his s. and s. s. Charter Rights. 2)The accused challenged the admissibility of the blood sample taken pursuant to the warrant. He argued that the Code contemplates analysis of a sample taken from a suspect for comparison purposes with a bodily substance 'found' in circumstances described in s. 487.05 (b) and that it is in the best interests of the administration of justice to do so. It would strike me as odd and suspect if they were not disclosed as part of the information placed before him upon oath by the investigator. 3)The evidence was found admissible for the purpose of trial."

The respondents argued that the applicant's by-law violated their rights under s. 2(b) of the Charter. Application allowed; respondents directed to remove the ground sign; if the sign is not removed within fifteen days, the Town can enter upon the land and remove the sign at the expense of the respondents. Although advertising is a form of expression and falls within the scope of sec. 2(b) of the Charter, the purposes of the by-laws (maintaining a distinct aesthetic character of the downtown, minimizing adverse impacts on adjacent properties and reducing safety concerns) were both pressing and substantial and the limiting measures were rationally connected to the objectives. The by-laws had a minimal impairment on the rights of the respondents, as advertising was not prohibited but only limited.","The Town made an application pursuant to s266 of the Municipal Government Act, 1998 S.N.S. c.18 directing the removal of a ground sign erected at 152 Provost Street. It is alleged that the erection of the sign violates the Town's Municipal Planning Strategy and Land Use By-law. The Town conceded that the by-law limited freedom of expression while still achieving its objectives and by reducing the proliferation of billboard advertisements. The sign also exceeded an area permitted by the downtown core zone and the sign was a third party sign which was permitted in a specific zone in accordance with its objectives. HELD: The Town was granted an order to remove the ground sign. The by-laws are rationally connected to the objective and effectively address unrestricted use of available space in a way that maximizes the effective use of signs. The limiting measures are rational and are not inconsistent with the objective. 1)The Town's objectives are to develop and maintain a distinct aesthetic character of the city, minimize adverse impacts on adjacent properties and reduce safety concerns such as distractions that affect both pedestrians and vehicular traffic. 2)The limiting measures of the bylaw are rational connected to their objective and it effectively addresses unrestricted use in a manner that minimizes the infringement of the rights of the appellant. The application is allowed and an order will issue pursuant to S. 266(3) of the municipal Government Act directing the respondents to remove. The Court of Appeal held that the limiting measures were rational and were demonstrably justified pursuant to ss.2(b) and s.1 of the Charter. It was clear from Irwin Toy Ltd. v. Quebec A.G. (1989) that the Town sought to uphold the limitation of advertising. The restrictions regulate how and where the signs can be placed and does not prevent advertising, but only limits it. 3)The Court found that the general purpose of the By-laws is to promote commercial use as a way to attract a solid customer base, maintain the character of a Town by minimizing the adverse impacts of billboard advertisement and to prevent distraction to motorists. 4) The Court found there was a proportionality between the effects of the measures limiting the right or freedom guaranteed by the Charter and those imposed by them."

HELD: The application was dismissed with costs in the amount of $500 to the petitioner. Neither the petitioner's father nor the petitioner's husband was a party to the proceedings. To require them to produce their financial records, in the absence of even the slightest evidence such production would disclose anything which would in any manner assist in determining the amount of child maintenance payable by the petitioner, would be totally unjust.","FIAT [1] The examination was completed and by agreement of counsel the questions to be resolved were whether Janice Petersen had produced all relevant financial information, and whether a trial should be directed as to the amount of maintenance payable by her. HELD: Both applications were dismissed with costs to the petitioner to the extent of $500.  1) The examination had been completed and the questions were whether the petitioner has produced all necessary financial information and if a trial was directed. The respondent's counsels' fees were increased. 2) The issue of child maintenance was adjourned pending fulfilment of the requirement that the mother, Janice, produce all information relating to her ability to pay maintenance, and for her examination by the respondent to determine her income.  3) Both applications are dismissed pending the submission of the respondent's financial report to the chamber.  4) Costs to the respondent were to be determined by the examination.  5) Although the petitioner's income is deposited into a joint account with her husband, there is not shred of evidence to support that statement. Counsel for Mr. Overs also seeks financial information related to Mr. Petersen's ranching operations, where the petitioner looked after the ranch while the husband was operating the truck. It has been submitted that income should be imputed to Janice from the numbered corporation. Income from the corporation owns but one truck, operated by the Petersen, from which all of the income of the corporation is derived. When one considers that the corporation's owner owns only one truck operated by Mr. The Overs, the suggestion that income from Janice's father's books of account would reveal which would assist the respondent in establishing that Janice has earned more income than the amount revealed in her income tax returns is nothing less then ludicrous."
2_2005nssc177.txt,"A real estate agent sold a condominium to an American and agreed to rent it for her for a fee. He deposited a security deposit and rent in his personal account and used it for personal living expenses. When the owner inquired, he caused a false lease to be provided to her showing the rental commencing two months later than it actually did; he then failed to remit some rent and was late remitting other rent. He entered into a settlement with the owner after she complained to the Real Estate Commission but misled and did not cooperate with the Commission. At the discipline hearing, his evidence was found not credible. The Committee gave a written decision outlining the reasons for finding him guilty of five counts of professional misconduct, but failed to provide reasons for the sanctions imposed, which included a two year licence suspension and hearing costs of $10,000. The realtor appealed both the findings of professional misconduct and the sanctions imposed. Applying the standard of review of reasonableness, appeal from the findings of misconduct dismissed; applying the standard of review of correctness, appeal granted on the issue of the sanctions imposed; matter remitted back to the Committee for reconsideration, based on the principles of sanctioning outlined in the decision. It is patently unreasonable and contrary to the principles of natural justice and fair play for an administrative board not to give reasons for its decisions; reasons must be sufficiently clear, precise and intelligible as to set out the reasoning process of the tribunal and demonstrate a consideration of all of the relevant factors.","The applicant was found to have exhibited unprofessional conduct and was suspended from the practice of real estate for two years. He appealed the decision of the Nova Scotia Real Estate Commission and the sanctions imposed, including a two year license suspension and order to pay costs of $9,980.08.

The complete inadequacy of the explanation of the suspension, and the absence of any explanation for the failure to remit the other two sanctions, failed to meet the standards placed on the Committee.

HELD: 1) The Court will look at all of the circumstances in deciding whether to grant an application for severance.  In this case the plaintiffs should not be precluded from adducing evidence related to Walbaum's dealings with each of the applicants or required to segregate the evidence into two, three or four separate trials. Given the likelihood that the applicants will be required to attend portions of the trial in respect of the Walbaum Group in any event, severance would not necessarily result in a significant saving of time and expense.  2) The plaintiffs acknowledge that only relatively small portion of trial time (perhaps less than 1 day) will pertain to the claims against any one of the Sims, Gabriel or Dumurs. It would be unfair to require all of the applicants to participate in all of the trial when very little of it will be relevant to them.

2_2009nssc364.txt,"The parties entered into an agreement and registered it with the court in 2008. It provided for a combined spousal/child support payment of $2,000/month, which the husband was able to claim on his taxes because of the shared custody arrangement they were in at the time. At the time of their divorce in 2009, the wife wanted to incorporate the agreement into the corollary relief judgment. The husband argued a dramatic drop in his income forced him to abandon the parties' shared parenting regime, which resulted in significant tax consequences and justified a change to the agreement's support provisions to include only the table amount of child support. He argued the change in circumstances was so extensive as to undermine the integrity of the agreement. The evidence showed the wife needed $2,000/month in order to keep the bank from foreclosing on the home she occupied with the children, and to allow her to finish retraining so she could enter the workforce. The husband (a self-employed financial planner) argued the recent world economic crisis had adversely affected his business to an extent unanticipated when the agreement was executed (October 2008). The evidence showed that his focus was to solicit new business rather than cut expenses to make his business more viable. He chose to spend less time with the children to do this, which impacted the children and wife. The agreement is binding; the support provisions are to be incorporated into the corollary relief judgement. This concerns an agreement registered under the Maintenance and Custody Act. It is not an application to vary under the Divorce Act, but rather an application to overturn an agreement (although the distinction doesn't impact the outcome). The terms of the agreement must be given great deference. Will enforcing it reflect the parties' original intent and be in substantial compliance with the Act? The court looked at the second branch of the test in Miglin: whether something has happened that was outside the parties' contemplation when the agreement was made. Care must be taken to distinguish between circumstances giving rise to the agreement and those making compliance difficult. Taking judicial notice, the court observed the world economic crisis was the subject of much debate before the agreement was made, even if it was more extreme than anticipated. Here, the agreement: used strong, unambiguous language; was arrived at after extensive negotiations by sophisticated parties and with the assistance of counsel; and was very important to each party. To overturn it would not be in the children's best interests: they would lose their home and their mother would be unable to finish her retraining, adversely impacting her ability to provide for them. The change in the husband's circumstances are less likely to impact the integrity of the agreement than would his proposal to disregard it. The husband cannot unilaterally alter the agreement simply by deciding to change the parenting arrangements. His decision to work additional hours and spend less time with his children was not reasonable or fair and in effect transferred the financial and parenting burden to the wife (who was also managing significant financial and professional challenges).",HELD: The court found that the parties had entered a separation agreement that provided for a shared parenting arrangement. The petitioner sought to have the spousal and child support obligations reflected in a paragraph of the separation agreement changed in order to reflect a significant reduction in his income and a loss of income tax deductibility for his payment under clause 9 of the agreement. The respondent argued that changes in circumstances in the future would not have the effect of setting aside the terms of this agreement as the terms relate to division of property and any and all Spousal support obligations except as set out in the Divorce Act. There was no suggestion the parties did not enter a binding agreement or that the agreement was not binding.
2_2009skqb516.txt,"In 1999 the plaintiff Bank granted the defendant, Wheatland, a credit facility of $500,000 plus an additional $20,000 in Visa Credit, all financed by means of a general security agreement pledging Wheatland's present and after acquired personal property with personal guarantees from two individuals. In April 1999 the Bank registered its security interest with the Personal Property Registry (PPR). Wheatland carried on business as a farm equipment dealer. Wheatland entered into dealership agreements with equipment suppliers (CNH). The Bank entered into a priority agreement whereby the Bank postponed its interest in favour of CNH. The issue in the present application is the Bank's priority with respect to credits for returned parts. The issues require an interpretation of the respective priority agreements between the Bank and the CNH companies. HELD: 1) The critical issue is the distinction between inventory and credits paid for by Wheatland and inventory and credits financed by CNH that Wheatland has not paid for. The objective of the contracting parties when they entered the priority agreement was that the CNH security would have priority over the Bank security as to Wheatland inventory supplied by the suppliers but not paid for by Wheatland or returned for credit. But once the supplied inventory was paid for by Wheatland, the Bank's general security on Wheatland's present and after acquired property would prevail.  2) The second issue only arises as the result of the first issue. It relates to the Receiver's right to require CNH Canada to repurchase parts inventory acquired from CNH Canada or its predecessors, notwithstanding that these parts were shipped direct to Wheatland by third party suppliers at the request of CNH. The issue arises pursuant to s. 50(14)(c) of The Agricultural Implements Act (AIA). While it is obvious that the direct ship parts are contractually excluded, the question is whether the direct shipped parts in this case were 'specially ordered' by Wheatland as stipulated in s. 50(14)(c) of the Act. The direct ship parts at issue consist of very ordinary articles such as nuts and bolts, washers, O-rings, seals, gaskets and bearings. The contractual provisions entitle CNH to refuse to restock direct ship parts. However s. 50(2) and s. 50(3) override the contrary contractual provisions in certain circumstances. It appears that the contractual arrangements were intended to enable CNH to opt out of its AIA obligations to repurchase inventory from a terminated dealer. The AIA does not permit or accommodate such opting out. The provisions of s. 50 appear to be designed to protect the supplier as well as the dealer. The Court is not persuaded that the parts in this case were in any way unique or specially ordered. They were commonplace articles of personal property required by a farm machinery dealer for its use and for use by its retail customers.","HELD: The court found that the goods/parts issue was the cornerstone of the priority agreement and that the agreements provided by the parties were the essential intent of the contracting parties and the impact of the agreement. The parties were not in dispute that CNH Canada and CNH Capital stand as successors to the respective contracting parties, and have assumed their respective rights and obligations relating to the TD priority agreements. The issues relate only to the interpretation of the respective priority agreements between TD and the CNH companies and to the corporate policy of CNH as to the return of direct ship parts. The contractual provisions clearly entitle the defendant to refuse to restock the inventory of a farm machinery dealer for its use and for use by its retail customers. The critical issue is the distinction between inventory and credits paid for by Wheatland and inventory and the credits financed by NHCC that Wheatland has not paid for in full. The defendant's claim is adjusted to $88,724.59. Notwithstanding the possibility of a contrary interpretation, it would have been logical for the agreement to have contained an explicit provision that parts and supplies are not 'Goods' or 'inventory' for the purposes of the Agreement. CNH is acting on behalf of all creditors to determine priority between competing claimants. That is not the same as CNH seeking to change the priorities as between the respective claimants. Parts and service manuals returned by the Receiver to CNH are unique or 'one-off' items CNH contends that the word'specially' as used in s.50(14) of the Agricultural Implements Act refers to any new and used Goods effective upon NHCC having been paid by the dealer in full for them. In this case, the defendant is in default in its obligations to TD. The defendants object to the propriety of a court-appointed receiver taking the side of a competing creditor in a priority dispute amongst creditors. In the context in which the employment of the direct ship inventory model was supposedly for the mutual benefit of the parties, the agreement was not the basis for the parties' claims."
2_2010skqb444.txt,"The accused was charged under s. 5(2) of the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act after a highway traffic stop in which the accused was driving a motorhome that was found to be modified to carry cocaine and marijuana by a group of officers designated to search for drugs in vehicles. The cocaine found in the motorhome had an estimated street value of between 1.1 and 2.5 million dollars. The marijuana had an estimated street value between $471,000 and $733,000. The officer who stopped the motorhome saw it weave from the centre line to the fog line approximately six times. The officer testified that he suspected the driver might be impaired by alcohol. The officer stopped the vehicle and found no indicia of impairment by alcohol. The officer ran the motorhome on his computer system and found that it was registered to the driver. Another officer arrived on scene and approached the motorhome. The second officer noted a smell of fabric softener in the vehicle and testified that the accused appeared unusually nervous. The second officer testified that fabric sheets are frequently used to mask the odour of drugs. The second officer testified that he suspected the Vehicle Identification number on the dash had been tampered with because the rivets looked too new. He testified that he compared the Vehicle Identification Number on the dash to the number on the door and found they did not match. He later acknowledged that he was in error and later discovered that the numbers did match. The second officer commenced a search of the vehicle purportedly to search for paperwork that would confirm that the vehicle was not stolen. The accused was arrested for possession of stolen property. As the officer searched the vehicle, he noted signs that it had been modified. A drug sniffer dog was brought to the scene and had a positive reaction near the rear vent of the motorhome. The officers conducted a search of the vehicle which revealed that the motorhome hnd been significantly modified for the purpose of transporting illegal drugs. The accused was arrested for trafficking. The accused advised the officers that he wanted to contact a lawyer after he was arrested for trafficking. Another officer attended the scene to transport the accused to the detachment. That officer assisted with the search of the motorhome for approximately half an hour before driving the accused another hour and a half to the detachment where he was allowed to contact a lawyer. The accused argued that his rights under ss. 8, 9 and 10 of the Charter were infringed and sought exclusion under s. 24(2). HELD: Section 8 Ã» The motorhome had been extensively modified for the purpose of carrying contraband and could no longer be used as a motor home because its domestic systems had been disabled. The accused was entitled to no greater expectation of privacy in the vehicle than he would have had in any other passenger vehicle that he had the ability to regulate access to. The officers did not have a reasonable suspicion that the motorhome was stolen. The real purpose of the detention and arrest for possession of stolen property was to search the vehicle for drugs. The observations of the second officer on scene to support his reasonable suspicion that the motorhome was stolen were not capable of verification. He chose not to look at or consider the available information indicating the vehicle was not stolen including: the valid registration presented by the accused and the information from the CPIC query. Virtually all of the other observations of this officer had little to do with the possibility of a stolen vehicle and were indicators of a vehicle suspected of carrying contraband. In conducting the search, the officers were acting on little more than a hunch based on intuition. The search of the motorhome incidental to the accused's arrest for possession of stolen property amounted to a breach of s. 8. By the time the sniffer dog was deployed, the police had a reasonable suspicion that the accused was transporting drugs. However, the search of the motorhome and observations of its modifications were incidental to the arbitrary arrest of the accused for possession of stolen property, therefore, their grounds for the reasonable suspicion did not support the deployment of the sniffer dog. Section 9 Ã»  The arresting officer did not have reasonable and probable grounds to believe the motor home had been stolen when he arrested the accused. He had not carried out even a cursory investigation into the possibility that it might have been stolen. His inability to compare the two vehicle identification numbers accurately was willful blindness or flagrantly negligent. The accused was arbitrarily detained when he was arrested for possession of stolen property. The observations that lead to the reasonable and probable grounds to arrest the accused for trafficking were derived from his arbitrary arrest for possession of stolen property. The detention had little practical effect on the accused because he remained confined to the back of the police car as a result of the earlier arrest for possession of stolen property. Section 10 Ã»  The accused was not provided with an opportunity to retain and instruct counsel in a timely fashion. However, the police did not attempt to elicit any incriminating evidence from the accused during the time it took to get him to the detachment to call a lawyer. There is no causal connection between the breach of the accused's rights under s. 10(b) and the discovery of the drugs. The evidence was excluded under s. 24(2). The breaches of the accused's rights under ss. 8 and 9 were very serious. The officer was so determined to find evidence of contraband that he became blinded to the constitutional requirements of a reasonable suspicion for investigative detention and reasonable and probable grounds for arrest. His actions showed a flagrant disregard for Charter requirements. The deprivation of liberty and privacy resulting from the breaches was significant but not egregious. These two factors favor excluding the evidence. The charge is a serious one and involves a large quantity of drugs. The evidence is highly reliable and critical to the Crown's case. The truth seeking function of the Court favours admitting the evidence. On balance, the administration of justice would be brought into disrepute if the evidence was admitted and that standard is paramount.","The accused was charged with possession of cocaine and marijuana for the purpose of trafficking contrary to s. 5(2) of the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act. He applied for an order excluding evidence of marijuana found in his motor home on the basis that his rights under ss. 8, 9 and 10 of the Charter were violated. HELD: The accused was found not guilty. The evidence was excluded. 1) The accused's right to be secure against unreasonable search or seizure under the Charter was infringed when he was held at the roadside and 'booked in' before being given access to counsel. 2) The Court found that the accused's claim to privacy in the context of his possession of stolen property was not infringed. The Court held that there was no breach of the accused’s right to privacy under s. 8 or s. 10 of The Charter.  3) There was no reasonable expectation of privacy at the time the accused was arrested. The accused had not raised this issue with the Court. 4) The court reviewed the circumstances of the arrest and found that there were no unreasonable search and seizure provisions in the Charter."
2_2011nsca89.txt,"The defendant, who was in a very small apartment with two other individuals, got up from the couch and proceeded through a doorway behind the complainant, purportedly to use the bathroom. A few minutes later, the complainant found something wrapped around his neck and he was choked until he passed out. When he regained consciousness, he was lying on the floor with the defendant crouched over him. She left without saying a word and he later discovered that money was missing from his wallet, which he found under his back. The defendant was convicted of robbery when the complainant maintained that the third person in the room never left his sight and was still seated directly in front of him when he felt something being tightened around his throat. Although the third person's testimony supported the complainant's evidence, the defendant alleged that while she was in the bathroom, she heard a commotion and when she came out she saw the complainant lying on the floor and the other individual stated that she 'had the money' as she ran out the door. Not knowing what to do, she crouched over the complainant and lifted his head to see if he was okay. When he came to and said he was going to call the police, she ran because she was afraid of having her parole revoked. She appealed the conviction on the basis that the trial judge had erred in treating the conflicting Crown and defence evidence as a credibility contest. Appeal dismissed;  it was clear that the trial judge had accepted the complainant's evidence as to what had occurred along with the other witness' evidence as to who had strangled him and rejected the defendant's testimony and denials of responsibility. Although he did not specifically refer to the principles in R. v. Wry (1991) (SCC), the court was satisfied he recognized their importance and did not fall into the trap of simply comparing the Crown and defence positions without assessing the whole of the evidence. The complainant never wavered in his evidence that the other individual had never left his sight and was still seated directly in front of him when he felt something being tightened around his throat, which was supported by the other individual's testimony.","An appeal from conviction for robbery alleging error by the trial judge in his assessment of credibility. The trial judge did not fall into the trap of simply comparing the Crown and defence positions without then going on to assess the whole of the evidence to establish proof of guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. HELD: Appeal dismissed. 1)The appellant was convicted of robbery and sentenced to four years' imprisonment. 2)The trial judge recognized that the ultimate issue was not credibility but proof to a criminal standard. He did not specifically refer to the principles set out in R. v. W.(D), [1991] 1 S.C.R. 742. 3)After a short trial before Nova Scotia Supreme Court Justice Peter M. Bryson (as he then was), the appellant sat on the couch across from the kitchen table where the complainant was seated and that at some point shortly after their arrival, the appellant got up and proceeded through doorway behind the complainant, purportedly to use the washroom. A few moments later the complainant felt something wrapped around his throat. He was choked until he passed out. The appellant took the stand in her own defence. She admitted that at the time of this offence she was on parole. She knew that if she were convicted, her parole would be revoked. She ran off because she already had charges against her and didn't want to get involved in this incident."
2_2011nssc338.txt,"A small claims adjudicator determined he had jurisdiction to hear the respondent's application for a review of his rent increase. He adjourned the matter and asked that it return to him for a hearing on the merits. The appellant appealed. At issue was whether the appeal was properly before the court or premature. There was also an issue concerning the admissibility of an affidavit that wasn't before the adjudicator at the original proceeding. Appeal dismissed and matter returned for a continuation of the hearing on the merits before the same adjudicator. The court has no jurisdiction to hear an appeal on an interlocutory decision of this nature. There can be no appeal from the Small Claims Court until a final determination is made. Until this matter is decided on its merits, there has been no final determination. There are sound policy, as well as practical, reasons for this approach.","This is an appeal from a decision of a Small Claims Court adjudicator sitting on an Appeal of an Order of the Director of Residential Tenancies. The adjudicator made an error of law and was in excess of jurisdiction. He is now hearing an application for declaratory relief. HELD: The appeal is allowed and referred back for a continuation of the matter before the same Small Claims adjudicator who made the ruling on the preliminary motion. 1)The adjudicator's decision is still open to be brought to this Court. An appeal to the Supreme Court under the Criminal Code does not mean that parties are prevented from engaging counsel and probably in many instances they are wise to do so, but if this Court was to entertain an appeal of an interlocutory ruling it would result in delays in having matters heard and would likely result in increased costs to the litigants. 2)The right to appeal final decision of Small Claims court adjudicator on an issue involving residential tenancies is still available to this court. Nothing in my decision will prejudice or preclude any of the parties to this particular action from launching an appeal if they feel aggrieved by the final decision that the adjudicator makes. 3)The decision to admit the clause'subject to appeal of this decision' is a discretionary thing. It appears to open the door for an appeal which would expand the right of appeal found in s. 32 of the Act. If there is an 'order or determination' of an adjudicator from which to appeal, it is in fact a re-trial. It is not the same as an appeal to our court which relies on the record."
2_2011nssc500.txt,"The accused was charged with trafficking in cocaine and possession of cocaine for the purposes of trafficking. He was arrested within minutes of two officers observing what they believed to be a drug transaction. After watching the accused roam the street, they had observed him meet up and speak briefly with another person, whom he motioned to follow him and they proceeded by different routes, meeting up at the rear corner of a building. Although the area was dimly lit, one of the officers saw the accused remove something from a small pink plastic bag, which he then placed in the other person's hand. The encounter was very brief and neither officer observed any money exchanged. A ball of crack cocaine was later seized from the other person's jacket pocket. Although no drugs were found on the accused, a search of the area located a pink baggy of drugs stashed in a rock wall close to ground level. The defence argued that the drugs seized from the other person could have come from anywhere and constructive possession had not been proven with respect to the baggy located in the wall. Accused found guilty on both counts; the court accepted that the drugs found in the wall belonged to him and his possession was constructive, done knowingly for his use and benefit so he could return to the stash for his next transaction. The encounter described was consistent with low level street trafficking (brief and direct contact between buyer and seller, the passing communication and gesture to go to another place to avoid police scrutiny and the frequent disposal of the remaining drugs by stashing) and inconsistent with any other possible explanation. Moments after handing something to the other person, the accused's silhouette was observed in the area where the drugs were stashed and the court was satisfied that he had placed the drugs in the wall minutes before his arrest.","The accused was charged with two counts under the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act with possession of cocaine for the purpose of trafficking. He was arrested within minutes of the alleged events near and at the trafficking location. The two undercover police officers observed the events from an observation post less than 130 feet from the incident and from position of some elevation. Constable Marriott testified that in the cooking process of crack cocaine, making it into stones, the cut substance boiled off and disappears and will not be found in analysis. The accused stashed the drugs in the rock wall after the transaction and did so minutes before his arrest. HELD: The accused was found guilty of the offences with which he is charged. 1)The Court accepted the Crown's evidence on these practices and found the encounters between the accused and the seller were consistent with drug trafficking practices and not consistent with any other possible explanations. 2)The accused had control of the drugs and that they were not accessible to any other individual but to him. It was his stash that he placed in the wall in the minute following the transaction with Mr. Burke. The evidence respecting the cutting substances in crack cocaine as an explanation for the absence of the agent benedryl in the Burke stone was very helpful to the defence in having an opportunity to challenge the observations of the two undercover officers. 3)The evidence of the RCMP officer who was qualified as an expert to provide expert evidence with respect to jargon, use, availability, paraphernalia, distribution, packaging, sale, price and value of cocaine, as well as methods of avoiding police detection and stashing of drugs, was also accepted. 4)The Crown was able to conduct a full cross-examination of the issue of lighting. The Court was satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused had stashed these drugs in a rock wall shortly after his arrest and that the evidence concerning what he observed of this alleged street level drug transaction was reasonable. The Crown could not demonstrate constructive possession of the baggy in the room at the rear of 2388 Gottingen."

They sought solicitor-client costs or costs under Tariff C, with a multiplier of four for a total of $12,000 given the applicants' conduct and their failure to include important information in their claim. Held, party-and-party costs of $6,000 awarded to the respondents, using Tariff C and a multiplier of two. This matter was sufficiently complex and important to the parties that it required significant preparation and effort to prepare/review the evidence and conduct the hearing. While they did omit relevant information, the applicants' conduct wasn't so outrageous, scandalous or reprehensible that it warranted an award of solicitor-client costs. The dispute was acrimonious, but the litigation was generally conducted in a civil manner.","The Bowsers were successful as Respondents in Chambers application. They claim solicitor client costs or in the alternative costs under Tariff “C” of $3000 to which they say a multiplier of four should be applied for a total of $12,000 costs plus disbursements of $302.75. HELD: 1) As appropriate partial compensation toward the Bowsers’ expenses of litigation, and to do justice between the parties here, I should apply a multiplicative of two for $6000 in costs. 2) The court found that the application consumed one full day on October 18 and effectively the morning of October 20, 2011 by ending at 10:45 a.m. The hearing consumed 1 full day. The application consumed 2 full days on October 20 and October 20. The court awarded $3000 in alternative costs. 3) The amount of costs awarded in the alternate costs is $6000. 4) The Court found that it was appropriate to award the respondent costs in the amount of $2500 to which a multiplier is applied. 5) The respondent client costs should be calculated in the range of $3,000 to $6,000. 6) This is not one of those rare cases where solicitor clients should be awarded."

Clearly the maximum allowable probation period is 3 years and therefore the sentence imposed below is unenforceable. HELD: The Crown appeals. The sentence imposed in s.334(a) is now set to expire in June 1997.

SaskPower sought an order pursuant to Queen's Bench Rule 547 to require the plaintiffs to post security for costs on the ground Wind Power was a non-resident plaintiff with little or no assets in the province of Saskatchewan. HELD: The motion was dismissed.  1)Rule 547 is limited to cases where the plaintiff is a non-resident or where the defendant is given a statutory right to apply. Wind Power is an Alberta company extra-provincially registered in Saskatchewan. Dove Industries, a Saskatchewan company incorporated specifically to develop a pilot project in Saskatchewan which did not proceed, had shareholders in the province. 2)Given the amount of the claim against SaskPower in the amount of $6,400,000 and the significant claim for costs in excess of $50,000 the Court would have granted the security for costs but for the delay by SaskPower in bringing its application. The action was commenced in April 1996. Unexplained delay by a defendant in seeking security for costs will prevent the grant of an order. To make an award for security for costs at this stage would place a burden on the plaintiffs and possibly prevent the action from taking place at the scheduled time.  3)The plaintiff was awarded one set of costs in any event of the cause.","FIAT. The defendant sought an order pursuant to Queen's Bench Rule 547 requiring the plaintiffs to post security for costs in this action on the ground that Wind Power Inc. was a non-resident plaintiff with little or no assets in the province of Saskatchewan and Dove Industries, Inc. while a corporation was incorporated specifically for a wind power demonstration project which did not proceed (and which is related to the subject matter of this action) and accordingly had little or none assets in Saskatchewan. The plaintiff alleged that the defendants had improperly placed security for the costs in an effort to prevent the action from taking place at the scheduled time.

The Court was required to decide whether the questions were the proper subject matter of a stated case.

The respondent raised a preliminary objection, arguing that the matter should not proceed by way of judicial review but that the applicant should be restricted to an appeal of the Rentalsman's decision under s.49(1) of the Residential Tenancies Act, and that the applicant had failed to do so within the prescribed 30 day limit. The applicant argued that she never received any notice of proceedings making it impossible for her to appeal within 30 days. HELD: Preliminary objection dismissed. The court ordered that the application be returned to the Chamber's list for a hearing on the merits.

At the hearing on the application, the executor, under cross-examination, admitted that he had 'done a disservice to the estate' and that his actions were a 'perfect example of why executors shouldn't have done what I have done.' The Chambers judge found that the executor converted estate funds to his own use and ordered the appellant to post security pursuant to the Act. The executor appealed. He submitted that the Court had not explicitly determined that he had committed waste, and accordingly there was no basis or foundation for an order requiring him to post security. Dismissing the appeal, that the appellant's own admissions under oath were sufficient bases for the Court's finding.

3_2000skqb75.txt,"The applicant sought to vary the 1995 consent judgment by terminating or significantly reducing spousal support of $2,500 per month. The respondent suggested the reduction should be limited to the amount she now received from her old age pension and CPP. Neither wanted a trial of the issue and submissions were primarily confined to the financial information filed. HELD: On-going spousal support was reduced to $1,750 per month from April until March 1, 2001 and $1,250 thereafter.  1)It is clear from Bracklow that each case involving spousal support must be determined on its own facts. The court must give due consideration to all the factors and objectives of a spousal support order set out in s.15.2 of the Divorce Act rather than focusing on one factor alone, such as income levels or self sufficiency.  2)There had been a material change in circumstances as the applicant, now 62, had lost his employment and suffered a debilitating leg injury while the respondent, now 67, was receiving an old age pension. 3)The 1995 agreement did not provide spousal support was either time limited or that it was to be varied if there was a substantial change in their future financial positions. However, it was unlikely the parties intended spousal support to continue indefinitely at $2,500 per month even after the applicant retired. The respondent was disadvantaged by the traditional marriage to a greater degree than the applicant as she devoted her full time to working in the home. She received her full share of their joint efforts in the form of an equal division of the matrimonial property. The economic benefits and disadvantages that flow from the marriage and its dissolution must be taken into account (Moge). There was no merit in the wait-and-see suggestion of the respondent. 4)No costs.","The applicant applies to vary a February 1, 1995 consent judgment by terminating or significantly reducing his obligation to pay further spousal support. The applicant's loss of employment and a debilitating leg injury have triggered a variation application. HELD: The application is granted. 1)It is significant that the agreement reached by the parties in 1995 did not provide for a material change in the future financial position of the parties. It is not evident from the material that either party has adequately taken into account. 2)The respondent has been disadvantaged to a greater degree than the applicant. Although the respondent devoted her full time to working in the home and raising the three children of the marriage during the years when she would have been the most productive financially had she pursued a job or pursued an education, the agreement was not updated in 1995. 3)The parties had three children. Fortunately the matrimonial property division provided her with sufficient financial means so that she was not required to seek employment after the parties separated. She resisted any reduction in her pension benefits until the applicant could establish that he will not in fact have any employment income. 4)The applicant met the threshold for a variation applications by demonstrating that there had been a change in circumstances since the order was last revised. Although this entitles him to have the Court review his obligation, it does not follow that his obligation should be terminated. 5)The agreement was made in 1995 that provided that spousals were either time limited or to be varied if there was a substantial change in future financial positions. Surely at the time the parties contemplated their eventual retirement and the financial consequences that it would have for each of them, but it is not likely that they intended to continue indefinitely at $2,500 per month even after the applicant retired."
3_2001skqb332.txt,"An appeal of convictions on two offences under the Excise Tax Act. Grounds for the appeal were summarized as lack of jurisdiction to proceed because of alleged defects in the summons; alternatively, the appellants were not properly advised of the charges they were facing contrary to s.11(a) of the Charter; Kimery should not have been convicted of an offence contrary to s.330 when the information set out an offence contrary to s.326 of the Excise Tax Act; there was no evidence to justify a finding that the Goods and Services Tax returns were not filed; unreasonable delay compromised their right to a fair trial; the demand for a return which was filed was invalid as there was no proof that it was signed by a person authorized to sign on the Minister's behalf. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. 1)Any defects as to the form or service of the summons were unimportant. The record clearly indicated the appellants appeared, pleaded and proceeded with the trial and made no objection. Kimery never requested an adjournment nor was there any suggestion that he desired to be represented by counsel. There was nothing to suggest he was confused or misled by the proceedings or that he did not understand the nature of the charges the appellants were facing. The trial judge did everything required of him in the circumstances. 2)Section 330 does not set out a separate offence but merely clarifies the circumstances under which a director can be convicted of the same offence as a party. This is no different than the situation of an accused being charged with a substantive offence under the Criminal Code on the theory that he is a party by virtue of s.21 of the Criminal Code. Kimery was sole director of the corporation during the period in question when the returns were required to be filed. It was open to the trial judge to find he must have directly participated in or at least acquiesced in the failure to file the appropriate GST returns. 3)There was evidence to support the finding that the appellants failed to file returns as required by s.326. The appellants filed blank returns. The trial judge found as a fact that there was no information relating to GST in any of the documents.  It was agreed the returns were not merely defective but did not qualify as returns at all. 4)The appellants were not denied the right to a trial within a reasonable time as required by Charter s.11(b). Pre-charge delay is not a factor which can be taken into account at this stage. The appellant, having failed to rectify the omission after reasonable opportunities, could not now say they were somehow prejudiced. Once charges were laid, the matter proceeded to trial within a reasonable time.  5)The decision in R. v. Swyryda is a complete answer to the argument that the field position of 'Director Tax Services Office' was not authorized to exercise the powers and perform the duties of the Minister. Also, s.24(2) of the Interpretation Act gives implied powers to persons acting under the authority of a minister of any Crown department over which that minister resides to undertake any act or do anything on behalf of the minister if that person is acting in a capacity appropriate to do the act or thing. Section 24(2) appears to be a codification of the common law, frequently referred to as the Carltona principle based upon the 1943 English case, and followed in R. v. Harrison where the SCC held that responsible and experienced officials will have the ability to exercise the Minister's authority in accomplishing Ministerial duties. The service of the demand in this case was not part of an explicit statutory or regulatory scheme of delegation. It falls under an implicit scheme of delegation and sub-delegation as allowed at common law and in accordance with the Federal Interpretation Act.  The execution and service of a demand to file a GST return is purely an administrative act.  It does not require the exercise of Ministerial discretion nor does it deprive any citizen of any right by restricting a right to appeal. The notice simply requires a taxpayer to comply with the statutory requirements of the Act. The fact that the true copy of the notice annexed to the affidavit of service contains a facsimile signature is not significant.",The appellants appealed their convictions for two offences under the Excise Tax Act for failing to file goods and services tax returns. The notice purported to be signed by someone specifically designated by the Minister pursuant to the regulations. HELD: The appeal was refused. 1)The Court lacked jurisdiction to proceed with the matter by reason of alleged defects in the summons or alternatively the appellants were not properly advised of the charges they were facing. 2)There was no evidence to justify the learned Provincial Court judge's finding that returns were not filed. The demand for a return which was filed was invalid as there was no proof that it was signed by some person authorized to sign on the Minister's behalf.  3)The notice simply required a taxpayer to comply with the statutory requirements of the Act. The fact that the true copy of the notice annexed to the affidavit of service contains a facsimile signature is of no moment. 4)The Act does not set out a separate offence but merely clarifies the circumstances under which a director can be convicted of the same offence as a party. This is no different than the situation of an accused being charged with a substantive offence under the Criminal Code on the theory that he is a party by virtue of s. 21 of the Code. The question raised is not arguable merit nor matter of sufficient importance to warrant review by this Court.
3_2002nsca152.txt,"A supplier delivered computer books to an educational institution prior to the appointment of a receiver for the institution. Immediately after the appointment of the receiver, the supplier presented a written demand for repossession of the books. The receiver refused, claiming that the books were subject to an agreement for sale to the institution's students and therefore, exempt.  A judge of the Supreme Court agreed and the supplier appealed. Appeal allowed; return of books or payment of their value to the supplier ordered. Although the goods were supplied as course materials, the institution's contract with its students obliged it to provide, in its discretion, textbooks and courseware needed for the program and the students acknowledged that it was necessary for the institution to change materials from time to time. The books had not been distributed to the students as of the date of the supplier's demand. The fact that the institution intended to supply certain materials did not give rise to a contractual obligation to provide these particular materials. Thus, the books were not subject to any agreement for resale within the meaning of the Act.","This is an appeal by a supplier from the refusal by a receiver to release goods to the supplier pursuant to s.81.1 of the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act. The single issue is whether the judge erred in finding that the goods were subject to an agreement for sale at arms' length at the time the supplier presented a written demand for repossession. The fact that it intended to supply certain materials did not give rise to a contractual obligation to provide those materials. The order for review by counsel for the respondent and submission to the Court was allowed and an order was issued directing return of the goods or payment of their value. Counsel for the appellant was to prepare the order and submit the application for review. The respondent was to pay the appellant costs fixed at $1500 inclusive of costs. HELD: Appeal allowed per oral reasons. 1)The single issue in this case was whether the court erred. The judge held that once ITI had decided what course materials it would use, there was a binding contract to supply those materials to the students. He found that ITI was obliged by its contract with its students '...to provide, at its discretion, textbooks and courseware needed for the program...' and that the students acknowledged that'material changes may be made during the course of the student's program.' 2)The judge did not err in finding otherwise."

In making disclosure, the Crown appended a copy of the respondent's criminal record to its affidavit.

The Crown appealed the order which prohibited the judge from continuing as trial judge in respect to the respondent's criminal charges of impaired driving, driving with blood alcohol levels exceeding .08, and dangerous driving. HELD: The appeal was allowed. The order for prohibition was quashed and the matter was remitted to the Provincial Court for trial. There is abundant authority that disclosure of an accused's criminal record to the court alone does not amount to an automatic disqualification of the court on the ground of apprehended bias, appearance of bias or other prejudice to the accused. The judgment in R. v. Peters is almost directly on point. The judge in this case said she had not read the record, she was not biased as a result of the information tendered at the pre-trial proceedings and the record was something she could put out of her mind as she did in all instances where she ruled evidence inadmissible.

There is abundant authority that disclosure of an accused's criminal record to the court, whether composed of judge and jury or jury alone, does not amount to an automatic disqualification of the court on the grounds of apprehended bias, appearance of bias or other prejudice to the accused. Although it is the presiding judge to ensure a fair and public hearing, there is no law which guarantees that inadvertent, inadmissible evidence will not be introduced. Even if the exact statement alleged to have been made by the accused may not be revealed, it may be properly inferred that there would be no attempt to introduce it into evidence unless it tended to establish the guilt of the accused, such as statements by the respondent, or intercepted communications. The evidence complained of was inadvertently introduced. The Crown did not have to disclose to the trial judge any indication of a criminal record. 2)Every individual charged with a criminal offence is guaranteed the right to be presumed innocent until proven guilty according to law in an independent and impartial tribunal. Although there is an overriding faith in the jury system was clearly manifested by the Court, assuming that juries should be properly instructed as to the limited use which may be made of evidence that the accused was previously convicted of criminal offences, one must assume that trial judges fully comprehend those instructions. If an error of that nature should occur, the error should be ignored, or, if it is deemed too significant to be ignored by the judge, a mistrial should be declared, permitting a new hearing which will contain no record of the inadvertent error. 3)When the matter was raised with trial judge, she said that she had not read the record. If inadvertent errors should automatically result in termination of the proceedings, then more egregious, and perhaps deliberate, errors on the part of the Crown, or its witnesses, would necessitate no less result. 4)The appellant contends that the trial had not commenced as no evidence had been called and therefore it could not be said the trial was put into evidence at trial."
3_2004skqb374.txt,"FIAT: In 1996, the respondent was ordered to pay $600 per month as child support for his daughter. He now applies to reduce his support obligation and rescind the arrears which have accumulated. HELD: 1) In 1999, the respondent sold his ownership interest in a business and retained a one-third interest. In 2001, he was terminated from his full-time employment as a result of an unexplained absence from work after he received a suspension for insubordination. Since his termination, he has not obtained full-time employment. He has continued to work seasonally 3 months a year and earn the gross amount of $21,000. The Court found that it is the respondent's choice to work a minimum amount each year. It has been said that individuals, who are subject to support obligations, are entitled to make decisions in relation to their careers as long as the decisions are reasonable at the time having regard to the circumstances. The respondent's decision to work only three months a year and to possibly return to school is not reasonable. 2) For the purposes of this application, the respondent's income was imputed to be $40,000 and he was ordered to pay $328 per month as support for his daughter. 3) The sharing of the s. 7 special expenses should be based on the respondent's imputed income. 4) A retroactive variation of child support is warranted. The respondent commenced his application for variation in June 2002 and the chambers judge was of the view that any variation of support should be retroactive to September 2002.  In light of the fact the respondent's previous support obligation was tax deductible/tax inclusive, the petitioner may in fact benefit from a retroactive variation as the child support she will receive, pursuant to this order, will be payable on a net of tax basis.  5) Rule 608(2) provides that a successful party will be entitled to costs of a family law proceeding unless, pursuant to Rule 608(3), the successful party has behaved unreasonably or has acted in bad faith. The difficulty in the matter before me is determining whether or not the respondent has been successful. Although his support obligation decreases, his previous payment was tax deductible while his ongoing payment will be net of tax. It is very likely that the respondent's financial position has not changed as a result of the order. The Court also had grave concerns respecting the substantial delays in the proceedings caused by the respondent's unwillingness to provide financial disclosure. Costs were awarded to the petitioner in the sum of $750, as the discovery motion would not have been necessary had the respondent provided appropriate financial disclosure.","FIAT. The father of one child applied to reduce his child support obligation and rescind arrears which had accumulated under the previous order. HELD: 1) The father was ordered to pay $600 per month as child support. The mother's decision to work only 3 months of the year and return to school was not a reasonable decision when he had a continuing obligation to provide support for his child.  2) On all of the evidence, the father was underemployed and could not find employment paying a reasonable salary should he choose to return to work. 3) The child support application was adjourned sine die with direction to return the matter to court once the grievance filed by the father concerning his termination from Ipsco was determined by an arbitrator. It was clear from the evidence that the father had not pursued employment opportunities since his termination with Ipsco in June 2001 and had not made an adequate financial disclosure to the court. 4) The mother had submitted evidence respecting extracurricular activities and had requested an order for sharing of expenses relating to those activities in proportion to the parties' income. She also requested costs as against the father for the additional legal expenses associated with having to submit motions to the Court in order to force the father to disclose financial information.  5) Although the father's choice to work a minimum amount each year was tax deductible and tax inclusive, it will be his choice to attend school and severely limit his earnings for a significant period of time. 6) It was the father who made an aggressive and aggressive effort to obtain employment within the meaning of s. 19(1)(a) of the Federal Child Support Guidelines. He did not make an aggressive or aggressive attempt to locate employment. 7) The court was of the view that he had given up on finding employment and that he could find employment that would be payable on a net of tax basis."
4_1993canlii6771.txt,"Appeal from [1993]TWL QB93106 QB93p55. HELD: There was no tenable basis for interfering with the trial judge's decision to award custody to the father. An award of $700.00 a month spousal support was not unreasonable having regard for (i) the length of the relationship (approximately fifteen years), (ii) the husband's wage (approximately $55,000.00 per year) and (iii) the fact that the wife had seldom worked outside the home.","HELD: The application was dismissed. Having regard for the governing standard of appellate review, found in such cases as Pelech v.Pelech, [1987] 1 S.C.R. 801 at 824 and Talbot v.Henry, 1990 CanLII 264 (SK CA), [1990] 5 W.W.R.(Sask. C.A.) at 264), we can find no tenable basis for interfering with the trial judge's decision to grant custody of James (b.d. June 4, 1984) to his father, Harvey Fick. The trial judge chose to accept the testimony of the father's witness who testified as to relationships within the family over that of Tracy Fick's expert witness. He also found the mother's interpretation of events not to be credible."
4_1996canlii6648.txt,The applicant sought to have the law firm barred from acting for the plaintiff because a member of that firm had been active in representing the defendant prior to 1991 when the defendant changed lawyers following a change in government. This action was commenced after the change of solicitors and there was no suggestion that the subject matter of the action was ever the subject of any consultation between the defendant and its former solicitors. The applicant raised arguments about the confidential nature of its adjusting and investigation of loss claims and internal policy procedures and litigation strategies in relation to the denial of claims. HELD: The application was dismissed with costs to the respondent in any event of the cause. 1)In 1993 in a similar application respecting another member of the same law firm the judge ruled against the plaintiff. This was consistent with a similar attempt following the 1982 change of government.  2)The only identifiable strategy (or perhaps a tactic) adopted to date has been excessive delay requiring applications to force compliance with the Rules and two applications to deprive the plaintiff of its chosen legal representation. 3)Once it is determined that there is no actual knowledge of the case in question the onus to establish the existence of confidential information shifts to the party asserting the concern. 4)As the applicant is a public corporation it is doubtful it has or should have secret strategies with which to defeat persons claiming under its insurance scheme. It is entitled to have its own preordained policies in respect of disputed claims but if such policies exist they probably should be made known to the public for whose benefit the corporation exists. Also such policies may well have changed since 1992.,"The applicant seeks to have the solicitor barred from acting for the plaintiff by reason of being consistent with a prior ruling involving a similar attempt to displace the applicant's present solicitors from certain litigation then existing following a change of government in Saskatchewan. HELD: The application is dismissed with costs to the Respondent in any event of the cause. 1)The applicant was being followed by a similar ruling involving another solicitor who ruled against the plaintiff prior to 1991 when the defendant changed solicitors. In so doing the applicant was acting in a similar fashion to the one which had occurred in 1993 when the applicant ruled against another solicitor. 2)The information itself cannot be disclosed, however, it is reasonable to insist that the nature of the information be disclosed. 3)The solicitor was referred to as strategy counsel.  4)It was argued by the plaintiff that the situation in this case was exactly the same as previously decided because the subject matter of the action, the contractual issues giving rise to the cause of action, were never the subject of any consultation between the defendant and its former solicitors and therefore the onus to establish the existence of confidential information justifying the requested order shifts to the party asserting the concern."
4_2000skqb340.txt,"The plaintiff purchased a medical insurance policy from MSI for the time he expected to reside in the USA pursuing studies. The policy did not cover the periods he would be in Saskatchewan where he ordinarily resided with his parents. The plaintiff suffered chest pain following a water-skiing accident in August 1997 in Saskatchewan and underwent a thoracostomy for a collapsed lung while in Saskatchewan. He underwent a further thoracotomy in February 1998 while in the USA. MSI denied coverage arguing the plaintiff should have postponed the operation and returned to Saskatchewan for the surgery and that, in any event, the condition pre-existed the purchase of the insurance policy. The medical reports agreed that surgery was necessary. They also agreed it could be postponed for a time but there was disagreement over the length of any postponement or the patient's ability to travel home given the circumstance of a collapsed lung and the suspected but unconfirmed existence of a bleb. HELD: The plaintiff was awarded $26,864.46 plus costs, to be taxed. 1)The evidence that travel was dangerous and put the plaintiff's life in jeopardy was accepted. Therefore the plaintiff was unable to return to Saskatchewan for the surgery. 2)The exclusionary clause did not exempt MSI from liability for payment. The definition of a 'pre-existing condition' is not clear and does not operate to relieve MSI of its obligation under the policy to extend the benefits in question. The policy was in effect from August 1, 1997 to July 31, 1998. It was not raised in a letter confirming the dates of his coverage sent after the plaintiff had experienced the pneumothorax of which MSI had been informed.","The plaintiff purchased a medical insurance policy from the defendant for the period of time he expected to reside in Chicago, Illinois, U.S.A. pursuing his optometry studies. During that period, the plaintiff required medical attention and surgery, necessarily performed in Chicago for a condition undetected earlier by qualified medical personnel and therefore not a pre-existing condition as that term is defined in the policy. HELD: The plaintiff will have judgment for the sum of $26,864.46 prayed for in this action together with costs to be taxed. Neither of the quoted terms can be construed to relieve MSI of its obligation to pay. The plaintiff was unable to return to Saskatchewan for surgery."
4_2004skqb280.txt,"This was an application pursuant to The Inter-jurisdictional Support Orders Act for a declaration of paternity and child support. HELD: By agreement there was an order pursuant to s. 45 of The Children's Law Act, 1997 declaring the respondent the biological father of the child. The respondent does not currently earn sufficient income to pay child support. He was to advise the petitioner within 30 days if he receives an offer of employment or contract and if so, the terms of his employment including his gross income. 1) The respondent's ability to earn income is limited by his health to sedentary types of employment. There is no suggestion or evidence that his pursuit of education is unreasonable.  2) An individual who chooses to be underemployed or unemployed to avoid paying child support is 'intentionally underemployed or unemployed'. That is not the only circumstance envisioned by s. 19(1)(a) of the Guidelines. The Court adopted the reasoning of the Manitoba Court of Appeal in Donovan v. Donovan and the Ontario Court of Appeal in Drygala v. Pauli and found that 'intentional' extends to situations where a parent required to pay child support chooses, for whatever reason, to earn less than they are capable of earning. The fact that the parent chooses to be underemployed or unemployed, brings their situation within the meaning of 'intentional' and creates the circumstances envisioned by s. 19(1)(a). The reason for such a choice does not change the fact it is intentional, but it may impact on the Court's decision whether to exercise its discretion and impute income.","FIAT: This is an application pursuant to the Inter-jurisdictional Support Orders Act (ISSA) for a declaration of paternity and child support. The parties never lived together but had an intimate relationship which resulted in the birth of a child. HELD: 1) As Mr. [E.H.]'s current income is below the amount normally required for Table support, no support shall be ordered at this time. 2) The applicant has not provided the necessary evidence to establish that any continued unemployment is unintentional or, if intentional, that it is reasonable in the circumstances and does not warrant the imputation of income. 3) The court must consider what is reasonable under the circumstances. The applicant must lead cogent evidence to determine why the table amount would cause undue hardship. The court cannot be excused from his or her child support obligations in furtherance of unrealistic or unproductive career aspirations. The onus is on the applicant to establish whether he has the legal responsibility for another child or children and/or because the standard of living of the applicant's household is lower than that of the other spouse."
4_2004skqb516.txt,"The accused applies by notice of motion to quash the search warrants that were issued authorizing the search of his residence and to exclude any evidence obtained as a result of the search. The application alleges a violation of the accused's s. 8 Charter rights. HELD: Although the search warrants relied upon in this case are invalid and the resultant search of the accused's premises was a violation of his s.8 Charter rights, nevertheless, the facts and all the circumstances do not satisfy the Court that the admission of the evidence would bring the administration of justice into disrepute. The application to exclude the evidence is dismissed.  1) The Crown stipulated the s. 487 Criminal Code warrant is invalid. That leaves the validity of s. 11 of Controlled Drugs and Substances Act (CDSA). 2) The CDSA warrant is invalid in that it does not sufficiently or adequately state the offences in respect of which the warrant was issued. The search was therefore warrantless. 3) The evidence seized was non-conscriptive and so its admission would not render the trial unfair. 4) There was no bad faith, malice or intentional omission involved in the preparation of the warrants. The officer was negligent in failing to review the applicable sections and forms of the Code and the CDSA. The absence of any malevolent intention, while it does not bear on the validity of the warrants, has some bearing in the s. 24(2) Charter analysis. 5) The existence of reasonable and probable grounds to obtain the search warrants to search the accused's residential premises, together with the seizure of $750,000 in cash from the accused's residence as a result of the search, fulfill a number of the circumstances under s. 24(2) of the Charter.","Cst. Olberg applied for and obtained two search warrants pursuant to s. 487 of the Criminal Code and s. 11 of the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act. The search of the accused's residence was the culmination of an investigation that concerned alleged illegal cross-border drug trafficking between the United States and Canada. These investigations were outlined in and the subject matter of two Informations to Obtain the Code and CDSA Warrants. HELD: The evidence satisfied that there was no bad faith, malice or intentional omission involved in the preparation of the warrants. Even though the Code Warrant is invalid the CDSA Warrant does meet the minimum lawful requirements and therefore the seizure of the property from inside the dwelling and the vehicles and equipment seized from the surrounding premises are legal and valid. In the context of s. 24(2) Charter considerations, the Crown argued that if both warrants were found to be invalid, the resultant search of Smith's residence and its surrounding premises was warrantless. The items seized during the search ought to be excluded as evidence at his upcoming trial. The evidence seized in this case was non-conscriptive within the meaning of R. v. Stillman, 1997 CanLII 384 (SCC), [1997] 1 S.C.R. 607."
4_2005skqb265.txt,"The respondent applies to vary his 1992 divorce judgment to fix support for his oldest son, who resides with him, retroactive to August 2004 and to terminate the payment to his former spouse for him. In March 2005, this Court made an order fixing the parties incomes and providing for ongoing support for this son of $129 per month. The sole issue is whether these orders should be made retroactive. HELD: It is fair and equitable to terminate the respondent's obligation to pay $670 per month for the oldest son effective August 2004 and to make the petitioner's support payments for him retroactive to that date.  1) This Court favours an approach to retroactive child support that leaves the decision to the discretion of the Court. In exercising that discretion, the Court must keep in mind the objectives of the Guidelines and take into consideration the circumstances of each individual case. 2) The Court must consider whether the application is interim or final, the objectives of the Guidelines, the same factors should apply to retroactive orders whether they increase or decrease child support and whether they are pursuant to federal or provincial legislation, and the individual facts of each case must be considered to ensure that parents are jointly responsible for the support of their children and the principles of fairness and equity are met. If the Court decides to order retroactive support then, pursuant to s. 15(6.1) of the Divorce Act, it must do so in accordance with the Guidelines. 3) By February 2004, the respondent had written to the petitioner, putting her on notice that he wanted the payment to terminate because the oldest son was residing with him. The petitioner refused even though the son had very little contact with her. There was no justification for the payment to continue. It is difficult to understand her failure to provide support for this son while at the same time insisting on the continuation of the respondent's payment for that same son, who was spending no time with her.","FIAT: Mr. Gore-Hickman applies to vary his February 28, 1992 divorce judgment to fix support for his oldest son, who resides with him retroactive to August 1, 2004 and to terminate the payment to his former spouse for August 2004. HELD: The Court finds that the Guidelines apply to applications for retroactive support pursuant to the Divorce Act. The Court also finds that there is a presumption in favour of retroactive child support to the date the order was granted and that the resources needed for its payment may no longer be available. There is no provision in the Guidelines for determining when and from what date a retroactive order is appropriate."

The learned judge did not make an error in law.","The appellant appeals a judgment of the Provincial Court made pursuant to s. 39 of The Small Claims Act, 1997, s. s. 1997, as am. (the “Act”). HELD: The appeal is dismissed. The findings of fact by the trial judge are reasonably supported by the evidence and there is no palpable and overriding error. Nor did the learned trial judge make an error of law based on the standard of correctness. The trial judge erred in allowing the Plaintiffs claim against a body corporate duly registered in the Province of Saskatchewan when it had agreed to honour its warranty by repairing the transmission provided the plaintiff bring the same to the Defendant to have it repaired. The respondent shall not take any steps to enforce the judgment within 30 days, to enable the appellant to comply with the terms and condition of the sale. The judgment is contrary to the law, the evidence, the weight of evidence and the standard. Housen v. Nikolaisen, 2002 SCC 33 (CanLII), [2002] S.C.R. 235 (Q.C.) and (City) v. Kivela (2006) SKCA 38 (R.A.1) as am., and the Queen's Bench Rules apply. Costs are awarded to the respondent of $150.00 in lieu of taxation based on Schedule D of the tariff of costs and the respondent shall take no further steps to either enforce or comply with this judgment. The appellant shall not be forced to comply. The court found that the judgment was contrary to The Law, the Evidence and the Weight of Evidence and that it erred by allowing the plaintiffs claim against DAN LEONARD AUTO SALES LTD. (RESPONDENT) when it was allowed in allowing its claim against the plaintiff to be dismissed when it agreed to pay $150 for a transmission replacement and that the plaintiff had agreed as term and condition to the sale of the said vehicle, which had an odometer reading in excess of 300,000 kilometers, that the Defendant would reduce the sale price from $4,995.00 to $3,360.00 provided the Plaintiff accept the vehicle which needed some repair to the steering mechanism. There were numerous other grounds as may come to the attention of the appellant upon receipt of the transcript of the evidence given at the trial.

4_2010nssc85.txt,"The parties were separated and had difficulty communicating. They were together for eight years, and had two children (ages six and three). The husband had interim care and sought sole custody/primary care, while the wife wanted shared custody (50/50). She alleged the husband was abusive. The evidence showed she unreasonably refused to cooperate with him in relation to matters concerning the children. Sole custody/primary care to the father, with access to the mother as per the interim arrangement (every second weekend and other times). The mother was not credible and her allegations of abuse unfounded. If a party expects the court to believe there was domestic abuse, their position on parenting should reflect that. Shared custody arrangements require cooperation and the ability to jointly plan. Similarly, joint custody requires a level of cooperation. A requirement to make decisions jointly is not in the children's best interests if it leads to conflict and creates a potential power imbalance. Looking at the nature and extent of the parents' conflict, sole custody is appropriate until there has been an established track record of respectful parenting.","HELD: The Court granted shared parenting with the husband. The children were placed in the husband's sole care and custody. The Court found that the wife's allegations of abuse were unfounded. The nature and cause of conflict between the parties was that the husband was abusive of the wife and the children had little face to face communication with the wife. The court found that there was no evidence the wife had actually harmed the children and that the child would not be exposed to the abuse if it were not for the wife’s repeated repeated requests to the husband to provide more time and attention to the children. The wife had been given opportunities to be involved in the parenting of the oldest child. However, she did not appear to be a credible witness and her allegation that she would not allot funds from her pay directly to the wife was untrue."

During re-examination of the final Crown witness, and after the defence had concluded its cross-examination of the witness, it became apparent that the disclosure package given to both the Crown and Defence did not include the bottom portion of the Intoxilizer Operator's Checklist because it had been cut off during photocopying. During the defence cross-examination, the officer testified that he could not recall if the accused had slurred speech. In re-direct, the Crown showed the officer the original Intoxilizer Operator's Checklist and the officer confirmed that it listed slurred speech in the observations section.  The accused applied for relief under s. 24(1) of the Charter alleging a breach of his right to make full answer and defence. HELD: The defence lawyer did not know the full content of the Intoxilizer Operator's Checksheet until after he had completed his cross-examination of the author of the document. The Court was satisfied that if the defence lawyer had been aware of what was noted in the document, he would not have challenged the officer on his failure to mention that the accused's speech was slurred because he would have been able to predict that such a question would result in re-direct by the Crown. The accused suffered actual prejudice in his right to make full answer and defence and a breach of s. 7 is made out. While the Court cannot attribute bad faith to either the RCMP or the Crown, the Court was satisfied that the prosecutor referred to the original checksheet during its re-examination of the officer without taking sufficient time and care to ensure that the original was what had been disclosed to the Crown and Defence. This is an exceptional case where the lack of full disclosure and the time at which it was discovered rendered the trial unfair in a way that can only be remedied by excluding the evidence under s. 24(1).","The accused applied to the Court pursuant to s.24(1) and s.2(2) of the Charter for remedies, which include a stay of the impaired driving charge, an order for a mistrial on that count, a direction that the Crown prosecutor be allowed to further cross-examine Crown witnesses and an order excluding evidence. HELD: The accused's right to make full answer and defence was infringed. The Court found that bad faith was the cause of the lack of disclosure on the part of either Cst. Granrude or Mr. Stricker. The officer inadvertently failed to copy the full extent of the Operational Checksheets, and the incomplete copy went to both the defence lawyer and the Crown Prosecutor. The prosecutor referred to the original Checksheet during the Crown's re-direct testimony and introduced the Checksheet into evidence without taking sufficient time and care to ensure that the original was what he had in his file and what had been disclosed to the defence. The accused suffered actual prejudice in his right to reply to questions and was satisfied on a balance of probabilities that his rights under s.7 were infringed on."

The plaintiff alleged that the equipment sold never worked properly and sought damages for breach of contract and, in the alternative, damages for fraudulent misrepresentation, damages for negligent misrepresentation, and damages for unjust enrichment in the amount of $20,000. HELD: The Court dismissed the action as the plaintiff did not establish its case on a balance of probabilities.  The Limitations Act applies and the action was barred. The defendant agreed to supply and install the equipment which was done; there was no agreement to maintain, service or reprogram equipment. There was no material misrepresentation or fraud or concealment of facts, nor unjust enrichment.","The plaintiff sold business equipment to the defendant in September of 2007. The defendant alleges that the equipment sold never worked properly and seeks damages for breach of contract and in the alternative, damages for negligent misrepresentation, damage for unjust enrichment, all in the amount of $20,000. The majority of the facts are not in serious dispute. The plaintiff operates the Whitewood Inn and in September 2007 entered into an agreement with the defendant to supply and install business equipment. The equipment consisted of two groups of computerized business equipment which can be loosely categorized as the Cash Equipment and the Camera Equipment. The Cash Equipment as its name implies is designed to enter and receive payments for purchases at the Inn, mostly restaurant purchases. The Equipment was never installed properly and is unusable. The Defendant supplied the equipment that they agreed to provide and in their view, and installed correctly. There was no material representation and no fraud. HELD: The plaintiff has not established any element of its case on a balance of probabilities and the Court dismissed the action. 1)There is no evidence of fraud or any concealment of facts that would allow the plaintiff's claim to succeed. The evidence from the evidence is that the defendant completed his part of the transaction and that despite repeated efforts by his technicians and repeated calls to BMR, the equipment was never found to be working properly. 2)There was no evidence that there was any material representation or fraud. The court found that the plaintiff signed an agreement to supply the business equipment and install the equipment and that in the view of the evidence, the Defendant completed the transaction. The Court concluded that there is no fraud or theft or unjust enrichment. 3)The plaintiff has always made his payments and the equipment has been in the exclusive possession of the Plaintiff at all material times. The Plaintiff has never been held responsible for any loss of money or loss of property. 4)The Court found that there were no material representations or breaches of contract between the parties and that the essential element of the cause of action is equipment rental only. The defendants have not done this and despite continuing to make all the regular payments on that equipment, have done nothing further to ensure that it is working for the purposes for which it was designed. 5)The court concluded that the claim of the plaintiff is statute barred as any agreement they had was entered into prior to October 2007.

4_2014skqb177.txt,"Civil Procedure – Pleadings – Statement of Claim – Striking OutCivil Procedure – Queen’s Bench Rule 7-9 The plaintiffs commenced an action against the defendants that included three causes of action: a claim against Xtreme Mining and Banga for wrongful dismissal; a claim for defamation brought against Banga; and for inducing breach of contract against Potash Corp. The defendants, Xtreme and Banga, brought an application pursuant to Queen’s Bench rules 7-9(1), (2), and 13-8 for an order that portions of the statement of claim be struck out as immaterial. The plaintiffs included in their pleadings regarding the first cause of action paragraphs that described the details of the plaintiff Bell’s business and real property, which he owned before he was hired by the applicants. Regarding the plaintiff’s pleadings respecting the second cause of action, they included details of the plaintiff Bell’s health condition at the time he was dismissed from employment. The plaintiffs pleaded a description of the contents of a meeting between them, Banga and his legal counsel in connection with the second cause, which, if proven, would establish that the plaintiffs were not responsible for acts of intimidation and that the defendants dismissed the plaintiffs for an improper and malicious purpose. The facts were material to the issue of wrongful dismissal and defamation. The other paragraphs that were considered immaterial by the applicants dealt with remarks made by Banga to the media. HELD: The court dismissed the application with respect to the plaintiffs’ pleadings about the plaintiff’s prior business and health condition. Similarly, the plaintiffs’ pleadings with regards to the meeting were not struck, nor were the paragraphs related to the reporting in the media as the plaintiffs were not certain of the exact words used by the defendant, and therefore could not draft anything at that time. It allowed the application respecting the pleadings that related to an individual who was not a party and struck the paragraphs in question as irrelevant and immaterial.","The plaintiffs commenced an action against the defendants, Xtreme Mining & Demolition Inc., and the Potash Corporation of Saskatchewan. The statement of claim contains 87 paragraphs and advances fundamental causes of action. The first claim, wrongful dismissal, is advanced by the plaintiffs. The second cause of action, inducing breach of contract, is brought against the defendant. The statements of media outlets reproduced at para. 67(a), (c) and (d) of the Statement of Claim describe the alleged defamatory statements with sufficient certainty, clarity and precision that the defendants ought to be fully equipped to respond. Further, the statements of several media outlets are also included in the pleadings. HELD: 1) The pleadings contain no extrinsic evidence and as the claim is not based upon innuendo, they are immaterial to the plaintiffs' actions in defamation and that traversing them will only engage the parties in issues that are unrelated to the real issues at stake. 2) There is no evidence to support the claim for moral damages. Rather, there is circumstantial evidence that the plaintiffs made threats to kill other employees and engage in violence and intimidation that prevented other staff from doing their jobs. 3) While there is some evidence that some of the alleged threats were made by members of the Hells Angels motorcycle club, others are irrelevant. There is nothing to suggest that these statements were made in an effort to prove their allegation that the defendant defamed them and their evidentiary facts contrary to prevailing Canadian jurisprudence. 4) The facts presented in this pleadings do not assist in determining what the defendants did and do not offer assistance as to why the plaintiff says it legally matters. The only thing that does assist is the fact that the statements are made by the defendants. The defendants should not have to plead what their recall was of any meeting and the matters that transpired at any meeting in response to such an improper pleading and that they would be prejudiced by being required to plead evidence as that would be tantamount to providing discovery at the pleading stage. 5) The information contained in paragraph 67 is irrelevant as it is immaterial, redundant or unnecessarily lengthy and it is plainly material to the issues of wrongful dismissal and any damages, including moral damages, flowing therefrom. 6) The statements are also irrelevant as they establish pattern of behaviour on the part of the defendant that raises the presence of bad faith in the defendants' dismissal of the Plaintiffs."

The 41 month lease required a monthly rental of $500 for the first five months and thereafter semi-annual payments of $5,000. The tenants had not paid any rent in 1998 nor had they maintained insurance; they installed alternating stalls in the barn in breach of their covenant not to make any alterations or additions to the premises; breached the express and implied covenants to keep the premises in good condition and tenantable repair by their failure to remove and properly dispose of baler twine, to maintain proper weed control or to remove manure buildup in the calf barn. The tenants admitted the rental payment was due in May but claimed the landlord breached the pre-condition wherein Russell's husband promised to repair the damage caused by a 1995 hail storm.

The matter should not be decided summarily where there are questions of fact or law. The hail damage may allow the tenants to claim in damages against the landlord but it could not be construed as a debt due for the purposes of s27 of the Landlord and Tenant Act.

In June 1995 he began to experience pain in his back which slowly worsened until he was hospitalized in October 1995. He was diagnosed with a large central and right sided disc herniation. SGI denied his claim for income replacement benefits as a non-earner under s.117(1) of the Automobile Accident Insurance Act. In issue was whether the accident caused the disc herniation. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. The plaintiff had not met the onus on him of establishing causation on a balance of probabilities. Two family physicians supported his contention but the medical director of rehabilitation services for SGI and the orthopaedic surgeon who treated the applicant were both of the opinion the herniation was not caused by the accident.,"The applicant, who sustained an injury to his lower back in an automobile accident, applied for income replacement benefits contending that the accident did not cause the disc herniation. The respondent, Saskatchewan Government Insurance, denied the application. The applicant applied for unemployment benefits as a non-earner pursuant to s. 117(1) of the Act. HELD: The applicant's appeal was dismissed. 1)All of the evidence leads me to conclude that the plaintiff has not met the onus on establishing causation on a balance of probabilities. His appeal is dismissed. 2)Accident is defined in s.100(1)(a) as any event in which bodily injury is caused by an automobile. The onus is on the applicant to establish his claim to the benefits on balance. He is trying to relate this all to his previous accident but have told him that the discheriation coincided with the marked exacerbation and right leg pain in late October 1995. 3)A review of all the evidence in support of Dr. Flotre's opinion was supported by Dr. Stewart, the orthopaedic surgeon who also opined that the hernia was not caused by the accident. Dr. Dindo was his family physician prior to the accident and was not diagnosed as suffering from a herniated disc or from any injury or dysfunction of the discs. He was generally in good health and had no back problems. 4)The court found that for a period of time after the disc hers was unable to hold the employment he could have held at the time of the accident, it would worsen the symptoms."

The plaintiff claimed the creditor wrongfully converted monies after a full and final settlement of his account for a lesser sum ($2,000 on a $15,600 account). He sought punitive damages for 'high-handed and malicious behaviour'. The plaintiff assigned his future crop insurance benefits and Canadian Wheat Board payments for application to his outstanding account in May 2001. In June 2001 a farmhand had an accident, while operating his employer's unlicensed vehicle. An occupant of the other vehicle in the accident was critically injured and died. The defendant says it was subsequently induced to settle the debt for a lesser sum by the plaintiff's false representation that SGI was suing him for between $200,000 and $300,000; that he would be found liable and would likely make an assignment in bankruptcy, making the account uncollectible. SGI initiated proceedings against the plaintiff in May 2002 claiming $17,660.

5_2008nspc12.txt,"A youth was arrested and charged with possession of a stolen motor vehicle after the vehicle arrived near the location of a pre-arranged drug transaction. The youth was later charged with possession for the purposes of trafficking after a strip search conducted at the police station resulted in a quantity of crack cocaine being removed from his underwear. A voir dire was held to determine the lawfulness of the strip search and the admissibility of the cocaine seized. The evidence is admissible; there was no breach of s. 8 of the Charter and, in the event that there had been a breach of s.8, the admission of the evidence would not bring the administration of justice into disrepute. The strip search was incident to arrest and conducted in a reasonable manner, being reasonably quick and non-invasive. There is nothing in the Youth Criminal Justice Act or the common law which requires that young persons be afforded the opportunity to consult with counsel or a parent or guardian prior to a search. This was real evidence, the admission of which would not affect trial fairness; any breach was conducted in good faith; the search was motivated by a sense of urgency; and significant efforts were made to respect the privacy and personal integrity of the young person.","A young person was charged with having in his possession for the purpose of trafficking, crack cocaine contrary to s. 5(2) of the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act. The strip search was lawful and there was no breach of s. 8 of the Charter. In the event of a Charter breach, the evidence would nonetheless be ruled admissible. The burden is on the applicant, the defence, to establish on balance of probabilities that the admission of the drugs located on the person of the accused would render the trial unfair. There is nothing in the YCJA or the common law however that requires that young persons be afforded an opportunity to consult counsel and/or parent or guardian prior to a police strip search. Their exclusion would end the prosecution and that would surely call into question the reputation of the administration of justice. The evidence sought to be excluded is 17.8 grams of crack cocaine. It is real, non-conscripted evidence which existed irrespective on any Charter breach. It must be governed by the need to preserve the evidence and prevent its disposal by the arrestee."
5_2011nspc8.txt,"The defendant entered into a plea agreement to a charge of sexually assaulting his young son but, shortly before the sentencing hearing, he applied to withdraw his guilty plea on the basis that he had not been fully informed of the nature of the allegations, partly due to a communication issue (English was not his first language) and partly because he had not viewed the video of his son's statement to the police prior to the plea. He did not accept the Crown's version of the incident and had not fully understood the effect and consequences of his plea, especially its effect on his ability to have contact with his son. The defendant argued that he thought the charge was based upon an incident where he had touched his son's penis for the purpose of showing him how to clean it as opposed to the Crown's assertion that he had masturbated his son and himself while viewing pornography. Application to withdraw guilty plea dismissed; the defendant's evidence regarding his knowledge of the facts alleged by the Crown in relation to the sexual assault was inconsistent and the court was not convinced that either his failure to see the video of his son's statement or a language/communication issue had prevented him from having a full understanding of the specific allegation of the sexual assault. The defendant's motivation for pleading guilty did not alter his knowledge and understanding of the nature of the allegation nor his understanding that he was, by his plea, admitting to that allegation.",The accused was found guilty of sexual assault of his son contrary to s. 271(1)(a) of the Criminal Code and further that he had committed sexual assault on his son while watching porn and masturbating. The accused had pled guilty to the sexual assault charge. Application dismissed; the accused's evidence regarding his lack of knowledge of the nature of the allegation was not credible; nor that a language/communication issue prevented him from having a full understanding of the specific allegation. The Court was not persuaded that the accused had not seen the video of the complainant's statement to the police although it had been disclosed to his lawyer.
5_2012skqb544.txt,"The accused was charged with second degree murder and two counts of aggravated assault. The accused made an O'Connor application for third party records relating to the two surviving Crown witnesses. In particular, the accused sought disclosure of police reports, videotaped evidence, witness statements, warned statements regarding the multiple arrests and charges incurred by the victims and disclosure of their criminal records. In 2012 SKQB 543, the Court ordered production of the records. This decision deals with whether the documents should be produced to the accused. HELD: The documents were disclosed to the accused. The judge vetted the documents to black out words, phrases or numbers that have no probative value or where the privacy interest of the witness would have been unjustifiably affected.","The Court directed the Crown to seek from the relevant police agencies or prosecution service the police reports and witness statements of the accused and in respect of two Crown witnesses, the alleged victims of two aggravated assaults, the accused, and the alleged witnesses, in relation of particular offences for which the accused had previously been convicted. HELD: The Court ordered the release of all 95 pages of documents to counsel for the accused. The documents had words, phrases or numbers that appeared to have blacked out where the information had no probative value or where the privacy interest of the witness would have been unjustifiably affected. Copies of the documents were made available to counsel and to Crown counsel in sealed envelopes. The original packet of documents filed by the Crown will be retained by the Court until the trial is completed, including any possible appeals. The court ordered that the documents be released under the conditions set forth in R. v. O’Connor, 1995 CanLII 51 (QL). The court reviewed the records, and considered all of the factors referred to in the jurisprudence. It found that the accused’s interest in obtaining disclosure for the purpose of making full answer and defence outweighed any residual privacy interest held by third parties in the material."
5_2013skqb237.txt,"The accused was charged with one count of impaired driving and one count of operating a motor vehicle while his blood alcohol content exceeded .08, contrary to ss. 253(1)(a) and 253(1)(b) of the Criminal Code. After trial, the accused was found not guilty on both charges. The Crown appealed on the basis that the trial judge erred in law in finding that the accused's rights were violated pursuant to s. 10(b) of the Charter and by excluding the evidence pursuant to s. 24(2) of the Charter. The accused was stopped by RCMP at 2:47 am to check his licence, registration, and sobriety. There were no driving irregularities leading to the stop. The officer noted a slight smell of alcohol and the accused blew a 'fail' on the roadside screening device. The accused indicated at roadside that he would like to contact a lawyer. At the detachment, the accused was asked which lawyer he wanted to contact and the accused gave a name to which the officer misunderstood. A search for the misunderstood name by the officer did not result in any findings. A search for a second name given by the accused resulted in 60 persons and the officer did not pursue any of them. The officer suggested legal aid but the accused refused. The accused was never provided a phone or a phonebook. The accused subsequently indicated that he understood the waiver regarding legal counsel and that he did not want to contact one. The accused did not recall this waiver. The accused indicated that he provided breath samples right away because he thought the officer was in a hurry and he understood that if he did not provide breath samples he was automatically guilty. The accused's readings were .11 and .04. The trial judge held that the accused was not given a reasonable opportunity to exercise his right to counsel of his choice and that the appropriate remedy was to exclude the breath sample results. HELD: The appeal was not successful. Whether there has been a Charter breach and whether evidence should thus be excluded are both questions of law reviewable on a standard of correctness. There is both an informational component and an implementational component to s. 10(b). The implementational component was the one of concern because the accused was not provided with the opportunity to consult counsel of his choice. The appeal court had to determine who was responsible for that failure. The failure was that of the officer first in misunderstanding the lawyer's name, then in not asking the accused the name again, and then in abandoning the search of the second lawyer when too many names were returned. The waiver did not remedy the situation because the accused did not fully understand it and it was therefore not effective. The trial judge did not err in finding that the accused`s s. 10(b) rights were breached. The trial judge correctly applied the test for s. 24(2) and the finding that the admission of the breath samples would bring the administration of justice into disrepute was not set aside.","The accused was charged with impaired driving and operating a motor vehicle contrary to s. 253(1)(a) of the Criminal Code and with exceeding 80 milligrams of alcohol in 100 millilitres of blood. The accused had consumed four or five drinks. There was no other observable sign of impairment. The officer asked the accused to enter the police vehicle where he asked him to provide sample of his breath into an approved screening device. When the accused complied, the instrument registered 'fail'. The accused was arrested for impaired driving. He appealed. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. 1)The trial judge addressed the factors and correctly applied the test. The trial judge did not commit an error of law. The fact that the accused was not given an opportunity to consult counsel of his choice was not a sufficient reason to exclude the certificate of analysis from the search. 2)The officer did not act in haste to obtain the results of the analysis of breath samples of the accused. He did not fail to understand the meaning of s. 10(b) nor did he fail to comprehend that there was evidence to support both findings and there was no error in law.  3)The Court reviewed the facts and circumstances and the law. It found that the trial judge erred in law by excluding evidence pursuant to ss. 24(2) and s. 23(2). The Court found that when the officer misunderstood the name of the lawyer desired and requested by the accused, the result was that the name could not be understood or heard as 'Vagnan'. There really was no similarity between the name and the name. 4)The accused's attitude was not fully comprehended at the time of the search nor did it reduce the officer's power to act in a timely fashion."
5_2014skpc78.txt,"Constitutional Law – Charter of Rights, Section 8Criminal Law – Sexual Touching – Child VictimThe accused was charged that she did, with a sexual purpose, invite a person under the age of 16 years to touch a part of her body contrary to s. 152 of the Criminal Code. The case involved alleged improper acts by the accused with respect to her eight-year-old son. The information regarding the alleged incident had been given by the accused’s son to her husband. The parties were separated. The husband apparently involved a child protection worker, who interviewed the child. After this RCMP were contacted. On the basis of an RCMP’s affidavit, an ITO was prepared and a search warrant obtained. During the search, the accused’s cell phone was seized and photographs were found on it. They showed the accused lying naked on a bed with her breasts and vaginal area covered and showing her son in his pajamas, holding a bottle of lotion and touching her legs, feet and stomach. Before trial, defence counsel requested that a voir dire be held for the purpose of determining whether the information to obtain the search warrant (ITO) was sufficiently defective that the warrant was invalid, thereby infringing s. 8 of the Charter and that the evidence obtained should be excluded. The ITO did not allege that the commission of sexual assault or the creation of child pornography. The search warrant though authorized a search for images of explicit sexual activity with a person under the age of 18, with emphasis on sexual organs and the anal region, which were not related to the offence alleged to have been committed and was not supported by the ITO. The warrant authorized the search and search of devices that included cameras capable of storing images or data and computers or any other electronic devices as well as conventional photographs depicting sexual activity as described above. However, the warrant to search specifically stated that the police were authorized to search for the said “things and to bring them before or some other justice”. When the search warrant was executed, about three constables and a social worker went to the accused’s home. She was in her bedroom and was very upset when advised that there would be a search of her house. She was arrested for obstruction when she objected to the police looking at a computer, taken into custody and removed from the house to a police vehicle. During the ensuing search, one officer looked through a computer, searching for pictures. He testified that he had done so as “previewing for relevancy” and had in fact, found relevant photographs. Another constable, who had not reviewed the warrant, searched the accused’s purse and found a cell phone, which was an item not included in the warrant. Other issues raised by the defence included that the information contained in the affidavit had not met the test of establishing that an offence had been committed and that misleading information had been included. The affidavit had identified that the search was for explicit sexual pictures that did not correspond to the information obtained from the child, who was the only source of information of the alleged offence. The information in the ITO came from a number of different sources, including the original complaint by the accused’s husband who was engaged in a matrimonial dispute with her. The husband had made a number of complaints against his wife in the past, none of which resulted in a conviction. The officer who swore the affidavit had not differentiated between information obtained by him and information from third party sources. The officer also set out information, including photographs, he had obtained from an Internet search that pertained to the accused as a lingerie model. The purpose of including the information was not made clear. The officer did not disclose in the ITO the detailed nature of the information disclosed by the child to the child protection worker, which would have had the potential to detract from the likelihood of an offence having been committed, such as the accused asking her son to massage her because she was sore. The child stated that he did not believe that he had been sexually abused. Furthermore, the child identified the photographer, but the police had not interviewed him. The issues before the Court were: 1) if the Warrant to Search was valid in view of the issues raised with respect to the completeness and validity of the ITO; 2) if the search of the computer conducted on the premises was legal, either because of the rules established in R. v. Vu or because of the wording of the warrant itself; and 3) if there was a breach or breaches of the Charter, should the evidence be excluded?  HELD: The Court found with respect to the issues that: 1) the ITO could not support the issue of the warrant by a justice acting judicially in considering the effect of the statements in the ITO regarding modelling and the omission of the information in the child protection worker’s report, that the husband of the accused had previously made allegations against her, the misleading statement in the ITO concerning the specific types of pictures that the officers would search for, suggesting an investigation of more serious activity not supported by the information provided. The Warrant to Search was a nullity and the search unlawful; 2) the search of the computer on the premises was illegal both in terms of its violation of the terms of the warrant and because the Supreme Court decided in Vu that a warrant must expressly grant the authority to search a computer; and 3) the evidence from the illegal search of the computer was excluded. The breach of the accused’s s. 8 Charter right was serious because of the negligence shown by the police in their investigation of the complaint, the drafting of the ITO and the execution of the warrant. The impact of the breach on the accused was serious. Her entire home was unlawfully searched as well. The effect of the search was emotional and upsetting to the accused and resulted in her arrest. The interests of society in the administration of justice will be protected because the exclusion of the evidence would not be determinative of the Crown’s case.","The accused was charged with sexual assault and invitation to sexual touching contrary to s. 152 of the Criminal Code. The accused alleged improper acts by the accused to her eight-year-old son, specifically massaging her in the nude while an adult male took photographs of the occurrence. The search was conducted immediately on the premises, and without further authorization or authorization as is now required in R. v. Vu, supra. The court found that the information to obtain the search warrant was sufficiently defective that it was invalid, thereby infringing section of the Charter, and that evidence obtained should be excluded. HELD: The Court held that the ITO could not, in the form presented, support the issue of the warrant by a justice acting judicially."

There was no record of any conveyances by either of the parties. 4)The issue of possession was not resolved by the filing of frivolous objections but rather by the discovery of a missing frontage."
6_1999canlii12377.txt,"A charge of failing to yield, contrary to s.50(3) of the Highway Traffic Act. The collision caused extensive damage to the defendant's vehicle and totaled the second. Two passengers were knocked unconscious. One sustained a bruised collar bone and the other required stitches to the head. HELD: The defendant was found not guilty. His action did not fall short of the standard of care demanded of ordinary prudent drivers faced with similar circumstances. The defence of due diligence was established with respect to the failing to yield. The second requirement of s.50(3) is that the defendant shall not make a turn until he has afforded a reasonable opportunity to the approaching vehicle to avoid a collision. It was found as a fact that that when he commenced his turn, any lawfully vehicle approaching from the opposite direction would have been able to avoid the collision.  1)Since the defendant turned across the path of the on-coming vehicle and since they came into collision, it would appear prima facie that he failed to yield as required by s.50(3). The right of way, however, is not absolute. As most regulatory offences s. 50(3) is an offence of strict liability which means that once it is established the defendant did the prohibited act, it is open to him to establish a defence of due diligence on a balance of probabilities. 2)Speeding by the second vehicle was a contributing factor. It could not be determined whether the second vehicle had only its parking lights on. Neither road nor weather conditions appeared to have been a factor. Alcohol was not a factor. Visibility was reasonably good given the time of day and the fact the intersection was lit by street lights. 3)When the defendant commenced his turn across the path of the second vehicle he was entitled to assume it was safe to do so as there did not appear to be any other vehicle close enough to the intersection to present a hazard.","This was a charge of failing to yield contrary to s. 50(3) of The Highway Traffic Act. The defendant was proceeding north on 15th Avenue when he stopped at an intersection for several south-bound vehicles to go by. Before turning left, he saw another vehicle approaching from the opposite direction, this one a 1987 Ford Tempo driven by Adrianna Wormworth. HELD: 1)The defendant was entitled to assume that it was safe to do so, as there did not appear to be any other vehicles close enough to the intersection to present a hazard. 2)The court found that the defendant did not fall short of the standard of care demanded of ordinary drivers faced with similar circumstances, and that with respect to the failure to yield, the defence of due diligence was established. 3)The evidence of the drivers and their passengers and to all of the circumstances did not suggest a reasonable amount of skill in the handling of a vehicle which is a potential source of danger to other users of the road. The vehicle probably approached and entered the intersection too fast for the defendant to take appropriate evasive action. It means that if vehicle has the right to proceed, then it must be allowed to proceed first."
6_2003skqb61.txt,"FIAT. An application by two siblings to act as personal decision makers and property guardians for their 68 year old mother, who suffers from Alzheimer's. Although their four siblings consented, the Public Trustee opposed their appointment as property guardians without a bond. This is one of a number of cases similarly contested by the Public Trustee since the Adult Guardianship and Co-Decision-Making Act was proclaimed July 15, 2001. Under the previous Dependent Adults Act, the Public Trustee was not served with notices of and did not intervene in applications for property guardianship and the practice for when a bond was required was ad hoc. The prescribed amount by regulation is $10,000. Arguments advanced by applicants generally is that a bond is expensive; in many cases the proposed applicants do not have adequate assets, which equal or exceed the value of the estate; the court has the power under the Adult Guardianship and Co-Decision-Making Act s.47(1)(a) to place any limitations or conditions on the guardianship it considers appropriate. HELD: The application to be appointed personal decision makers was granted. No order was made with respect to the application for property guardianship. The requirement for a bond is mandatory under the new Act as indicated by the use of the word 'shall' unless an applicant can qualify for dispensation under s.55(4). Under s.55(4)(b), it is no longer adequate for the nearest relatives to consent to the appointment. The only discretion is in s.55(4)(c) where the court may dispense with a bond in any other situation the court considers appropriate. Reading the section as a whole and bearing in mind both its purpose, context and historical evolution, the word 'appropriate' means suitable or appropriate for the end in view, which is to ensure the adult's estate remains intact during the guardianship, or can be restored in the event it does not. To consider this an appropriate case to dispense with a bond would be to largely negate the mandatory requirement for the filing of a bond contained in s.55(1).","FIAT: This application by two siblings to act as personal decision-maker and property guardian for their 68-year-old mother is opposed by the Public Trustee insofar as they request they be appointed property guardians without the necessity of a bond. HELD: 1) This is a routine application by siblings, who are most usually the applicants, and to consider this an appropriate case to dispense with a bond would be to largely negate the mandatory requirement for filing a bond contained in s.55(1). Almost every application would so qualify because in most cases the nearest relatives and public trustee consent in writing. 2) The application is in order and an order may issue with the authorities identified in the draft order submitted. 3) Leave is granted to the applicants to supplement the existing material should they see fit to do so. Leave to the applicant to consult with the public trustee in advance will eliminate significant costs for the applicants in having to litigate every application with the Public trustee. 4) The applicant is not required to file a financial statement on a public record in support of the suretyship. The court has the power under s47(1)(a) to place any limitations or conditions on the guardianship that it considers appropriate, and may also require the property guardian to have the appointment reviewed within specified period of time."

The limitation period for suing under Section D had expired and no notice of the application had been given to the insurer. The chambers judge held that he had no discretion to grant the amendment and dismissed the application. The plaintiff appealed. Appeal allowed; the plaintiff is entitled to renew the application for the amendment in Supreme Court chambers on notice to the proposed, as well as the existing, defendant within sixty days of today's date; if not filed within that time, the application to add the insurer will be deemed to have been abandoned. The court had a discretion to grant the amendment even though the case did not fall within any of the specific situations set out in Rule 15.02 as the broad power to amend conferred by Rule 15 is not limited to the specific instances set out the Rule. Although there was no firm rule that notice to a proposed defendant was necessary in all such applications, generally the applicant should give notice to the proposed defendant (as well as the existing parties) where it is apparent from the circumstances that the proposed defendant likely has a reasonable basis to oppose being joined, such as being prejudiced in its defence by the plaintiff's long delay in asserting his claim.","The appellant sued the Halifax Regional Municipality for negligence. Years later, he decided he should amend his action to add a new claim against a new defendant. By then, the new claim was barred by a limitation period. He applied in Supreme Court chambers for permission to make the amendment. The chambers judge held that he did not have authority under Rules 15.01 and 15.02 to grant leave to the appellant to amend his statement of claim to add Lombard as a party and to assert the Section cause of action against it. The appellant appealed. He argued that the Rules gave the judge a discretion to grant the amendment even though the limitation period had expired. Appeal allowed; the appellant was granted leave to appeal; the proposed defendant was not given notice of the application to amend."
6_2009skca97.txt,"The proposed appellants and the proposed respondent were involved in litigation involving the ownership of some valuable breeding dogs that were in the possession of the proposed respondent, but claimed by the proposed appellants.

The chambers judge granted the application finding that the affidavit filed in support of the writ contained false and misleading information and that to allow the writ to stand would constitute an abuse of process. The issue on appeal is whether the chambers judge erred in inquiring into the accuracy of the facts sworn to in the proposed appellant's affidavit, in light of the provision in Rule 407(2) of the Queen's Bench Rules that provides that the validity of the writ shall not be questioned in any interlocutory proceeding where the affidavit substantially complies with the requirements of the Rule.

The ruling of the chambers judge raises an issue of considerable importance to the general operation of the writ of replevin as provided for in the Rules of Court.","The proposed appellants and the proposed sheriff were involved in litigation involving the ownership of some valuable breeding dogs which were in the possession of the proposed respondent, but claimed by the appellants. The proposed respondent sought and obtained a writ of replevin in relation to the dogs pursuant to Rules 406-10 of The Queen's Bench Rules. The sheriff seized two of the disputed dogs then in her possession, on the grounds that the affidavit filed in support of the writ contained false and misleading information.

6_2009skqb201.txt,"A bankruptcy petition against the applicant was filed on May 18, 1995 and a receiving order with respect to her property issued the following month. KPMG Inc. (formerly Peat Marwick Thorne Inc.) is the trustee of her bankrupt estate. The applicant received an absolute discharge on March 8, 1996. The trustee has never applied for a discharge. The trustee did not oppose the applicant's discharge and in its report dated February 8, 1996 stated that the there were no facts, matters or circumstances that would justify the Court in refusing an unconditional order of discharge. Now, more than 13 years later, there remains an unresolved issue concerning non-exempt equity in the applicant's homestead. The applicant applies for relief under s. 37 of the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act for an order reversing the trustee's decisions and restoring the property interest to her. The Court reviewed the relevant case law and found that only the value of non-exempt homestead equity existing at the time of the bankrupt's application for discharge can be attached by the trustee. HELD: The Court made the order applied for by the applicant including an order for costs.","The trustee of the estate received an absolute discharge on March 8, 1996. The applicant had registered as owner of residential property in the City of Saskatoon having an exemption in the amount of $32,000. The trustee's report stated that the applicant's duties under the Act had been satisfactorily performed; that her conduct either before or after the bankruptcy was not subject to censure; and that she had not committed any offence in connection with the bankruptcy. Now, more than 13 years later, there remains an unresolved issue concerning non-exempt equity in the applicant’s homestead. HELD: The order for costs was to be made available to the applicant. 1)Exempt equity did not exist at the time of the application for discharge. The caveat should be vacated if it were not for the trustee's position that any increase in the equity should accrue to the benefit of the creditors. 2)The applicant was at the date of her bankruptcy registered as a registered owner of a residential property. Her home was valued at $50,000 and she claimed that the trustee was transmitting an 82% interest in it to her name. She alleged that the transmission was an arbitrary action taken without her agreement and knowledge. She also complained of the transmission being made without her having had an opportunity to oppose it for further realization. 3)The respondent was granted absolute discharge in March 1996. He did not object to the discharge, nor did he oppose it. The respondent did not oppose the discharge and in its report, prepared pursuant to s.170 of the Bankruptcy Act, R.S.C. 1985, c. B-3 as am. by the bankruptcy and Insolvency Act s.2 (theAct), stated there were no facts, matters or circumstances that would justify the court in refusing an unconditional order of discharge."
6_2011skqb386.txt,"The tenants were given short written notice to vacate their apartment unit. The tenants applied under the Residential Tenancies Act for the return of their security deposit and damages including moving expenses. The landlord was out of country at the time of the hearing but authorized by letter that the caretaker would attend the hearing to represent the landlord. The caretaker confirmed the tenants endured a protracted plumbing problem and restriction on bathroom use in the apartment. The hearing officer awarded the tenants half of the actual moving cost and 1 year of rent abatement. The landlord appealed the hearing officer's decision. The landlord alleged that he was not given the opportunity to be heard or to adequately respond to the tenants' claim as he received inadequate notice and alleged that the award of damages was unreasonable. HELD: The landlord's appeal was dismissed. 1) The tenant gave notice of his claim by two separate documents and the landlord showed no misapprehension of the tenants' position based on his written response. The landlord did not indicate in his letter that the caretaker had a limited role and the landlord could have sought an adjournment but did not.  2) Section 70(6)(c) of the Act empowers the hearing officer to order payment of damages where the hearing officer considers it just and equitable. The wording of this provision is broad and unconstrained excepting that the nature of damages that may be imposed must not be punitive. The decision on rent abatement was principled and to compensate the tenants for their loss of use of usable space. The award for moving costs was intended to compensate for inconvenience, aggravation and related expenses. The awards were reasonable both in fact and law and no reviewable error was made by the hearing officer. Corrigendum released dated November 15, 2011 and added to fulltext.",The landlord appeals a decision rendered by a hearing officer under The Residential Tenancies Act. The issue before the hearing officer concerned the tenants' claim for damages and return of the security deposit arising out of the landlord's notice to vacate.

The tenant's strategic miscalculation does not amount to an error on the part of the Hearing Officer.
6_2013skca2.txt,"The Crown applied for leave to appeal a Queen's Bench decision that set aside the convictions of the respondents, Chisum Log Homes and Lumber Ltd. and its sole director, Varga, for operating a forest products processing facility without a licence, contrary to s. 18.1 of The Forest Resources Management Act. The charges had stemmed from the manufacture of log-home packages by the company under the direction of Varga. The manufacture of these packages entailed the purchase of felled trees harvested by others from Crown lands. The logs were then cut at the respondents' facility into various lengths and notched, marked for construction and assembled into log-home packages. In the appeal to Queen's Bench of the convictions, the judge found that these steps in the manufacture of the packages did not engage the licencing provisions of the Act. HELD: The Court gave leave to appeal and allowed the appeal. Based on the definitions provided in s. 2 of the Act with respect to the words 'processing facility', 'forest products', and 'manufacture', it found that the operation of the facility by the company and Varga without a processing facility licence was unlawful as being contrary to s. 18.1. As the Provincial Court judge's conclusion was correct, the Court held that the convictions must stand and did not interfere with the fines and surcharges imposed upon the respondents.","The two companies were convicted in Provincial Court of operating a forest products processing facility without a licence contrary to s.18.1 of The Forest Resources Management Act. HELD: The appeal was allowed and the convictions restored. 1) The Court of Queen's Bench misconstrued the provisions of the Act and in consequence misapplied them. 2) The judge who heard their appeal allowed it and set aside the convictions. He did so on the basis the steps taken in connection with the manufacture of the log-home packages were not such as to engage the licensing provisions of The Act. 3) The circumstances in this case were such that nothing was made of his liability, as distinct form that of the company, as a company, either in this Court or in the courts below, so nothing was to be taken as having any bearing on whether he, too, needed a license."
6_2017skca42.txt,"Statutes – Interpretation – Limitation of Civil Rights Act, Section 2The appellants had granted a residential mortgage in favour of the respondent that secured a loan in the amount of $460,800. The loan was a consolidation of existing debt, part of which was the balance of $373,089 owed on the original loan that had enabled the appellants to purchase the land. The remaining $87,711 was non-purchase money financing approved by the respondent. The appellants fell into default, and the respondent commenced foreclosure proceedings when the balance owed had increased to $536,186. The property was sold through judicial listing orders and the net sale proceeds were paid to the respondent. As the proceeds were insufficient, the respondent sought an order entitling it to the deficiency. The Chambers judge considered s. 2 of The Limitation of Civil Rights Act (LCRA) and held that the amount of the deficiency should be $162,675.99. The issues on appeal were how the proceeds of sale should be applied against the mortgage balance and what the proper amount of the deficiency was. HELD: The appeal was allowed. The court reviewed the purpose and policy behind the LCRA. It then examined its conflicting decisions in Hrynewich Holdings and Andrews and held that the latter was a per incuriam judgment and therefore not binding and the approach set out in Hrynewich would guide the disposition of this appeal. Therefore, it found with respect to each issue that the holding in Hrynewich meant that payments should be allocated on a pro-rated basis to purchase money and non-purchase money debt balances and the proper amount of the deficiency to which the respondent was entitled to judgment against the appellants was $31,160.23.","HELD: The appeal was allowed and the respondent was entitled to take out a deficiency judgment in the amount of $31,160.23 against the appellants. The court found that s. 25 of The Limitation of Civil Rights Act protects the debtor from an action on the personal covenant to pay the unpaid balance owing for mortgage taken in part to secure the purchase price of farmland. It is the understanding or agreement of the parties that payments are allocated to the consolidated debt and not the separate component of that debt. In the absence of such a provision, a neutral approach involves allocation of the payment on pro-rated basis to debt affected by section and the non-purchase money portion of the debt."

The parties agreed that the sum of $50,711.66, together with interest at the judgment rate hereby ordered to accrue in the meantime, would be sufficient to support registration of a caveat in the following lands to the extent of $1,600.00. Upon hearing the parties' parties' third and fourth quarter quarters, it was ordered that a kind of specified access should be put in place to support the registration of the caveat and that the respondent should pay the sum payable to the wife solely. If the sum is not paid by the husband by September 1st next, Jeanette may applyto the court for a sale of the lands to facilitate payment of the amount then outstanding. An award for retroactive support and maintenance sought by the wife must be rejected. The respondent's assets were to be divided according to the value of the assets. The evidence did not allow for lessening of the monthly payment for Mark's cabin belongings. Given the employment and farming income of the respondent during 1993 revealed in his 1993 income tax return, am not persuaded that he will not be able to continue making the support payments."

The plaintiff argued in response that the defendant was estopped from claiming repayment. Ordering the benefits be re-paid, that the defendant acted expeditiously to comply with its contractual obligation, on the basis of representations put forward on behalf of the plaintiff, to provide income replacement when the need was made apparent to it.

In issue was whether the police officer had reasonable and probable grounds to make the breath demand; whether the demand met the requirements of the sample being taken by or under supervision of a medical practioner; whether the officer actually obtained information that taking the sample would not endanger the accused's life; whether the accused gave valid consent; whether the blood samples were taken as soon as practicable; whether the Crown could rely on the certificate where there was a reasonable doubt as to whether the physician took the sample himself or supervised a technician. HELD: The accused was found guilty. There was no basis on the evidence as a whole to exclude the Certificate of Analysis, which established the accused's blood alcohol level was 1.59 at the time of driving. 1)The officer had reasonable and probable grounds when he made the demand, including the accused was in the driver's seat; the odour of alcohol; the open bottle of beer; the nature of the accident. 2)Although the medical certificate could not be accepted as proof of the facts set out therein, the Crown did prove beyond a reasonable doubt by other evidence all the matters that could have been proven by the certificate. There was a reasonable doubt as to whether the doctor addressed his mind to the facts and opinion to the truth of what he was certifying. The doctor's mind was directed to the medical needs of the patient. His evidence was based on normal practice - not specific memory. There was no other logical conclusion that either the doctor or technician took the samples.

The blood was taken within a reasonably prompt time under all the circumstances.  5)The accused's admission that the accident affected his memory of the events following it and had no recollection of having passed the other vehicle just prior and that he was not driving like he normally drove and was perhaps going too fast for the road conditions (the gravel road was a wash board but was not at its worst condition) were noted.","The accused stands charged that he consumed alcohol in such quantity that the concentration thereof in his blood exceeded 80 milligrams of alcohol in 100 millilitres of blood, have the care and control of a motor vehicle contrary to s. 253(b) and s. 255(1) of the Criminal Code.

The evidence at trial disclosed that the medical practitioner had no recollection of having the doctor complete the wrong form (P-2). The doctor clearly would not have done so if he were of the opinion that the taking of the blood samples for law enforcement purposes would not endanger his life or that his testimony was in relation to a visit by the officer to his home and not at his home. 2) There was no evidence that the officer, who was present when the blood sample was taken, the doctor or technician took care of the samples from the accused. The medical practitioner testified that if he said it was okay to take, he would have advised him to do so. 3) The officer's testimony that he did not recall the doctor signing the second certificate to him at the hospital was not supported by the evidence as to whether the officer had communicated his request of permission from the doctor to make a demand in more explicit language in respect to the question of 'Red, Bloodshot Eyes or Watery Eyes'.

The petitioner was entitled to occupy the property and was to pay the mortgage, insurance, utilities and other usual costs.  6)It was inferred the value of the chattels was the same as that at the date of the marriage. It would be inequitable to order a distribution of chattel property given as antiques or heirlooms by her parents valued in excess of $6,000. The inheritance from her aunt who died almost a year after the separation was excluded. The motor vehicles were divided in accordance with their value as of October 2000. All other matrimonial property and debts and obligations were valued as of the date of the petition. RRSPs were to be equalized as of October 15, 1999 by rollover. 7)The respondent was to convey one-half of the commuted value of his pension at date of the petition to a locked in RRSP in the name of the petitioner. The balance in excess of the maximum amount transferable under the Pension Benefits Act resulted in an adjustment of $2,042.75. The respondent was to assume any debts.  8)No costs were awarded.","The parties had been living separate and apart since January 1998. In issue were custody, access, child support, spousal maintenance, possession and division of matrimonial property. The marriage breakdown had been established and the parties had agreed on joint custody of the two children. The mother sought adjustments for some maintenance and repair costs and insurance costs incurred after the marriage and with respect to minimum monthly payments made on the Canada Trust Powerline loan. HELD: 1)The respondent was ordered to convey one-half of the commuted value as of the date of the petition (½ of $21,804.38 = $10,902.19) to a locked-in RRSP in the name of the petitioner.  2)The petitioner was not earning enough from her part-time employment to contribute other than nominally to the support of the mother. Maintenance for the mother was to be determined in accordance with the Federal Child Support Guidelines (S.S.C. 1985, c.P.L.); 3)Costs to the petitioner were to be adjusted by rollover from the respondent's account to her account; 4)Spousal payments to the mother would be reviewed at any time after December 31, 2003. 5)The parties were ordered to keep the children on his group insurance benefit plan so long as they are eligible and to designate the children as beneficiaries of his life insurance for a period of time as, in the case of each child, that child continues to be a child of the marriage as defined in the Act."

He failed to make the required financial disclosure and relied on a medical disability of which he gave no prior notice. The judge allowed the application to proceed, over the objections of the mother, and reduced the child support obligation to $1 per month. The mother appealed. Appeal allowed; the judge's decision to allow the application to proceed was procedurally unfair to the appellant and wrong in principle. Only in rare circumstances should a party applying to reduce child support be heard absent that party making full disclosure.","The mother appeals an order of Vernon MacDonald, J.S.C. (Fam.Div.) which, in response to an application by the father to vary a child maintenance order, reduced his child maintenance obligation to $1.00 per month. HELD: Appeal allowed. 1) The judge erred in allowing the father's variation application to proceed even though he had not made adequate disclosure of his financial situation. 2) Only in rare circumstances should a party applying to reduce a child support obligation be heard absent that party making full disclosure. 3) The absence of disclosure here was unfair to the mother as it prevented her from making full response to the father. 4) The Court was told at the hearing that the father had never paid any child support voluntarily under these orders and that what had been recovered was as result of the efforts of the Maintenance Enforcement Program placing garnishments against his wages. He presented no T-4 slips and incomplete income documentation for the 2002 and 2003 years. He also sought to rely on medical disability of which he had given no previous notice."
7_2016skpc104.txt,"Criminal Law – Evidence – CredibilityCriminal Law – Evidence – Expert Evidence – Blood Alcohol ConcentrationCriminal Law – Impaired Driving – Blood Alcohol Level Exceeding .08 The accused was charged with three Criminal Code offences: driving while impaired, contrary to s. 253(1)(a); driving over .08, contrary to s. 153(1)(b); and with failing to stop for a police officer as soon as reasonable in order to evade that officer, contrary to s. 249.1(2)). As he was completing a traffic stop, an officer heard the accused’s truck in the early morning hours. When the officer engaged his police vehicle emergency lights, the accused spun his tires, fish-tailed, and took off. The accused failed to stop at two stop signs and eventually stopped in the driveway of his house. The accused was arrested for the s. 249.1 offence and was given a breath demand after he failed as ASD. He failed the ASD between 3:01 and 3:03 and the breath samples were taken at 3:55 and 4:17. The accused admitted that he was drinking alcohol that evening, but denied being impaired. He said he was not trying to evade the officer when he failed to stop for him. He also said that alcohol he had just had was not in his system yet when he was driving, but was at the time of the breath samples. The officer indicated that the accused had glossy, watery eyes, but his walk and speech were fairly normal. The officer smelled alcohol coming from the accused, but was surprised he did not show more impairment given his driving. The accused indicated that he had consumed six beer that day, but the officer noted more than six empty beer cans on the accused’s table when he was getting his shoes. The accused indicated that he downed six or seven ounces of vodka just before driving at 2:45. An alcohol expert and the accused testified. The defence expert testified that the accused’s blood alcohol concentration (BAC) at the time of driving would not have been over .08 based on the drinking the accused testified to. The issues were: 1) whether there was proof beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused’s ability to drive was impaired by alcohol; 2) whether the accused’s evidence raised a reasonable doubt that his blood alcohol concentration was over the legal limit at the time when he finally stopped his vehicle; and 3) whether the accused had reasonable excuse for not stopping immediately for the officer and whether his actions amounted to him evading the police officer. The accused had nine drinking and driving convictions since 1982 with the most recent in 2007. HELD: The issues were determined as follows: 1) the Crown did not prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused’s ability to drive was impaired; 2) section 258(1)(d.1) deals with the last drink defence. The court had to be satisfied that the accused’s drinking was consistent with his BAC being not over .08 at the time of driving yet being consistent with the BAC’s in the Certificate of Analysis. The court preferred the officer’s evidence over the accused’s, given the drinking affected his recollections. The court was not satisfied that the defence provided a credible account of the accused’s alcohol consumption. Given the findings, the court was unable to apply the expert’s opinions. The court did not have a reasonable doubt regarding the accused’s guilt on the driving while over .08 charge; and 3) there was no doubt that the accused knew he was being pursued by the police and did not stop as soon as was reasonable in the circumstances. The court concluded that the accused did not have a reasonable excuse for not stopping. There was also no doubt that the accused attempted to get away from the officer because he was afraid of the legal consequences that he could face. The accused was found guilty of the evading charge.","The accused was charged with driving while his ability to do so was impaired and while his blood alcohol concentration exceeded the legal limit of.08 and, lastly, with failing to stop for a police officer as soon as reasonable in the circumstances. HELD: The accused was found not guilty. The accused's blood alcohol content was over 80 mg% at the time he got out of his vehicle and approached Cst. Cobbledick. The officer noted approximately ten to twelve beer cans on the coffee table, which got his attention because the accused had told him he had only drank six beer throughout the day. Although the officer did not specifically count the beer cans and put them in his notes, he was adamant that there were more than six beer cans. Based on the evidence, there was no doubt that the accused knew he was being pursued and that he had engaged his emergency lights for a stop or that he did not stop. The only issue was whether the accused was drinking alcohol steadily over the hours before he drove and whether his memory, and/or version of what he drank this evening and night, and when he drank it, has changed over time."
8_1996canlii4963.txt,The appellant was acquitted of communicating with another person for the purpose of prostitution. A new trial was ordered on the basis that the Provincial Court judge included a requirement as an element of the actus reus for an offence under s.213 that there be a specific conversation with the respect to payment of money for specified sexual services. The Queen's Bench judge concluded that this was an error in law and cited as a correct test that set out in R. v. Schmidt. HELD: The proper disposition is to set aside the judgment and restore the decision of the Provincial Court acquitting the appellant of the offence. 1)On reading the entire oral judgment the court concluded that the judge was saying in effect that the evidence failed to convince her beyond a reasonable doubt that the offence had taken place. 2)The trial judge was incorrect in finding that under s.213 the actus reus must include a specific conversation specifying the sexual services and the money to be paid.,"The appellant was acquitted after trial in the Provincial Court of communicating with another person for the purpose of engaging in prostitution contrary to s. 213(1)(c) of the Code. However, on appeal to the Court of Queen's Bench a new trial was ordered, and it is from that judgment that this appeal arises. HELD: The appeal is allowed. 1)If indeed the provincial court judge had found that under s 213 the actus reus must include a specific conversation specifying the sexual services and the money to be paid for them, she was incorrect. 2)The facts before the learned Chief Judge constituted evidence from which a properly instructed jury could reasonably infer that the respondent was communicating with a female person, for the purposes of paying, and for which he intended to pay. The fact that the conversation did not reach the point where the matter of payment was discussed would not preclude a jury from reasonably concluding that an act of prostitution involving the payment of money for sexual favours was contemplated. It was strongly urged by the Crown, and conceded by the defence, that this was the correct test. 3)If the Queen’s Bench judge had also interpreted her oral reasons to include a requirement as an element of the Actus Reus for an offence under s213 that there be a particular conversation with respect to payment of the money for specified sexual services, she would have refused the nonsuit. 4)This was an error in law and cited as a correct test a comment in R. v. Schmidt (1987), 53 Sask. R. 75 at pp. 77-78. 5)The appellant appealed. He argued that the evidence was relatively specific on the issue of money and that there was no need to conduct an extensive review of the facts to conclude that the offence had taken place."

The defendant has applied for an order setting aside the judgment and striking out the plaintiff's claim. A car-pedestrian accident occurred causing personal injury to the plaintiff. The defendant was convicted of dangerous driving under the Criminal Code. The plaintiff sued for battery and assault. The defendant was noted for default on this claim and the damages were assessed at $37,717.35, $10,000 of which were punitive. The plaintiff submits that s.102 of the Act should not deprive a citizen of the right to sue a defendant for injuries caused by assault, battery, fraud, or similar torts.

The plaintiff was precluded by s.102 of the Act from commencing a valid legal action with the result that the judgment obtained is a nullity. Although s.102 of the Act prohibits certain types of law suits, the act provides victims with compensation for injury.

8_2001nssc179.txt,"The defendant obtained a tender to bank, blend and load coal at the plaintiff's coal preparation plant. In performing the contract, the defendant experienced equipment problems resulting in the plaintiff having to rent equipment from the defendant's predecessor. The plaintiff terminated the contract without any prior warning or notice to the defendant and brought an action for reimbursement of monies advanced under the contract and expenses incurred for the equipment rentals. The defendant counter-claimed for damages arising out of the termination of the contract, for services performed under the contract and for extras which had not been paid. Plaintiff entitled to reimbursement for overpayments and equipment rentals; defendant entitled to fair and reasonable compensation for extras for which court awarded the sum of $10,000. Both parties were in breach of the contract, the plaintiff's breach occurring because the volumes of coal supplied did not approximate the tonnages represented in the contractual documents. The clause excluding liability for errors in the forecast did not excuse the plaintiff because the actual volumes were not even approximate to the forecasted tonnages and the rates bid by the defendant were directly related to the anticipated tonnages. Absent evidence as to how the plaintiff arrived at the information used in the calculation of the forecasted tonnages, no negligent misrepresentation could be found, as there was no evidence that the information was negligently obtained. In respect to claims where on the evidence there was a loss, but it was difficult, if not impossible to quantify, damages were awarded even where it could be said the amount is a matter of guesswork.","The plaintiff/defendant sought reimbursement of monies advanced under the contract and expenses incurred for equipment rentals and other activities it says were required because of the failure of Roper Ltd. to perform the contract.

HELD: The plaintiff brought this action. The plaintiff was awarded the contract by the issuance of a purchase order incorporating the terms and conditions contained in the specifications. The contract was to run from June 1985 to March 1986 and was to be terminated without prior notice by the defendant on March 11, 1986.

HELD: The conditional provision was removed as time spent on electronic monitoring and post sentence efforts were considered. A conditional sentence was not available in the circumstances. The 38 year old had 49 prior convictions. The sentencing judge noted the accused's 3.5 years of sobriety, community support, education and technical trade training, and positive pre-sentence report but failed to consider the gravity of the offences, the need for deterrence, and above all, protection of the public. The respondent had no sooner finished parole than he began to commit these crimes.","The Crown appeals a conditional sentence of two years less one day imposed on the respondent after he pled guilty to the following charges: breaking and entering a dwelling house and committing theft. HELD: Appeal allowed orally. 1)When one reviews the record it is easy to understand the position taken by the Crown which is for penitentiary sentence. The judge noted the respondent's alcohol problem, his three and one-half years of sobriety and that the respondent did so well on probation he was released early at his own request in December of 1999. She further considered a positive pre-sentence report and the fact the respondent spent time on remand. She was of the view community disposition was likely to be more effective than incarceration at rehabilitating the respondent. 2)The respondent is 38 years old with 49 prior convictions. The sentencing judge had this to say in response to the Crown's proposal of a sentence of three to four years: “When a record is reviewed the Crown must be acknowledged that it is possible to change the sentence subject to a change in circumstances. However, the sentence should not have been imposed until after the Crown had finished monitoring the record. 3)The sentence should have been made available sooner. The community's support for the respondent, his education and technical trade training, the fact he spent time in remand, the community’s willingness to cooperate with the Crown and his failure to comply with the terms of his undertaking, fail without lawful excuse to comply and fail without protection of the court order. 4)The sentencing judge acknowledged that the sentence was already in danger of being imposed sooner than it had already been. 5)The community had already made efforts to monitor the sentence and to make sure it was made available to the public sooner. 6)It was obvious that the Crown was aware of the gravity of the sentence."
8_2009skqb54.txt,"FIAT: Each of the defendants and third parties (collectively the 'applicants'), apply to stay either permanently or on an interim basis the plaintiffs' claim commenced pursuant to The Class Actions Act. The stay applications seek the same discretionary order of the court pursuant to s. 37(1) of The Queen's Bench Act, 1998 and/or Rule 173 of the Queen's Bench Rules. The plaintiff's action claims damages for injuries that are alleged to have been caused by the testing and application of herbicides at a Canadian Forces base in New Brunswick. To date 11 statements of claim have been filed across Canada, 9 by Merchant Law Group (MLG). MLG has proceeded with various stages of the class action proceeding which it has commenced through the various jurisdictions in Canada as it has considered to be to the best advantage of the plaintiffs which that firm represents or seeks to represent. Now Saskatchewan is the clear preference. Many of these strategic decisions are driven by the nature of state of class actions legislation in the various jurisdictions in which claims were commenced. The applicants claim these strategic decisions are and do constitute an abuse of process. They claim they are a costly expenditure of time and money. The applicants have already participated in certification hearings in Newfoundland and New Brunswick. The issue on this application is whether the Saskatchewan action should be stayed permanently or on an interim basis with or without conditions on the basis of abuse of process. HELD: The applications to stay, on either an interim or permanent basis, the Saskatchewan action are dismissed. 1) The Court has concluded that virtually all, if not all of the concerns raised by the applicants in support of their stay applications are intended to be, and for that matter, mandated to be considered by the court during the certification application of this class action.  'Traffic control' as between the nine or ten existing class actions commenced in the other provincial jurisdictions is the responsibility of this Court upon certification as now required by s. 6(2) and s. 6(3) of the Act. The objectives and relevant factors by which the court is to be guided and which it must consider involve the very considerations upon which the applicants base their stay applications. They include avoiding, where possible, the risk of irreconcilable judgments, the promotion of judicial economy, the consideration of the law applicable, the stage each action has reached, the plan for the proposed multi-jurisdictional class action and the location of the representative plaintiffs, class members, evidence and witnesses. The discretion granted by the legislature to the court with respect to any certification orders it may issue as outlined in s. 6.1 of the Act is very broad. That discretion must be exercised having regard to the criterion set out in s. 6(2) of the Act. That may prompt a conclusion that deference should be given to an existing class action commenced in another jurisdiction. The discretion of the court is further circumscribed by the objectives and relevant factors set out in s. 6(3) of the Act. The concerns raised by the applicants in support of their stay application have been eclipsed. They are not specifically and legislatively required to be addressed by the court at the certification stage and after a certification hearing has been conducted. 2) Even if the criteria in Englund v. Pfizer Canada Inc., 2007 SKCA 62; were to be applied to the consideration of the stay applications presently before the Court, the Court would be inclined, in any event, to dismiss the stay applications in the facts and circumstances of this case. There are many differences between the proposed Saskatchewan class to be certified, its inclusiveness and exclusiveness, the nature of the injuries claims for, the substances alleged to have cause those injuries and the enumerated defendants or third parties in the actions commenced in each of the other jurisdictions. That alone, without the assistance of s. 6 and the other amending provisions of the Saskatchewan Act, distinguish this case from those criteria which the Court of Appeal applied in Englund to reach the conclusion that the action should be appropriately (but conditionally) stayed.","FIAT: The plaintiff’s claim commenced pursuant to the Class Actions Act as am. (the “Act” or “Sask. Act”) as am and now represented by an amended Statement of Claim filed with the Court November 7, 2008. Each of the defendants and third parties applied to the Court to stay either permanently or on an interim basis, the action commenced under the Act. The applications to stay were dismissed. HELD: The Court found that virtually all of the concerns raised by the applicants in support of their stay applications were specifically and legislatively required to be addressed by the Court at the certification stage and after a certification hearing has been conducted. The Court also found that the application to stay was premature and an unnecessary duplication of resources and expense. 1)The Court reviewed the history of the Saskatchewan class action and found that it was the most appropriate jurisdiction for the certification of multi-jurisdictional class action claims, given that Saskatchewan was the first jurisdiction in the country to do so. 2)It was important to note that the Saskatchewan Act was amended in 2007 to provide for a discretionary order of the Court pursuant to s.37(1) of the Act, which mandated a stay. 3)The Saskatchewan Act is now a no-cost jurisdiction providing for certification of a multi jurisdiction class action on an 'opt-out' basis. There are significant geographic and other scopes to that action, including a far wider list of damaging “substances”, larger group of defendants and broader scope of causes of action."
8_2010nssc219.txt,"The parties' hostility prevented them from reaching an agreement on interim parenting arrangements for their two-and-a-half-year-old child. There was a no contact order in place pending the outcome of domestic violence charges against the father (who had not seen the child for four months). The mother had nothing positive to say about him. They disagreed about the extent of his marijuana use, and the extent of his involvement with the child. He agreed to abstain from drugs around the child and for 12 hours before access. The mother expressed concern the father was a flight risk because he was from Egypt and had family support outside the country. Sole custody to the mother, with supervised access for a period of time (to reintroduce the father to the child), moving to increasingly longer periods of daytime access. The father must complete a parenting course to better learn how to meet the child's various needs. There was insufficient evidence to show he is unable to protect the child from her severe nut allergy. There was insufficient evidence to establish he is a flight risk. Even if he had threatened to flee with the child, it is relevant that he lacks the means to do so. While there has been unpleasantness and some violence between the parties, the evidence does not establish domestic violence of a nature that would require supervised access on an ongoing basis.","The Mother sought to have the Father's access supervised. The Father had not had contact with the child since January 2010 Given her age the parties agreed there would need to be a gradual reintroduction between Father and child and that this should be managed by utilizing the services provided by Veith House. HELD: The Father was to attend a course in parenting such as those offered by Family SOS so that he will be informed about child development and understand how to appropriately parent the child. 1)The Father was not to be under the influence of any non-prescription drug 12 hours before and while he had the child in his care. 2)The evidence before the court was not conclusive that the Father was involved in the violence that occurred between the parties during the incident in question, nor the other unpleasant events that have occurred in their relationship, as domestic violence requiring the father's access to be supervised.  3)The court was directed to ensure the terms of the interim order were sufficient to maintain the relationship with both parents."
8_2010skca149.txt,"The father appealed from the decision of the Chamber's judge which varied the custody provisions of a consent judgment. The father had been unsuccessful in arguing for a shared custody arrangement in the Court below. The father argued that the Chamber's judge erred in her application of the best interests of the children and failed to apply the principle of maximum contact by applying a presumption in favour of the status quo and finding that the wishes of the children were irrelevant. For the first time on appeal, the father also argued that there was insufficient uncontroverted evidence before the Chambers judge to allow her to make a proper decision. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. It is implicit in the Chamber's decision that there was sufficient evidence before the Court to reach a conclusion about the best interests of the children and to find a change in circumstances. No error was made on this issue. The Chamber's judge correctly applied the test to determine the best interests of the children as articulated in Gordon v. Goertz. The Chamber's judge correctly concluded that the Act does not provide that the maximum contact principle alone provides a sufficient basis for ordering shared parenting. She addressed this principle in the context of the children's best interests. There is no evidence that the Chamber's judge stopped her inquiry at the status quo and that she did not assess the children's best interests against the proposed new circumstances and its impact upon them. The Chamber's judge was entitled to give limited or no weight to the wishes of the children. There is no material error or misapprehension of the evidence.","The father appeals from the decision of the Chambers judge which varied the custody provisions of a consent judgment dated March 30, 2005 governing custody and access to the parties' children. HELD: Appeal dismissed. 1) Given the state of the evidence before the chambers judge—affidavit evidence which was partially inadmissible, largely contradictory, and materially deficient—we are all of the view there was an insufficient factual basis for the making of the custody order in issue. The Chambers judge correctly stated that s. 17(9) of the Act does not provide that the maximum contact principle alone provides a sufficient basis upon which to order shared parenting.  2) The evidence regarding the children's wishes was limited and inconclusive. In the context of conflicting evidence regarding their wishes, it is open to the judge to decline to make a finding on the issue and to proceed to base the decision on other factors. This argument cannot succeed.  3) The chambers judge recognized and stated the relevant law by acknowledging the applicable sections, and correctly stating the best interests test. However, the evidentiary record was so sparse with respect to number of crucial matters that the Court would not undertake an assessment of the question before it and returned the matter to the Chambers Judge for viva voce hearing."

9_1992canlii2588.txt,", The Crown appealed the acquittal of the respondent on a charge of assaulting his wife. The trial judge had found the respondent, who had taken a sleeping pill and was drunk at the time of the assault, did not have the intent to commit the assault. Allowing the appeal, that voluntary intoxication cannot be considered as raising a reasonable doubt as to intent in a general intent offence unless the degree of intoxication is so extreme that the accused did not even possess the minimal intent to perform the actus reus because his state was akin to automatism or insanity. The Court noted that no medical evidence as to the affect of the sleeping pill with the alcohol was adduced, nor was there any evidence concerning the strength of the pill or the amount of alcohol consumed and concluded that the evidence supported the conclusion that the respondent appreciated the circumstances of the assault, even though he could not remember it afterward. The Court set aside the acquittal and entered a verdict of guilty pursuant to s. 686(4)(b)(ii) of the Criminal Code as it had concluded that the respondent 'should have been found guilty but for the error in law'.","This was an appeal from the acquittal of the respondent on a charge of assaulting his wife. The respondent had come to visit his estranged wife. He complained of being tired and suffering from insomnia. She gave him a sleeping pill and told him that he should not consume alcohol. He refused and pushed the wife against the wall. The wife's evidence showed that the respondent had the minimal intent to perform the actus reus of the offence because his state of awareness was akin to automatism or insanity. HELD: The appeal was allowed. The verdict of acquittal was set aside and a new trial ordered. 1)The respondent should have been found guilty but for the error in law. The trial judge failed to properly direct himself as to the type of evidence necessary to conclude that the appellant was an automaton in the sense that there was clearly an assault and as the evidence of intoxication was totally insufficient to raise a reasonable doubt as the intent required to prove a general intent offence. The Wife's evidence indicates the appellant had an appreciation of the circumstances of the assault at the time although he cannot remember. The'sack of potatoes defence' is not supported by any evidence. 2)The Court was of the opinion that intoxication falling short of insanity or automatism is not a defence to crimes of general intent. The defence of voluntary drunkenness is not generally defence to general intent but could be defence if the intoxication induced a state of automatism. 3)The trial judge's decision was not overruled. The distinction between specific and general intent offences has been preserved. In general intent the Crown need only prove beyond reasonable doubt that the accused had the requisite intent for the offence of common assault when he concluded there, in fact, was an assault. Therefore, the defence of intoxication is available only in cases of extreme drunkenness."
9_1994canlii4844.txt,"This decision is supplementary to [1993]TWL QB93506. Applications to further divide matrimonial property and to vary spousal maintenance. The husband had declared personal bankruptcy since the date of the original orders obtained under the Matrimonial Property Act and Divorce Act. HELD: 1)The husband's obligation to pay maintenance was reduced to $1 per month and the arrears accruing after the date of his assignment into bankruptcy were cancelled.  2)The wife's counsel requested that the court value and divide all of the matrimonial property equally notwithstanding the bankruptcy, because she might pursue a constructive trust claim for her 1/2 share as against the husband's trustee. 3)The court valued all of the matrimonial property and determined that 56% of this value should be paid to the wife, and only 44% to the husband, given amounts he had spent since the separation.  4)The court left unresolved the issue of which matrimonial assets might be exempt under the Bankruptcy Act and therefore available to the wife.","In November 1993 following trial involving the divorce of the parties, including corollary relief on such questions as spousal maintenance and the division of matrimonial property, the Court granted the respondent wife 56% of the estimated asset value and the respondent husband 44%. In addition, the petitioner filed a motion seeking a variation of the Spousal Maintenance Order made in November in light of his bankrupt financial situation and his inability to earn any income at this time. HELD: 1)The respondent's claim for set-off was allowed. The Court granted him 56% and 44% of his estimated assets. 2)The petitioner did pay the respondent $2,300 by way of maintenance out of certain barley he sold privately. The respondent claims this was in violation of the original order prohibiting the sale of any assets of the marriage without consent of the other party or the Court. The evidence supports this position so the Court awarded the respondent's share of the value of the barley to the respondent. 3)Division of property was based on asset values which were at this stage problematical and indeed by including some assets which may not be exempt in whole or in part from the bankruptcy proceedings.

9_1994canlii4999.txt,"PCL applied for an interlocutory injunction restraining the members of the Defendant unions from picketing the entrance to a construction site at which PCL was constructing an addition to the City's sewage treatment plant. The picketers were completely blocking the entrance to the construction site, were threatening the occupants of vehicles using the entrance and damaged one vehicle as it entered the site. No City employees were working on the site. ISSUES: 1)Is the picketing secondary picketing? 2)Is the manner of picketing unlawful in any event? HELD: Application allowed. 1)Picketing of the premises of an employer, where there is no direct dispute between him and the picketers or between him and his employees, is secondary picketing, is per se unlawful and cannot be jusified merely because the picketers are engaged in a legal strike against another employer who has business relations with the employer being picketed. 2)If the court had determined that the subject picketing was not secondary picketing, then, in the particular circumstances it would still have held that the subject picketing was unlawful, and ought to be restrained, as, on the whole of said evidence it was satisfied that the applicant had established that said picketing was not being carried on for the purpose of lawful communication, but, rather, was being carried on in a manner designed to obstruct, impede and interfere with the lawful performance by the applicant of its construction contract on the construction site.","The plaintiff sought an interim injunction restraining the defendants from entering the premises of the defendant and from interfering with the lawful use and improvement of the plaintiff's premises. The defendants were granted an order ex parte abridging the time for service and return of the notice of motion and permitting the plaintiff to proceed with the trial of the action from: (a) besetting, watching or pickingeting the defendant's premises; (b) interfering with its access to and from the premises adjacent to the pollution control plant; (c) obstructing the entrance of the Defendant's employees to the construction site; and (d) attempting to intimidate and intimidate the Plaintiff's employees, suppliers and contractors into submission. HELD: The injunction was granted and the proceeding continued. The plaintiff was ordered to file and serve materials in response to the application. The court found that the acts complained of were illegal and would cause irreparable damage to the plaintiff. The injunction would restrain the defendants and prevent them from proceeding with the proceeding."
9_1994canlii7210.txt,"The defendants permitted a private building to remain on public reserve lands contrary to s. 197 of The Planning and Development Act, 1983 and the zoning bylaws of the Resort Village of Echo Bay. They contended the bylaws were inapplicable. They conceded the activities may be an offence under the provincial statute, but submitted the selective prosecution should be stayed as an abuse of the legal process, and a violation of their right to 'equal protection and equal benefit of the law without discrimination' under s. 15 of the Charter. Legislation required 10% of land intended for subdivision to be given to the province. This land was designated as 'public reserve', and its use was limited by s. 197 of The Planning and Development Act, 1983. Most public reserves were not developed by the government, but rather by cottage owners. Some cottage owners asserted the public was able to use the construction on public reserve, and allowing such access made such construction things that 'facilitate the use of the reserve as a public recreation area' under s. 197(f) and were legal. In Echo Bay, the subdivision plan created a public reserve in front of cottage lots, vested in the province on October 25, 1983. The provincial Department of Municipal Government ('Department') was to determine what fell within s. 197. The province had no policing mechanism for violations. The Department acted as if maintaining the reserves was the municipality's responsibility, even though the province held title. In August 1986, Mr. and Mrs. Taillon built a boathouse on public reserve. They did not seek permission, as their realtor said they could treat the land as part of their lot. Their neighbour Mr. Zeah complained to Mr. Brickwell, the Senior Planner of the Department. This resulted in an enquiry into if the defendant's activities violated s. 197 or the municipal zoning bylaw. On October 28, 1986, Mr. Brickwell told the mayor that Department officials inspected the site and asked council to request the Taillons remove the structure. Council advised the Department on November 24, 1986 that it was not their land or responsibility. Mr. Brickwell informed council of proposed legislative amendments that would give title and enforcement responsibilities to municipalities. In June 1989, council asked Mr. Fraser to produce authority to construct his boathouse and if not, they would issue a stop work order under the zoning bylaws, even though they believed they did not apply to public reserves. Council was trying to avoid future problems once they heard of the amendments. They received no response and issued an order. Mr. Fraser then contacted Mr. Brickwell who told him there were numerous violations, but enforcement was lacking. Mr. Brickwell said he did not demand the boathouse be removed because, in his view, his Department did not police public reserves. On October 21, 1989, council passed a motion to turn the prosecution of violations of s. 197 over to the RCMP. The province was the landowner and enforcer of the Act, so it was appropriate for the RCMP to assume prosecution. The RCMP declined, and Mr. Brickwell informed council his Department would not act. On January 31, 1991, an amendment to The Planning and Development Act passed which allowed municipalities to take title and passed responsibility for prosecuting offenders to local councils. Echo Bay took title on July 6, 1992. On February 21, 1991, council's solicitor requested the defendants and the Fosters to remove their boathouses by June 31, 1991. The Fosters complied, but the defendants did not. On November 16, 1991, council proceeded with the action. Although council believed the boathouses were illegal, the Taillon boathouse was assessed for property taxes. Council believed they must prosecute offenders to fulfill their duty to uphold the law, discourage further violations, and ensure public reserve lands were open for public use. The defendants believed either none or all violators should be prosecuted. Council stated it was wiser to prosecute only boathouses to obtain the court's opinion. If council was correct, it may not be necessary to prosecute others because they might comply with the law as expressed by the court. If the court did not agree, council should not incur any further expense. Council asserted prosecution of boathouse owners was appropriate as boathouses caused the complaint, and they were clearly private. The defendants view their selection for prosecution out of a numerous violators as unfair and discriminatory within the prohibition of s. 15 of the Charter. HELD: A municipality may further restrict uses of reserve land, but it cannot allow uses not permitted by s. 197. Taxing the boathouse was immaterial and did not imply approval. The defendants were not misled as to their legal rights by a person in authority. The Taillons could not have believed the opinion of the realtor; they knew they did not own the land. Mr. Brickwell's comment that there were numerous violations being ignored could not be taken to mean the defendants were able to build on public reserve. It was an opinion that they might escape prosecution. The case turned on whether it was an abuse of the legal process to prosecute the defendants when other violators were ignored or a case of violating their rights under s. 15 of the Charter. How unfair it was depended on how many violators were overlooked which turned on the reading of s. 197. John Nanson, the Principal Planner of the Community Planning Services Branch, believed things on public reserve available to the public were not violations of s. 197. The court did not accept this view as it allowed citizens to determine what constituted a 'public facility' and required council to launch civil actions to remove private construction. If this was intended, no offence would be created in the first place, and the titleholder would just be left with civil remedies. An interpretation which allowed private citizens to effectively turn public reserve into private land defeated the legislation's objective. The fact that the titleholder was the province or a municipality and the use of the word public indicated the legislature wanted the government authority to decide what constituted a public facility. It cannot be public unless it was authorized or actually built by the government authority and was open for public use at all times. If the legislation was interpreted as Mr. Nanson suggested, then there were fewer violators. This made council's decision to prosecute only boathouses less unfair, and it did not give the defendants a defence as the boathouses were not open for public use. They constructed a private building on public reserve contrary to s. 197, therefore the boathouses were illegal under s. 221(1)(a)(ii) of the Act. The defendants were guilty unless prosecution was stayed as an abuse of process or because it violated s. 15 of the Charter. Council prosecuted defendants whom they saw as committing clear violations. To prosecute all violators initially would add expense at no benefit. A decision on boathouses was likely to lead to the desired clarification of the law. They had a complaint upon which they had a duty to act and wanted a test case to determine the legal position. Selective prosecution, per se, is not an abuse of process; rather it depends on the circumstances. The defendants must show they were singled out unfairly, not just that they were singled out. There was no such evidence. Stopping prosecutions for abuse of process is a power only to be used in the 'clearest of cases' (R. v. Keyowski). The defence must show that proceeding exceeds 'the limits of the community sense of fair play' and the administration of justice is best served by stopping the prosecution. In R. v. Rourke, the SCC said there was no general discretion to stay proceedings because they were considered 'oppressive'. In R. v. Jewitt, the SCC adopted the test from R. v. Young that 'there is a residual discretion in a trial judge to stay proceedings where compelling an accused to stand trial would violate those fundamental principles of justice which underlie the community's sense of fair play and decency, and to prevent the abuse of court's process through oppressive or vexatious proceedings'. Picking out defendants to prosecute from a pool of offenders to ascertain the legal position of the parties because one of their group has been the subject of a complaint did not violate 'the community sense of fair play and decency'. The defence relied on Regina v. Miles of Music Ltd. where the court said that 'no cause can fall within the category of the Ã¦clearest of cases' unless it can be fairly said that the cause of the apparent unfairness complained of can be Ã attributed to either the police or the Crown or both'. The defence said council not only did not prosecute, but did not investigate whether others were in violation. The court acknowledged this was so, but accepted the motivation was that council believed Mr. Nanson, and they did not currently intend to prosecute all violators. The defendant's real complaint was the decision to only prosecute boathouse owners. Council was trying to ascertain the law, so they could fulfill their duty to uphold it. The court found council proceeded against the defendants because it seemed sensible and financially responsible to do so, not because of any male fides. The municipal bylaws were not applicable to public reserves, but it made sense to seek the court's opinion on their applicability since council was going ahead with the action. The fact that one count was laid under the bylaws did not violate the community sense of fair play, but if it did, this would mean that count should be stayed. Council rightly attempted to get others to prosecute which caused a reasonable delay and did not prejudice the defendants. Any unsatisfactory delay was caused by the Department and not council. The Charter gives a right to a trial within a reasonable time, but this applies after a charge is laid. The delay by the province occurred pre-charge. There was no unreasonable post-charge delay or abuse of the legal process. Section 15 of the Charter is not limited to the enumerated types of discrimination, but it does not prohibit all discrimination. It must be commonly accepted discrimination abhorrent to the basic principles of society with no reason that justifies a breach of such principles. It was not discrimination contrary to s. 15 to select individuals to prosecute as a test case where it was not done for improper reasons.  'Equal protection and equal benefit of the law' did not mean one was entitled to have prosecution stopped until all violators were prosecuted. Picking out boathouse builders was not an example of discrimination prohibited by s. 15. The defence argued the law was not allowed to have unequal impact because of irrelevant circumstances (Law Society of British Columbia v. Andrews). This case should not be read so broadly. In the court's view, the proceedings should not be stayed because there was no violation of s. 15, and if the court was wrong, it was not 'appropriate and just' that such a remedy be granted, as required for relief under s. 24 of the Charter.","The defendants were charged with permitting a private building, to wit: a boat house, to remain on public reserve lands contrary to both the provisions of the Planning and Development Act and the Zoning Bylaws of the Resort Village of Echo Bay. HELD: The charges were stayed as an abuse of the legal process and a violation of their rights to be afforded 'equal protection and equal benefit of the law without discrimination' under s15 of the Charter of Rights and Freedoms. 1) The defendants did not deny it, although they did require the crown to prove it, as has been done. They say the bylaws of the resort Village are inapplicable and that, although their activities may constitute an offence under the provincial statute, the prosecution of it should be stayed. 2) The municipality stepped into that position. Moreover, it could be argued that after the enactment of the interim zoning bylaw in 1986, permission from the municipality had to be obtained if their zoning bylaws did apply, in this case, to public reserves. The municipality had set up a situation whereby it created public reserves in front of cottage lot owners, the very people most likely to see themselves as justified in encroaching on public reserves, and the Government's rights as landowner, which would be used as precedent by other cottage owners to justify doing whatever they liked on a public reserve. However, the Department took the position that the expense of maintaining the reserves was the responsibility of the municipality, despite the fact that the Province was the titleholder. 3) The Municipality stepped into the position of assuming the Department's responsibilities for enforcement of landowners' rights, and their benefits to the public, involved in their equally unauthorized uses of public land, with an eye to their respective self-interest. 4) In this case the municipality did not seek to prosecute the defendants. Rather, the charges were made under subsec. (f), inasmuch as it says that: 1) the defendants are charged. The charges are dismissed. 5) There is no evidence to suggest that the municipality was aware of the nature of the reserve, nor that it was prepared to act under the possible authority of them. 6) There are access walkways to such public reserves between cottage lots, set aside on the plan of survey, unless one is familiar with the survey one would not even be likely to realize that public reserve exists, let alone realize how to access it from the landside without trespassing on cottage lots. 7) It was agreed that the boathouse would"

HELD: The appeal was allowed and the acquittals ordered by the trial judge were restored. There was no basis to overturn the findings of fact made by the trial judge. The appeal judge misinterpreted the decision of the trial judge who properly considered the issue of income before dealing with mens rea.

The charges against both pertain to willfully evading the payment of taxes and the unlawfully making of a false or deceptive statement in the return of income. The Crown argued the accounting records upon which the claim for deductions were made were, in fact, false thus obviating the liability for tax. The appeal judge misinterpreted his decision by arguing the returns were false and therefore the basis for such findings was erroneous. Neither the trial judge nor the appeal judge were prepared to make such a finding."

Lanson loaned Nickel $16,000 to purchase a mobile home and registered their financing statement giving them a security interest in the mobile home. The trial judge found that Lanson knew that Nickel would either rent or sell the home but that upon a sale Nickel would repay the loan in full. Nickel sold the home but did not disclose the sale to Lanson. The purchaser, SP Trucking, did not require financing and did not search the Personal Property Registry. SP Trucking sold the home to Rempel who obtained financing from the Credit Union which registered a financing agreement claiming a security interest in the home and its proceeds. Lanson attempted to seize the home. The trial judge found Lanson's security interest continued and took priority over that of the Credit Union as Lanson had not authorized the sale to the trucking company and that Lanson had no interest in releasing the security interest until he received payment in full.  HELD: 1)Section 28(1) reiterates the common law principle of nemo dat quod non habet. The debtor's right to deal with collateral is subject to the security interest granted to the creditor unless certain things occur- ie. the secured party authorized expressly or by implication the dealing with the security. 2)The trial judge was in error in finding the secured party, Lanson, had to authorize the buyer, SP Trucking, to deal with the property and that the buyer must know of the authorization. Section 28(1) does not contemplate an authorization to a third party to deal with the collateral. The fundamental issue was whether the authorization was subject to the pre-condition of payment in full. 3)The authorization to sell must be given before the sale. Lanson clearly gave Nickel express authority to deal with the security which would include resale. The fact the debtor failed to pay the secured creditor did not invalidate the sale to the buyer.  4)Canadian Commercial Bank is restricted to cases where the secured party agrees with the buyer to release the security interest on the express condition that the obligation is satisfied in full and makes it clear to the debtor he does not intend to rely simply on the proceeds. There is a distinction between a conditional authorization and an authorized sale subject to conditions that the proceeds be remitted to the secured party. 5)The trial judge clearly found that Lanson authorized the dealing. It followed that the security interest did not continue in the collateral and the title passed to the buyer. The Credit Union acquired the collateral free of the security interest of Lanson and Lanson's rights against Nickle were restricted to the proceeds.  6)By declining to deal with the matter of s30(2), the appellate court was not to be taken as approving of the reasons of the trial judge. 7)The appellant was awarded costs on double Column V.","The issue on this appeal is the priority of security interest in a mobile home granted by the respondent to the respondent and subsequent purchaser for value, the Saskatchewan Valley Credit Union having regard to the operation of s. 28(1) and s. 30(2) of The Personal Property Security Act, 1993. HELD: Appeal allowed. 1) The trial judge concluded that Lanson did not authorize the sale of the mobile home within the meaning of s28(1)(the P.P.S.A.) and the sale did not occur in the ordinary course of business as contemplated by s30(2). 2) The Credit Union appeals this decision. 3) The respondent's rights against Nickle are restricted to the proceeds. 4) The issue is whether the security holder, Lanson, authorized the sale. Lanson clearly gave the respondent an express authorization to deal with the security. That dealing would include resale. The fact the debtor failed to pay the secured creditor does not invalidate the sale to the buyer. 5) The Court of Appeal erred in finding that the security interest did not continue in the collateral and the title passed to Spruce Meadow Trucking Ltd., free from the secured interest.

The defendant pled and relied on the Statute of Limitations and notes that the motor vehicle accident, which forms the subject matter of the Statement of Claim, is said to have occurred some 25 years earlier. The plaintiff, who until 1997 made no inquiries to the defendant or any other family member, nor the police as to how this happened.

In the result, 25 years went by without anything being said by the parties to one another about the tragedy that had taken place. To compound the difficulty surrounding this application, it is to be noted that the revelation even as made is based on double hearsay, i.e. from the defendant allegedly to, believe, his brother, then on to daughter and then to Flora Burt.

Each of the three Informations sworn by an RCMP officer alleged the accused and his 19 year old daughter committed incest contrary to s.155, and a 7 month old child was born as a result. The Informations deposed that the Crown had obtained a DNA sample of the person who claimed to be the natural mother of the 19 year old.HELD: 1)No case was found dealing was a similar application regarding a possible charge under s.155. The words of s.487.05 were analyzed to determine its proper meaning and interpretation. 'Bodily substances' is not defined in the general definition s.2 nor the DNA definition s.487.04 of the Criminal Code. Assuming, without deciding, that it is proper to conclude that the child is a victim, there has been no bodily substance found or obtained from the child or from anyone else, and accordingly no portion of s.487.05(1)(b) is applicable. Subparagraphs 487.05(1)(b)(ii), (iii) and (iv) all refer to a bodily substance found or obtained on or within the body of a victim or some other person involved with the offence; 487.05(1)(b)(i) and (iv) refer to bodily substances found or obtained at or related to the place where the offence was committed. Nothing in s.487.05 suggests that a blood sample of a child born of an alleged incestuous relationship, which is not in the possession of the Crown and remains in the child, is a bodily substance found or obtained within the meaning of s.487.05(1)(a). 2)There were numerous deficiencies in the Informations. The paragraphs did not set out the basis or source of the officer's information, the relationship of the parties to the named informant, nor why the information was considered reliable. There should be some indication as to how the DNA analysis will establish that the adult male is the natural father and how it will negative any suggestion that the parents of the baby are 'strangers' genetically speaking. The qualifications of the RCMP officer who will take the blood samples and of the corporal who trained him should be set out. The paragraphing format was confusing. 3)A DNA warrant application would be premature. The custodial parent or parents are in the legal position of being the persons who can give informed consent to the taking of the baby's blood. It may be appropriate at some point to order a sample be obtained. It was questionable whether it was in the best interests of the administration of justice to make such an order now.","The Crown applied pursuant to s. 487.05 of the Criminal Code for DNA warrants to obtain blood samples from the male, the female and the child. The Informations in Support depose that the Crown has obtained a DNA sample from the person who says she is the mother of the 19-year-old and that the child, now months old, has been born as result of the incestuous relationship. HELD: A DNA warrant application with respect to the child would be premature, but may be renewed in due course if the Crown is so advised. The proper inference to be drawn from the words have emphasized is that a warrant may be issued when some substance such as saliva, semen, hair, blood or like product produced by or excreted or discharged from the body is found at or obtained in conjunction with a crime scene, or is found in or on, or obtained from, victim or other person present at crime scene. The paragraphing format used in the present applications is confusing and detracts from ease of reference and understanding. There should be some indication as to how the DNA analysis will establish that the adult male is the natural father of the child and the baby and how it will negative any suggestion that the father and mother are'strangers' genetically speaking.

9_2003skqb459.txt,"The accused was charged with possession of marijuana for the purposes of trafficking contrary to s. 5(2) of the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act and four other charges related to her attempts to evade arrest. At the onset of her trial, the accused took the position that her s. 8, s. 9 and s. 10 Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms were infringed and that all the evidence obtained after the stop should be excluded. HELD: The accused's Charter rights were not breached. 1) The strong odour of raw cannabis marijuana emanating from the interior of the accused's vehicle in itself amounted to reasonable grounds not only for lawful detention but also for arrest. 2) The officer was not in breach of the accused's Charter rights by asking her where she had been and how long she had been there. 3) On the arrest or detention of the accused, she was promptly informed of the reasons therefore and she was informed of her right to retain and instruct counsel without delay.","The accused was charged with two counts of possession of a controlled substance contrary to s. 5(2) of the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act and one count of assault with a weapon. The accused had been operating a motor vehicle at night and was attempting to evade a police officer when she noticed that the officer was pursuing her and noticed that there was a red bag in the back seat of the accused's vehicle. When the officer approached the accused, the accused stated that she was under arrest for possession of marijuana and that she wanted to contact a lawyer. The officer told the accused that he had smelled marijuana in the vehicle and that the smell of raw cannabis was strong and that he thought the bag might have dog food in it. The Crown proceeded against the accused on the following counts: 1) The evidence was obtained in a manner that infringed or denied any rights or freedoms guaranteed by this Charter. The evidence obtained after the initial stop should be excluded pursuant to ss. 8, 9 and 10 of the Charter. 2) There can be no quarrel with the visual inspection of a vehicle by police officers. At night the inspection can only be carried out with the aid of a flashlight and it is necessarily incidental to a check stop program carried out after dark. The inspection is essential for the protection of those on duty in the check stops. There have been more than enough incidents of violence to police officers when vehicles have been stopped. Nor can place any particular significance upon the fact stressed by the appellant that the police only made use of flashlight after the request had been made of the appellant to produce the necessary papers and not when the constable first approached the car. Although the safety of the police might make it preferable to use the flashlight at the earliest opportunity, it certainly can be utilized at any time as necessary incident to the check stop routine. 3) The accused was in possession of 2,446-day supply or 6.7-year supply. Since the shelf life of cannabis marihuana is six months, under ideal conditions this amount far exceeds what could normally be considered 'personal usage'. The police use of check stops should not be extended beyond these aims."
9_2004nssf51.txt,"After the court released its decision but before an order was issued, the court received a letter from the respondent in which it was stated that he had not been served with the applicant's application and supporting material. The applicant had previously provided the court with a sworn Affidavit of Service indicating otherwise. The respondent was provided with the judge's assistant's name and phone number and given a date by which he was to contact the assistant. The assistant was not contacted but the respondent sent a second letter to the court enclosing a document entitled 'Affidavit' which again stated that he had not been informed of when the hearing was to take place. A telephone conference was arranged but the court was unable to contact the respondent at the set time despite numerous calls and messages from the court. The applicant now sought additional costs due to the time counsel had taken to prepare for the telephone conference. Affidavit of the respondent struck; applicant entitled to additional costs in the amount of $250. The court was not convinced that the respondent had not received adequate notice of the hearing and because he did not make himself available for cross- examination, his affidavit was struck.","The Court received a letter dated March 25, 2004 in which he stated that he was not served with the Applicant's application and supporting material. The affidavit was struck. The Applicant was entitled to additional costs in the amount of $250 for a total of $350. HELD: The Court was satisfied that the defendant received adequate notice of the hearing and was not available for cross examination. In any event, because he did not make himself available for the telephone conference and was available for examination, his affidavit is struck and his application is struck as invalid. The Court is also entitled to costs over that which was provided in the decision of March 8, 2004 because of the time and preparation for the phone conference."
9_2004skqb324.txt,"Wal-Mart Canada applies for an order pursuant to Rule 664 and Rule 673 of The Queen's Bench Rules of Court quashing the orders of the Board. The orders require Wal-Mart Canada to discover and produce documents. Wal-Mart Canada says that the Board does not have the jurisdiction to use the subpoena or make the disclosure and productions orders in the manner in which it has done. Wal-Mart Canada also applies for an order declaring s. 9 of The Trade Union Act unconstitutional. HELD: The orders of the Board are quashed with costs payable forthwith to Wal-Mart Canada by UFCW. The application for an order declaring s. 9 of The Trade Union Act to be unconstitutional and of no force and effect is dismissed without prejudice to Wal-Mart Canada to bring its application back. 1) The Court concluded that a review of the transcript was essential to the proper determination of the issues raised by the application and that it must be considered part of the record.  2) The case law has determined that orders made by the Board that in reality are document discovery orders, are orders made without jurisdiction to which the applicable standard of review is one of correctness. 3) The Board abused its jurisdiction and power to issue the subpoena duces tecum in two respects. First the Board issued the subpoena without any prior consideration as the relevance of the documents that it compelled Wal-Mart Canada to produce. The subpoena was issued before the hearings commenced. There is no evidence that the Board exercised its discretion judicially in considering the issue of relevancy. It is unlikely that the Board even scrutinized the subpoena or it would have likely required the scope of it to be narrowed. Second, the subpoena was far too generalized and amounts to an order to discover documents. The Board must restrict its consideration to evidence that is relevant to the issues before it. It is precluded from making its decision on the basis of irrelevant or improper considerations. 4) The Board exceeded its jurisdiction and abused its power in making the discovery and production orders it did. The comments of the Court with respect to the subpoena duces tecum apply in principle to the Board's discovery and production orders. The orders were not production orders but directed Wal-Mart to comply with the subpoena duces tecum.  5) The requirement that evidence, including documentary evidence, be relevant before it can be properly considered, is a substantive issue that goes to the heart of the legitimacy of judicial or quasi-judicial dispute determination. It is an important consideration in determining whether there has been a denial of natural justice where there has been reliance on improper considerations rather than relevant evidence. 6) Some of the documents sought are in the possession and control of a third party non-resident American corporation. Additional factors and procedures should at least have been considered such as the 'likely relevance' of the documents to an issue. Solicitor and client privilege was raised with respect to some of the documents yet the Board ordered the production of those documents without ruling on the issue or without providing a means by which the confidentiality of the documents could be maintained until a ruling was made. 7) The Board has demonstrated a reluctance to give up its perceived powers of discovery despite two previous decisions of the Court of Queen's Bench and the Court of Appeal. If it interprets this decision of the Court in the same fashion, an order to reconsider the issues would be of little value to the applicant. The only feasible option is to grant the relief that is sought by quashing the two orders.  8) Wal-Mart Canada submits that the Board has already interpreted s.9 of The Trade Union Act very broadly so that its effect violates s. 2(d) of the Charter. Wal-Mart Canada submits this is evidenced in two ways. First, by the manner in which the Board has permitted the proceedings to be conducted and second, by the focus of the hearing on the alleged anti-union philosophy of Wal-Mart Canada instead of on whether or not Wal-Mart Canada has in fact influenced its employees to bring their applications against UFCW. If the Board has interpreted s. 9 of The Trade Union Act in accordance with UFCW's submissions, then such an interpretation appears to be on a collision course with s.2(d) of the Charter of Rights. If s. 9 of the Act has the effect of restricting freedom of expression between an employee and an employer that does not constitute interference or coercion, then s. 9 may well violate s. 2(d) of the Charter and if not saved by s. 1 of the Charter, is unconstitutional. However, Wal-Mart Canada's application respecting the constitutionality of s. 9 of the Act is premature in the sense that the Court did not have a sufficient factual foundation or context to properly measure s. 9 of the Act against s. 2(d) of the Charter.","Walgreens applied for an order pursuant to Queen's Bench Rules 664 and 673 quashing the orders of the Board. These orders require Wal-Mart Canada to discover and produce documents, including those referred to in a subpoena duces tecum. The applicant brought an application to the Court for certiorari pursuant to s. 24 of Part I of the Constitution Act, 1982, being Schedule B to the Canada Act 1982 and declaring s. 9 of The Trade Union Act unconstitutional and of no force and effect insofar as it infringes the freedom of thought, belief, expression and communication under s. 2(b) of the Charter. The application is contested by the applicant and certain Wal- Mart Canada employees who are designated by the Board asInterested Parties. HELD: A review of the transcript is essential to the proper determination of the issues raised by the application and that it must, in this case, be considered part of the record. 1) There are virtually no reasons given by the board in its written decision as to why it ordered each and every document, memo or communication sought by UFCW. 2) The Board has conceded that it did not have jurisdiction to utilize the subpoena or make the disclosure and production orders in the manner in which it has done. It is not in dispute that the case law directs the court to adopt a pragmatic and functional analysis in determining the applicable standard of review. The court found that the legislature intended the question to be left to the exclusive jurisdiction of the tribunal and that the Board was not obliged to do so. 3) The applicant was directed to produce the following documents: a copy of the first affidavit of Paul Meinema. The portions of the second affidavit are rampant with opinion and argument. These portions would normally have been struck. However, the Board did not address the issue of patent unreasonableness in its decision to order the production of documents that were irrelevant to the issues that are properly before the Board and the necessity of reviewing the transcript to consider each aspect of the breach of Charter allegations."
9_2005nssc297.txt,"The appellant was convicted of driving a motor vehicle while his licence was suspended. The appeal centred upon the adjudicator's acceptance of the police officer's evidence and the reliability of that evidence versus the defence witnesses who testified that the appellant's son was actually the driver of the vehicle. Appeal allowed; verdict of acquittal entered. The adjudicator erred by failing to address whether the appellant's evidence raised a reasonable doubt as to his innocence, particularly on the central issue of whether the appellant was the only person present in the vehicle. But not making a finding on this critical issue, this tended to suggest more strongly that the adjudicator engaged in an either/or analysis in accepting the evidence of the Crown's witnesses over that of the four defence witnesses; the adjudicator should have made clear findings of credibility based on the evidence before him.","This appeal arises from a decision of the Adjudicator in the Provincial Court of Nova Scotia who convicted the appellant for driving a motor vehicle while his license was suspended contrary to s. 287(2) of the Motor Vehicle Act. The adjudicator made clear findings of credibility based on the evidence of his son, who testified it was he who drove the car, the appellant's son, the patron at the gas station, and the attendant at the service station who testified the appellant was not the driver of the vehicle but that his son was. The appeal centers upon the adjudicator's acceptance of the Crown's evidence and the reliability of the evidence, i.e., his glimpse of the appellant driving his auto as a sole occupant while unlicensed versus the defence witnesses who testified he was not. HELD: The appeal of the conviction is allowed. The Court of Appeal has repeatedly affirmed the importance of taking into account the special position of the trier of fact on matters of credibility. In R. v. Biniaris, [1992] S.C.R. 122, 1992 CarswellONT 90 wherein McLachlin J., as she then was, commented on the scope of appellate review in summary conviction appeals. Absent an error of law or miscarriage of justice, the test to be applied by the Summary Conviction Appeal Court is whether the findings of the trial judge are unreasonable or cannot be supported by the evidence. Given the experience of both the appellant and the other witnesses, the judge has the advantage, denied to the appellate court, of seeing and hearing the witnesses; of observing their demeanor and conduct, hearing their nuances of speech and subtlety of expression and generally is presented with those intangibles that so often must be weighed in determining whether or not a witness is truthful. This is an issue that is not capable of reflection in the written record. It would be impractical to order a new trial at this date."
9_2008skpc147.txt,"The parties entered into a handwritten agreement with regard to the feeding and maintenance of 100 cows. The plaintiff was to provide labour and the necessary equipment to feed and maintain the cows for $.50 per cow per day. The defendant was to provide the feed and medicine. At paragraph 6 the contract stipulated that the plaintiff was to receive a bonus for each live calf that he got to pasture. The amount of the bonus was left blank. The plaintiff sues the defendant, claiming a bonus for the 2004-2005 year and the 2005-2006 year. HELD: The claim is dismissed. In law an agreement to come to an agreement is not enforceable. This is especially true where an essential term regarding remuneration has not been agreed to. The parties agreed that they would settle on the bonus amount later on but they never did. The plaintiff believes he is still entitled to a bonus. The Court cannot make the agreement for the parties.","The parties signed a handwritten agreement on the 20th day of October, 2004. The contract was to cover feeding and maintenance of one hundred and one cows to be boarded at the plaintiff's farm. The plaintiff did not have copy of the final invoice given to the plaintiff and he, Dobson, did not bring copy of that bill with him to Court. Because the parties are so close in their estimate as to the amount of final cost of the feed, find that the defendant owes the plaintiff $850 and judgment shall issue accordingly. Because each of the parties were partially successful, there was no order as to costs. S. C. Carter, [1] See: C.E.D.

9_2009skqb313.txt,"The appellant appeals a demolition order pursuant to s. 329(4) of The Cities Act issued against his property. Issues on appeal was whether the board erred by considering material which had not been before city council, whether the board committed a jurisdictional error by failing to disclose evidence to the appellant prior to considering the appeal, and whether the board was biased against the appellant. HELD: The appeal is dismissed on all grounds. The board's order is confirmed. Counsel for the City advised that it would be appropriate to extend the suspension of enforcement of the demolition order to a period of 6 months from the date of this court order. The applicant is granted a 6 month period to remedy the problems identified. 1) The board complied with the directions of the Saskatchewan Court of Appeal to ensure all disclosure had been made to the appellant of relevant evidence that would be considered by the board. The board has ensured that the appellant knew the case he had to meet. No error of law has been committed. 2) The appellant had all the information considered by the board disclosed to him. 3) There is no evidence of bias. Oppositely, the evidence supports the board's conclusion that the situation in the building constituted a nuisance related to the activities around the building, including the safety of the residents and surrounding neighbours. There is no evidence of bias against the appellant personally.","The registered owner of the property brought an appeal against the City of Prince Albert's demolition order. The respondent had refused to grant the respondent an adjournment to prepare his appeal on the basis that the city had not received complete disclosure of the case he had to contend with. Dismissing the appeal, that the Board's decision to confirm the demolition order had not been a biased one. The evidence supported the board's conclusion that the situation in the Minto Apartments constituted a nuisance relating to the use and activities surrounding the building, including the safety, health and welfare of the residents and surrounding neighbours. It was too late to raise such an allegation now. There is no denial of natural justice with respect to police information. HELD: The appeal must be dismissed on all grounds. The board's order is confirmed. 1)The respondent had failed to provide sufficient evidence to justify its decision. 2)The evidence did not advance a reasonable inference that the City would have reason to demolish the building. There was no error of law on either side of the issue."
9_2013skca110.txt,"HELD: The Court addressed the issue of jurisdiction by holding that it would follow its usual practice to refuse to hear an entirely new matter argued for the first time on appeal. Since the order being appealed from was not a Part II order under SCNA, what was being appealed was a procedural order under Queen’s Bench Rule 173 and the inherent jurisdiction of the Court, and therefore the Court had jurisdiction to hear the appeal pursuant to ss. 7 and 8 of the Court of Appeal Act. The Court held with respect to the decision in Chambers that the judge properly exercised her discretion and did not err in refusing to grant the stay requested. The Chambers judge appropriately balanced the factors respecting the fairness of allowing re-litigation and determined in all of the circumstances that it would not be unfair to the appellant to allow the SCNA application to succeed because the purpose of that legislation was different and had a wider ambit of The Residential Tenancies Act. However, the result of this appeal could not be taken to have decided whether a public officer’s actions pursuant to a statutory power could be an abuse of process or that an application under The Residential Tenancies Act to terminate a tenancy by the director and subsequent SCNA application respecting the same residence may never be questioned in any circumstances.","The appellant appealed the Chambers judge's decision dismissing his application under Rule 173(e) of the Queen's Bench Rules of Court and the inherent jurisdiction of the Court to strike out or stay the application of the Director of Community Operations for a community safety order under The Safer Communities and Neighbourhoods Act on the grounds that the appellant was trafficking. HELD: Appeal dismissed. 1) The jurisdiction to hear the appeal can be found in the Court's general jurisdiction under ss.7 and 8 of The Court of Appeal Act, 2000 and on the premise that the decision of the judge was made in the context of Queen’s Bench Rule 173 and the exercise of the court's inherent jurisdiction to prevent abuse of process. 2) There is no evidence that this Court was inclined to hear this appeal because it is an interlocutory appeal from a decision which is part of an application under Part II of the SCAN. What is being appealed is in the nature of a procedural order under Queen‘s Bench rule 173 and/or (or the inherent jurisdictional jurisdiction of Court, therefore s.24 of SCAN does not apply. 3) The Court must still decide whether fairness is better achieved by applying issue estoppel, or by refusing to apply it."
9_2014skpc205.txt,"There was contradictory evidence regarding the central issue of consent and therefore the court had to assess credibility. The complainant’s action of fleeing the situation was found to be consistent with both not consenting and with regret, humiliation and embarrassment. The evidence of the accused’s witnesses was found to raise a reasonable doubt about the complainant’s non-consent. The court concluded that the complainant was not as intoxicated as she said; for example, she had a conversation with the accused’s sister. Therefore, the court was also not satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that the complainant was incapable of consenting due to her level of intoxication. It was unnecessary for the court to consider whether the accused had an honest but mistaken belief in consent. The accused was found not guilty.","The accused is charged with sexual assault of the complainant contrary to s. 271 of the Criminal Code. The charge arises from sexual activity that occurred between the accused and the complainant in December 2012. The complainant says that she has no memory of the sexual activity due to an alcohol induced blackout. The Crown argues that there was no consent. The accused does not deny that he had sex with the complainant. He claims that the activity was consensual or, alternatively, that he lacked the mens rea for sexual assault. HELD: The accused is found not guilty. 1) The complainant's conduct raises reasonable doubt about her non-consent and that she was capable of consent and need not consider whether the accused had an honest but mistaken belief in consent. Her level of intoxication is not supported by the evidence of the defence witnesses. 2) There was no doubt that the complainant's subjective state of mind was incapable of communicating with her daughter beyond a reasonable doubt. The evidence of her daughter raised reasonable doubt that she, in her mind, did not want the sexual touching to take place. If the complainant did not consent, did the accused have an honest and mistaken belief that consent? 3) Consent is an essential component of both the actus reus and mens rus. If it believed the activity is consensual, there is no actus deus. However, if the accused believed it was a consensual activity, he lacked an 'actus rea.' 4) The Court heard contradictory evidence with respect to the central issue of consent, this case involves an assessment of credibility, which is to be assessed in light of all the evidence having regard to the principles established by the Supreme Court of Canada in R. v. W.(D.), 1991 CanLII 93 (SCC), [1991] 1 SCR 742. Consent is a determinant of credibility. Consent can be determined by reference to the complainant’s subjective level of mind towards the sexual touch, at the time it occurred. While the complainant testified that she did not see anything but blankets as it was dark in the room, she got into an argument with her father and told the accused to leave."
9_2016skpc123.txt,"HELD: The Charter application was granted. The accused was found not guilty. The court found that the accused’s s. 8 Charter rights had been breached. After applying the Grant analysis, the court decided that the breach was serious and that the unreasonable search affected the accused’s privacy, liberty and dignity because the accused did not invite the officer into her house, she was followed by the officer throughout her home and then handcuffed outside her home in full public view. The court concluded that society’s interests to be free from police interference in their own home without proper judicial authorization supported the exclusion of the evidence. Regarding the impaired driving charge, the accused was found not guilty because of insufficient evidence.","The accused was charged with impaired driving contrary to s. 8 of the Charter. The accused worked at a 7-11 store and was approached by a woman who was intoxicated, had a small child and was driving away from the store. She was concerned that perhaps the woman was out driving around with the child in the vehicle. The police responded by entering the store without consent or invitation and following the accused around the house so she did not lose eye contact with her. The officer applied for a voir dire and the accused was found not guilty. The Crown did not argue the impaired driving charge and there was little if any evidence to support the charge. However, the police officer's behaviour egregious was found to be serious. The Court of Appeal upheld the trial judge's decision that the Crown must prove the essential elements of this charge beyond reasonable doubt. The evidence will be excluded."
9_2016skqb216.txt,"HELD: The application for interim spousal support was granted and the respondent ordered to pay $500 per month. The order was made to diminish the disparity between the income and lifestyles of the parties. The application for interim distribution of property was dismissed. The court found that this was not a situation where the net assets exceeded the amount of the distribution claimed. As the respondent had no liquid assets, the distribution of family property might eventually involve a spousal rollover from the pension funds to the petitioner.","FIAT: The wife applies for interim spousal support and an order providing her with an interim distribution of property in the amount of $25,000. HELD: The application is dismissed. 1) The wife has failed to demonstrate need for support at this time. 2) There is no evidence that the parties have any beneficial interest in the house they were residing in at the date of separation (which appears to be legally owned by third party). 3) Where there is a significant disparity in the incomes of each of the former spouses in the immediate post-separation period, and such economic disparity defines a corresponding disparity in affordability of lifestyles of the current spouses. Spousal Support is the appropriate mechanism to diminish those disparities.  4) The husband's total reported income in 2015 was $74,174. He has one minor child in his care and continues to pay $1,100 in child support each month to his former spouse. He claims that he has no monies remaining after his basic expenses are paid. 5) In this situation, the net assets for distribution far exceed the amount requested. The husband does not take issue with the wife's entitlement to interim support but states that she has not demonstrated need for it. The wife's application for an interim payment of $2,000 per month to equalize the gross incomes of the parties is not an exhaustive list. The statutes do not prescribe separate considerations, factors or objectives for interim support as opposed to final determination of spousals support. The paramount consideration at an early stage of the breakdown is 'need and ability to pay.' This is not a situation where the net asset for distribution 'far exceed' the amount sought. The net assets should provide both the husband's income and his dependents with a more equitable standard of living which more closely relates to that of each other and to the standard of life experienced by both before their separation. Where there are significant economic disparities between the parties, the economic analysis must take into account the needs, needs and other circumstances of each spouse. The spouse is not required to consume one's capital, savings or other family property when there is ability to reallocate family income to overcome disparities in the income of the spouses. Child support obligations take precedence over spousAL support.  6) The court has authority to order an interim order."

HELD: 1)Application allowed. At the time that the applicants were served with the statement of defence and counterclaim, they were not represented by counsel nor did they know that they had to serve and file a statement of defence to the counterclaim. However, immediately upon being served with the garnishee summons they contacted solicitors. The application to set aside the default judgment was made as soon as possible after the judgment came to the attention of the applicants who have explained to the satisfaction of the court their failure to defend the counterclaim. The applicants have clearly shown that they have a good defence on the merits to the counterclaim. The applicants did not delay their application to set aside the judgment so that it cannot be argued that delay will cause irreparable injury to the respondents. 2)Application to set aside guarishee summons dismissed. There has been strict compliance with s.3(2) of the Act. The affidavits filed by the applicants challenging the affidavit for garnishee summons have no bearing on whether the garnishee summons should be set aside. It is not the function of a judge to look into the merits of the case on such an application. 3)Application for payment out of monies garnisheed dismissed. Section 14(1) of The Attachment of Debts Act provides that no order shall be made for payment out of any money paid into court by the garnishee when a garnishee summons issues prior to judgment until the plaintiff has recovered a judgment against the defendant. Since the judgment has been set aside the application for payment out is premature and is therefore dismissed without prejudice to reapply.","This was an application for an order setting aside the default judgment and writ of execution issued against the applicants pursuant to Queen's Bench Rule 441 and s. 10 of The Attachment of Debts Act. HELD: The application to set aside the garnishee summons was dismissed. 1)The applicants had clearly shown that they had a good defence on the merits to the counterclaim.  2)The application was made as soon as possible after the judgment came to the knowledge of the defendant, but mere delay will not bar the application, unless an irreparable injury will be done to the plaintiff or the delay has been wilful."
b_1995canlii5809.txt,"FIAT An employer sought judicial review of a unanimous decision by an arbitration board ordering the reinstatement of an employee. The employee had previously been terminated and then reinstated by the mutual agreement of the union and the employer. The employee was then terminated a second time for a repeat infraction. The employer took the position that the agreement was a 'last chance' agreement and that the arbitration board was therefore required to uphold the second termination. The Board ruled that the agreement was not a 'last chance' agreement because the agreement stated on its face that a further infraction would result in 'discipline up to and including dismissal'. The Board therefore reinstated the employee but imposed a 16 month suspension, without pay. HELD: 1)On issues involving the interpretation of a collective agreement, an arbitration board's decision can only be overturned if it is patently unreasonable. If there is any evidence on the basis of which the board could have found as it did then its decision should not be interfered with, even if the Court would have come to a different conclusion on the same evidence. 2)Decisions involving the interpretation of a statute or the common law, however, are not within an arbitrator's core area of expertise and should therefore be reviewed with reference to the standard of correctness. 3)In this case, the 'mutual agreement' was subsidiary to the collective agreement and its interpretation was therefore within the core area of the arbitrators' expertise. The standard to be applied to the board's interpretation of the mutual agreement was therefore one of patent unreasonableness. 4)The employer's evidence that it had verbally advised the employee that he would be fired for any repeat infraction was rightly rejected as contravening the parol evidence rule. The board's interpretation of the mutual agreement was therefore not patently unreasonable and in fact was correct. 5)The board was also entitled to reject the employer's argument based upon the doctrine of 'culminating incident' and it did not act unreasonably in so doing.","FIAT: An application for judicial review of a unanimous arbitration award by a three-person panel dated December 1, 1994 which reinstated the respondent as an employee of the applicant. HELD: 1)The respondent was reinstated to his former position immediately. The period from August 18, 1993 to the date that this Award shall be treated as a suspension without pay for approximately 16 months. 2)The Board's interpretation of the mutual agreement with respect to clause 10 was correct. 3)The applicant took issue with the fact the Board refused to apply the doctrine of culminating incident and concluded that the August 14, 1993 incident amounted to a culminating incident. 4)The penalty imposed by the Board for taking into account the respondent's absence from work on August 14/93 together with his previous employment record, the appropriate penalty was not discharge. 5)The application was dismissed with one set of costs."

b_1996canlii5058.txt,"The issue was whether $10,000 payable under a GIC was subject to garnishee as a debt due or accruing due within the meaning of s5(1) of the Attachment of Debts Act. The Bank had served a garnishee summons on First Line seeking to attach money owing to David. First Line paid nothing because the debt was not payable until its maturity. When the debtor died First Line paid the money to his estate. Relying on Tradewinds, the chambers judge dismissed the Bank's application. The appeal turned on whether the debt was accruing due or whether it was a conditional debt because it could be assigned. HELD: The appeal was allowed. The GIC was attachable pursuant to s5(1) of the Attachment of Debts Act.  1)The main point was whether the debt was not attachable because it was not accruing due when the garnishee summons was served in that it did not bind the debt. 2)The leading authority, Webb v. Stenton, concluded that existing debts payable in the future are attachable. 3)The garnishability of the debt owing under a promissory note is not prevented because the debt is conditional by reason of the possibility of assignment.  4)Saskatchewan courts have followed Bel-Fran holding that a term deposit is attachable. The only exception is Tradewinds which overlooked the aspect of s5(1) which permits attaching of debts which are accruing due. Tradewinds is contrary to Spiritwood and misapplies the law summarized in Barsi v. Farcas. The historic review demonstrated that there have been gradual changes in the law of garnishment. Based on the cases reviewed the assignability of a GIC is not the type of condition which has been held to affect the determination that a debt is accruing due. 5)Because of the early payment to the estate there were no intervening claims and no priority issue arose. It would be inappropriate to deny judgment in the circumstances. DISSENT: The appeal would be dismissed for reasons other than those reached by the chambers judge. 1)The statement that the creditor cannot be in a better position than the debtor to demand payment under the GIC is probably correct but was not a factor as the Bank was not seeking payment before its maturity date. The Bank's position was the debt had been garnisheed and payment should have been made to the Bank on maturity. 2)The chamber judge's comment that the Bank could have seized the GIC under execution and then had it sold by the sheriff was obiter. 3)The debt was a present debt due on its maturity date and therefore qualified as one that was accruing due. 4)Whether it was conditional depended upon whether the opportunity of assignment constitutes a conditional obligation. There is no significant difference between a promissory note and a GIC as they both contain a promise to pay a sum certain at a designated date. 5)Some jurisdictions specifically provide that a debt payable within six years of the service of the garnishee is garnishable.","Whether money owed under a guaranteed investment certificate (GIC) is a debt 'accruing due' under the Attachment of Debts Act or subject to garnishment cannot be determined by reference only to garnishability of promissory notes not yet due. However, a judgment creditor must be able to prove that debt payable under the GIC is a conditional one and made so by reason of the possibility of assignment. In this case, the Bank applied in Queen's Bench chambers under s.18 of The Attachment Of Debt Act for judgment against Firstline in the amount of $10,100.14. When the Bank learned of the garnishee summons, it applied to the Court of Appeal under s18 of the same Act. The Court held that the garnishment of the debt owing under a GIC was prevented because it was a conditional debt and not a condition precedent to any debt which was not presently due."
b_1996canlii5628.txt,"The plaintiff was terminated as a sales agent after being employed by the defendant for 26 years. As part of the termination package he received 14 months salary continuation. The plaintiff claimed that he had not received 'reasonable notice' and sought damages. He also claimed that he was owed arrears of salary at the time of his dismissal. The defendant argued that the plaintiff had failed to mitigate his damages. Dismissing the action, that the appropriate period of notice was in the range of 14 to 15 months. Since the calculation of a 'reasonable period of notice' is not an exact exercise, either period could have been justified. Thus, it could not be said that the 14 month period given by the defendant was unreasonable. Furthermore, the plaintiff was not owed any arrears. Finally, in view of a non-competition clause in the contract of employment, it was not unreasonable for the plaintiff not to have pursued employment with other insurance companies any more than he had.","The plaintiff was terminated as a sales agent in 1991. He had been with the defendant since 1965 and continued in his position for 26 years. At the time of his termination, the defendant agreed to provide him with relocation counselling services. The plaintiff was also advised he would receive salary continuation and benefits (excluding disability) until January 1993 or until he secured alternative employment, whichever first occurs. HELD: The Court found that the plaintiff's conduct was not unreasonable and did not constitute a failure by the defendant to mitigate his damages. 1)The plaintiff had made little effort to secure alternative employment prior to his termination. The defendant did not seek to justify the termination on the basis the non-competition clause was a material factor in determining whether the terminated employee had made reasonable efforts to seek and obtain alternative employment. 2)The defendant was entitled to credit for 20 months of notice. The Court rejected the claim that 20 months is a reasonable period of notice and found that proper notice period on the evidence to be 14 months, notwithstanding the long service with the plaintiff. The court found that after 14 months following his departure from the defendant, the plaintiff would have secured a position with comparable income if he had elected to start new business."""
b_1996canlii6726.txt,"FIAT. The plaintiffs sought an order preserving and detaining certain proceeds from oil production properties which were being held by an escrow agent pursuant to an order of the bankruptcy court in Alberta and a further order preserving and detaining all future proceeds from those properties. The applicants claimed such orders were necessary to protect their claims under the approximately 408 builders' liens filed against those oil properties. The contents of the statements of claim in each of the five actions were identical. HELD: The application was dismissed. The escrow agent was ordered to remit to Herc the lien property revenues with any interest earned less the agent's appropriate costs. With the exception of SEM the parties appearing through counsel were awarded their costs against the applicants. 1)The tests set out in Bean on Injunctions for granting a mandatory injunction were summarized in Cupar School Division. The tests really state in different forms the generally recognized test for prima facie case, irreparable harm and balance of convenience but with more stringent requirements. 2)Only one lien holder filed an affidavit, no invoices or other information were filed substantiating the amount claimed in any of the liens. The word 'or' used in one of the liens indicated that the person subject to the lien did not know whether the water or oil was transported. Whatever prima facie case the lien holders might have was weakened. 3)The applicants had not established a very strong probability that grave danger will accrue. The risk to the respondents if the order should be granted was far greater than the risk to the applicants if the order were not granted. The oil properties would continue to decline without further development or recovery efforts to maintain or increase production. If a preservation order issued SEM would likely exercise its extensive powers under the Oil and Gas Conservation Act. 4)While s33 of the Builders' Lien Act provides for a lien on the holdback of any trust funds held by the contractor, it does not give the lienholder a charge against any other moneys. A builder's lien cannot be looked on as 'proof' that the amount claimed is what is actually owing. The only remedy open to the lienholder is to enforce its claim under Part VIII of the Builders' Lien Act. The statement of claim said nothing about dates and times. On the material filed it was impossible to know whether any of the respondents were intervening parties within s49(5)(a). 5)The second and third tests were not met. The order would guarantee irreparable harm by freezing the capital necessary to hinder the decline in value. It would be unacceptable to SEM that lien holders should receive the income from the properties without being responsible for the environmental costs. 6)The fourth test required that the defendant know exactly what he has to do. If the order were to issue it would be difficult to determine the proper amount of lien property revenue that should be paid to an escrow agent. There was no definition of net revenues in the Plan. The applicants would have been required pursuant to Rule 390 to pay full compensation before the order was issued.","FIAT. The plaintiffs sought an order preserving and detaining certain proceeds from certain oil production properties, those proceeds now being held by an escrow agent pursuant to an order of the bankruptcy court in Alberta, and a further order preserving the proceeds from future proceeds from those properties.

b_1996canlii7148.txt,"A claim for damages to the plaintiff's leased automobile arising out an accident. The action against the defendant Ruhr had been discontinued. An SGI adjuster appraised the damage but during the course of repairing the vehicle further damage was found. A roving adjuster authorized the replacement of the exhaust system but deducted 20% for depreciation. The plaintiff brought an action for reimbursement of the $503.73 arguing that SGI elected to repair or replace the exhaust system under statutory condition 8(4) of s39 of the Automobile Accident Insurance Act. SGI took the position that as Crestview was the registered owner of the vehicle the plaintiff was not entitled to bring this action as he was not the insured within the meaning of the Act. SGI also argued that Crestview authorized the repairs and acknowledged the 20% deduction as registered owner and that if the plaintiff paid the $503.73 he did so under his private lease contract with Crestview. It also argued that it is entitled to deduct for depreciation in any event. HELD: The claim against SGI was dismissed with taxed costs.  1)An election under statutory condition 8(4) amounts to an irrevocable decision to repair regardless of costs of repairs. Once an election is made the insurer is bound to pay or reinstate. An insurer by its conduct may be deemed to make an election to reinstate. The insurer's election to reinstate unilaterally creates a new contract which the insurer may not unilaterally revoke. On the facts the insurer neither expressly nor by its conduct elected to reinstate. The roving appraiser provided an appraisal to Crestview which included the depreciation deduction. Crestview repaired the vehicle without advising the plaintiff. 2)The concept of waiver in insurance law encompasses an election to pay or to reinstate. Estoppel was not applicable. Two provisions of the Saskatchewan Act provide that SGI in certain situations is not deemed to have waived provisions of the Act. The roving appraiser reassessed the claim and included the newly found damages. These acts related to the appraisal of the claim and could not constitute a waiver of statutory condition 8(1). They did not constitute an election under statutory condition 8(4). Crestview, not SGI, took the steps to repair the vehicle. As the plaintiff did not receive a written waiver of statutory condition 8(1) pursuant to s77 the insurer could not be deemed to have waived its option to enforce statutory condition 8(1).  3)The exhaust system was three years old and had 46,000 km of wear. A 20% deduction for depreciation was appropriate and therefore allowed.  4)It was not necessary to determine whether the plaintiff was the 'insured' as defined by the Act.","This was a claim for damages to the plaintiff's leased motor vehicle arising out of an automobile accident. The plaintiff claimed for reimbursement of the $503.73 deducted for depreciation. The insurer argued that SGI elected to repair or replace the vehicle under statutory condition 8(4) of the Automobile Accident Insurance Act. HELD: The action was dismissed. 1)The plaintiff was not aware of the 20% deduction for depreciation until he attended to pick up the vehicle. The repairs were complete at that time. 2)SGI was not liable beyond the lesser of the actual cash value of the vehicle before the accident and the maximum value of exhaust system as fixed by regulations. The claim was reassessed to include damages for replacement of the exhaust system without the knowledge or involvement of the insured. The insured was entitled to the full cost of the repair. 3)The insurer had elected not to reinstate the vehicle as it had elected to do so. 4)It is not possible to lay down any general principles as to what conduct constitutes an election, since an express election is not necessary. An insurer by its conduct may be deemed to have made an election."
b_1997canlii10986.txt,"FIAT. The plaintiffs applied for an order striking out the statement of defence and counterclaim and separate statement of Helen Rilkoff as not disclosing a reasonable defence or cause of action. The plaintiffs claimed the doctrine of res judicata applied to the claim for damages by virtue of two Small Claims court judgments in 1989 and 1992. The defendants asserted their damages arose in 1994 and that the cause thereof was different than those previously dealt with. HELD: The application was dismissed with costs to the defendants in any event of the cause. 1)The fact that the plaintiffs filed a 55 page brief in support of their submissions and the defendants filed a 14 page brief in response evidenced that the issues were not easily resolved and certainly not on a summary basis.  2)An application to strike out pleadings basically permits only an examination of the impugned pleadings to determine if any justifiable dispute is revealed. If no facts are in dispute, the parties may resort to Rule 188. Only if the defendants consented to the application being converted into an application pursuant to Queen's Bench Rule 188 could the court proceed to resolve the questions of law.","FIAT The plaintiffs applied for an order striking out the defendants statement of defence and counter-claim and separate statement of defense of Helen Rilkoff. HELD: The application was dismissed with costs to the defendants in any event of the cause. The Court was not permitted to embark upon the resolution of legal questions in order to determine whether the pleadings should be struck as requested. The pleadings raised issues which had been dealt with in final decision of court of competent jurisdiction and the defendants were barred by the doctrine of res judicata, or issue estoppel, from pursuing such issues. The issues raised were not susceptible of being resolved on a summary basis and certainly not on a summarily basis.  1)The issues raised in the defendants Statement of Defence did not disclose a reasonable defence nor did the issues in the counterclaim show a reasonable cause of action. 2)The application of the plaintiffs was therefore premature."
b_1997canlii11437.txt,"A month following the birth of the plaintiff's only child by caesarian section, she underwent a hysterectomy on an emergency basis. She believed that the post-partum haemorrhage was caused by retained products of conception and that failure to perform a dilation and curettage procedure resulted in the hysterectomy. HELD: The plaintiff's claim was dismissed with costs. 1)The plaintiff failed to prove that the defendant was negligent in his treatment of her. The doctor's treatment and care met the standard of care expected of the average physician and surgeon, specializing in gynaecology and obstetrics. 2)She failed to prove that the cause of the post-partum haemorrhage was retained products of conception or that his failure to perform a D&amp;C resulted in the necessity of a hysterectomy or because of any other negligent act or omission on his part. The most likely hypothesis was that the post-partum hemorrhage was caused in this case by the necrosis of the cervix. Given the rarity of this condition and paucity of documented medical knowledge the defendant doctor could not be faulted. The evidence did not support the suggestion that a D&amp;C would have cured the hemorrhage. ADDENDUM: 1)The first paragraph was deleted and a new paragraph substituted: Kaban v. Sett in applying Ares v. Venner rejected the view that nurse's notes are only prima facie evidence and, if there is sworn testimony contrary to the notes, the notes cease to be prima facie evidence. 2)A paragraph was added after the quote on page 4: The Manitoba Court of Appeal, in dismissing the plaintiff's appeal, agreed with the trial judge's determination of the admissibility of the nurse's notes.","Following the birth of her daughter, the plaintiff was admitted to the Victoria Union Hospital on an emergency basis as a result of the sudden onset of profuse vaginal bleeding. She was subsequently transferred to the intensive care unit where she underwent a dilation and curettage procedure. The defendant's credibility was challenged on the issue of whether or not he actually performed the D & C, aprocedure which would have remedied the bleeding which in turn would have obviated the necessity of performing the hysterectomy. HELD: The plaintiff's allegations of negligence on the part of the defendant were dismissed. The court found that the defendants' evidence was reasonable and reasonable. The plaintiff had the burden of proving on a balance of probabilities that the defendant failed to perform C. The Court found that, given that retained products of conception were the most likely cause of the hemorrhage, the procedure should have been avoided. There was no evidence that the operating room nurses' notes were fabricated of something that did not happen."
b_1998canlii12364.txt,"The primary issue was whether the youth court has jurisdiction in proceedings which are commenced in youth court where it was not possible to determine whether at the time the alleged offences were committed the accused was a young person or an adult. The secondary issue was whether a writ of mandamus should issue. The accused was charged with two indictable offences, sexual assault and incest, as well as acts of gross indecency. The Crown stayed an identical information previously laid against the accused alleging the same offences occurred when he was an adult. The accused became an adult in October 1985 and was charged with certain offences which occurred between 1985 and 1989. The summary conviction appeal court judge found the provincial court judge erred in declining jurisdiction and that because of the uncertainty when the alleged offences occurred, the accused should be tried under the least onerous regime, youth court. The appeal judge then ordered a writ of mandamus directing the youth court judge to render a decision. It was common ground that a youth court judge does not have jurisdiction with respect to offences committed while he was an adult. HELD: The decision of the summary conviction appeal court was set aside and the matter remitted to youth court. Either party may apply for an order under s16 to decide the proper forum to hear the charges.  1)Section 16 is the ideal vehicle for the youth court to make a proper determination of the proper jurisdiction to hear the charges. If the Crown after a complete investigation is unable to particularize the time when the offence(s) occurred and alleges that it (they) occurred over a period of time which included when the accused was a young offender and an adult, the preferable approach is to have the Crown commence the proceedings in youth court because some of the offences occurred while he was a youth. The Crown should then apply to a youth court judge for a transfer hearing under s16 to determine the proper forum to hear the charges.  2)There are two ways to determine which of the two courts should assume jurisdiction: view the facts in a manner most favorable to the accused and deem the offence was committed when the accused was a young person; or order a transfer hearing under s16(1) of the Young Offenders Act to determine whether the offences should be heard in youth court or ordinary court. 3)The transfer hearing must proceed in an impartial fashion in accordance with the principles of natural justice and s7 of the Charter. 4)Section 16(2) provides the factors to be taken into account in determining the competing interests of the youth and the public. 5)The position taken in the Ontario Court of Appeal in R.v. A(EA) does not lend itself to universal application. R. v. A(EA) is distinguishable and should be confined to its particular facts.","The accused was charged with two indictable offences over a period of seven years. At that transfer hearing, the entire issue of when the offences occurred can be examined and the choice of the proper jurisdiction to hear the charges can be made in the absence of the requirement to determine the guilt or innocence of the accused. HELD: The decision of the summary conviction appeal court judge was set aside and the matter remitted to youth court to be heard according to law. The primary issue on this appeal is whether the youth court judge should have assumed jurisdiction after he found the alleged offences could have occurred when the accused was either a young person or an adult. The Court considered the effects of the transition provisions in the Act and in particular s.79(4) in R. v. B.(K). The Court found that if the Crown was unable to particularize the time when the offence or offences occurred and as a result alleges that it occurred when he was a young offender, the Court remitted the matter to a youth court for an order under s.16 of the Act to decide the proper forum for the charges. It also found that the Court could not determine whether the accused's status changed from young person to adult and that a writ of mandamus would of necessity follow the result of the first issue."

Royal Bank of Canada (supra). 2)The plaintiff paid $6,000 for pain and suffering. 3)The defendant's evidence was both credible and reliable.

In the second application the mother sought to have the paragraph in the 1994 order restraining the parents from removing the children from the province without the other's written consent or court order struck. HELD: 1)The mother was advised to apply by notice of motion with appropriate supporting affidavits.  2)The arrears were $11,838.39 as the father had paid money directly which was not accounted for in the Statement of Arrears. Since the Guidelines were not in force prior to 1997, they do not automatically apply to a support payable prior to 1997. The father's income was sufficient for him to pay child support for 1996 and 1997. Arrears for 1993 to 1995 inclusive were reduced as he was not able to pay according to the order at those times. Upon payment of $5,000 the balance of arrears accrued prior to December 31/98 would be extinguished. 3)The father was to pay child support of $325 per month for the two children. Garnishment of his wages by the Maintenance Enforcement Office were to be limited to $175 per month for arrears plus the current maintenance due. 4)The parties agreed the father should have access not less than one full weekend per month upon two weeks prior notice plus when he was available to attend at the city in a manner consistent with the children's best interests and their need to be available for school.","The respondent seeks an order providing for the following relief: 1) a variation of the child maintenance payable pursuant to the July 16, 1993 order by reducing the monthly rate from $250 to $250; 2) cancellation of the arrears of $13,273.39 in maintenance payments accrued under the order; and 3) variation of access provisions of the order with the view of providing him with greater access to the Children. HELD: The Court was not prepared to hear the application and advised the petitioner to apply by notice motion with appropriate supporting affidavits. The respondent's gross annual income was $22,993. The petitioner's income was not sufficient to enable him to pay the full monthly maintenance provided by the order. The Court ordered that upon the payment of $5000, on account of the $5,000 accrued prior to December 31, 1998, the balance of the debt accrued prior prior to such date shall be extinguished. 1) The respondent was not in a position to pay child support. The court ordered that the respondent should have access not less than one full weekend per month between 6:00 p.m. on Friday to 6:30 p. m. on Sunday upon two weeks prior notice together plus other periods of time when he is available to attend at Saskatoon for the purpose of exercising access in a manner consistent with the best interest of the children including their need to be available for school.  2) The petitioner is entitled to access on any given weekend.

b_2001skqb124.txt,"The medical doctor alleged the other medical doctors owed a fiduciary duty to act in good faith with respect to their agreement to perform on-call services for the District Health Board. Under the voluntary arrangement doctors who chose not to enter the arrangement remained on-call to look after their own patients and to respond to emergencies. It worked well until Hanna established another clinic and began dividing his time between Regina and the Moosomin clinic. HELD: The actions against the doctors and health district were dismissed with taxed costs.  1)Hanna's exclusion from the roster was authored by his own conduct. When he was habitually late on his weekend on-call duties and sometimes failed to show at all, the remaining doctors set up a new on-call roster which did not include him. Such action was necessary under the bylaws governing the hospital and to provide good patient care to the hospital. He was not only remiss in performing his on-call duties but there were serious questions about his professional competence. He would admit a patient and fail to attend upon him or her for several days. Or he would fail to diagnose an obvious condition. His reasons for his failure to attend a meeting convened by the hospital administrator to resolve the problems was unacceptable. 2)There was no evidence of a legally binding contract between the doctors. The on-call arrangement was voluntary. There was no expressed intention that it be legally enforceable. 3)The common characteristics defining a fiduciary relationship were discussed in Baskerville v. Thurgood. There was no fiduciary with power over anyone and therefore no fiduciary relationship with respect to the doctors.  4)The relationship between the hospital and its doctors having privileges in the hospital is one that is defined by the Hospital Standards Act and Regulations and bylaws of the Health District. Consideration was also given to the relationship with the College of Physicians and Surgeons. A hospital is never, on the facts, in the position of a fiduciary towards its doctors. There was no basis in law or fact supporting the existence of a fiduciary relationship between Hanna and the Health District.","The plaintiff medical doctor brought an action against the defendants alleging that each of them owed a duty of trust and a fiduciary duty to act towards him in good faith in connection with an arrangement entered into by all of them to perform the on-call services required of them by the defendant, Pipestone District Health Board.

Rather, the hospital tolerated the plan and, to that extent, cooperated with the doctors in its implementation because when it operated well it delivered to the hospital the services it required. 3)The court dismissed the plaintiff's action against Crouse and Kirsch. 4)The Court dismissed the action against Hanna."

b_2002skqb72.txt,"Both sought to vary the June 30, 1999 child support order under which the father was to pay monthly child support of $987 based on an income of $80,278. He ceased paying when the children did not attend school full-time. The 21 year old worked for several years before returning to his mother's home in August 2001 and commencing full-time studies. He continued to work part-time and obtained student loans and a student line of credit. The daughter resumed living with her mother in January 2002 and was attending university full-time. Both adult children were assuming responsibility for most of their education costs by taking student loans. The mother's position was the father should pay the table amount of support for both children and his proportionate share of post-secondary expenses not covered by student loans. At issue also was payment of arrears for July to December 2001. HELD: 1)The father was to pay $1,153 per month for support for the adult children for the months of September to April inclusive, pursuant to s.3(2)(a) and 3(1)(a) of the Guidelines. Based on the criteria set forth in Farden and Zaba, both children were children of the marriage as contemplated by the Act. They were involved in the reasonable pursuit of post-secondary education and neither was able to withdraw from the charge of their parents. It was appropriate to determine the obligation in accordance with s.3(2)(a). The student loans covered most direct education expenses of tuition, books and fees. The line of credit was not considered a part of the son's means available to meet his needs. The father has a reasonably substantial income ($96,300) and cannot seek to reduce or avoid a child support obligation by guaranteeing a loan, which the child will have to repay. Child support arrears for July to December 2001 for the son to a total of $2,872 were payable at a rate of $718 per month. The daughter's needs were met while attending university in Alberta.  3)While it would appear beyond debate that an adult child must make reasonable efforts to contribute to his or her support and education, it is not so clear how this is to be applied to an individual circumstance. The principles enunciated in Francis were recast in the context of s.3(2). A similar summary, albeit with respect to an application under s.4, is found in Metzner as reiterated in MacDonald. It is clear from Francis that determining inappropriateness is not a matter of the court determining what the budget ought to be and whether a Table amount exceeds that budget. To revert to such an approach is to undermine the presumptive rule and legislated objectives of predictability, consistency and efficiency. 4)The father was to pay his proportionate share (80%) of any expenses not covered within 30 days of such funds being due. If the parties were unable to work out an adjustment for any unused education tax credit, an application may be brought to court. 5)The mother was awarded her costs of the application fixed at $750.","The parties sought to vary the existing child support order. They have two children, Luke, age 21 and Amanda, age 18. Under the terms of the order, the respondent was paying child support in the amount of $987 per month on the basis of an income of $80,278. HELD: 1) The respondent failed to apply s. 3(2)(b) of the Guidelines by failing to have resort to the provisions of subsection 3(3)(b). The child was not a child of the marriage inasmuch as he is not dependent upon his parents for the necessaries of life. He works part-time and earns $475 per month from his part time employment. The petitioner is involved in the reasonable pursuit of post-secondary education and has the ability to contribute adequately to their food, shelter and related expenses when not in attendance at school. The respondent's income in 2001 was $18,000 per annum out of total living expenses, exclusive of source deductions of approximately $30,000.  2) Based on the criteria set forth in Farden and Zaba, supra, both Luke and Amanda are children of the Act and, if so, the extent of the obligation of parents to support their child. In the circumstances at hand, it would be appropriate to calculate arrears only for the support of Luke during the months of September to December."
b_2003skqb397.txt,"The plaintiff claims that his father intended to designate him as the sole beneficiary of a $60,000 mutual fund but that this plan was defeated by the negligence of the defendants. The defendant admitted he was aware of the deceased's intention to leave the investment to his son. The defendant entered the plaintiff's name in the beneficiary designation portions of the fund application. However, the beneficiary designation was void by virtue of the mutual fund being non-registered. The defendant gave evidence that he advised the deceased that he would have to make a specific bequest in his will. The deceased made no special designation in his will and, at his death, the investment became part of the residue of his estate and was divided between the plaintiff and his sister. HELD: The plaintiff was awarded judgment against the defendant Nordstrom for half the value of the investment at its maturity, plus pre-judgment interest and costs.  1) Nordstrom was a professional, who held himself out as possessing special skill, judgment and knowledge in financial planning. The advice and information provided to the deceased was provided in the course of the defendant's business. The defendant had a financial interest in the transaction and was cognizant of the fact that the realization of the deceased's intent to benefit the plaintiff was dependent upon there being a valid beneficiary designation. The products sold by the defendant are used as estate planning tools. The intervention of death removed any opportunity to correct the matter and, without the application of the Wilhelm principle, this financial planner would go scott free and the plaintiff would bear the loss. The 'disappointed beneficiary' principle was applicable in this case.","The plaintiff claims that the mutual fund ought never to have formed part of his father's estate. It was his father’s intention to name him as beneficiary of the fund but that this plan was defeated by the negligence of the defendants. HELD: 1) The plaintiff had cause of action as disappointed beneficiary for 50 percent of the value of the investment at its maturity. He was cognizant of the fact that the realization of his intent to benefit Garry Mayer was dependent upon there being a valid beneficiary designation. The products sold by Nordstrom are frequently used as estate planning tools. The intervention of death removed any opportunity to correct the matter and, without application of the Wilhelm principle, this financial planner would go scott free and the third party would bear the loss. 2) The defendant was a chartered life underwriter and financial consultant who sold life and investment products through Canada Life Assurance Company and Dataplan Securities Ltd. He and his client purchased an annuity life policy through Nordstrom for a lump sum premium of $60,000. When the annuity matured in 1994, it was withdrawn by the defendant and deposited to his own account. The plaintiff shall have pre-judgment interest from the date of death of the client to his date of this judgment and his costs to be taxed. 3) Given that Nordstrom was professional who held himself out as possessing special skill, judgment and knowledge in financial planning, his completion of the beneficiary designation on the application form could do nothing but cause confusion in Mayer's mind. His failure to take these steps and his inexplicable compliance with the Mayer's request to designate beneficiary regardless of its efficacy do not reflect the standard of conduct and care one is reasonably entitled to expect of a professional. All evidence of a failure of the defendant to discharge his duty of care to the client and consequently, his negligence is dismissed. 4) The court found that the defendant was aware that the Trimark fund would not recognize a designated beneficiary but that the conclusion of the transaction of the applicant was dependent on it being a non-registered plan. The failure of Nordstrom to act in accordance with the principles articulated in White v. Jones, [1995] A.C. 207 (H.L.), by which remedy, akin to that flowing from the application of Hedley principles, is accorded an intended beneficiary where solicitor, on taking instructions for a will, can reasonably foresee the deprivation of an intended legacy if due care is not taken. 5) The Court found that in addition to the duty owed to the defendant"

Application dismissed; the evidence would not be so complex and scientific that the plaintiff's substantive right to a jury trial should be denied. Although the medical charts exceeded 1500 pages, the more relevant hospital records were less than 100 pages; the essence of the liability issue would be limited in time, in the most relevant anatomical area and in the number of medical personnel involved in the relevant interventions; the factual material did not appear to be in dispute; and the issues were no more complex than most causation issues presented in medical malpractice cases.","The plaintiff was injured in a single motor vehicle accident shortly after midnight while riding in vehicle operated by the defendant. The accident was substantially based on injuries he received in the accident and more specifically, on the treatment provided to him by the other respondent at the Cape Breton Regional Hospital. The plaintiff's wife died shortly after the plaintiff's operation to insert pressure clamps in the presence of an undetected disk hernia. Jurisdiction: the evidence will not be so complex and scientific that the applicant's substantive right to a trial by jury should be denied. The evidence will be limited in time and in the most relevant anatomical area (the thoracic vertebrae region of the spinal column). The medical experts will mainly focus on the interventions of the medical personnel at the medical centres at Neil's Harbour, Sydney and Halifax. However, the principal subject matter will be the medical condition of the plaintiff by virtue of her cross-claim against the plaintiff and her use of radiological investigation to determine if there was disk herniation or impingement into the spinal canal."
b_2006skqb183.txt,"The plaintiffs seek damages arising from the alleged nuisance and negligence caused the defendants in the operation of the golf course. The plaintiffs also seek an injunction to prohibit the defendants from continuing to operate the golf course in a manner that causes errant golf balls to enter the plaintiffs' property. HELD: 1) The court looked at other jurisdictions for guidance as to what number of errant balls might constitute a nuisance. It would appear that anything from 200 golf balls and up over the span of a year is definitely an unreasonable interference with the use and enjoyment of one's own property. Over a span of 9 years, the plaintiffs have had approximately 1,000 golf balls per year enter their property. In this case, the number of golf balls being hit onto the adjacent properties from the defendant's golf course is far greater than the number cited in many of the cases put forward. There is no doubt then that the present operation of the ninth hole is a nuisance and continues to be a nuisance.  2) The wording of the Optionee's Indemnity clause is of little value to the defendants given the evidence of the parties. The evidence confirms that when the residential area was developed and the contract signed, no one, including the operator, anticipated the extent of the existing problem. Accordingly, the plaintiffs could not have agreed to save the defendant harmless from a problem of this magnitude. 3) The plaintiffs will be compensated for the extensive physical damaged to the plaintiffs' properties, but also for the loss of the use and enjoyment of their yards for 7 months of the year. 4) The plaintiffs are entitled to injunctive relief to put an end to the nuisance that has continued for the past 9 years. The defendants are enjoined from allowing golfers from hitting golf balls on the ninth hole so that they land anywhere near the plaintiffs' property.","The plaintiffs sued for damages arising from alleged nuisance and negligence caused by the defendants, Great Plains Leaseholds Ltd. and the Town of White City with respect to their operation of the golf course and for a permanent injunction to prohibit the defendants from continuing to operate the course in a manner that causes errant golf balls to enter the plaintiffs' property. HELD: 1) The plaintiffs were awarded injunctive relief to put an end to the nuisance which had continued for the past nine years.  2) The defendant was ordered to pay $18,000 for the loss of use and enjoyment of their property over the course of the next 9 years. 3) The defendants refused to accept either of the recommendations in the report. 4) The plaintiff's claim for damages against the defendants was dismissed. 5) The court held that the defendant should only be responsible for those damages arising since they became the owners of the course. 6) The Court did not order the specific course of action that the defendants should take in order to remedy the problem. The expert’s report has been filed. In that report he made certain recommendations, one of which was that the plaintiffs should have planted more trees themselves. The plaintiffs refused to do so. 7) It would appear that this clause was of little value to the defendants given that the evidence of all of the parties confirms the fact that when the residential area was developed and the contract was signed, no one, including the operator, anticipated the extent of the existing problem and, accordingly, the plaintiffs Cattell and Mack could not have agreed to save the defendant harmless from a problem of this magnitude. 8) In addition, the defendants were ordered to recover the plaintiffs from the claim by Bosenberg and Strassburg, who continue to have the same problem with the golf balls. 9) There were several other factors that would cause golf balls being hit from the adjacent golf course to enter plaintiffs’ yards over the past 9 years, including golfers driving the ball as hard as they are presently doing in an attempt to reach the green. This failure has not only caused extensive physical damage to the plaintiffs property, but has also resulted in loss of enjoyment of the property for seven months of the year and for these damages they should be compensated. If you overlay this obsession with distance onto the current design of the ninth hole, and add to that the prevailing wind direction, together with the golfer's perceived or real need to compensate for the wind direction and speed, you often end up with a misalignment"
b_2008skpc104.txt,"The accused was charged with resisting arrest contrary to s. 129(a) of the Criminal Code. The defence argued that there were insufficient grounds for the accused's arrest and he was therefore justified in resisting his detention. The Crown's position was that the police were justified in arresting the accused for being drunk in public. HELD: The Crown has proved beyond a reasonable doubt that the officers were engaged in the lawful execution of their duty when the accused resisted their efforts to arrest him pursuant to The Summary Offences Procedure Act. There was a complaint to police concerning the accused. He was heard and seen banging on the door of an apartment. He smelled of alcohol. He was slightly unsteady on his feet and he was yelling and swearing at the police. Given the complaint and the observations made by the attending constables, it was reasonable for them to believe that the accused was intoxicated due to the use of alcohol. He was causing a disturbance to others. Prior to his arrest, the accused began to yell at the officers in a parking lot which is, without any doubt, a public place. No one else was present who may have been capable and willing to take charge of the accused. The defence argued that in these circumstances the arresting officers should have questioned that accused as to where else he might go to sleep off his intoxication. The Crown submitted that in circumstances such as this, the police are not required to sit down and discuss with the accused where he might go. In the Court's view, s. 52(2) of The Summary Offences Procedure Act should be interpreted as meaning that there must be no other person present at the scene who is capable and willing to take care of the person who is subject to arrest. There was no such person in this case. The arrest was, on these facts, lawful.","The accused was charged with resisting arrest contrary to s. 129(a) of the Criminal Code.

The summary conviction appeal judge raised the issue of the sufficiency of the charge on its own motion. The face of the ticket purported to charge the accused with an offence under s. 66(3) of The Vehicle Equipment Regulations. HELD: The charge was declared a nullity because it was drafted so poorly that it did not give fair notice to the accused of the charge or the penalty to be imposed if breach was established. Section 66(3) of The Vehicle Equipment Regulations purports to make displaying aftermarket tint an offence, but the section is a charging offence and does not prescribe a penalty. The correct way to charge an accused with this offence is under s. 113 of The Traffic Safety Act which makes it an offence to operate a motor vehicle on a public highway that is not equipped in accordance with the regulations. The count could not be amended to cure the defect because the charge was a nullity and void ab initio. The conviction was quashed.","The appellant was convicted after an ex parte trial before a Traffic Safety Court justice for 'unlawfully have sunscreen in front side windows' contrary to's. 66(3) The Vehicle Equipment Regulations'.

The Crown was given an opportunity to present evidence of previous convictions for the same type of offence with the same vehicle and asked the Court to impose a fine of $200. The appellant refused, and the appeal was allowed. The appeal was quashed and the conviction declared void because it did not address the sufficiency of the charge. HELD: Appeal allowed. 1)It is not possible to amend the count so as to cure the defect. This is because the count, as drafted, is a nullity and is not capable of amendment.  2)The appeal is allowed. 3)The Court invited both the Crown and the appellant to address the issue of sufficiency."

The complainant was an off duty police officer who left his home and knocked on the passenger window. The accused exited the van and assaulted the complainant resulting in the complainant receiving a broken nose and ankle. The accused was charged with aggravated assault and assaulting a police officer. The accused asserted a defence of self-defence to the charge of assault and questioned whether the complainant was properly identified and acting as a police officer in the line of duty at the time of the incident. HELD: The accused was convicted of aggravated assault and acquitted of the charge of assaulting a peace officer. 1) Regardless of whether the complainant was acting in the course of his duties as a police officer, he had a lawful right to intervene to prevent the continuation of the breach of the peace he witnessed. Even if the original actions of the accused might be viewed as originally defensive in nature, he clearly used more force than was necessary to defend himself.  2) Although three of the Crown's witnesses identified that the complainant identified himself as a police officer, none of the versions of what occurred were consistent with the other. The Court was left with doubt as to whether the mens rea of assaulting police officer was proven, namely that the accused knew that the officer in question was in fact a police officer.","The accused was charged with aggravated assault contrary to s. 268(1) of the Criminal Code and breach of a peace officer by unlawfully assaulting the complainant.

The accused had not been properly identified and properly acted as a police officer in the line of duty at the time of the assault. The complainant was on his back on the boulevard beside the van and was being assaulted by the accused when the accused exited the vehicle and literally flew at the complainant, flailing his arms and fists and as result of the complainant defending himself from the assault he fell and the assault resulted in his ankle being broken.

b_2011skqb219.txt,"The applicant is a residential unit owner in the condominium corporation. He sought a declaration pursuant to Queen's Bench Rule 664 interpreting the bylaws of the condominium corporation with respect to the voting rights of the commercial unit owners. The condominium has 32 units with the three largest units being commercial units. The remaining 29 units are residential. The parties agreed that the commercial owners were entitled to nominate and vote for three positions on the Board of Directors. A dispute arose as to whether the commercial owners were entitled to vote on the election of the positions on the Board designated for representatives of the residential unit holders. The Board of Directors passed a resolution interpreting the bylaw such that the commercial owners were entitled to nominate up to three people for election to the Board, all owners were entitled to vote on all nominees, all the owners agreed to cast their votes so as to elect the commercial owners nominees and where that does not happen the commercial owners are entitled to vote as a class to elect their nominees and there is no restriction in the bylaw limiting the right of the commercial owners to vote on positions to the Board. HELD The appropriate standard of review is that of reasonableness and deference must be given to the Board of Directors with regard to its interpretation of the bylaw. There is no specific provision in the bylaws that would restrict the voting rights of the commercial owners. Prohibiting any owner from voting altogether would be contrary to s. 41 of The Condominium Property Act because the Act provides that all owners are to vote on all questions proposed at any meeting. The proper interpretation of the bylaws has nothing to do with the principles of contract interpretation. The application was dismissed. The interpretation of the bylaw by the Board of Directors was reasonable and that Court was not prepared to interfere with it.","The applicant, a residential unit owner, brought an application against the Condominium Corporation, its board of directors and the owners of three commercial units seeking relief pursuant to Rule 664 of The Queen's Bench Rules. HELD: The application was granted. The preliminary decision clarifying what the Court would disregard within the affidavits was provided prior to the argument of the merits of the application. To do so would result in Section 3.3 of Bylaw No. being in contravention of s. 41 of the Act, and that is prohibited by s. 47 of The Act. The Court was not prepared to accept the conclusion that principles of contract interpretation have no place within the scope of the within application, being the interpretation of condominium bylaws."
b_2012nssc225.txt,",  motion denied. The court considered Rule 37.02(c) and distinguished between the terms 'same' and 'similar' with respect to claims involving the 'same transaction' and determined the use of the term 'same' indicated it must involve the same transaction and not merely similar transactions. The court stated that there should be more than a single common question of law or question of fact except in the simplest of cases to grant a motion for consolidation. The more issues and facts in common, the more supportive those factors will be toward consolidation. The court found there was insufficient evidence of commonality between the actions and dismissed the applicants' motion for consolidation on the basis that the actions were based on similar transactions but not the same transactions. The court did not consider the applicant's request to have the matters heard sequentially because it was raised only during their reply oral submissions to the court. The court suggested that Rule 37.04, which would have allowed for common issues to be tried or heard together, would have been most applicable but was not relied upon by the applicants. The court dismissed the motion.","The applicants sought to consolidate their claim against the defendants, with three other actions, all involving the same defendants and allegations regarding the improper negligent conduct of an investment advisor. HELD: The Court dismissed the motion. The Court found that there was no evidence to establish that the series of transactions were all part of the same transaction as contemplated by Rule 37.02 of the Judicature Act. It also found that the law with respect to consolidation has become unclear since the advent of the new Rules. It remains, as it was in the past, a balancing of factors. It is not possible at this juncture to determine the degree of commonality in what the pleadings disclose as being four relatively complex actions."

The defendant is being sued by the plaintiff for damage caused to a construction site under a bridge in Saskatoon. The damage is alleged to have been caused when the defendant's truck left the ramp leading onto the bridge and fell into an excavation pit. The defendant argues that the City should be added as a third party because the City did not take proper steps to clear snow from the ramp, which provided a surface for his vehicle to launch off of. HELD: The application to add the City of Saskatoon as a third party was granted. The applicant has made out a prima facie case against the proposed third party. There is no prejudice to the plaintiff because he has settled with his insurer and is requesting settlement with the defendant's insurer.

The consent judgment provided that the husband should make an equalization payment of $105,000 to be composed of cash and/or a rollover of retirement funds. The husband wants to satisfy the judgment by paying the sum of $5,000 in cash and rolling over $100,000 in RRSPs, unreduced for tax. Applying a 25% discount for tax, the proposal is equivalent to $80,000. The husband argued that the consent order was not dispositive and that if the tax implications were a controlling factor they should have been specifically addressed in the judgment.HELD: The Court held that it is common practice in family property distributions to discount RRSPs to their after-tax value. The fact that that principle was not stated explicitly in the judgment was not fatal to the application. The evidence introduced at the hearing of the wife's position in pre-trial calculations clearly indicated that she expected the discount for tax on RRSPs. Therefore, the Court ordered that the judgment be satisfied by way of rollover of RRSPs in the amount of $111,600.","FIAT: The wife sought an order requiring the husband to pay the equalization payment under a consent judgment or alternatively that the consent judgment be set aside and trial dates ordered. HELD: 1) The wife was entitled to $105,000 net in cash or cash equivalents with at least $65,000 being the cash composition. She was not aware the husband had significant RRSPs. The husband argued that the trial judge erred in failing to discount the value of funds held as RRSP to adjust for tax implications. He argued that this discount for tax was explicit in the wife's position in her pre-trial calculations, in her valuations, and in all valuations of property discussed thereafter.

The complainant testified that she did not believe the accused when he told her that he remained in the basement of the house for most of the night in question, that he did not go to K.S.'s bedroom and that he never had contact with her. The accused elected trial by way of indictment on both charges. HELD: The accused was found guilty of both counts. The Court found that the evidence of the complainant as to what transpired in the bedroom during the early hours of March 1 was not credible. The evidence on the other side of the argument was not supported by the evidence on either side. The court found that there was no evidence that the accused had pulled the blanket away from her or that he removed his pants when she told the officer that she didn't know if the blanket was removed or if she did see him remove his pants. It was entirely possible for the jury to disbelieve the complainant and conclude that they had reasonable doubt as to the credibility of the witnesses."
b_2014skca82.txt,"The Crown did not meet the onus under s. 676(1)(a) of the Criminal Code, and therefore the appeal was dismissed. The Appeal Court found that the Crown must satisfy the court of two things: 1) that an error of law was made on the standard of correctness; and 2) that the error had a material bearing on the acquittal. The Court of Appeal dealt with the Crown’s arguments as follows: 1) while it is an error to mistake the elements of an offence the Court found that the trial judge did not do so. The trial judge did, unfortunately, state that the speed needed to be proved beyond a reasonable doubt but the trial judge did not confuse the factual speed issue with either the mens rea or actus reus; 2) the trial judge thoroughly reviewed each of the witnesses’ testimony. The trial judge did not have to refer to every piece of evidence or explain exactly how each piece of evidence was weighed or considered in the reasons; and 3) the trial judge did err in applying the criminal standard of proof beyond a reasonable doubt to the different pieces of evidence going to the vehicle’s speed. The trial judge concluded that the minimum speed must be accepted because the higher speeds were not proven beyond a reasonable doubt. The Court of Appeal concluded that the verdict would not have necessarily been different but for the error in law; speed was the only driving factor suggested to be dangerous. The Crown also questioned the admissibility of the analyst’s opinion evidence on appeal, although they did not at trial. The Crown was not allowed to raise arguments on appeal that were not raised at trial. The analyst was originally a Crown witness at the preliminary inquiry and then he was a defence witness at trial. Further, the Appeal Court declined to give an opinion on the weight that should have been given to the analyst’s testimony because that was a question of fact for the trial judge.","The Crown appeals the acquittal of the respondent from a charge of dangerous driving causing bodily harm, contrary to s. 249(3) of the Criminal Code. The Crown argues that the trial judge erred in law by subjecting individual pieces of evidence to the standard of proof beyond reasonable doubt. HELD: The appeal is dismissed. 1) The Crown has failed to overcome the heavy onus required to overturn appeals from acquittals under s. 676(1)(a). 2) It is an error of law to make finding of fact for which there is no evidence. 3) The trial judge correctly stated and applied the elements of the offence. In this case, the Crown failed to establish beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused's speed was anything more than 93 to 99 kilometres per hour or that it was objectively dangerous in the circumstances."
b_2017skqb81.txt,"HELD: The issues were determined as follows: 1) the applicant applied pursuant to The Seizure of Criminal Property Act, 2009, as that version of the Act was in place at the time of the seizure. The respondent argued that s. 35.1 did not apply at the time of seizure, because it was not in the Act at the time of seizure. The respondent argued that the two-year limitation period pursuant to The Limitations Act applied to the application with the date of seizure being the date of discoverability. The respondent also argued that the 2009 Act did not have retrospective application. The court found that the applicant applied pursuant to the 2009 Act and therefore the matter was assessed from that perspective. Section 35.1 of the 2009 Act required applications for forfeiture to be made within two years from the director becoming satisfied that the property sought to be forfeited was proceeds of unlawful activity or an instrument of unlawful activity. The court found that the words “Notwithstanding The Limitations Act” at the beginning of s. 35.1 served to provide an intention to prioritize the content of s. 35.1 over The Limitations Act. An affidavit filed by the applicant indicated that the director became satisfied that the property was an instrument of unlawful activity after August 2016. The director’s application was brought four months later, well within the two-year limitation period. The court then considered whether the 2009 Act had retrospective application and found that B. had the same legal position and faced the same jeopardy regardless of the version of the legislation, and therefore, there was no retrospective problem;  2) s. 7 outlined the test to apply. The court accepted the expert’s evidence with regards to the significance of the factors evidencing drug trafficking and how common they were to the drug trafficking trade. The applicant’s evidence also showed that the person alleging to purchase the truck from the respondent was not the purchaser and the purchase price was $8,000, not $16,000. The court found it more likely than not that the money was proceeds of unlawful activity; and 3) B. did not provide evidence or argument to support the exception that forfeiture would clearly not be in the interests of justice. The property was found to be proceeds of unlawful activity and the forfeiture order was granted.","This is an application by the Director under the The Seizure of Criminal Property Act for an order directing the forfeiture of $10,475.00 to the Crown in Saskatchewan. The property had been seized by the Regina Police Service from William Ross Butler in 2008. Since Mr. Butler filed notice of dispute in response to those proceedings, the Director applied to this Court for forfeiture order pursuant to Part II. HELD: The application was brought four months later and fell comfortably within the two year limitation window prescribed by s. 35.1. The Director's application is not statute barred and there is no limitations issue. 1) The current legislative mandate reflected in the 2009 Act is prospective in operational effect and not retroactive. 2) There is no retroactivity problem. The facts and circumstances of the seized property are consistent with the purchase and sale of the goods. The date of discovery is irrelevant as is the need for a finding of criminal culpability. 3) The reality is that the Director commenced proceedings under the 2009 act thus the Director's authority to pursue a forfeiture order must be assessed from that perspective alone. The present case boils down to: 1) Whether the property was seized prior to the limitation period expired; and 2) Whether an order granted under this legislation in relation to property seized before this legislation came into force is retroactive in effect. The effect of the legislation is to deny for the future right to deduct enjoyed enjoyed in the past but the right is not affected as a result of the enactment of the amending statute. The legislation is civil not criminal in nature, and it is an in rem remedy."

c_1996canlii6728.txt,"Issues included the division of a pension, child and spousal support and whether to transfer or have sold the matrimonial home which had a small equity. The petitioner was an undischarged bankrupt and any funds in his possession belonged to the trustee. The only marital asset of any value was the petitioner's pension but lump sum payment was not available for five years as there was a liquidity problem. The parties had been 'spenders' not 'savers'. HELD: 1)The respondent was to pay child support for one child. 2)Spousal support was denied. 3)The matrimonial home was to be sold and proceeds were to be divided equally.  4)Three values were suggested for valuation and distribution of the pension plan. The retirement method of calculating the value of the pension yields the fairest value as opposed to the termination method. The practice by the plan administrator on marriage breakdown was to divide the pension on the basis of the commuted value only and excess contributions were not considered for the purpose of the lump sum transfer to a locked in spousal RRSP. The options were to leave the funds in the plan and defer payment until age 65 or have the commuted value transferred to a locked-in RRSP. The respondent was to make the choice between the only two options. If she wished to have the funds in her name immediately, she was to provide written notification otherwise there would be an order that the respondent is to receive a portion when the monthly pension benefit commences.","HELD: The court ordered the matrimonial home to be sold and the proceeds divided equally between the parties. The husband had already reached the earliest eligible retirement date but had not retired. The wife had been employed throughout the marriage and continued to be employed. The parties were'spenders' not'savers'. Through the circumstances of the debts and Scott's bankruptcy, the wife had relied on the husband's employment demands to her family obligations. The court determined that the maximum amount available for transfer to spousal RRSP by reason of the marriage break-down was $75,300. The only marital asset of any value is Scott's pension. There are no funds available for any lump sum payment. Even if such funds were available, Scott would still be an undischarged bankrupt and any amount transferred to a locked-in RRSP would be taxed equally."

The respondent had served notice to lapse all of the caveats which were based on an agreement taken by Freeholders Oil from the registered owner of the minerals. The respondent sought an order directing the caveats be continued on the condition Home Oil commence an action within a reasonable time to determine their validity. At issue was whether the caveator or the challenger should be required to initiate an action. HELD: The caveats were to be continued until a further court order was filed in the Land Titles Office or until they were withdrawn. 1) Each of the agreements was prima facie still in existence as there had been no cancellation or rescission of the agreements and Home Oil was the valid successor of the interest of Freeholders. 2) Further documentation would be required by a trial judge to determine the issue of the validity of Home Oil's interest in the leases including whether Home Oil's lease violated the rule against perpetuities.  3) Home Oil was given its costs of the application.,"FIAT.

The respondent sought to lapse the caveats and served notices to lapse on the applicant in respect to all of the caveats. HELD: The caveats were to continue until further order of the Court, or until withdrawn. 1)The court found that there was a prima facie agreement in existence and Home Oil was the valid successor of the Freeholders Oil Co. case. 2)The caveat was to be continued on condition that the Caveator commence action to establish the alleged agreement for sale. 3)HELD: Further documentation was ordered.

At issue was whether s5.3 of the Trade Union Act authorized the Board to make such an order. HELD: The appeal was dismissed with costs.  1)The Board recognized the question to be a jurisdictional question. The standard of review is whether the decision was correct rather than patently unreasonable. 2)The chambers judge arrived at the correct conclusion whether from the point of view of the plain meaning of the words of s5.3 or the context of the entire statute or a purposive approach.  3)S5.3 refers to the 'board' which is defined by s2(c) to be the LRB and accordingly referred to applications and orders of the LRB. The interim power is not only based on the final power but is also part of the final power and both are part of the same process. 4)S25(1), when read with ss(1.1) and (1.2) indicates an intention on the part of the legislators to grant exclusive jurisdiction to arbitration boards to deal with disputes arising out of the interpretation of collective agreements. 5)Whatever the scope of s42, it cannot be used to release the restrictions of a statutory provision the very purpose of which is to define the jurisdiction of the LRB to act in respect of such matters.","This appeal is from an order which quashed an interim order of the Labour Relations Board pending the determination of a grievance by an arbitration board, even though it had no power to make any final order respecting the proceedings before the arbitration board.

c_1998canlii12344.txt,"At issue was whether the right of appeal to a board of revision against a municipal tax assessment was exercised properly having regard for s303(1) of the Rural Municipality Act and how and when notice was given. The company posted the notice of appeal by registered mail the day before the expiration of the 20 day appeal period. The notice arrived at the post office on a Friday, the day after the period expired and was picked up by the administrator the following Monday. The Appeals Committee refused to direct the board of revision to hear the appeal on the basis the company failed to give notice within the period prescribed by s303(1) and concluded that the board did not have the power to extend the time. HELD: The appeal was allowed. The board of revision was directed to hear and determine the assessment appeal. 1)The Committee did not err in deciding the prescribed time period for an appeal could not be extended.  2)The less formal expression 'to give notice to' as used in the Act is a less exacting term than 'to serve notice upon'. Wascana Energy exercised its right of appeal properly, or at least effectively, requiring the board of revision to entertain the appeal.","The question in this case is whether the right of appeal to a board of revision against a municipal tax assessment was exercised properly, or at least effectively, having regard for the governing provisions of the statute and the fact of how and when notice of appeal was given.

That being so, and since the period could not be extended in the absence of power of enlargement in the statute, one might reasonably interpret the statutory terms governing the exercise of the right to appeal as calling for no more, necessarily, than the posting of the requisite notice in a registered mail before the expiration of the 20 day period. 2)Wascana Energy exercised its right as an appeal properly or effectively, requiring the board to entertain the appeal and requiring it to entertain it in full compliance with all of the terms of the subsection."
c_1998canlii13533.txt,"FIAT. An application to vary maintenance for two children under the Federal Child Supprt Guidelines. At issue were the determination of the father's income and whether the expenses of the eldest child attending Grade 12 in Manitoba constituted extaordinary expenses for secondary school education pursuant to s7(1)(d). The father's reduced farm income was explained as due to poor crop yields. He anticipated being laid off from his work at the mine in October. He claimed significant vehicle expenses for his travel to work. The mother contested many of his expenses as being overstated. HELD: The respondent's child support obligation was $347 per month. 1)It was fair and reasonable to take an average of the 1997 and projected 1998 income. The preceeding years were not significant because the father's current income at the mine commenced in May 1997. Travelling expenses would not be considered in the absence of the accounting advice to explain the basis for the deduction and to establish the actual amount and where no deduction has been made in the past. No explanation was offered for why the claims for gas and repairs were significantly higher than in previous years. The capital payments for land and machinery and the costs of the stepchild's horse were excluded. In the circumstances the acquisition of equipment and capital cost allowance, in lieu of renting, was not patently unreasonable. The farm income was adjusted in 1997 and 1998 by adding back 25 percent of the capital cost allowance for the new truck. The acquisition of a $43,000 vehicle was an extravagance given his income bracket and his obligation to support his children. His allocation of one-half its cost to farming was questionable given the distances tavelled during his employment at the mine. 2)There was no evidence why the child attended high school in Manitoba, why the expense was necessary in relation to the child's best interest and whether the child had any means to contribute. Leave was given to return the matter to the Court with the appropriate supporting materials.  3)No order as to costs.","FIAT. This is an application to vary maintenance under the Federal Child Support Guidelines in respect of two children, Jessilyn and Javan, born March 18, 1981 and June 3, 1982. The mother currently earns $27,600 per annum from employment with a computer consulting firm. The father explains his reduced farm income as due to poor yields. He has no inventory of grain on hand and all his expenses of $56,849 are purportedly for the current crop year. He worked substantial overtime at the mine in 1998 but that ceased in July and he anticipates being laid off in October. The purchase of a vehicle gave rise to capital cost allowance claim of $1,833 in 1997 and at depreciation rate of 20 percent would have provided capital costs allowance for 1998. HELD: 1)The application was granted on the basis of the determination of income for the father and whether the expenses of the eldest child, who was attending Grade XII at Western Christian College in Dauphin, Manitoba, constituted extraordinary expenses for secondary school education pursuant to s7(1)(d) of the Guidelines. 2)Costs to the petitioner were to be paid in the amount of $347 per month for the first month and $15 for the month of the second month. 3)The father's income was to be determined by projecting his income at straight wages until October 15, 1998 thereby giving recognition to the possibility of lay-off and the reduction in overtime."
c_1998canlii14016.txt,"The defendants sought to set aside a default judgment and have the plaintiff's claim struck out. The defendants abandoned their alternate claim to be granted leave to file a statement of defence. The defendants, carrying on business as a hauling sub-contractor to Tri-Link, reported a cheque drawn on the plaintiff bank as lost. Tri-Link issued a replacement cheque. The first cheque was certified at a bank branch of the plaintiff in Alberta and deposited to the defendants' credit union account. Default judgments were obtained in January/March 1997 against the defendants who now sought to have them set aside pursuant to Queen's Bench Rules 346 and 173(a). The defendants claimed the statement of claim disclosed no cause of action as a certified cheque is irrevocable and as such any default judgment may be set aside ex debito justitiae, in which case delay in bringing the application is not factor. The plaintiff claims it has a cause of action in either conversion or mistake of fact/unjust enrichment. HELD: The defendants' motion was dismissed as the plaintiff's statement of claim adequately disclosed a cause of action in mistake of fact/unjust enrichment.  1)There are exceptions to the irrevocable nature of a certified cheque. The present case is one of those circumstances where the bank has an action in restitution against the holder of a certified cheque as payment did not satisfy a just debt. The defendants in this instance had already deposited the replacement cheque when the original cheque was presented for certification and subsequently deposited by the defendants. The cerified cheque did not satisfy a just debt. The defendants had already received payment for their services.  2)In recognizing exceptions to the irrevocable nature of certification the commercial utility of certification at the request of the payee is maintained while providing recourse to a bank where a payee seeks to unjustly enrich itself and then purport to seek refuge behind the 'irrevocable nature' of a certified cheque.","The defendants sought to set aside a default judgment entered by the plaintiff against them and have the plaintiff's claim struck out. The plaintiff sought judgment against the defendants in the amount of $18,442.39 plus interest. Default judgment was taken out January 1997. The defendant's statement of claim discloses no cause of action. In recognizing exceptions to the irrevocable nature of certification the commercial utility of certification at the request of the payee is maintained while providing recourse to bank where payee seeks to unjustly enrich itself and then purport to seek refuge behind the 'irrevocable nature' of certified cheque."
c_1999skqb209.txt,"FIAT. A defendant applied for an order pursuant to the inherent jurisdiction of the court, alternatively s.50 of the Queen's Bench Act, for an order requiring the plaintiff to be examined by a qualified psychiatrist within 30 days; requiring a report to be filed with the court as to whether the plaintiff is mentally competent to instruct his solicitor; and staying proceedings until a report is filed. The certificate of incompetence issued in December 1998 was revoked (QBG No. 690/1999) on the basis the competency examination was obtained by subterfuge (other parties had asked the plaintiff to attend a physical examination for a fictitious purpose but conducted a competency examination); there was no record of the review panel hearing; no reasons were given for the decision to uphold the certificate. The plaintiff alleged the issuance of the certificate caused mental anguish, emotional suffering, and loss of liberty and alleged conspiracy, abuse of process, breach of fiduciary duty and negligence. HELD: The application was dismissed.  1)Our civil procedure does not contemplate the trial of an issue on a person's competence to bring a lawsuit. A certificate of incompetence issued pursuant to the Act had the same effect as a finding that the person is incapable of instructing counsel or understanding legal proceedings and would result in the appointment of a litigation guardian. This step was not deemed necessary based on the evidence presented. A stay was refused.  2)Costs incurred in defending a civil action against a person who is subsequently found to be incapable of managing his or her estate are recoverable from the estate. 3)Queen's Bench Act s.50 did not apply.  4)The plaintiff was entitled to his costs in any event of the cause.","FIAT.

The applicants recognized that if the requested order was granted, this action could nevertheless continue with the appointment of a litigation guardian. HELD: The application was dismissed. The Court found that the application was simply another subterfuge and abuse of process to obtain evidence to support the original findings of incompetency to the benefit of the applicants in this law suit, and to possibly obtain a new certificate of incompetent. It was not a case where the Court felt obliged to take this step based on the evidence presented. Even if the Court had the power pursuant to its inherent jurisdiction to grant relief, it should exercise its discretion to do so cautiously, only in clear cases and only when the relief sought cannot reasonably and realistically be obtained by the applicant in some other lawful manner."
c_2000canlii19597.txt,"The accused was charged with uttering threats to his 77 year old mother to cause death to her and his brothers contrary to s.264.1 of the Criminal Code. HELD: The accused was found guilty. 1)The words spoken by the accused were clearly meant to be taken seriously and implied menace to the listeners. The accused's evidence was disbelieved. His constructed story did not 'hang together'.  2) In a non-jury trial there is ordinarily no need for defence to formally make a Corbett application, requesting an order excluding evidence of convictions whose prejudicial effect outweighs their probative value. The judge must not infer from the record that the accused has a propensity to commit criminal offences. Given the age of the record and other factors considered including his present work and family life, it was concluded that all of the prior convictions should be disregarded as they relate to the accused's credibility. The only conclusion drawn was that the accused had been familiar with the workings of the criminal justice system which was not a negative inference.","The accused was charged with uttering a threat to cause death to three of his children contrary to s. 264.1 of the Criminal Code. The complainant had lived on a farm approximately 30 km. east of Prince Albert for some 64 years. She was the mother of the accused's children. The accused had recently passed away and a bitter family fight had developed over dealings with and entitlement to his rather substantial estate.

The strictness of the due diligence requirement should be relaxed in light of the allegation of arson. Although the expert evidence of Mr. Jones was available, counsel at trial failed to competently present this evidence on behalf of the appellants. The proffered fresh evidence could reasonably have affected the result at trial, particularly with respect to the 'cause of the fire'. The appellants were ordered to pay the respondent's costs of the trial, to be taxed on a party and party basis, on or before July 15, 2000. The appellant shall be liable on application to the Court of Appeal to have their claim struck out and the action dismissed. The respondent's claim was struck out in Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce v. George Leslie Wilson Freeman, unreported, March 14, 1996. [1] We are all of the opinion that the 'fresh' evidence of T.V. Jones should be admitted and the new trial ordered. [2] At the outset we observe that although this application is in the context of civil action, it does have significant criminal overtones in that the respondent alleges arson in paragraph four of its statement of defence which reads: 4. The Defendant says that the fire was not accidental in origin but was deliberately set by person insured under the policy. [3] We also find that there is a reasonable prospect of the accused being extradited to face trial."
c_2002skqb47.txt,"FIAT. The defendant sought to have costs reduced because the plaintiff was unsuccessful in part of her claim for damages for the injury to her ankle and resulting pain disorder when she fell after stepping on a metal plate bolted to the floor at the mall entrance of the defendant's store. The plaintiff was awarded $77,406.15 plus special damages and pre-judgment interest for a total of $120,540.43. The offer to settle for $75,000 plus taxable costs had been refused. The defendant argued the plaintiff's bill of costs should be taxed at 50% as she only received about 13 and 1/3% of the amount claimed; the costs were disproportionate to the judgment and the offer to settle, made in good faith, was never formally responded to. The plaintiff argued extensive witness costs were incurred because the defendant declined to agree to the filing of medical reports. At issue was whether the success of each affects the amount of costs to be awarded to either; the amount to be awarded for expert witnesses; and level at which a second counsel fee should be taxed or allowed. HELD: 1)Taxable costs should not be based on either hardship or the degree of success. Solely because recovery falls short of the amount claimed is not a reason to deprive a successful party of costs. Although costs are in the discretion of the Court, they usually go to the successful party. 2)It was appropriate in this case to reduce by 50% the plaintiff's costs taxable under column 4 since over half of the plaintiff's witnesses who were called to testify and most of the trial time was dedicated to the pain disorder claim, which proved only minor non-pecuniary damages. 3)A great deal of the plaintiff's expert medical evidence was of marginal value. Great care must be taken by a party who obtains leave to call more than five expert witnesses to ensure their testimony will assist the case. Expenses of each was examined separately. In some cases, medical report charges or consultation and preparation time were not recoverable from the defendant as not being of value or too exorbitant. 4)A second counsel fee was allowed at 50% of first counsel fee. A second counsel fee is in the discretion of the Court and is limited to two-thirds of the fee paid for first counsel. The amount at risk and complexity of the pain disorder claim justified second counsel in this case. Although one lawyer could have handled the trial without difficulty as there was considerable down time, that could not be known in advance. 5)Costs of the four pre-trial conferences, unspecified number of management pre-trial conferences, pre-trial brief, medical reports for doctors who were not called as witnesses are matters for consideration by the taxing officer rather than the Court. It was recommended that no fee should be considered when there is simply an adjournment because the pre-trial conference is premature; there is no tariff item for a pre-trial brief and in most cases is included in the attendance charge; a charge of $50 for each management pre-trial conference be allowed to a total limit of $500; costs of transcripts be recovered from the defendant. Costs payable by the plaintiff on an interlocutory application may be deducted from the plaintiff's Bill of Costs.","FIAT. The plaintiff was injured when she fell after stepping on a metal plate bolted to the floor at the defendant's store. The trial did not commence until November 27, 2000. The defendant served an offer to settle for $75,000 plus taxable costs. The offer was not accepted by the plaintiff. HELD: 1)The plaintiff was entitled to recover $1,000.00 of the fees paid to the defendant for testimony and consultations but no part of the payment for the locum tenens or his medical report. 2)A great deal of expert medical evidence was of marginal value. The extensive witness costs were incurred because the defendant declined to agree to the filing of medical reports. The costs should not be based on either hardship or the degree of success. The amount expended by party for investigating or in gathering evidence to either advance a claim or defend it may actually exceed the value of the claim. 3)A second counsel fee is allowed at 50 percent of the first counsel fee."
c_2007skpc41.txt,"The accused was charged that he did drive while disqualified, contrary to s. 89(1) of The Highway Traffic Act, as it was then. The issues were as follows: 1) should the offence of driving while disqualified contrary to the provincial statute be regarded as a full mens rea offence? 2) is the evidence sufficiently credible for the court to conclude that the accused had knowingly operated a motor vehicle while subject to a driving disqualification? HELD: The accused is not guilty. 1) Driving while disqualified should be regarded as a full mens rea offence, rather than one of strict liability requiring the accused to establish due diligence on a balance of probabilities, given that the accused's liberty is jeopardized with the potential of incarceration. Likewise the automatic disqualification and surrender of a driver's license are serious sanctions. 2) The accused was adamant in asserting that he had no knowledge of his license suspension at the material time. Although he was not able to offer a compelling explanation for ignoring the admonition to him in a letter from Saskatchewan Government Insurance (S.G.I.) of July 11, 2005 that if he consumed any alcohol, an original driving suspension would be reinstated, the accused believed it was appropriate to rely instead on the advice of the peace officer on December 18, 2005 that it was only a 24 hour suspension, unless he heard further from S.G.I. Likewise, it did not appear that the accused had any further communication from S.G.I. subsequent to December 18, 2005, until shortly after the motor vehicle accident, roughly 2 months later. At that time, it was confirmed that the suspension had been extended to October 16, 2006, contrary to his earlier belief. Apparently it is an important part of the S.G.I. administration of driver's license suspensions that there be communication by letter, as has occurred here twice, with the purpose of attempting to ensure accused persons are advised in writing of changes in the legal status of their driving suspensions, with clarity and precision. As such, this accused should be able to rely on that procedure, even when that communication was not as timely as one would hope. Not having heard from S.G.I. in the interim, after December 18, 2005, it was reasonable for him to rely on the advice received from the peace officer. As such, the evidence is not sufficient to prove that the accused had knowingly operated a motor vehicle while disqualified as alleged, and he is not guilty.","The accused was charged with driving while disqualified contrary to s.89(1) of The Highway Traffic Act. The driving occurred when the accused was involved in a motor vehicle accident and engaged in other alleged misconduct, including driving without due care and consideration for others, and failing to identify himself to the other driver before departing from the scene. HELD: The accused was found not guilty. The evidence was not sufficient to prove that the accused had knowingly operated a vehicle while subject to a driving disqualification. The accused's liberty was jeopardized with the potential of incarceration. The Court reviewed the decision of R. v. Kraftchick (2006), 37 M.V.R. (5th) 228, (Sask. Prov. Ct.) (CanLII). The Court applied the principles of McKenzie supra, while not necessarily believing the evidence, that there is a presumption against strict liability offences, and in favour of some element of mens rea or criminal intent that must be established by the Crown."
c_2007skqb224.txt,"FIAT: The accused applicant brings an application for a change in venue in this matter pursuant to s. 599(1) of the Criminal Code. HELD: 1). The application for a change of venue is denied. 2) There is no evidence of a general prejudicial attitude in Saskatoon as a whole that would justify a change in venue. There has been significant pre-trial publicity in this case from media reports of the case and other similar cases involving knives, as well as ongoing memorial reports. However, the accused has not met the onus necessary to succeed on its application. In other cases the existence of some memorial fundraising and memorials in the victim's names led the courts in those instances to grant a change in venue. However, in allowing the application, the courts in those cases both referenced the relatively small size of the judicial centers in which the trials were to be held, thereby making it more than likely an impartial jury pool could not be found. Saskatoon is not a small judicial centre. It is more populated than the Prince Albert judicial district to where the accused requests the case be transferred and is much larger than the judicial district of Humboldt, which might also be considered.","FIAT: The applicant brought an application for a change of venue in this matter pursuant to s.599(1) of the Criminal Code. He also sought an order pursuant to ss. 119(1)(q) and the Youth Criminal Justice Act directing the Crown to disclose the names of any witnesses with criminal convictions registered under provisions of the Act, and particulars of the convictions. HELD: The application was denied. 1)A properly instructed jury will be able to deal with the issues in the trial impartially and in accordance with the evidence presented, such that the accused will receive a fair trial. There is no evidence of a general prejudicial attitude in Saskatoon as a whole that would justify a change in venue. 2)The applicant had not met the onus of proof necessary to succeed on this application."
c_2007skqb269.txt,"FIAT: The applicants are residents of Wilcox and have children attending the Wilcox school. They seek an interlocutory mandatory injunction preventing the respondent Board of Education from acting upon a resolution that the Wilcox school be closed. HELD: Both with respect to the statutory breach of the 28-day notice period for the meeting to elect school community council members, and the ground of lack of procedural fairness, the Court concluded the applicants failed to meet the standard of a strong prima facie case. 1) A review of the facts and the law suggest that the applicant's submission on the fact that the notice for election of the school community council was 2 days short of the 28 days required by The Education Act does not meet the test of a strong prima facie case. The Act does not state that non-compliance with formalities will result in a nullity. There was no prejudice caused by the non-compliance with the 28-day notice period before the election of members to the school community council. There is no evidence or suggestion that a different school council would have been elected if the extra 2 days notice had been provided. No one complained at the time and the fact the matter is raised now amounts to a collateral attack on that election. The potential consequences of a Court finding of a nullity militate against such a finding. The relevance of the school community council in the closure of a school arises after the decision to close the school has been made. To nullify all of the process and consultation that went into the school closure on this collateral ground would have serious consequences of causing at least one year delay in the efficiencies or improvements in student education which motivated the decision, and result in a loss of time, energy and money expended in the process. 2) Taking into account the mandate of the Board under the Act with respect to school closures, the consultation process adopted by the Board, and the manner in which it conducted the consultation meetings does not lead to the conclusion the procedure was unfair. A review of the five factors identified by the Supreme Court in Baker v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) does not favour an overly stringent application of the procedural fairness rules in this matter.","FIAT. The applicants sought an interlocutory injunction preventing and restraining the respondent Board of Education from acting upon a resolution passed by the Wilcox school community council on May 7, 2007 that the school be closed effective August 15, 2007. HELD: A preliminary review of the facts and law did not suggest a strong prima facie case. The respondent Board failed to comply with the requirements of procedural fairness in the manner in which it proceeded to pass the resolution closing the school. There was no evidence or suggestion a different school council would have been elected if the extra two days notice had been provided. The court found that the election took place two days short of the deadline set out in the legislation and that, on the balance of convenience, an injunction should be granted."

HELD: 1) A party to litigation cannot decline to answer questions on an examination for discovery that are intended to elicit the facts on which that party has based its pleading. A party is required to divulge the facts that it has now or admit that it has none if such is the case. The defendant is obligated to provide its responses to the undertakings before the examination for discovery of its proper officer is concluded so that he can be further examined on the responses. If the position of the defendant as set forth in those responses changes as a result of after acquired information, the defendant shall so inform the plaintiff by way of supplemental responses within 90 days following the completion of the defendant's examinations for discovery of the third parties. If it is necessary for the plaintiff to further examine for discovery on the defendant's responses or supplemental responses, the defendant's proper officer shall attend such examination for discovery. 2) The material filed satisfies the Court that PSAC documents relating to the PST issue are at least broadly relevant to the issues and that BJ Services likely has the power to obtain and produce them. The fact that BJ Services may intend to claim a litigation privilege over the documents, or that PSAC may not produce them, does not relieve BJ Services of the obligation to disclose their existence. BJ Services shall provide further and better disclosure of documents by providing a detailed list of documents referred to in the second part of the second schedule of its statement as to documents. If a claim for privilege is asserted over such documents, BJ Services shall identify the basis of such claim, the date of the documents, the name of the sender and the names of the recipients.","FIAT: The plaintiff applies for orders requiring the defendant and third parties to answer questions and respond to undertakings arising from the examinations for discovery in this action. The plaintiff contends that pursuant to the governing legislation it was not liable to pay PST because the cement was supplied, used and installed into the real property of the plaintiff. HELD: 1) The defendant is obligated to provide its responses to the undertakings before the examination for discovery of its proper officer is concluded so that, if necessary, he can be further examined on the responses. If the position of the defendant as set forth in those responses changes as result of the discovery process, the defendant shall inform the plaintiff by way of supplemental responses within 30 days. 2) The plaintiff seeks judgment against the defendant for the amount paid. 3) The discovery rules have a number of purposes to serve in our adversarial litigation procedure. These include; the obtaining of admissions, obtaining facts that will lead to lines of inquiry, knowing the case to be met, avoiding being taken by surprise at trial, and defining the issues in the law suit. The purpose of discovery is to provide the receiving party with information that will enable them to understand what is being disclosed and prepare for trial. The discovery process is not yet complete. The defendant has not yet finalized its legal arguments on ambiguity in the contracts. The court will support any legislative framework which clarifies these relationships for Saskatchewan PST in a manner consistent with the findings of the above-mentioned court cases."
c_2009nssc180.txt,"At issue was retroactive maintenance for the now 16-year-old for a period of time pre-dating the mother's application (in 2007). Although the parties separated in 2001, there was no written agreement/order in place until 2009. The father paid support voluntarily, at an amount that was increased over the years. The mother said the father controlled the amount and knew it was below his table obligation under the Guidelines. She claimed she did not know his true income, and that every time she asked for additional assistance (such as a contribution to extraordinary expenses) he told her he could not afford it. The father said he was unaware of the correct table amount, and that he paid according to the mother's demands. Retroactive support awarded according to the table amount from 2005 onward. The father's hardship arguments rejected. He was aware from the outset that his child support obligation was related to his income. The dramatic increase to his income, and his failure to disclose it to the mother in 2005 constituted sufficient/effective notice that his payments were now deficient. Claim for retroactive s. 7 (extraordinary or special) expenses for the same time-period denied. The father did, on occasion voluntarily contribute to these expenses. During the relevant period of time, the parents spent some time trying to reconcile and acting as a family.","The mother sought an order that would provide parenting provisions as to their son; child maintenance payable to her in accordance with the Child Support Guidelines in the form of table amount and contribution to special or extraordinary expenses and that retroactivity of child maintenance for the period from August 2001 to December 2007. The parties separated in August 2001. Prior to the Consent Order, there was no written agreement or court order dealing with child maintenance. The father's dramatic increase in salary was in and of itself'sufficient notice' his child maintenance obligation had to be increased. He did, on occasion, make additional payments with regard to some of the items put forward by the mother. The mother's request for a retroactive award was denied. HELD: The father has a responsibility to provide child maintenance to the mother for their child, Ryan, beginning January 1, 2005, and ending January 31, 2008. He is in arrears with respect to this obligation in the amount of $9,833.00. The Nova Scotia Maintenance Enforcement Program will be in contact with the father to make arrangements as to repayment of arrearages. The court will ask counsel for the applicant to prepare the order. 1)The mother's blameworthy conduct in considering the propriety of retroactive awards is denied. If effective notice has already been given, it will usually be inappropriate to take the same conclusion as the one reached in Hess v. Hess (1994), which established that each parent's behaviour should be considered in determining the appropriate balance between certainty and flexibility in a given case. 2)There is agreement as to the status of the child. However, the mother's interest in certainty is most compelling where the recipient parent delayed [page 278] unreasonably in seeking an award, the payor parent did not take action to be reimbursed for such expenses at an earlier date, nor did she ask him to increase his monthly payment. 3)The father has not shown any receipts for child support since the couple separated in 2001. The Court found that the father has been paying less than legally required given his income and the dictates of the Guidelines. The fact that the mother has refused to provide any contribution towards legitimate special expenses related to the child during this time does not support the conclusion that she was pressured or intimidated by him to the extent it would be reason for delay in her application to seek formalized child support."
c_2013skca113.txt,"HELD: The applicant’s first two grounds of appeal related to the evidence of the respondents’ and police. The Court of Appeal was not persuaded that questions of evidence were of sufficient importance to grant leave. The applicant’s third ground was that the Chambers judge failed to take into account the interests of the public, particularly, the need to deter the public and the need to remove profit from crime to compensate victims. The Court of Appeal did not grant leave on the third ground. The Chambers judge reviewed the relevant case law and did not fail to take those items into account. The last ground of appeal was the fact that the vehicle had already been held for 90 days. The Court of Appeal said that this ground did raise some interest but they were not convinced that this was the case to grant the leave to appeal.","The Director of the Seizure of Criminal Property Act seeks leave to appeal a Queen's Bench Chambers decision which denied his application for the forfeiture of a vehicle registered to the respondent. The Director's application was brought pursuant to s. of the Act on the ground that the vehicle had been used in criminal activity. HELD: Application dismissed. 1) With respect to issues (a) and (b), I am not persuaded that in the context of this case, questions of evidence are of sufficient importance to engage the attention of the Court.  2) The Chambers judge was not at all sure that the Chambers judge overlooked the interests of the public or failed to consider the need to deter crime, remove the profit from crime and so forth. He conducted a relatively thorough review of the relevant case law in the course of establishing the framework governing his decision-making. This included Saskatchewan (Director, Seizur of Criminal property Act, 2009) v. Mihalyko, supra. Paragraph of his decision would suggest that the judge did consider matters relating to the deterrence of crime. To do so would narrowly cross the threshold of being draconian and manifestly unjust. 3) The Director was not persuaded by the issues raised in this appeal but that the chambers judge did not err by considering certain information about the circumstances of the respondent and Ms. Brinkman even though that information had been submitted by those two individuals as part of their arguments rather than formally by affidavit. He was characterizing the evidence of Sgt. Pfeil as having been made on information and belief. He pled guilty to three counts of theft under $5,000 and one count of break and enter and was sentenced to 12 months probation and 80 hours of community service. Both charges were ultimately withdrawn but the accused did not deny her involvement in the events of March 21 and March 29, 2012. The accused was found in the back of a parked truck with rolls of copper in his arms. When the driver threatened to call the police, the accused and the accused returned to the Vehicle and fled. Both accused denied involvement. 4) There was no exceptional circumstance in this case where questions of appeal should be granted."
c_2013skpc94.txt,"A Child and Family Services agency applied for an order: 1) declaring that the foster parents of three children have sufficient interest pursuant to s. 23 of The Child and Family Services Act; and 2) granting the foster parents custody pursuant to s. 37(1)(b). The children's mother was deceased and their father indicated that he was unable to meet his children's needs. The foster parents intended to continue to allow the father parenting time with the children. They also indicated that they would care for the children until each is 18 or until the order was terminated. The father consented to a draft order agreeing the children should be in the custody of the Minister and that he have reasonable access. The agency amended their application for the custody order to be made in favour of the foster parents rather than the Minister. HELD: The children were in need of protection pursuant to s. 11(b). The Court found that the agency's amended application was appropriate and preferred to a temporary order in favour of the Minister. Also, the Court noted that s. 39 allows for amendments of orders if circumstances change. The Court, therefore, ordered that the foster parents have custody even though the father only indicated his consent to the order in favour of the Minister. The agency was required to ensure that a copy of the written decision was personally served on the father.","The agency initially applied for a long term order under s.37(3) of the Child and Family Services Act but had amended its application to now apply for an order that the current foster parents be declared persons having a sufficient interest in all three children under ss.23 of the Act, and an order granting them custody. The children were identified by initials for the purposes of protecting their identity. HELD: The agency applied for and was granted custody of the children. Pursuant to s.31, the agency requested personal service of this decision be provided to each of those individuals within 15 days of receipt of it. The amended application was granted. 1)Each child was in need of protection pursuant to ss.11(b) and s.17(b). As the first option was unavailable, the question was whether or not a placement with the proposed persons of sufficient interest would be preferable to a temporary order in favour of the Minister. The revised plan being proposed by the agency was appropriate in these circumstances. 2)The father, having agreed to a long-term order, had consented to a lesser order. The father was clear that he was unable to care for the children and indicated that he intended to continue to provide a stable and nurturing environment for them. As all individuals involved are members of and live on the same First Nation, continuing contact between the father and his children is more easily accommodated. The Agency's revised plan is appropriate in the circumstances. 3)The evidence before the agency clearly indicates that the father does wish to have a continuing relationship with the children, and that he clearly recognizes that he is not in a position, due to his circumstances, to offer a stable or nurturing environment."
c_2013skqb180.txt,"The parties had a shared parenting arrangement since separation where each party parented their four-year-old child for equal times in a two-week cycle, the petitioner parenting in her home in Moose Jaw and the respondent parenting in his parent's home in Regina. The issue before the Court was to determine where the child should primarily reside and attend school. Each party saw the other as a competent and loving parent. The petitioner had another child, a half-brother to the parties' child, who was an infant at the time of the application. The petitioner was a stay-at-home mom on social assistance and the respondent was a student who worked part-time and lived with his parents. The respondent's parents were willing to assist the respondent financially and in the care of the child. The Court ordered custody/access report concluded that the child should primarily reside with the respondent, though the author noted that the decision was almost too close to make. HELD: The Court held that the best interests of the child would be best served by her primarily residing with the respondent and the parties having joint custody of the child. The Court first considered the quality of the child's relationship with each party and their families and concluded there was little difference between the parties but the child had a closer relationship with the respondent's extended family because she resided with them when she was with the respondent. The Court also determined that the child's economic needs could best be met residing with the respondent and his parents. The home environment of the respondent was found to outweigh that of the petitioner's. Further, the Court held that the child would have greater stability and continuity with the respondent, who has a concrete future plan. The petitioner's future plans were wavering and uncertain. The respondent was ordered to bear the responsibility for transporting the child to and from Moose Jaw and Regina. The respondent was also required to accommodate the petitioner and child by supporting Internet communications between them during the week, especially at bedtime. The petitioner was granted parenting time three consecutive weekends and the respondent on the fourth weekend. The second of the petitioner's weekends was extended to include another day as were any weekends with school or statutory holidays. The decision requires the child to miss one day of school every four weeks and the Court therefore left it to the parties to determine whether this can continue once the child begins grade two. The parties were ordered to each parent the child for half of Easter and Christmas breaks and they were to accommodate each other for Mother's and Father's Day each year. Further, the Court ordered that the child spend half of each summer holiday with each parent, suggesting that alternating weeks may be the best for the child, unless otherwise agreed to by the parties. Lastly, if the child has a school break longer than three clear days, the petitioner is to parent at least one-half of those days. The Court also urged the parties to collaborate and discuss the extra-curricular activities best suited for the child taking into account their affordability and disruption to the parenting arrangement.",HELD: The court held that it would defer to the court to determine where the child's primary residence would be and thus in which city she would attend school. The court found that the parents had acted erratically in allowing the child to live with them and that the child had not shown any signs of distress. The child was normal and had been resilient in coping with the parent's separation and conflict. The father was not attempting to obtain child support for either child.
c_2014skqb31.txt,"Civil Procedure – Affidavits – Admissibility HELD: The Court could not locate any cases that suggested there was a duty to act fairly and in good faith by an insurance company because of an insurance policy where no claim was made against it. The Court found that it would be impossible for SMI to act fairly and in good faith to the plaintiffs and to concurrently act fairly and in good faith to the first defendants. SMI only had a duty to defend the first defendants pursuant to their policy of insurance. The Court noted the following in making its conclusion: 1) if SMI also had a duty to the plaintiffs, they could not use tactical or substantive errors of the plaintiffs to minimize their payment obligation. The insurer would not be able to vigorously defend the claim; and 2) the first defendant may be required to pay more if there was a duty by SMI to the plaintiffs. Many insurance policies have co-insurance provisions or require deductibles be paid by the insured. The Court held that the claim against SMI, and its employees and agents, had no reasonable chance of success. The Court also awarded costs against the plaintiffs for filing improper affidavit material. The improper material included information on settlement discussions.","FIAT: The plaintiffs brought an application pursuant to Queen's Bench Rule 173(a) to have the claim struck in its entirety. The plaintiffs alleged that the first defendants, who are also farmers, sprayed herbicide on their land which drifted across to the plaintiffs' land and caused crop damage and subsequent financial loss. The second defendant, which as an agrologist knowledgeable about farm chemicals so that he knew better, deliberately submitted a false plant sample, which he knew in advance would not show Touchdown and Banvel and would in turn notify their insurer, SMI. HELD: The application was dismissed. 1)The plaintiff was obliged to defend the interests of the defendants under the policy, while at the same time to act fairly and in good faith to the plaintiff in prosecution of the claim. It was entitled to attempt to limit the liability of first defendants. 2)The plaintiffs were not entitled to punitive damages."

The court found that the applicant had not proven that there was a material change in circumstances as voluntary early retirements do not constitute material change of circumstance. It ordered the respondent to immediately proceed to complete an application to split the applicant’s CPP credits.,"FIAT The applicant/petitioner sought to vary a consent Interim Order issued by Zarzeczny J. August 7, 2007. The provisions of the order addressed the applicant's child and spousal support obligations. It was based upon the petitioner's then income of $48,196 and the respondent's $0. The respondent agreed to inextricably intertwine the payor’s spousals and child support obligations to the total “lump sum” payment of $1,400 for tax purposes favouring a large sum payable for spousa support and lesser sum than that which would be required for child support. HELD: The application was dismissed. 1)The applicant was prepared to either apply for or agree to split his CPP credits or support her application to do so. To do so, she requires and is waiting to receive sufficient supporting medical reports from her current medical specialist. 2)The respondent had no income and suffered from at least two of the now longer list of medically disabling conditions set out in her affidavit. She continued to assert she was disabled and unable to engage in employment. She was to reapply for CPP disability benefits in the Guideline amount until Elizabeth received her first degree. The applicant was to provide all information reasonably required by CPP to support his application. 3)In the interests of avoiding multiple court proceedings in the future, the applicant further ordered that the respondent immediately proceed to complete an application to split the CPP credit to the account of the applicant equally, the same to be supported by the applicant once she received her 1st degree. If she is successful and receives disability pension, that increase in Ms. Ellis-Reid's income combined with the reduction of Mr. Reid's income upon retirement may also be sufficient material changes in the circumstances of the parties to then support a variation application being made if an agreement is not reached."

Alternatively he sought an order preventing the mother from removing their daughter from Saskatchewan. The father obtained an ex parte order preventing the mother from removing the child from the province until the return date of the motion. The mother had always been the primary caregiver and had custody since the separation in 1994. The father had exercised regular and frequent access. She was given exclusive possession of the matrimonial home under the terms of the consent judgment which contemplated the home would be listed for sale and the net proceeds divided between the parties. Subsequent to the consent judgment the applicant went through bankruptcy proceedings in which he transferred his interest in the home to the trustee who then sold that interest to the respondent such that the applicant no longer had any interest in the home. HELD: 1)Relocation was neither foreseen nor reasonably contemplated by the judge making the original order. The threshold criteria was thus satisfied. 2)The trial of an issue was required as the matter could not be decided on the basis of affidavit evidence. The child had a close relationship with both parents. The disruption as a result of a change in custody or removal of the child from the community could not be assessed. 3)The applicant's request for interim relief was denied.

The arbitrator upheld the grievance and the hotel applied for judicial review. Application allowed; the arbitrator's interpretation of the collective agreement was patently unreasonable and her award should be set aside. The court's focus must be on the existence of a rational basis for the decision of the tribunal and not on whether it agrees with the decision. Although there was evidentiary support for the arbitrator's essential findings of fact, no logical process could be ascertained by which the final conclusion drawn from the evidentiary foundation was made.","This was an application for judicial review of the decision of a labour arbitrator released on July 21, 2000 in respect of a grievance arbitration heard in Sydney, Nova Scotia on May 10, 2000.

Granted the accused was charged with refusal 51 minutes after the demand for the breath tests, even though he was diligent in attempting to reach counsel, he was not diligent in pursuing his rights after he unsuccessfully tried to contact a lawyer three times. It is not a police officer's obligation to go further if the accused does not appreciate the advice of Legal Aid counsel. 2)His evidence was not believed as to the anxiety attacks. The intoxilyzer did not register because he was not breathing properly into the mouthpiece. He provided an adequate supply of air in the roadside screening device about an hour prior. The statement of law enunciated in Pederson out of the Yukon Territory Supreme Court was adopted. It could not be concluded on the evidence that his respiratory problems made it impossible to provide a sample. The doctor stated he could do so when his breathing returned to normal as did the accused. Further an accused who is aware of what triggers his anxiety attacks, for example a hard night of drinking the night before, and continues to drink alcohol and operate a motor vehicle cannot be later heard to say and hope to avoid conviction that the refusal was a result of a known medical condition. He should not drink and drive.","The 28 year member of the RCMP was charged with failure to comply with a demand made to him by a Peace Officer pursuant to s. 254(3) of the Criminal Code requiring him to provide then or a soon thereafter as is practicable such samples of his breath as in the opinion of a qualified technician are necessary to enable a proper analysis to be made in order to determine the concentration of alcohol in his blood. The accused, who was aware of what triggers his anxiety attacks, a hard night of drinking the night before and continues to drink alcohol and operate a motor vehicle cannot be later heard to say and hope to avoid conviction, that the refusal was a result of a known medical condition."

The Court raised jurisdiction, service and time issues.HELD: 1)To avoid adjournment counsel consented to the court's jurisdiction, the acknowledgement of service and the abridgement of time. 2)The mother was found to be in contempt of court for deliberately disobeying the order by repeatedly refusing, without lawful excuse, to comply with its terms. Almost without exception she refused to make the child available for the bi-weekly supervised access visits. She did not abduct the child. The mother was to purge her contempt by paying the father's solicitor and client costs respecting the two applications fixed at $1,500 and by obeying the access terms of this order. The August 15, 2002 order was vacated. 3)The father was to have unsupervised access on alternate weekends. He may bring the child to Saskatchewan but shall not remove her from this province or Manitoba without the mother's written consent.

Almost without exception, she refused to make the child available for the supervised access visits that were ordered to take place every two weeks over a four-month period from August to December 2002. The respondent continued to be in contempt when she moved with the child to Brandon without prior notice to the petitioner. She purported to terminate access and refused to return the child for the remainder of the visits that had been ordered. The court was of the view that the respondent will not again disobey court orders so that fine is not called for in the circumstances. 2) The limited access proposal of the respondent was not realistic because it virtually guarantees that the petitioner and his parents will never be able to develop any relationship with his son, child that he has been supporting financially on a voluntary basis since birth. Nor was the access proposal realistic because the respondent does not have the financial ability to bring the child here for access visits.

d_2004nsfc13.txt,"The mother was unable to care for the child and the father, who had been convicted of sexual assault, was only entitled to supervised access. Both the paternal and maternal grandmothers presented plans of care to the court, with the paternal grandmother seeking custody and the maternal grandmother seeking care and control of the child. The child had a younger sibling who was in the maternal grandmother's custody and her daughter, the mother of the child, supported the plan of the maternal grandmother. The Agency supported the paternal grandmother. Custody granted to the paternal grandmother with reasonable access to the maternal grandmother and supervised access to the parents. The paternal grandmother was better able to care for the child financially and her circumstances were such that it was in the child's best interests to grant her custody. The issue of separation of siblings was only one factor in considering an alternative (relative) placement; the children were very young and there was no evidence of a bond between them.","HELD: The court granted leave to the maternal grandmother to apply for custody. The child was in need of protective services. The father was a convicted child abuser whose name appeared on the Child Abuse Register, having been sentenced to thirty-nine months in prison as a result of the conviction. There was no evidence of a bond between the paternal grandmother and the child and there was an indication baby food was being fed to the child when she was not quite four months old and not ready for it. The mother indicated that she would move to a larger residence if she got custody. An order was made under the Maintenance and Custody Act granting custody to the grandmother who will be required to facilitate access amongst the various parties, some of which will be supervised within her discretion.

Application to disallow the limitation defence dismissed; plaintiff's action dismissed. The plaintiff's evidence did not show any valid reason for such a lengthy delay and the defendants thought that all outstanding issues with the plaintiff had long since been settled.

The plaintiff's lawyer had stated the nature of the claim to the defendants in his letter of 30 October 1992. It is presumed that this was done on the instructions of Cluett. 2) The elapse of 9 years raises a presumption that the evidence would be less cogent than it otherwise would have been. 3) It is reasonable to conclude that the plaintiff acted neither promptly nor reasonably by'sitting on her rights' for some nine years."

d_2006skpc95.txt,"The Crown has applied pursuant to s. 753 of the Criminal Code to have the accused designated a dangerous offender. There is no question that the accused was convicted of a 'serious personal injury offence' as that term is defined in s. 752 of the Code. It is also clear that the accused's predicate offence and past behaviour lead to the conclusion that the requirements set out in s. 753(1) of the Code have been met. The sole issue left for the Court to determine is whether the evidence permits the Court to find that there is a reasonable possibility of eventual control of the risk the accused poses to the community so that he could be designated a long term offender rather than a dangerous offender. This is not a case where a definite term of imprisonment would be appropriate, as was conceded by defence counsel. HELD: The accused is a dangerous offender. He is sentenced to indeterminate detention. 1) The accused does not have significant gaps in his violent offending, except for one period of about 19 months beginning August 2000. While there is a significant time period between his offences concerning T.R. (1993) and those involving P.M. (2003) there are also the other violent offences concerning women which are of concern, both with respect to MZ, which is a third example of that type of controlling, violent behaviour and the incidents concerning F.B. and S.O. which denote more explosive violent behaviour. 2) The expert evidence supports a finding that the accused is not someone who can be treated so as to reduce the risk of re-offence he presents to the community to an acceptable level.  3) Although many of the accused's offences were committed while he was under the influence of drugs or alcohol, it is doubtful that the continuous beatings which he inflicted on his domestic partners can all be attributed to violence while under the influence of substances. 4) The accused does not pose a risk to just a single person. Any woman he has contact with either through family relationships, intimate relationships, or purely social relationships is at risk of his penchant to punch or kick them in the face. Those he is involved with in a domestic situation or intimate relationship are at grave risk of his controlling, violent and torture-like abusing behaviour over a lengthy period of time. It is unlikely that restrictions in his living arrangements would be effective in preventing him from being intimately involved with women, who would be at risk. 5) The Court was of the opinion that the accused has significant psychopathic features of his personality that are so entrenched as to be impervious to change such that the sentencing principle of public protection can only be achieved by an indeterminate sentence.","The Crown applied pursuant to s. 753 of the Criminal Code to have the accused designated a dangerous offender. The accused was found guilty of aggravated assault for which he received a sentence of 11 months secure custody plus probation for two years, condition of which he take alcohol treatment. He was also found to be a long-term offender. HELD: The Court found that the accused was a long term offender, even if he met the criteria of dangerous offender, and that there must be more than an expression of hope that the person can be treated, but we must not require an absolute guarantee of treatability. The Court also found that there was a significant difference between the accused's current status and that of someone who would normally have been found a 'dangerous offender' and a person who was on probation at the time all of these offences were committed, having been released from custody on Sept. 21, 1992. A review of the law at the outset was held to determine whether there is a reasonable possibility of the accused eventually being controlled in the community, despite the fact that the statutory criteria in Part XXIV of the Code have been interpreted recently by both the Supreme Court of Canada and the Appeal Court of Appeal."
d_2006skqb251.txt,"Hayley is 7 years old. In this application each of her father, mother and maternal grandmother compete for some form of custody over her. The father seeks sole custody. The mother and grandmother seek joint custody with the father. The mother seeks to be designated as her daughter's primary caregiver. HELD: 1) The father and his wife Patricia have been the primary caregivers and psychological parents of Hayley for in excess of 2 years. The preservation of that important relationship when added to all other factors in this case tips the scales in favour of the father. 2) The family which has been Hayley's experience for the past 2 years, even if relocated to Calgary, is where the continuity, consistency and stability necessary to attain Hayley's best interests will be found. 3) The father must be the sole custodian of Hayley. He must consult with her mother. The evidence shows that the parties have not been able to maintain a functional parental relationship. Whether the mother establishes a new residence in Moose Jaw or Cold Lake, the distance relative to Calgary is significant. 4) A grandparent may be a person of sufficient interest if the relationship leads to the conclusion that such a relationship is beneficial to the child and consequently harmful if terminated. That is the first step. The second step arises only where the grandparent is found to be a person of sufficient interest. It proceeds with a review based on the best interest principle as enunciated by s. 9(1) of the Act. 5) The court was satisfied that the grandmother is a person of sufficient interest in Hayley's life and that if her relationship as grandmother to Hayley was thwarted by the actions of Hayley's parents, the result to Hayley would be harmful. There are situations, and this is one of them, where the court should curtail the tradition of access to a grandchild flowing from the parents who have the right to control the upbringing of their child and to determine what relationships the child shall be a party to. An independent right of access is needed to attain Hayley's best interests. The history and intensity of Hayley's relationship with her maternal grandmother weighs in favour of specifying access.","The father petitioned for sole custody of his daughter, while each of the mother and maternal grandmother independently sought joint custody with the father.

The petitioner’s father had recently moved from Nova Scotia to Alberta and was now working full-time. The Court noted that the mother had recently given birth to a daughter. The father had been living in Alberta for four and one-half years and had recently relocated to the city of Calgary. The mother and the maternal grandmother were to move to Alberta in mid-summer and the petitioner would have the opportunity to live with her father for the rest of her life.

d_2006skqb35.txt,"FIAT: The plaintiffs apply for an order requiring the defendant doctor to answer the interrogatories and attend a further examination for discovery. The defendants seek an order striking portions of the statement of claim, and requiring the plaintiff to provide answers to undertakings given at his examination for discovery. HELD: 1) Rule 222 of The Queen's Bench Rules allows a party to a proceeding without order to examine for discovery, before trial, an adverse party touching matters at issue. If the plaintiffs are in effect seeking to obtain particulars of similar fact circumstances, the prejudicial effect of such evidence far outweighs any prohibitive value. At the same time, s. 60(2) of The Medical Profession Act, 1981 protects against disclosure of information or evidence given during proceedings conducted by the College of Physicians and Surgeons. Likewise, s. 35.1 of The Saskatchewan Medical Evidence Act grants a similar privilege relating to quality assurance committees that have evaluated care given to patients in hospitals. Insofar as the interrogatories relate to patients, surgical procedures or proceedings not related to the subject litigation, they are either not relevant or privileged. Since the statement of claim has twice been amended, the court was satisfied that special circumstances exist permitting further examination for discovery and/or interrogatories. Wide latitude is permitted at this stage of the proceedings. The trial judge will be in the best position to determine the admissibility of information obtained in relation to the doctor's skills, techniques, judgment and competency. The plaintiffs are entitled to responses to specific interrogatories. If further elaboration is required, the plaintiffs may at their own expense re-examine the doctor. Such examination should not include inquiries as to other patient names, hospitals involved or details of the surgical procedures or surgeries performed.  2) Pursuant to Rule 173(a) of the Rules of Court it must be plain and obvious that the paragraphs of the statement of claim disclose no reasonable cause of action. Punitive damages are awarded in situations where the defendant's misconduct is so malicious, oppressive and high-handed that it offends the court's sense of decency. Such damages are only awarded where the combined award of general and aggravated damages are insufficient to achieve punishment and deterrence. The defendant's misconduct does not have to be an independent actionable wrong to attract punitive damages. The breach of a duty that is owed will attract an award of punitive damages. It is not the degree of negligence but the mental element that accompanies the negligence that give rise to a claim for aggravated or punitive damages. The amended statement of claim alleges the doctor failed to inform one of the plaintiff of the risks associated with the surgery leading her to believe there were no risks involved. Such negligence, if proven, could lead a trier of fact to conclude that both aggravated and punitive damages are warranted against this doctor. It would be somewhat presumptuous at this stage to conclude that it is plain and obvious that the plaintiffs do not have a cause of action for aggravated or punitive damages against the doctor. In the courts view humiliation, indignity, degradation or shame could be the consequences of the wrongful behaviour pleaded. If those emotions must be specifically pleaded, the plaintiffs can apply for a further amendment of their claim. 3) The obligations of a party to comply with undertakings given at an examination for discovery are contained in Rule 231 of The Queen's Bench Rules. To the extent that the doctor has been required to respond to interrogatories relating to his skill and training and to the extent that any further cross-examination may show defects in his competency, the plaintiff's undertaking must be answered. If the plaintiffs have further or other facts, those facts must be provided. 4) The defendants are not entitled to know or to take advantage of or receive any credit for or accounting relating to trust funds gratuitously set up for the plaintiff. However, an accounting regarding the bank records and the records produced for the Public Trustee by the Trustee for the trust fund will be complied with as it may impact on the claim by him for loss of income as a result of being required to be in attendance to provide care for the plaintiff.","The plaintiffs sought an order compelling the defendant to respond to written interrogatories and an order permitting further oral examination for discovery of the plaintiff on issues arising from his responses to the written questions. HELD: The application was adjourned sine die. The Queen's Bench Rules do not permit the use of information derived from investigations/reviews conducted by hospital boards or the College of Physicians and Surgeons. Insofar as the interrogatories relate to patients, surgical procedures or proceedings not related to the subject litigation, they are either not relevant or privileged. Since the Statement of Claim has been amended, special circumstances exist permitting further examination. The Court embarks upon an assessment of the merits of the claim and the motives of the plaintiffs. It would be somewhat presumptuous at this stage of the proceedings to conclude that it is plain and obvious pursuant to Rule 173(a) that the plaintiffs do not have a cause of action for aggravated or punitive damages against the defendant."

The situation had evolved to the point that the petitioner had relocated to the same city as the respondent and children. For the past two and a half year, the petitioner had access to the children 50% of the time. The petitioner acknowledged that under the current arrangement, the respondent consulted him before making decisions regarding the welfare of the children.

The original consent order provides that the respondent must consult with the petitioner on issues of health and education and the current arrangement has worked well for the children. The petitioner also failed to establish a material change in circumstances sufficient to alter the agreed child support arrangement. The issue of increased costs for the petitioner to exercise access to the children was dealt with in the original consent order.

The parenting judgment contemplated in detail the parenting arrangement that has been followed. The respondent as single parent was able to access the petitioner 50% of the time. However, the petitioner's income on equal parenting was clearly provided for in the original parenting judgment. 2) The petitioner has not satisfied that a material change of circumstance has occurred. There has been no health or welfare issues to be resolved through consultation. 3) The respondent has not managed to resolve material issues with respect to the children's health and well-being.

Canadian Broadcasting Corp., 1994 CanLII 39 and R. v. Mentuck, 2001 SCC 76 to determine whether restrictive publication should be ordered: the necessity to prevent serious risk to the proper administration of justice because reasonable alternative measures will not prevent the risk; the positive effects on the rights and interests of the parties and the public, including that of the right to free expression. 2) Bearing in mind the efficacy of the high school grapevine in this electronic age, publication of the factual accounts of the young people in their affidavit will not cause further harm in my view."
d_2011skpc110.txt,"The accused was detained by a police officer at the scene following a motor vehicle accident. The police vehicle was not equipped with an approved screening device (ASD) and was requested at 3:02 a.m. Upon receiving the ASD, a demand was made for a breath sample at 3:10 a.m. and a 'fail' reading was obtained at 3:12 a.m. The accused unsuccessfully attempted to reach three different lawyers at the police station and ultimately spoke with Legal Aid duty counsel. The accused was charged with driving over .08. The defence argued that the ASD demand was not made forthwith and the ASD results were unlawfully obtained. The defence submitted the accused's rights under s. 8, s. 9, and s. 10(b) of the Charter were breached and sought exclusion of the Certificate of Analysis. HELD: 1) The accused's s. 10(b) Charter right was not infringed. While the police were obliged to afford the accused a reasonable opportunity to contact counsel and to facilitate that contact, they were not required to monitor the quality of the legal advice once contact was made. 2) Although the accused was arbitrarily detained for a period of 11 minutes from time of detention to making of the ASD demand contrary to s. 8 and s. 9 of the Charter, the officer acted in good faith by placing the accused in the police vehicle because it was cold outside, the accused had no jacket on, he was injured and his vehicle was seriously damaged. The detention was of relatively short duration and there was no evidence that the accused's bodily integrity or dignity were compromised. The admission of the Certificate of Analysis would not bring the administration of justice into disrepute.","The accused was charged with operating a motor vehicle while his blood alcohol content exceeded 80 milligrams of alcohol in 100 millilitres of blood, contrary to s. 253(1)(b) of the Criminal Code. The accused attempted unsuccessfully to reach three different lawyers but ultimately spoke with Legal Aid duty counsel. HELD: The accused's s. 10(b) Charter rights were not infringed. The admission of the Certificate of Analysis would not bring the administration of justice into disrepute. 1) Charter breaches were moderately serious. The officer's failure to make the demand 11 minutes earlier than he did raised the issue of reasonable delay. 2) The accused was arbitrarily detained for 11 minutes and a sample of his breath was obtained. However, the officer appeared to have acted in good faith. He should have informed the accused why he was placed in the police vehicle and ought to have made the demand as soon as he formed the reasonable suspicion that the accused had alcohol in his body. 3) The Certificate ofalyses was admitted into evidence. 4) It is my view that Charter breaches are moderately serious and the accused's Charter rights are not infringered. 5) There is little in the accused’s testimony upon which to determine the impact of the detention upon him. He testified that he was unaware of his right to counsel and the officer did not take any steps to provide him with their after-hours contact numbers or obtain their home numbers. 6) The Court found the accused was not given an opportunity to exercise his Charter rights. 7) It was also found that the certificate of analysis would not be excluded under s. 24(2). 8) The court found there was a range in the potential impact upon an accused, fromfleeting and technical to profoundly invasive. The more serious the effect of the breaches, the greater the risk that the admission of a breath sample would bring to account the rights obtained by the accused."
d_2011skqb62.txt,"The Crown appealed the acquittal of the accused on a charge under s. 90 of the Criminal Code for carrying a concealed weapon. The accused was spotted at a recycling facility with a sword stuffed in the back of his pants. At trial, defence called evidence suggesting that a sword of that type could be purchased at a novelty store and had a blunt edge. The accused testified that he bought the sword with the intention of hanging it on the wall or putting it on his television. The trial judge found that the Crown had not established that the sword was a weapon or that the accused intended to use it as a weapon. The Crown appealed on the basis that the trial judge misapprehended evidence, ignored other evidence and improperly admitted opinion evidence. HELD: The evidence from the defence 'expert' indicated that he had particular experience that allowed him to recognize the sword and he was able to be of assistance to the Court because of his experience. No attempt was made by the Crown to contradict the evidence that the sword could be purchased at a novelty store and had a blunt edge. The Crown bore the burden of establishing that the sword was a weapon within s. 2 of the Criminal Code and the only evidence before the Court was that the accused probably bought it as a decorative item and that it likely came from a novelty store. On that basis, it was open to the trial judge to conclude that she had a reasonable doubt that the sword was designed to be used as a weapon. The trial judge properly considered the evidence in the context of the issues to be addressed. The Court held that a sword is not prima facie a weapon. The Crown appeal was dismissed.","The Crown appeals the acquittal of the accused on a charge of carrying a concealed weapon contrary to s. 90 of the Criminal Code. The Crown appeals on the grounds that the learned trial judge misapprehended the evidence, ignored other evidence and improperly admitted opinion evidence. HELD: The Crown submits that the verdict was unreasonable and not supported by the evidence and seeks conviction on the charge. 1) The Crown argues that a knife, being an instrument that is universally used for utilitarian, peaceful purposes is not prima facie designed to be used as a weapon, that is to say, in warfare, fighting, or combat to overcome an enemy in attack or defence. The only evidence before the trial judge was (a) that the accused probably bought it as a decorative item and (b) that it likely came from a novelty store. The accused testified that he had just purchased the sword and was taking it home to display in his room, or on his television. The trial judge concluded that she had a reasonable doubt that the sword was designed for the purposes enumerated in the definition; however, the Crown's appeal is dismissed. 2) One must first start with the premise that a sword should be found to be a weapon within the meaning of s. 2 of the Code, the only evidence that is properly the subject of expert evidence put in under the guise of opinion evidence is the accused's testimony that he bought the sword from someone who was aware of it being readily available in novelty stores. As he did not testify as to his eye witness perceptions, but about the sword, that he was not testifying as to that but about it and where it could be purchased, that notwithstanding that the knife, like a multitude of other things (e.g. baseball bats, hatchets, pipe wrenches, ice picks) can on occasion be used effectively in fighting offensively or defensively, the accused testified to having been drinking at the park with friends the day before. He was aware that it was readily for sale in novelty store and that it had wear on its tip; the locking device renders the knife safer when it is used for protection, and the switchblade affords useful contrast to the usual use of this type of item. One must, at the outset, start with a premise that the blade is a 'brilliant' type of weapon, in the same manner that a firearm, or brass knuckles or other inherently dangerous items are considered weapons. On this basis, sword would be distinguished from knife, which"
d_2013skca22.txt,"The prospective appellant applied to leave to appeal an order made in Chambers. The Merchant Law Group and the Crown had been involved in protracted negotiations regarding the manner in which Merchant would bill the Crown for legal fees regarding their representation of Indian residential school claimants. The parties eventually reached a 'Verification Agreement', respecting the verification of Merchant's legal fees and disbursements. In order to protect solicitor-client privilege, Merchant's software company was able to develop redacted electronic billing records with the privileged information removed. When Merchant did submit a bill, it was discovered that the electronic billing records were inaccurate. The parties then became involved in a dispute regarding the Merchant's obligations under the Agreement. They had each made an application to a Chambers judge acting in his capacity as an administrative judge for the purposes of the Agreement for directions. The judge ordered (see: 2012 SKQB 517) that Merchant should contact its former software company and arrange for them to re-create the redacted electronic billing records as a whole from the 'live data' in the appellant's present billing program. Before the software company would perform this task, the Court ordered Merchant to pay the outstanding fees. Merchant had disputed these fees and had refused to pay them. Merchant took the position that the administrative judge had exceeded his jurisdiction by requiring the law firm to make this payment: the judge had over-reached his authority. In addition, the judge had based his decision on emails that were not evidence.HELD: The Court noted that leave to appeal under Court of Appeal Rule 11 is granted in accordance with the criteria established in Rothmans, Benson &amp; Hedges Inc. v. Saskatchewan. Leave to appeal was denied. The order appealed from was simply a discretionary order designed to move the verification process along and ensure the process met its overall objective of determining if the amount of Merchant's fee was reasonable and equitable. The prospective appellant failed to establish that there was a matter of sufficient importance to the proceedings or to the field of practice, the state of law or the administration of justice to warrant a determination by the Court.","The appellant sought leave to appeal an order of the Chambers judge acting in his capacity as an Administrative Judge appointed pursuant to the Court Administration Protocol (CAP) established as part of the settlement of the Indian Residential Schools litigation. The appellant argued the parties agreed to make their records available for review and verification and each had made an application to the Administrative Judge for directions. The Administrative Judge specifically set out what was required of the applicant to supply the new information in form compatible with the redacted electronic billing records. The applicant argued this was a discretionary order designed to move the verification process along and ensure the amount of the appellant's fee was reasonable and equitable. HELD: Leave to appeal was denied. 1) Contrary to the argument that the applicant did not err by requiring MLG to pay the alleged accounts of ESI without sufficient information and without due process, the Court found that the order was not erratic in nature and was not directed to the applicant. It was open in the process for the court to give further directions from time to time to ensure that the process is properly concluded. An appeal will unduly delay the proceedings and will unnecessarily add to the cost of proceedings. 2) The applicant failed to establish there was a matter of sufficient importance to the proceedings before the Court, or to the field of practice or the state of law, or the administration of justice generally, to warrant determination by the Court of Appeal. The order appealed from was simply a discretionary ordering designed to get the verification to move along. There was no error by failing to require Deloitte to complete its report and order the report delivered to MLG. There were no errors in requiring the appellant to provide additional information in format which could not be reconciled with the original redacted data. 3) The application for directions was dismissed. 4) The court found that although the applicant had not satisfied its obligations under the VA, it could have ordered MLG to supply it with the information which was necessary to allow Canada's auditors to continue with the verification of the claim."
d_2013skpc206.txt,"HELD: The Court concluded that the $1,000 loan did not exist, there was nothing on the books showing an advance of wages as submitted by the plaintiff. The Court was not satisfied that the defendant husband received a loan from the plaintiff in the amount of $5,000. There was no loan documentation, which would be expected given the money was advanced from the plaintiff corporation. The plaintiff never demanded any of the money be paid back until just before issuing the statement of claim. The Court also held that the $5,000 to the defendant wife was a gift. The counterclaim of $2,400 was not proven; there was no evidence that these payments were not made with consent. The $960 should not have been taken off of the defendant husband’s cheque because the $1,000 and $5,000 loans were not made out. The defendant husband was successful in this portion of his counterclaim. The Court found that $2,400 given to the plaintiff by the defendant wife was also by agreement. The defendant wife’s testimony with respect to her hours worked were favoured over the plaintiff’s. The defendant wife was overpaid for work in November so the plaintiff was only owed $32.32. The plaintiff filed an inaccurate Record of Employment knowing that the defendant wife was trying to obtain employment insurance. The amount of damages owing to the defendant wife was adjourned to allow her to make a new claim with Service Canada for employment insurance given the Court’s determination of her hours worked, which would be enough to qualify for employment insurance.","HELD: The Court found that there was no loan of $1,000.00 to Christos as far as the $2,400.00 was concerned. The counterclaim as to the $5,000 was not proven. The court found that the plaintiff had an obligation to record accurate working hours in the Record of Employment for Christos. 1) The amount of the loan was never taken from the defendant's wages, which the plaintiff has not made out, in light of the Court's finding that she has worked 604 hours. 2) The defendant's counterclaim was dismissed shortly after the plaintiff's statement of claim was issued. 3) There was no gift or gift given to the defendant to start their new life in Canada. There is no loan documentation prepared and/or signed which one would anticipate considering the plaintiff is a corporation.  4) The counter claim as to $3,000 being a loan is not proven as there is no evidence to support it. The defendant testified that she never received any money for the loan. 5) The plaintiff could have made a loan to the plaintiff without documentation. As the amount of damages is not known at this time, and as the defendant may be able to now qualify and receive funds retroactively for special benefits from Service Canada, the issue of the defendant Lilia's claim is adjourned to a date to be determined by the parties and the Court will hear evidence and argument on the quantum of damages to be paid by the plaintiff to Lilia.  6) Lilia is entitled to damages as against the defendant for negligence in the filing of the record of employment. As there is not a record of it, the defendant could have qualified and received funds retroactive to January 1, 2019. 7) The issue of damages as to this aspect of Lilia if she now qualifies for payment from service Canada. If she was unable to obtain the payments that she had lost, the Court ordered that Lilia be paid on the balance of probabilities.  8) The Court ordered Lilia to file a demand letter close to the time of issuing the Statement of Claim, but no request to pay it back earlier.  9) As Lilia did not file the front of each cheque, the plaintiff filed a copy of the back of the cheques, which was never filed as an exhibit with the Court.  10) The court ordered the defendants to pay Lilia the balance.  11) The $5k.00 cheque was never issued and Lilia was never"
d_2013skpc56.txt,"The accused was convicted after trial of trafficking cocaine and breach of probation. The issue was whether the accused could be sentenced to a custodial disposition under s. 39(1)(d) of the Youth Criminal Justice Act. HELD: The youth was sentenced to deferred custody. The amount of cocaine was significant, the accused was the only person involved in the offence, it was a fairly unsophisticated operation, the impact on the small northern community where the offence occurred was huge, it is aggravating that the drug being trafficked was cocaine, the accused has a previous criminal record for trafficking, the place where the offence was committed is a friendship centre and a popular gathering spot for youth in the area and the offence was committed for financial gain. The Court held that the most aggravating factor on sentence was that the accused was less than one month into a probation order imposed for trafficking cocaine and was to stay out of the province. The Court held that it was impossible to conclude that the probation order the accused had previously been placed on had in any way achieved its goal of rehabilitation and reintegration of the offender.","The accused was convicted of possession of cocaine for the purposes of trafficking contrary to s. 137 of the Youth Criminal Justice Act, possession of a weapon for the purpose of trafficking and failure to comply with a youth probation order for failing to attend a youth court. The accused was sentenced to six months deferred custody on all three counts. HELD: 1)The accused had 76 grams of cocaine. The evidence seemed to indicate a fairly unsophisticated operation being conducted out of the back seat of a vehicle. The Court conceded that with this not being a violent offence, and with his limited criminal record, the accused is not subject to custody under either s. 39(1)(d) or s. 38(c) of the YCJA. 2)The Court was convinced beyond a reasonable doubt that the prime motivation behind the drug trafficking was financial gain. The most aggravating factor in this case was the fact that the accused was only one month into a probation order. The court found that with the accused not having in his possession any firearms, crossbow, prohibited weapon, restricted weapon, prohibited device, or explosive substance, for a period of 2 years from the date of this order, he did not have access to a cell phone during the time of his deferred custody."
d_2013skqb59.txt,"The petitioner mother has entered into a new relationship and is pregnant. She wants to move with the parties' two children to live with her new spouse. The respondent father is currently in jail and will be incarcerated for the balance of the calendar year. The respondent opposes the move and wants access to his children at the jail. The mother had unilaterally moved with the children prior to making this application in the face of an existing court order. One of the reasons that respondent is in jail is because he assaulted the petitioner. HELD: The Court was of the view that this was an exceptional case that warranted permitting the move on an interim basis. The petitioner's new relationship and the impending birth of a new sibling for the children is a material change in circumstances. The move is justified because the petitioner is the only parent available to the children and it would defy common sense to deprive the children of a relationship with their new sibling, particularly when the respondent is unavailable as a parent and there is no reasonable basis to conclude that matters can be resolved in the father's favour. The respondent asked to have the issue of custody and access delayed until his release. This is not a realistic option. It was clear that the father had not truly considered the best interests of his children in opposing this application and that the mother's position would likely prevail at trial. With respect to access with the father in jail, there was no evidence that visiting the respondent in jail would be beneficial to these young children. The respondent was granted telephone access and, if it was possible to arrange with corrections officials, access via Skype or Face Time.","FIAT: The mother wants to change her residence and that of the two young children presently. The father has a significant history of criminal behaviour, is presently incarcerated and will be for at least the balance of this calendar year. HELD: 1) While personal access to an incarcerated parent may be beneficial to children in some instances, the court has insufficient evidence to conclude, on a balance of probabilities, that these two children visiting their father in jail would benefit. There should be some connection maintained. That can be done through telephone access. 2) There has been a material change of circumstances affecting the children. Their mother's new relationship and her pregnancy means a new sibling will be introduced into their lives. 3) The court is of the view that the children's best interests are best served by the mother remaining the primary parent, and that this be done in Kenaston."

Although the accused was lawfully stopped, the roadside demand was valid and the accused declined to exercise his right to counsel on two occasions following his arrest, the observation period at the detachment was not conducted properly. The officer was sometimes focused on other things. As the observation period comprised part and parcel of a breath test, the breathalyzer test was not properly administered and the Crown could not rely on the accuracy of the readings.","The accused was charged with operating a motor vehicle while impaired contrary to s. 255(1) and s. 253(1)(a) of the Criminal Code, having consumed alcohol in such quantity that the concentration thereof in his blood exceeded eighty milligrams of alcohol in one hundred millilitres of blood, and failing to call a lawyer on two occasions. HELD: The accused was found not guilty of count 2, over.08. The evidence did not support a finding of guilt on count #1. The accused declined the opportunity to call his lawyer after he was advised of his rights to counsel. The Crown cannot rely on the presumption of accuracy and rely on accuracy of the readings on the Certificate of Qualified Technician. On the issue of whether the stop of the accused was lawful, if it is established that the observation period was not properly conducted, the right to counsel is suspended not only after, but before the demand. The officer was actually absent for a period of time from the accused's presence. The Court of Queen's Bench decision in By found that the police officer was checking for licence, registration and sobriety, but not that he was also checking for driver's licence or registration and the breathalyzer did not detect anything in their mouth, burp or vomit."

Dismissing the appeal, that the insurer of a subcontractor on a construction project was not liable to contribute to payment of a fire loss by the insurer of the principle contractor where the risk was allocated by the contract documents to the principle contractor and not the subcontractor.","This was an appeal from a decision declaring that the respondent Guardian was not liable to contribute to payment of a fire loss insured against by the appellant Hartford. The respondent had entered into a contract with Fraser-Brace for the construction of a hospital. The contract allocated the risk for fire loss to Fraser and required Fraser to obtain fire insurance to protect the parties against fire loss. The appellant sued to recover its money with interest from Hartford on the basis that the policy had been issued under the mistaken belief by Delta that it was required to carry builder's risk insurance. The trial judge found the building was never at the insured's risk; the policy was never void and the policy attached when the property became at the risk of the insured. He ordered the respondent to repay the advances with compound interest. Several issues were raised on appeal. 1)The appeal on the main issue ought to be dismissed. There was no evidence nor even suggestion that the fire caused the fire. The obligation to insure the risk had been allocated to Fraser Brace by the Province by the contract with the Province. As Delta did not cause the fire it had no liability to the Province for causing the loss. 2)There was no contractual relationship between Guardian and the Province, nor between the Guardian and Hartford which could give rise to any obligation on Guardian's part to contribute towards the fire loss and there was no obligation on the part of the insurer to contribute. 3)The appellant had no obligation to the respondent pursuant to the terms of the policy issued to it."

The 1997 income information was not included because the financial evidence was insufficient. 15% of the capital cost allowance was imputed pursuant to s19 for the 1994-96 taxation years.

The appellant appeals the dismissal of her claim for negligent misrepresentation and the notice period for wrongful dismissal. The respondent crossappeals, claiming the five-month notice period should be reduced due to the appellant's failure to mitigate her loss. 1) The trial judge found that the misrepresentation related to the very existence of the job offered, not as to its length and, therefore, the contractual provision for notice did not bar an action in tort. 2) The appellant's claim was not that the appellant negligently misrepresented the amount of time he would be working on Multiview or the conditions under which his employment could be terminated. The term in the contract providing for dismissal on notice was an effective disclaimer precluding any separate action in the tort. 3) There was extensive evidence about the working relationship between the appellant and the appellant. There was an extensive conflict of interest on the issue of whether the trial judge's decision to award damages at the high end of the scale was in any way inconsistent with the standard set out in Queen v.

e_1999skqb106.txt,"FIAT. One of the nine plaintiffs, legal representatives of passengers killed in a helicopter crash in 1995, and two defendants sought better testimonial and documentary discovery. Objections to questions or to the production of documents at the examinations for discovery fell under relevance and privilege. The plaintiffs alleged the defendants carried on a negligent and reckless shuttle service to and from the work site and that the Cameco group could not avoid liability by reason of having hired the Kyrgyzstan National Airline as an independent contractor. HELD: 1)Relevancy. The plaintiffs were entitled to question officers of the corporations and receive production of all documents touching on the issues of why the helicopter and the airline were selected; who made these decisions and whether KOC was the alter ego or agent for Cameco in this respect; whether the airline was unsafe; if so, should any of the defendants have known it was unsafe; was it inherently dangerous; and if so, could the defendants rely on the independent contractor defence. Questions relating to availability, cost and reliability of alternative forms of transportation were logically relevant. Questions as to topography were relevant as background information and supported the allegation the shuttle was inherently dangerous. Whether the project was over budget was relevant but the budget itself was not. Although questions directed at whether insurance was arranged and by whom were to be answered, the information is not automatically admissible at trial. Questions relating to the e-mail system and when survival gear was placed on board were properly answerable. Records as to when the tickets were reserved and purchased were to be produced. Counsel is not required to justify why every particular question is asked. The relationship between Cameco and it various subsidiaries was in issue and the information as to when the president met certain people was broadly relevant. Leave was granted to reapply for direction. 2)Privilege:(a)The defendants were ordered to date any document for which privilege was claimed. The document must be sufficiently identified to allow the opposing party to assess whether the claim for privilege should be challenged. (b)The request for names of the persons who prepared documents was simply an attempt to investigate the investigation and was not permitted. The Rules of Court do not require the names of expert witnesses who prepared reports for which privilege is claimed. The same rationale applies to non- expert privileged memoranda. (c)Pre-accident observations disclosed to someone in the subsequent privileged investigation are disclosable. The plaintiff is entitled to ask the name of any employee who expressed safety concerns about the shuttle prior to the accident. While matters of opinion only, such concerns are disclosable. A reciprocal order with respect to the names of potential witnesses was made in favour of the defendants. (d)Litigation privilege attaches only until such time as party determines to utilize the document at trial. Under the Rules of Court party must disclose any such document and produce any existing expert reports prior to the pre-trial conference. (e)The report on safety equipment and survival gear prepared by the KOC Safety Superintendent was to be reviewed by the court to assess whether or to what extent it was privileged. It was not known whether the Report prepared after litigation included matters other than what the Superintendent was requested to report on prior to the accident. (f)It was ordered that information given by a former senior level KOC employee would not amount to a breach of the confidentiality agreement. The agreement not to disclose any proprietary information, including business information, was broad enough to include privileged investigations carried out by the employer. Counsel for KOC and Kilborn were permitted to be present at the interview. (g)The chronology document was privileged on the basis it represented the product of a privileged investigation. 3)The necessary criteria under Rule 222(a) was not established to justify examining for discovery the two former employees. The request to explore post accident conduct of senior executives was dismissed. Seeking to establish alternate forms of transportation was irrelevant to the issues. 4)Particulars of the statutes and regulations referred to in the statement of claim, sought under Rule 142, were to be supplied within 45 days. 5)The question asking the spouse if in her opinion her husband would have boarded an aircraft he felt was unsafe was improper as framed. The question was relevant only to character. Character evidence is limited to reputation in the community and does not allow for personal opinion. 6)There was no order as to costs as success was mixed.","The plaintiffs allege that one or more of the above defendants carried on a negligent and reckless helicopter shuttle operation to and from the work site. HELD: 1) Answers to all of these questions are logically relevant to the choice made by one of the defendants because they are factors one would expect any decision maker to take into account in deciding a specific form of transportation, and are also relevant to test the credibility of answers that may be provided by the corporate officers with respect to the reasons for the choices made. 2) The plaintiff corporation is in a position to determine when such survival gear was placed on board the helicopters, the question should be answered. 3) The defendant corporations are obliged to answer questions directed at whether insurance was obtained, and if so, who arranged and paid for the same.  4) If not, leave is granted to reapply for direction.  5) The plaintiffs are entitled to the information contained in the plaintiff corporation's statement of claim and the statements of defence. 6) Answers are required at this time to the details of the budget, the dates of the meetings, the cost of the flight, the availability of the survival gear, the reliability or safety of the alternatives, the dependability of the air conditioners, the number of potential witnesses and the extent to which the defendants knew of the safety issue. 7) Questions directed at when the e-mail system was established is not irrelevant for the simple reason that until such date is known it cannot be known whether such records are in existence during the relevant period of time. Questions related to the other six theories are clearly irrelevant as they are not raised by the pleadings. The only significance of the plaintiffs identifying the theories they may hold behind the claim is that by disclosing the theory it is easier to determine whether such questioning is warranted. The plaintiffs' wish to explore theory that cost was major consideration in the defendants' continued use of Kyrgyzstan National Air as a shuttle service is also relevant. The same is true of any decisions involving the transportation of goods or services made by the defendants.  7) The only relevance is whether cost entered into the defendants’ choice to utilize Kyrgyza National Air (KOC) and state that KOC was a separate and distinct corporation which operates the Kumtor Project independently and of its own will by its own Board of Directors. Any decisions involving transportation made by KOC were made by it independently of Cameco, Cameco Gold and Kumtor Mountain.

e_2002nssc20.txt,"The applicant operated commercial private billiards club with liquor licence and served bar food. The applicant applied to amend the liquor licence to another category to allow public access and slightly longer hours of operation. The Municipality refused to issue a letter to the effect that the premises were properly zoned for that purpose, arguing that the proposal would result in a change in use requiring a development agreement. The applicant applied for an order declaring that the land use by-law permitted the proposed use. Application granted; the proposal did not constitute a change in use as the essential use of the premises was the sale of liquor and food in a pool hall and that would not change. There was no evidence that the proposal would result in a nuisance or increased traffic, neither of which could be presumed.","This was an application for an order to declare that the Land Use By-law of the respondent permits the operation of a licensed billiard club open to the public. The applicant had established a private pool hall in a rural area of the municipality. The premises was located in a land use zone known as the Core Village and was subject to the respondent's Land Use by-laws. The pool hall was operated within the definition of a 'drinking establishment' as that term is defined in the by-law, set forth above. It consisted of pool tables, a full bar service and various snacks which could be purchased at the bar. It was common ground that this operation was conforming to the use of the landowner's rights as it then existed. The change of the liquor license sought by the applicant would constitute a change in use requiring a development permit. Both remoteness and neighbourhood effects contribute to what Gonthier J. refers to as the real and natural expectation of a landowner."
e_2004skpc101.txt,"The accused applies for relief pursuant to the Charter of Rights on the basis of post-charge delay denying him the right to have his trial in a reasonable time. The accused was charged on July 3, 2003 with common assault contrary to s. 266 of the Criminal Code, threatening to use weapon contrary to s. 267(a) of the Code, and destroying property of value less than $5,000 contrary to s. 430(4) of the Code. On July 31, 2003, the accused first appeared in court. The information was adjourned until October 6, 2003 due to lack of Legal Aid resources. On November 3, 2003, not guilty plea was entered and trial was set for May 6, 2004. On May 6, 2004, the trial was adjourned on application by the Crown due to the non-attendance of the complainant and new trial date was set for October 7, 2004. HELD: There was no Charter breach and the application is dismissed. 1) The length of delay from the date of release to the date of trial is approximately 15 months. This is not a complicated case and the delay warrants an inquiry. 2) The Court did not accept the accused's submission that he suffered actual prejudice because the undertaking prevented him from accessing his children. There were no efforts by the accused to overcome this. 3) The restrictive condition in the undertakings prohibiting him from drinking alcohol has resulted in him being charged with and pleading guilty to offences of breaching his undertaking. As these offences all occurred within what could be considered a reasonable time for the matter to proceed to trial, there is no actual prejudice to the accused. 3) This is a charge that involves an offence of domestic violence and is so serious that it carries the heightened public interest that exists in offences of violence.","The accused applied for relief pursuant to The Charter of Rights and Freedoms on the basis of post-charge delay denying him the right to have his trial in a reasonable time. HELD: The application was dismissed. 1)There was no Charter breach. The accused did not contribute to the remaining delay. He appeared on all court dates and was diligent about having the charge set for trial. 2)The Court found no actual or inferred prejudice. The conditions of release he is subject to are not soerous as to result in any significant prejudice to him or to infer that he has suffered prejudice over and above that suffered by others charged with similar offences. The Court found that the prejudice to the accused in the delay was not such a significant issue as to outweigh the prejudice that would result if the accused was not to face trial. 3)The court found that in this case the accused had not suffered actual prejudice because the restrictive condition in the undertaking preventing him from contacting the complainant and it is therefore argued that he was prevented from having access to his children in her care. 4)The accused was charged with three intervening offences of breaching his undertaking which he attributes to the delay. The six months between the first and second trial dates consider as attributable to the Crown, it being necessary because of the non-attendance of the complainant who was under subpoena to attend. 5)There is no evidence of any efforts by the accused to overcome this prejudice. This prejudice is something that the accused could overcome."
e_2006nssc364.txt,"The plaintiff, while working as security officer in mall, was run down in the parking lot as he was pursuing shoplifter. The van that struck him, driven by second individual, was being used as getaway vehicle. The issue before the court was whether the agreed-upon damages were to be paid by the liability insurer of the registered owner of the vehicle (who was not the driver) or by the plaintiff's Section D (uninsured motorist) insurer. As the first defendant remained the registered owner of the vehicle at the relevant time and failed to rebut the statutory presumption that it was being operated by the second defendant (who had now disappeared) with his consent at that time, the vehicle's insurer was responsible to pay the plaintiff's damages. The action against the plaintiff's Section D insurer is dismissed. The case turned on numerous credibility issues as the registered owner of the vehicle professed to have sold it few days prior to the incident (although he maintained insurance on the vehicle for several months afterwards), and it was argued that the second defendant (whom the plaintiff had detained for shoplifting earlier that day) was not the driver of the vehicle.","The plaintiff, who was working as security officer for a department store, was hit by a van while attempting to register ownership of another vehicle with the Registry of Motor Vehicles. The van was being used as the getaway vehicle in the shoplifting heist and was being driven by a second individual. The plaintiff suffered serious personal injuries, mainly to his knee, as a result of the hit and run. Allstate joined the proceeding as a third party under the provisions of s. 133(14) of the Insurance Act whereby it is defending the action against its insured, Jerome Thomas, under his Section (uninsured motorist) coverage. HELD: The plaintiff's evidence was replete with inconsistencies, contradictions, admitted poor memory and admitted lies in his earlier discovery evidence. There were few other inconsistencies in the plaintiff’s evidence, including his admission that he sold the van to Laura Marsh for $500 and that he traded the van for drugs. He also acknowledged that he had no documentation whatsoever in proof of the sale of the van and that the van was parked in a handicap parking area but that he did not recall the address of the shoplifter. The court found that the plaintiff had no recollection of the date of the transaction and that there was a small round after market light mounted just above the left rear bumper. The Court awarded the plaintiff the all inclusive sum of $162,500."
e_2006skqb519.txt,"The Bank presents a motion to the Court to determine the priority position of the Bank and the respondent corporation respecting assets leased by the respondent to Sweeprite. By agreed statement of facts and issue, the parties have agreed that the issue to be determined is whether the Bank has priority to, or entitlement to, the equipment subject to the Lease. This requires a determination of whether the Lease was a 'lease for a term of more than one year' as defined by s. 2(1)(y) of The Personal Property Security Act. HELD: The respondent was 'regularly engaged in the business of leasing', within the meaning of s. 2(1)(y)(iv) of the PPSA and therefore is not entitled to the exemption from registration requirements of s. 3 of the Act. The lease in question was therefore 'a lease for a term of more than one year' within the meaning of the Act and it required registration. Having failed to register its leasehold interest at the personal property registry, the respondent's claim to the equipment is subordinate to the registered and first priority claim of the Bank. 1) There is no evidence of any business activity at all that the respondent engaged in until May 2001 when it had transferred back to it Sweeprite's land, building and equipment. The respondent in turn rented back the building, land and equipment, none of which ever left Sweeprite's possession, to Sweeprite under the terms of non-written agreement. Sweeprite paid rental to the respondent. Ultimately the respondent and Sweeprite entered into the equipment lease for term of years. 2) In 2001 when the non-written lease/rental agreement first began, the respondent had no other business except the ownership and lease to and/or rental of the land, building and equipment to Sweeprite. It was not until December of 2001 when it obtained the research and development contract with Rite Way. 3) The business of leasing, which had started in the spring of 2001 under the non-written arrangement and which continued thereafter by virtue of the equipment lease until the bankruptcy of Sweeprite, was from May to December of 2001 the only business of the respondent and thereafter continued to be a significant part of the respondent's business.","The Bank of Montreal (the Bank) presented a motion to determine the priority position of the Bank and the respondent Patchrite (Patchrite) respecting assets leased by Patchrite to the Bank. The Bank had no other business except the ownership and lease to and rental of the land, building and equipment to Sweeprite. It was not until December of 2001 when it obtained the research and development contract with Rite Way that it commenced the business of leasing the equipment to Patchrite. In 2001, the Bank granted the Bank security interest in all of its present and after-acquired personal property (the equipment lease until the bankruptcy of Rite Way), was the only business of Patchrite, and thereafter continued to be a significant part of the bank's business. HELD: The Court found that Patchrite was regularly engaged in the leasing business within the meaning of s.2(1)(y)(iv) of the PPSA and therefore it is not entitled to the exemption from registration requirements of s3. The lease in question was therefore a lease for a term of more than one year and it required registration. Having failed to register its leasehold interest at the personal property registry, the Court concluded that the Bank's claim to the equipment is subordinate to the registered and first priority claim of the Trustee. The Trustee was awarded an option to purchase the leased equipment for purchase price of $212,000."
e_2007skca122.txt,"This is an appeal from a decision of the trial judge who granted a motion to withdraw the case from the jury in an action for damages in negligence brought by the appellant plaintiff against the respondent defendants. The action arose out of burn suffered by the appellant while participating in demolition derby run by the defendants. The motion was granted on the premise there was no case to go to the jury because the appellant had failed to adduce sufficient evidence of the requisite causal connection between his injury and the alleged acts of negligence, and the standard of care required of the respondents. In consequence, the trial judge dismissed the action with costs to the respondents. The issue on appeal is whether the trial judge applied the test correctly in light of the evidence. HELD: Appeal dismissed. 1) Had the case been permitted to go to the jury on the theory of the appellant, the jury would have been asked to conclude on a balance of probabilities that, but for the actions of the flagman who failed to immediately halt the competition and alert the Fire Department to the condition he had observed, the appellant would have suffered less serious burns than he in fact suffered. Similarly, the jury would have been asked to conclude that, but for the failure of the volunteer fire fighters to take more effective action, the appellant would have suffered less serious burns. The jury could not have arrived at either conclusion, given the evidence of the duration the appellant was on fire, about 30 seconds, and the expert evidence that his injuries would have occurred virtually instantaneously or within 5 to 6 seconds of his having caught on fire while still in his vehicle. In the light of this evidence, and in the absence of further evidence of the standard of care required of each of the respondent, the Court is of the opinion the jury could not rationally have concluded that either of the respondents caused or materially contributed to the extend of the appellant's injury. On the basis of the expert evidence, the damage would have occurred just the same, fault or no fault on the part of the respondents. That being so, the damage could not be seen to have been caused or materially contributed to by the respondents. 2) There is no tenable basis for this Court to interfere with the trial judge's award of costs.","This was an appeal from a decision of the Madam Justice Rothery who granted a motion to withdraw the case from the jury in an action for damages in negligence brought by the appellant against the respondents, Bjorkdale Lions Club Inc., and the defendants, the defendants. HELD: Appeal dismissed. 1) There was no tenable basis to interfere with the award. 2) The court found that the action was destined to fail because, based upon the evidence before the court and the evidence and theory advanced, the jury could not have concluded that either of the respondents caused or contributed to the extent of the appellant's injury. 3) The jury was asked to conclude on a balance of probabilities that the actions of the flagman who failed to immediately halt the competition and alert the Fire Department to the condition he observed, the appellant would have suffered less serious burns than he in fact suffered. 4) Had the case been permitted to go to the jury on the theory of the appellants, the damage would have occurred within minutes of the competition halted and the appellant, knowing he was covered in gasoline, remained in the vehicle for a period of time before it broke out."
e_2007skqb174.txt,"The respondent father applied by way of notice of motion to vary a custody judgment that provided for joint custody of the child with shared parenting according to a specified schedule. The grounds for the application were that the mother had failed to abide by the terms of the original judgment and had refused to provide the father with any information as to the location of herself and the child since the date of that judgment. The mother had left Saskatoon, taking the child with her and, subsequent to police involvement and several Court orders to assist in locating the child, was arrested on Canada-wide warrant in Edmonton, Alberta and charged pursuant to ss. 281(1) and 283 of the Criminal Code of Canada with child abduction and contravention of custody order. The applicant submitted that the mother had placed the child at risk of harm and accordingly it was in the best interests of the child that the father be granted sole custody. The applicant also requested an order providing only supervised access to the child by the mother. The father filed a further application seeking an order allowing him to relocate the child to Whitehorse, Yukon, for residential purposes. The mother opposed the father's application for relocation, and prayed that she be granted less restrictive access to the child. The issues were as follows. 1) Should the father be granted sole custody of the child? 2) Should the father be allowed to relocate with the child to Whitehorse, Yukon? 3) What access to the child should be granted to the mother? HELD: Application allowed. The father shall have the costs of the trial on party and party basis. 1) The starting point for the Court's review is whether the father has demonstrated material change in the circumstances affecting the child. The Court is satisfied that there has been a material change in the circumstances that existed at the time of the original custody judgment when it was thought that the cooperation of the parties necessary for joint custody was possible. As the mother has demonstrated it was not, review of the order to determine whether change in custody or access order is in the best interests of the child, having regard to all of the circumstances of this case. Based on the original findings and the evidence at trial that the father has cared well for the child, as well as the mother's conduct in attempting to avoid shared parenting, the Court is satisfied that it is in the child's best interests to grant sole custody to the father. 2) The evidence at trial confirmed the seven points that the father outlined in support of the proposed relocation to Whitehorse. In reviewing each of seven factors set out in the case law and considering the best interests of the child, the Court approves the father's plan to relocate to Whitehorse. 3) It is in the child's best interests to continue the mother's existing access arrangements with the child until the child moves with the father to Yukon, at which time the new access arrangements set out in this decision will apply. Detailed orders are issued accordingly.","The respondent applied by notice of motion dated June 26, 2006, to vary the judgment of Justice Foley. HELD: 1) There had not been a material change in the circumstances at the time of the original judgment when it was thought that the cooperation of the parties, which would be necessary for joint custody, was possible. 2) The mother failed to notify the father as to the child's whereabouts and prevented the father from exercising the shared parenting, which the Original Custody Judgment had ordered. 3) The father's evidence contradicted the mother's decision to move. 4) There was no evidence that the mother was unaware that the father had taken the child out of the Province of Saskatchewan and refused to provide the father with any information as to where the child was located. 5) The evidence at trial confirmed each of the seven points outlined by the father in support of the proposed relocation. 6) The respondent had not shown any significant change in his parenting skills, the strong bond he has forged between himself and his daughter despite the trying conditions, his fairness in recognizing and reiterating his belief that the child should have the advantage of exposure to both parents despite the unsubstantiated and indeed false allegations made against him by the mother. 7) The court reviewed each of Gordon v. Goertz, which that Court states should be considered and find. The court found that there was no material change. The respondent was granted sole custody of the child in June 2006 based upon the mother’s refusal to accept the parenting arrangement and her removal from Saskatchewan. The father was granted joint custody with shared parenting with the mother in December 2006. The mother was granted interim custody in March 2006. She was granted scheduled access in March 2007. In September 2006, the father filed a further application seeking an order allowing him to relocate with the child to Whitehorse, Yukon for residential purposes. The Court found that the respondent had demonstrated significant change of residence in Saskatchewan and that there had been material change between the mother and the father."
e_2007skqb179.txt,"Application for judicial review of a board of arbitration award that held the First Nations University of Canada had violated certain provisions of a collective agreement in force between the parties. The grievance alleged that the University had interfered with faculty member's academic freedom. The allegation concerned the withdrawal of an invitation to that faculty member to be the keynote speaker at National Symposium on Post Secondary Education Policy and Funding that was held on campus, although the University was not directly involved. After one of the chief organizers examined the faculty member's thesis and determined it would not provide suitable foundation for the symposium's keynote address, the invitation was withdrawn. The faculty member sought to have the decision reversed, and requested the University's Board of Governors' intervention. When the faculty member's request came up at one of the Board's meetings, one of its members made some inappropriate comments and expressed personal animus towards the faculty member. No decision was reached at that meeting. The respondent Board of Arbitration found that, in failing in his obligation to refrain from interfering in and to defend the academic freedom of a faculty member, the Board member's comportment amounted to a violation of the collective agreement by the employer. The applicant argued that the Board of Arbitration exceeded its jurisdiction by entertaining a grievance that did not involve parties to the collective agreement. Further, it argued that the Board of Arbitration made a determination of an issue not raised in the grievance, namely, a finding that there was a violation of academic freedom. HELD: The application is dismissed with costs. The Board of Arbitration found that the member of the University's Board of Governors' comportment at the meeting did not accord with the requirements of certain articles of the collective agreement. The reasons of the Board of Arbitration support that finding and the decision meets the reasonableness test. The fact that the member of the Board of Governors was acting in his capacity as Chair brought the issue within the purview of the collective agreement. The Court disagrees with the applicant's contention that the Board of Arbitration made a determination of an issue not raised in the grievance directly.","This was an application for judicial review of a Board of Arbitration Award which held that the First Nations University of Canada had violated certain provisions of a Collective Agreement in force between the parties. The applicant had received his Ph.D. degree from the University of Regina in 2004 and was involved in the University's Board of Governors decision to withdraw an invitation to the applicant to be the keynote speaker at the National Symposium on Post Secondary Education Policy and Funding which was held in mid-March 2005. At the time, the applicant was employed by the Federation as Director of Higher Learning and Research. In that capacity, she was instrumental in the planning and organization of the symposium and it was the Federation's decision to invite the applicant as a speaker that the applicant should not have been on the program. He brought the issue within the purview of the Agreement. HELD: The application was dismissed with costs. 1)The applicant failed in his obligation to refrain from interfering in and to defend the academic freedom of a faculty member. The Board made a clear finding of fact that the alleged breach of the Collective Agreement occurred while the respondent was acting in his capacity as Chair of the Federation and not as an officer. The Employer violated the collective agreement and we uphold the grievance in part. 2)The respondent's conduct at the board meeting did not comport with the requirements of Articles 2.1 and 2.2 of the collective Agreement. In my judgment, the reasons as a whole support that finding. The decision meets the reasonableness test. 3)The Applicant was disappointed at this turn of events and he sought to have the decision reversed. He sent a letter to the President of the First Nation University enquiring whether its Board of governors might be asked to intervene and request the Symposium's organizing committee to reconsider the matter of his presentation. The respondent appealed. He argued that the Board of Directors exceeded its jurisdiction by entertaining a grievance which did not involve parties to the Collective agreement. In his view, the board made a determination of an issue not raised in the grievance namely, a finding that there was a violation of academic freedom."
e_2008skqb192.txt,"FIAT: A previous interim order detailed specific access in the period leading up to pre-trial or trial, however more than a year has passed and the matter has not even been set down for pre-trial. The petitioner seeks to increase access to the two children of the relationship and an order to address holiday periods not covered in the previous order. HELD: There shall be no change in the previously ordered access schedule.  The Court found no change in the material circumstances that would warrant a change in the petitioner's regular access schedule. Because of the petitioner's work schedule, the increased access is unlikely to result in any meaningful time with the children. The holiday access requested was in the nature of an extrapolation of the previous order and the Court ordered holiday access in such a fashion as to continue that order.","FIAT: The petitioner seeks an order that would enable him to exercise increased access to the two young children born of his relationship with the respondent. HELD: 1) More than a year has passed and the matter has not even been set down for pre-trial. The purpose of interim orders is to establish a temporary parenting arrangement pending a trial or final resolution of the matter. In making interim orders, Courts try to disrupt the lives of the children as little as possible and adopt the status quo subject always to that arrangement being in the best interests of their children. The status quo in this case is represented by the verbal agreement which the parties entered into following their separation, that Mr. Gavelin would have the children during his week off from Saturday to Tuesday. Given the age and circumstances the petitioner would be laid off for two months in the spring. It is reasonable that, during this period, his contact with the children should be increased. Unfortunately, more than 1 year has gone by and there is no evidence of any material change in circumstances that would warrant a change in the petitioner's regular access.  2) This is the second time access issues have come before the Court. In February 2007 Ryan-Froslie J. issued a fiat that specified access for two weeks followed by one week off. For the period subsequent to April 10, she ordered that the petitioner have access. This is not so much in the nature of a variation as an extrapolation of the previous order.  3) The petitioner does not indicate that he will be laidoff this spring although, given that his employment has not changed, this will likely be the case. The fiat did not address access for the Christmas, 2007 period or the 2008 summer holiday period. With good reason."
e_2008skqb84.txt,"The appellant appeals his conviction for common assault under s. 266 of the Criminal Code on the basis that his non-lawyer agent, Richard Klassen, provided him with ineffective assistance resulting in a miscarriage of justice. HELD: The appeal is dismissed. 1) Klassen's lack of ability by itself is not a ground for determining that a miscarriage of justice occurred. There was no unfairness in the trial process. The appellant was entitled to have Klassen represent him. He made that decision freely based on information fully at hand that he consciously chose to rely on. There was no procedural unfairness to the appellant. He did not get the standard of representation that a competent lawyer could provide but that came as a result of the decisions he freely made. On appeal the appellant cannot rely on the fact that the standard of representation received was not equal to that of a competent lawyer. 2) The tactical decision to attack the credibility of the complainant through challenge to the audio tape was personally approved by the appellant. The appellant saw many lawyers in the assault case. He did not have confidence in them and pursued his original line of defence through Klassen. The Court cannot see a miscarriage of justice as a result of the tactics of the appellant and Klassen. The evidence at trial and the fresh evidence offered by the appellant's testimony and his affidavit to not establish a miscarriage of justice that may have occurred outside of the appellant's choice of agent, which is the test in R. v. Romanowicz (1999), 138 C.C.C. (3d) 225 (Ont. C.A.).","The appellant appeals his conviction for common assault under s. 266 of the Criminal Code on the grounds that his non-lawyer agent, Richard Klassen, provided him with ineffective assistance resulting in a miscarriage of justice. HELD: The appeal is dismissed. 1)There certainly was no procedural unfairness to the appellant as he did not get the standard of representation that a competent lawyer could provide, that came as a result of the decisions he freely made. The evidence at trial and the fresh evidence offered by Mr. Dubelt's counsel did not establish that a miscarriage had occurred outside of the trial judge's choice of agent, the test in Romanowicz. 2)The appellant did not have to call any witnesses to testify. The trial judge treated the appellant fairly and attempted to accommodate the unrepresented litigants' unfamiliarity with the process so as to permit them to present their case. The appeal was based on the fact that the appellant had chosen self-representation and did not seek the assistance of a lawyer agent at trial. The appellant's lawyer was advised by the appellant that he wished to testify and he did so. He did not provide copy of the report to Crown counsel as required by the Code. The Crown did not call witnesses or testify himself. 3)The appeal was dismissed on the basis that there were no procedural or procedural unfairnesses. The decision of the appellant was made freely based on information fully at hand that he consciously chose to rely on. There was no presumption as to the agent's competence at the time the appellant chose to represent himself. 4)The trial judge accepted the fact situation described by the complainant, and there is nothing in any of the evidence led either by the Crown or defence that he found to detract from her evidence. The Court of Appeal held that a person who chooses to be represented by an agent and not a lawyer has no constitutional right to competent representation. In this case, the appellant's decision to not testify on his own behalf was not based on a factual issue decided by the Court but rather on the knowledge he had made freely. The fact that neither police officer had anything to offer by way of evidence that would provide or assist in providing defence by the accused did not prevent the Court from allowing the expert to be qualified as such and give evidence on behalf of the accused."
e_2010skpc130.txt,"Defence sought an adjournment of a preliminary hearing to call a police accident reconstructionist as a witness. Prior to the commencement of the hearing, defence counsel was aware that the Crown did not intend to call this person as part of its case. One month prior to the preliminary hearing, defence counsel requested that the accident reconstructionist be made available as witness. The Crown advised defence that the officer was out of the country on peace keeping mission. The officer was expected back within months of the commencement of the preliminary hearing. HELD: The defence request for an adjournment was granted. The Court could not be satisfied that the officer was not a material witness to the preliminary inquiry. The Court was not satisfied that defence was guilty of neglect in failing to procure the officer's attendance when they had been advised by the Crown that he was out of the country. The length of the adjournment would not be lengthy.","The accused was charged with committing an offence under s.254(5) of the Criminal Code and, at the time of committing the offence, knew or ought to have known that his operation of the motor vehicle caused an accident resulting in bodily harm to another person. The Crown opposed the adjournment request. HELD: The accused was granted an adjournment to allow Defence Counsel to make the necessary arrangements to call Sergeant Barbar as a witness for the Defence in this preliminary inquiry. 1)There was a reasonable expectation that he could be called on the date and time to which it was sought to put off the trial. 2)The Defence was not guilty of neglect in procuring the attendance of Sergeant Barbar. He was present at the accident scene and took measurements, made notes and calculations done by Sergeant Barbar, an accident reconstructionist with the Saskatoon Police Service as well as eight pages of Crash Data Retrieval Information. The Defence was negligent in not taking the time to issue and serve subpoena on him once he returned from Afghanistan. 3)It is not certain that Sergeant Barbar is not a material witness in the preliminary inquiry because the Crown did not call him. The evidence adduced at preliminary inquiry does not reflect the whole of the evidence which will be presented at trial nor does it reflect the Crown's discretion to present only enough evidence to establish a prima facie case."

HELD: 1) The Court declined to vary the interim access order and ordered the matter to trial. 2) The respondent is intentionally under-employed and the Court imputed annual income to him of $130,294 and child support was varied accordingly. Section 7 childcare expenses are to be shared pro rata. 3) The Court declined to order interim spousal support as the Court was not satisfied that the respondent had the existing ability to pay it. 4) The issues regarding retroactive child support, ongoing child support, access and spousal support were directed to pre-trial conference. 5) Costs of $1,500 were awarded to the petitioner and payable no later than May 31, 2011.","This is a review of the issues of parenting and support as directed by the interim order of August 18, 2010.

The respondent must immediately obtain employment and work to his earning potential. The issues of the respondent's income and the petitioner's entitlement to spousal support were also adjourned for review. 2) Considering the existing means and needs of the parties, I decline to order interim spousals since I am not satisfied that the respondent has the existing ability to pay it. However, the respondent must first obtain employment. The parties shall share child care expenses of $4,380 annually in proportion to their respective incomes, pursuant to s. 7 of the Guidelines. The annual income of the petitioner to be $19,500. The petitioner is to be paid retroactive to September 1, 2010, share of the annual childcare expenses, $4.380 per month, and $1,500 per month for the two children under s. 3 of the guidelines. 3) The respondent had no income when the child support order was made in 2006 requiring him to pay $500 monthly child support. He has 14 years of experience working on the pipelines. 4) The court was not persuaded on this review that it was in the best interests of the children to change interim access orders made last August or by restricting it. Those questions are best left for trial where full and complete evidence and issues of credibility can be considered and adjudicated. Costs are awarded to the petitioner, payable no later than May 31."
e_2014skpc35.txt,"The Crown found the accused not guilty. With respect to the issue of identification, it held that the officer was empowered by s. 209.1(2)(a) of The Traffic Safety Act to require an operator of a motor vehicle to provide his name and address. The accused had admitted that the statement given was voluntary. Although there had been no identification in Court, the officer had seen the accused operating a motor vehicle and had properly obtained his name and date of birth. That person was arrested and released on an appearance notice. Counsel for the accused appeared on the scheduled date and entered a guilty plea and then appeared on the trial date and the accused was noted as present. All of these facts constituted prima facie proof of identity. Regarding the other issues, the Court held that notice under s. 260(6) of the Code can be given to counsel of record without proof that counsel consented to the receipt of such notice. However, the Crown had not established that proper notice was given either to the accused or his counsel as required by s. 260(5), either by way of viva voce or affidavit evidence from the person effecting service or an admission of counsel. Without such compliance with s. 260(6), the certificate was not admissible in evidence. There was no other evidence of disqualification and no evidence as to the nature of the disqualification on which the Court could conclude that a s. 259 offence had been committed.","The accused was charged with driving while disqualified contrary to s. 259(4) of the Criminal Code. HELD: The accused was found not guilty. 1)Although there was no identification of the accused in court, the officer clearly empowered s. 209.1(2)(a) of The Traffic Safety Act to require the operator of a motor vehicle to provide his name and date of birth and the voluntariness of statements made by the accused were not in issue. The officer was clearly empowered by s.(209.1)(2) of s. s. c. T-18.1 to require this operator to supply his name, address and phone number. The Certificate of Disqualification or Prohibition was not admissible in evidence. The accused admitted knowledge of his disqualification for driving and the dates on which he might become eligible to obtain a driver's licence. The Court had no doubt whatsoever that the Tyler Hoover named on the Appearance Notice was the same person who had stood trial. 2)The Court was referred by counsel for the accused to the following authorities: R. v. Nicholson (1984), 12 C.C. (3d) 228 (Alta. C.A.) (Sask. Q.B.). The Court was awarded leave to appeal to the SCC. The court found that an in-court identification was not necessary; it was sufficient that the individual with whom the police officer dealt had surrendered to the Court as demonstrated through an Appearance Notice. 3)The Crown failed to establish that the accused was disqualified or prohibited from driving and therefore, the accused is acquitted."
e_2017skqb99.txt,"HELD: The application was allowed in part and the balance of images found on the computer were excluded from the evidence at trial pursuant to s. 24(2) of the Charter. The court found that the evidence found through temporary Internet sites was admissible. The reason for obtaining the warrant was apparently abandoned by the police at the beginning of the search of the computer. The police had no authority to search the computer generally. They were only authorized to look at the Internet history. The search of the non-Internet history was a serious infringement of the accused’s s. 8 Charter right. The temporary files created as a result of the visits on the Internet was evidence of Internet history, and because of this connection, this evidence was not excluded.","The accused applied to exclude certain evidence discovered by the police during the execution of the search of his computer and cellular phone. The initial determination of whether there had been a violation of the accused's s. Charter rights occurred by the judgment of January 3, 2017. The issue of exclusion of evidence pursuant to s. 24(2) of the Charter was not determined at that time. HELD: The accused's application was dismissed. 1)The court found that the accused had obtained a search warrant which authorized search of the defendant's computer. 2)The presence of this potential corroboration evidence obviated the need for the search history information. 3)The accused sought to exclude all of the images of child pornography located on his computer. In the alternative, the accused seeks to exclude those images not automatically cached by web browser during an internet search. 4)The Court found that, having regard to all the circumstances, the admission of the evidence would bring the administration of justice into disrepute."
