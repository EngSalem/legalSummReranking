3_2003skqb93.txt,"The company applied for an order granting court approval of a proposal made by its creditor pursuant to Part III of the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act. A former 28-year employee objected on the grounds pension plan members should be treated as a different class of creditor rather than under the unsecured creditor classification ascribed to them by the proposal; the indemnification of past directors under the terms of the proposal was inappropriately wide. He submitted the unfunded pension liabilities constitute trust funds pursuant to provincial pension legislation (the Pension Benefits Act s.43(3)) and as such the pension fund claimants are entitled to preferred or secured creditor status. HELD: The Proposal was accepted.  1)Provincially created statutory trusts such as the one created by the Pensions Benefits Act are not recognized in bankruptcy including Proposals submitted under the BIA. The Trustee and the company acted appropriately in identifying the nature and status of the pensioners' claims. Although it might have reflected the status of his claim against the employer outside the BIA, the specific objection did not constitute a valid ground of legal objection to the Proposal. 2)The Proposal met the statutory and judicial criteria for acceptance by the Court. The Court takes into account the interests of the debtor, general body of creditors and the public at large in maintaining the integrity of the bankruptcy legislation. Of the 15 employees in the same position, 12 voted in favour of the proposal, 2 failed to file proofs of their claims; 89 percent of all creditors voted in favour of acceptance.  3)Each party was to assume their own costs of the hearing.","The applicant company applied for an order granting court approval of a proposal made by it to its creditor (the 'W.R.T. Proposal'), pursuant to Part III of Division I of the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act. The applicant company and the Trustee accepted that the terms of the indemnity set out in the Proposal with respect to present and past officers and directors was too widely cast and inappropriate. At the December meeting of creditors, approximately 93 percent of the creditors who had proven claims voted in favour of accepting the proposal. The Trustee made an application to the Registrar in bankruptcy for Court approval of the applicant's proposal. Notice of Objection to the application was filed on behalf of an unsecured creditor who was a former 28-year employee of the Company. He requested that the proposal be referred to a judge for court approval. The proposed amended para. 9.1 of the proposed proposed was consistent with the provisions of ss. 50(13) and s.50(2) of the Act as judicially interpreted. At present 89 percent of all creditors have reached the same apparent conclusion. HELD: Taking into account all of the interests the Court concluded the proposed amended proposal did meet the statutory and judicial criteria for acceptance by the Court. The proposal was therefore accepted and the draft order filed may issue including the amendment to para. 8.1. The unfunded pension liabilities constitute trust funds pursuant to provincial pensions legislation (s.43(3) of The Pension Benefits Act, 1992). As such the pension fund claimants are entitled to preferred or secured creditor status and this should be recognized."
1997canlii9869.txt,"The appellant was convicted of failing a breathalyzer test. The trial judge concluded on the evidence that the blood alcohol level at the time of the offence was different from the time of the offence, and found that the Crown could not rely on the presumption of identity. He ruled, however, that they could rely on the presumption of accuracy, and placed an onus on the appellant to raise a reasonable doubt on the whole of the evidence. The appellant appealed. Allowing the appeal and ordering a new trial, that the trial judge committed a fundamental error of law by ruling that when the Crown is forced to rely on the balance of the evidence, the accused must raise a reasonable doubt, a burden that clearly remains on the Crown.","This was an application for leave to appeal from a decision in the Supreme Court of Canada dismissing an appeal from the appellant's conviction under s. 253(b) of the Criminal Code. The Crown adduced breathalyzer readings of 110 and 120 milligrams. The appellant testified that he consumed five pints of beer during the course of the afternoon, the last shortly before being stopped by the police. In cross-examination, the expert was asked to relate the readings shown by the tests to the alcohol consumed by the appellant. He stated that the readings were not consistent with the evidence of consumption given by the accused. The trial judge concluded that the appellant had not raised a reasonable doubt on the whole of the evidence. The appeal was allowed and a new trial ordered."
c_2009skpc31.txt,"The accused, Chisum Log Homes and its sole director Gary Varga, are charged with operating a processing facility without a licence contrary to s. 18.1(1) of The Forest Resources Management Act. The accused corporation assembles log home packages. The packages are sold to customers across Canada. The accused corporation buys wood from area operators such as L&amp;M to be used in its packages. L&amp;M through its contractor P&amp;E, harvest wood from the forest and sell the wood to pulp mills, saw mills and other customers such as the accused. These area operators and their contractors have Forest Management Agreements and Forest Product Processing Facility Licences. In August and September 2007, the area operator L&amp;M delivered logs to the accused. The accused took additional steps to prepare the logs for inclusion in their log home packages which they sold. The accused does not have a Forest Product Processing Facility Licence. The issue in this case is whether the Crown has shown that the accused requires such a licence. HELD: 1) The definition of 'manufacture' in the Act is extremely broad as it says, 'means any step taken'. Given this definition is not difficult to find based on the evidence presented that the steps taken by the contractor in cutting the logs is more than simply harvesting as it is defined in the legislation. See R. v. Provincial Forest Products, 2000 SKQB 371. 2) The Court is satisfied that the accused corporation, Chisum, took steps to manufacture the forest product for the log home market. Steps such as debarking were steps taken in the manufacture of a forest product for market.  3) Given the wide definition it is the Court's view that many facilities, including a retail lumberyard, could be captured within the definition. Given the stated purpose of the Act, it is appropriate that the requirement for a Processing Facility Licence be restricted so that it does not apply to every entity that manufactures a forest product. 4) The processes Chisum is involved in encompass the substantial conversion of the forest product into logs to be used in the log home industry. The process is not insignificant, nor is it a process which is removed from the sustainable use of forest lands and the need to maintain and enhance the health of forest lands. The Court concludes that Chisum was required to have a Processing Facility Licence. 5) Pursuant to s. 81 of the Act, Gary Varga, as President of Chisum, is also guilty of violating s. 18.1 of the Act.","The defendant, Chisum Log Homes and Lumber Ltd., was charged with operating a processing facility without a licence contrary to s. 18.1(1) of The Forest Resources Management Act, F-19.1. The defendant was the President and sole Director of the company. The company assembles log home packages in the Weyakwin district north of Prince Albert. These packages are sold to customers across Canada and around the world. The defendants suggest that once forest product is harvested and the dues and fees paid, they are no longer forest products and are thus no longer governed by provincial legislation. HELD: 1) The definition of “manufacture” in the Act is extremely broad as it says “any step taken”. Given this definition it is not difficult to find based on the evidence presented that the steps taken by the president and sole director that included cutting the logs were specifically taken to prepare them for the log home market. These steps may not be significant but the process utilized by the company is more than simply harvesting as it is defined in the legislation. The creation of a chisum log is processing and must require a Forestry Product Processing Facility Licence. The process detailed in P-1 encompassed the substantial conversion of the forest product into logs to be used in the loghome industry. 2) The accused were found guilty of violating the Act by failing to obtain a processing licence. The requirement for processing facility licence was restricted so that it did not apply to every entity that manufactures forest product. The nature of the business as noted in the corporate registry is logging, manufacturing building products. There is a two tiered system of processing facilities, those that process product originating from Crown Forest Land and those that only process product from private land. 3) The Court of Queen’s Bench decision in R. v. Provincial Forest Products established that the defendant was in the manufacture of forest products within the meaning of the Act. The fact that the accused met their obligations under the Act did not create an absurdity in that: one, it would require any manufacturer, at any point in the market chain, to obtain processing licence for any processing of product that had as its point of origin, Crown forest Land; and two, it creates a two-tiered system. The accused did not have a processing license."
d_2001nssc85.txt,"The applicant was aware that allegations of abuse had been made against him in an alternative dispute resolution process undertaken by the Province with respect to his former employment. He applied under the Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy Act for certain information concerning these allegations. The FOIPOP Privacy Coordinator denied access and the applicant appealed. Appeal allowed; in all cases where the claimants had signed release forms the applicant is to be supplied with information as to the number and nature of allegations made against him and the names of the complainants; the specific dates and times of all allegations made against him; the evidence collected in relation to the investigations undertaken as a result of the allegations; the number and dollar amount of payouts made for actions attributable only to the applicant; and information as to whether any of the allegations leveled were dismissed or unproven. The appeal should proceed as an appeal de novo. The applicant was not seeking information from R.C.M.P. files and the release of information which the police had passed on to the Department of Justice would not harm law enforcement as the information was compiled by the Province for its own purposes. The complainants had been required to execute releases whereby the information supplied could be used for various specified purposes, all of which potentially involved public disclosure or disclosure to the applicant. Law enforcement protection was lost when a release was obtained from the complainants and the information was passed to the Province. There was no unreasonable invasion of the claimants' privacy. The applicant was entitled to know what he had been accused of and should have the right to correct the record.","The appellant had made an application pursuant to the provisions of the Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy Act (FIOPA) for information about the various provincially operated institutions for youth correction and protection. At the beginning of the investigation, the respondent was given certain 'can say' statements by former residents of the institutions which outlined allegations of institutional abuse. The respondent was advised that the allegations were completely and totally false. He was also given assurances that his statements would not be circulated elsewhere without his permission. He appealed the denial of the information requested. Throughout the entire ADR process, the appellant had been aware of the allegations and was aware that the respondent had been involved in a number of investigations. The extent of the abuse was known to the Department of Justice, the RCMP and others who had investigated the alleged abuse were public knowledge. In some cases, the allegations had been proven so that the public would be able to learn about the alleged abusers through information provided to them by the public. The denial of access to the appellant's information was grounds for a review by the Nova Scotia Attorney General under the FIOPA. The AG had refused to grant the appellant an opportunity to appeal pursuant to s. 41(1) of the Act. In other instances, the AG had resisted disclosure by the appellant. The degree to which the various roles of the R.C.M.P. and Department of Community Service and the ADR Program became meshed and interchangeable is clearly set forth in paras. 11-33 of the affidavit of Inspector Atkins. In the course of the inquiry, the applicant was given specific information about his background, work and employment history. The information sought was based on statements made by the respondent that he had received as a result of the Stratton Inquiry and the subsequent Validation Investigation Unit (VIU) investigation. The latter was a review officer appointed under the Act to investigate allegations of abuse in these institutions. The former chief supervisor of the school for boys, who had been in the position of supervisor at the time of the publication of the report, had been intimately involved in the investigation and was intimately familiar with the various investigations going on at the institution. The resulting hostility between the respondent's investigators and the Justice Department resulted in a potential conflict between the undertakings of confidentiality originally extended by the ADVU and those of the VIU. This resulted in the applicant being denied access to some of the important information requested by the Department. The administration of the Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) declined to comment on the application for comment. The"

The failure of the tenant to maintain the floor caused approximately 25 percent of the damage to the floor. The estimated span for the flooring was 20 years. As the lease was in good standing at present and would expire in 2018, the age of the floor at that time would be 17 years. The Court awarded to the landlord the amount of $836, which was 25 percent of 3/20 of the damages claimed. The business loss claimed by the tenant was $4,800. Thus the net setoff owing by the landlord to the tenant was $4,800 less $836. The defendant tenant was awarded costs of the three-day trial of $2,500.","The plaintiff landlord claims damages against its tenant, the defendant, asserting negligence by failing to clean, wax and polish the vinyl tile floor in the building, thereby permitting moisture to penetrate between and underneath the tiles resulting in lifting and cracking. The tenant alleges that the landlord interfered with the sale of its restaurant. HELD: The tenant is awarded judgment against the landlord in the amount of $6,464. The damage to the floor is $22,281 and the tenant is contributorily negligent to the extent of 25% of the damage. Leaking of water through the ceiling, sagging ceiling tiles, and deterioration of the vinyl floor tiles could be attributed to poor maintenance of polish and waxing. The floor has a lifespan of 20 years if regularly maintained by polishing, waxing and polishing. Moisture entering the building from the roof and outside walls are 5 times in excess of standard reading for normal building samples and are due to the negligence of the tenant in failing to properly maintain the floor."

HELD: The application was dismissed in its entirety with taxed costs to SAPLN.  1)No order for further particulars was made at this time. The Hearing Notice particularizes the factual allegations and is specific as to time and their nature. 2)The only matter previously considered by the discipline committee dealt with whether there was any professional misconduct established arising out of criminal convictions for illegal picketing prior to the applicant becoming a member of SALPN. 3)The Act provides an adequate alternate remedy, which should be pursued. There were no special circumstances upon which the court could exercise its discretion to determine the merits of this application or to provide the relief sought.","The applicant seeks an order declaring the charges cannot be professional misconduct without contravening provisions of The Saskatchewan Charter and The Saskatchewan Human Rights Code and an order of prohibition to prohibit the discipline committee from hearing the charges. HELD: 1) The applicant is a member of the Association and is charged with professional misconduct contrary to s. 24 of The Licensed Practical Nurses Act. The Act provides an elaborate and detailed complaints investigation and discipline process, with access to the courts through rights of appeal for the member being disciplined. The statements referred to are incorrect and he knew or should have known them to be incorrect. He shouted at patients or potential patients of the health care facility that they were 'fornicators' and showed people pictures of aborted fetuses. He took photographs of the demonstration which were seen by the public and potential patients. He also displayed signs that said Planned Parenthood would give you Aids, that were printed with words to the effect Planned Parenthood, and 'Don't let Planned Parenthood corrupt you' and 'Planned Parenthood murders innocent babies'. These facts supported the conclusion that the applicant was guilty of professional misconduct and constituted professional misconduct within the meaning of the Act.  2) The SAPLN takes the position that the Court should not entertain the application where there is a convenient alternative remedy available. The procedure on appeal, the composition of the senate committee, its powers and the manner in which they were exercised were probably to be exercised by a body which was not a professional court of appeal and was not bound to act exactly as one nor likely to do so. 3) Costs are awarded to the applicant in the amount of $16,000.00."

The applicant applied for an order varying the support provisions of a 1989 judgment. He sought an order requiring a total payment of $570.75 per month for the two children of the marriage. The respondent wife had moved out of the province and was working full time. An agreement was reached in 1989 in accordance with paragraph 2(c) of the 1989 judgment reducing maintenance from $1,200 per month to $500 per month.

b_2000skqb420.txt,"FIAT. An application for summary judgment under Part Forty. In issue was whether a solicitor is bound by an undertaking to protect an expert witness for its professional fees. The defendant solicitor, who represented several farmers and farming companies in suits brought against Saskatchewan Crop Insurance Corporation on a contingency fee basis, confirmed in writing in 1993 that his office would undertake to protect the plaintiff consultants for their fees and disbursements and to pay interest at a rate of 12% per annum. The plaintiff was hired to provide technical evidence as to crop losses and damages the farmers claimed as a result of actions of SCIC. When all of the claims were dismissed at trial, the solicitor rejected the plaintiff's demand for payment arguing he had no obligation to pay as the farmers' actions had not resulted in the recovery of any monies. The plaintiff sued the solicitor in 1997 for professional fees of $37,604.33. The plaintiff objected to certain portions of the defendant's affidavit. HELD: The plaintiff was awarded $37,604.33 plus interest at 12% per annum as provided for in the undertaking, and costs of the action.  1)The plaintiff commenced its action under the general rules but amended its claim without objection to continue under the Simplified Procedure. 2)Portions of the defendant's affidavit were struck as being hearsay and opinion or related to matters immaterial to the proceeding.  3)The applicant's admissions at discovery did not confirm the interpretation of the undertaking set out in the statement of defence. It was obvious the plaintiff's officer recognized the farmers were intending to fund their costs from a settlement or judgment and that disbursements, including the costs of any expert's reports commissioned by them or the defendant, would be paid by his clients regardless of the outcome of the suits. 4)The only conclusion that could be drawn was that defendant guaranteed payment of the applicant's account regardless of the outcome of their mutual client's actions. A solicitor is presumed to know the cannons of the Law Society including c.XVI, comm.10 of the Code of Professional Conduct with respect to undertakings. The solicitor's undertaking in 1993 was absolutely clear. The addition of the word 'protect' put the question beyond doubt. His inquiry in 1997 made it clear the defendant recognized his responsibility and was hoping for some resolution of the applicant's account.","FIAT. The defendant represented several farmers and farming companies in suits brought against the Saskatchewan Crop Insurance Corporation (SCIC). The plaintiff was hired to provide technical evidence as to crop losses and damages the farmers claimed resulted from the actions of SCIC. The plaintiff's officer was employed by the farmers on a contingency basis, the understanding being that the clients would pay the defendant's disbursements in any event. HELD: The court was required to hear both parties in this action on evidence in chief and under cross examination. The portions of the affidavit that were not evidence were not used as evidence but relate to matters immaterial to the proceeding. The only conclusion that can be drawn from the facts is that the respondent guaranteed the payment of the applicant's account regardless of the outcome of their mutual client's actions. The court had sympathy for the respondent but he is presumed to know the canons of the Law Society. A great deal of attention has been focused on solicitors' undertakings over the past decade as evidenced by the frequent reports of breaches which appear in the reports of the Discipline Committee of the Society. In one sense, an undertaking given to a layperson is to be viewed in an even more critical light as that person does not have the training and experience to understand the nuances of legal language."

The respondent bore the larger share of the responsibility for breakdown in communication and ultimate inability of the parties to show more flexibility. Both parents were very good parents. Although they could not demonstrate an ability to co-parent more effectively, the petitioner was prepared in the initial stages to be more flexible than the respondent and prepared to promote maximum contact.

It was accepted that the parties could not communicate effectively with each other. 4) The petitioner's access went beyond the minimum required by the interim order. There were times when the respondent would not be able to work on his day off. 5) The child was cared for during the day by the paternal grandparents on Tuesday and Thursday of each week.  6) The parties were to agree by June of each year on the division of the summer holiday period that the children should have as much contact with each spouse as is consistent with their best interests and that the willingness of the person for whom custody is sought to facilitate such contact would be appreciated.

The plaintiff discovered that one of the defendants had shares being held at the defendants' solicitor's office and instructions were given to the sheriff to seize and sell the shares. The sheriff attended to seize the shares but the defendants' lawyer objected. At issue was whether the legal office could refuse to hand over the shares to the sheriff pursuant to a solicitor's lien and whether the shares were exempt from seizure pursuant to the Saskatchewan Farm Security Act.

There was no evidence to determine the amount owing from the defendant or the third corporation for legal work; a valid solicitor's lien was not demonstrated. 2) There is a difference between the seizure and sale of shares in a company and the seizure and sale of a piece of farmland and the argument that the Executions Act or the Saskatchewan Farm Security Act restricts the seizure fails.,"FIAT: The applicant seeks an order from the court requiring the legal office of the Judicial Centre to produce to the sheriff of Prince Albert, the shares owned by Jensen in Jen-Sim Cattle Co.

The judgment in pursuance of the judgment was granted to the defendant law firm that had performed legal services on behalf of the defendant and himself for approximately the last 10 years. They cannot be subsumed to the company and thus become liable to a solicitor's lien as being part of the records of the company. The defendant has no rights greater than those of the client vis-à-vis the solicitor. The claim for lien is not made out.  1) Given the totality of the evidence before me, the general rule that a solicitor has a lien can be raised against all persons claiming through the client must be qualified by consideration of whom the rights accruing from the lien are claimed. 2) The solicitor has no better right to retain documents than his client would have if still in possession of them.  3) The court was unable to enforce the writ issued due to the defendants' actions."
c_2002nssc30.txt,"The borrower in a mortgage foreclosure action counterclaimed against the lender and joined the insurer of the mortgage and experts he had retained for advice in the development on the basis of negligent misrepresentation. During discovery of the borrower's former solicitor it was revealed that the solicitor may have given the borrower a warning that the financing arranged was inadequate. No privilege was claimed during the discovery process. The defendant brought an application for production of the solicitor's files and a copy of the borrower's employer and bank records intended to show his familiarity with business and financial affairs. Application allowed in part; solicitor's files with respect to terms of solicitor's retainer and non-legal advice or services are to be produced; employer's and banker's records not to be produced. The claim of negligent misrepresentation raised the question of reliance; evidence of knowledge would go to the borrower's state of mind and the solicitor's warning, if timely, would be relevant. The conduct of the borrower's present counsel in making no objection at the discovery amounted to waiver. There were no special circumstances existing with respect to the employer's and bank's records; the applicant made no effort to obtain the records until too late and the documents would have little, if any, relevance.","The plaintiff was a party to a mortgage foreclosure commenced against the defendants. The plaintiff sought to insure the mortgage with the defendant's mortgage insurance through its mortgage insurance program and retained the services of a Kentville lawyer. The mortgage fell into arrears during construction of the complex. The defendants made an application for further disclosure, which was ordered to be completed by October 31, 2001. At issue was whether the defendants had waived their fiduciary duty by interposing the affirmative defence of good faith reliance on the government's regulations and communications. HELD: The plaintiff was granted leave to make further disclosure.  1)It was clear in the circumstances that the defendant knew of the privilege as it had been expressly addressed prior to the discovery and then by attending the discovery, in the absence of objection, evinced an intention to partially waive it.  2)The documents sought were found to be incomplete. 3)The plaintiff objected to the reliance upon by the defendants on the plaintiff's evidence. 4)Although there was no established distinction between a solicitor and client privilege in the United States and Canada, the fairness test may be interpreted as meaning that solicitor-client privilege is waived whenever the communications between the solicitor and the client are legitimately brought in issue in the course of the litigation. 5)In this factual situation, a waiver may be reasonably inferred.  6)Civil Procedure Rule 20.06 was enacted in the U.S. following Bell v. Smith, 1986 CanLII 17 (S.C.R.); 7)The Supreme Court of Canada has concluded that a party waives the protection of the Attorney General's privilege when it voluntarily injects into a suit the question of state of mind. Such a party would not be induced to take certain steps in reliance upon the advice of a solicitor on legal matters. The proper waiver would be for the examination to proceed on a question-by-question basis and to specific objections by the plaintiff."
b_2012skca3.txt,"The appellants appealed the order of a Queen's Bench chamber's judge striking out portions of the statement of defence and counter-claim. HELD: The chamber's judge was in error in striking out portions of the statement of defence and counter-claim. The error consists of a failure to address the merits of the application. The Court of Appeal opted to deal with the merits of the application themselves, rather than remitting the matter back to Queen's Bench. While the allegation of fraud might have been pleaded more explicitly, the pleading is nevertheless sufficient to answer the requirements of QB Rule 173. The appellants should have been given an opportunity to amend their pleadings. The appeal was allowed and the application to strike was dismissed without prejudice to respondent's right to seek further particulars.","Fulltext of judgment follows: [1] The order made by the chamber judge striking major portions of the statement of defence and counterclaim was made in error. The error consists of a failure to address the merits of the application brought by the applicant to strike the impugned portions of these pleadings. Having come to this conclusion, we are left to either set aside the order and remit the application to the Court of Queen's Bench for appropriate disposition or to address further cost and delay we have decided to do the latter. [2] Turning to the merits, we note that the principal question is whether the imputed allegations in the statement have met the requirements of Queen’s Bench Rules, particularly in relation to the allegations of fraud. But without at least giving Carry the Kettle First Nation the opportunity to amend its pleadings in these respects so as to be more specific, the allegations cannot fairly be struck out as not answering to the requirement of Rule 149, albeit barely so perhaps. [4] It is always open to Ms Thompson to apply to the court for an order requiring her to provide further and better particulars should she find herself in the position of not knowing with sufficient certainty of the case she will meet in the respects under consideration.

Even if the respondent's conduct constituted a breach of the clause of the contract prohibiting him from soliciting the customers of the appellant, the appellant failed to prove any loss attributable to the breach. The appellant's loss consisted of its inability to continue to obtain Mato products and sell them to its customers at a profit. This loss stemmed from the termination of its distributorship agreement with Mato, not from anything the respondent did.

The requested relief cannot be granted unless the court has authority to order that a subdivision of land be effected outside the requirements of The Planning and Development Act. HELD: 1) Even if this was a proper case for the making of a vesting order, there is a further difficulty presented by the fact that the applicant school division is asking the court to order that a subdivision be effected, as a pre-condition to the vesting order. Whether under the former legislation or the present, the court is not free to subvert the statutory requirements in the exercise of its authority to make vesting orders. The court reviewed the relevant caselaw. 2) While the court is precluded from directing the Registrar to effect a subdivision that is prohibited by the legislation, a resolution of the matter could be achieved if, for example, after adjudicating on all the rights and obligations at issue, the Court was prepared to direct that the pre-conditions to subdivision approval be met by a party to the proceedings. Once the proposed subdivision meets the required standards and is approved, then a vesting order can be made in the appropriate circumstances under the provisions of s. 6.5 of The Land Titles Conversion Facilitation Regulations, or under The Improvements Under Mistake of Title Act. The court reviewed the applicable caselaw. 3) The court requested that further written submissions be provided by the parties on the matter of directing a trial of the issues.","FIAT: The applicant school division asks for a vesting order regarding a presently unsubdivided parcel of land owned by the respondent. The applicant asks for an order directing the Registrar of Titles to register the Plan of Proposed Subdivision with respect to Parcel G and to issue a Transform Approval Certificate. The requested relief cannot be provided unless the Court has authority to order a subdivision of land outside the requirements of the Planning and Development Act, 1983. HELD: The application is granted. The matter is directed to the Court of Appeal. 1) There are some distinguishing features. The original transaction between the School Division and the Flads was not concluded in an effort to avoid compliance with subdivision regulations, rather it was made in the mistaken belief that an already subdivided parcel was being transferred. The Court was obliged to prevent such wholesale frustration of the legislature's objects. 2) While the Court is not free to subvert the statutory requirements in the exercise of its authority to make vesting orders, the Court was able to direct the trial of an issue where the facts are not in dispute (ie. there is no question of the right of the applicant with no reservation of his rights) and resolution of the matter could be achieved in minutes or hours. 3) The application for a writ of mandamus was granted on the facts of the case but after a full hearing at trial as opposed to the summary fashion in which the order was requested in the present case. The parties should have an opportunity to make submissions as to the framing of the issues, who will bear the burden of proof in the issues as framed and what procedures should be followed."

The petitioner had previously been ordered to pay $1,000 in costs to the respondent but instead paid the $1,000 directly into the child's credit card balance and there was no evidence that this was done by mutual agreement between the parties. The child was not performing well in her program with no explanation for her poor performance. HELD The burden is on the petitioner to prove the adult child's ongoing economic dependence. Although the child is a child within the meaning of the Divorce Act during the time she was attending classes, her expenses are excessive. The child provided no evidence to rebut the respondent's information that she did not attend many of her classes. The child must take greater responsibility for her own expenses and debts if she does not apply herself to her studies. The respondent was ordered to match the amount paid by the petitioner towards the child's expenses.

The amount paid by the applicant to the respondent was $7,500.00. The respondent's application was returned to the chambers list in November 2010 and adjourned to be argued in December 2010. 2) The court reviewed the various factors set out in the Federal Child Support Guidelines and found that the respondent must take greater responsibility for her own expenses and debts if she did not apply herself to her studies. It was the view of the court that an application of clause 3(2)(b) having regard to the actual means and needs of the respondent and the financial ability of each parent to contribute to her support be considered.

Since the defendant was an uninsured motorist, the Facility Association defended the plaintiff's action against him; however, the plaintiff also brought an action against the insurer of a motor vehicle policy under which the deceased was insured. At issue was whether the Section D provisions of the deceased's insurance policy extended to cover the plaintiff. The deceased's insurance policy does not provide coverage to the plaintiff as the emotional harm suffered by her was simply too remote from the obligations contemplated by the contracting parties.","The plaintiff, a cousin of the deceased, was killed when her car was struck from behind by an uninsured motorist. She commenced this action to recover damages for nervous shock from the driver. Since the driver was an insured person at the time of the accident, the plaintiff was not entitled to recover any damages herself. The Court found that such a claim was not the result.

The allegation was that the appellant placed a second mortgage on a property owned by the company without the Gordon's knowledge or consent. Gorbin's shareholder's resolutions and banking resolutions required the signatures of both Gordon and the appellant on legal documents and cheques. The applicant first became aware of the mortgage in 1982 when it was foreclosed upon. In August 1995 the appellant initiated this action against the respondent banks.

HELD: It is in the interest of justice to order an assessment. The bills were issued in two separate matters. In the first matter, the final bill was rendered and the applicant had a lengthy opportunity to raise the issue. There will be no extension of time for the first bill. The second bill is different in that the applicant disputed the amount of the bill when he first received it. He was advised that the bill would be adjusted. An initial adjustment was made and when still not satisfied, ongoing discussions about the bill continued.

b_2011nsca39.txt,"The police responded to a call from a woman identified as the defendant's girlfriend's mother to the effect that her daughter was being abused. Initially unable to locate the residence, they spoke to the girlfriend on the phone, who advised them that she was fine and did not require the police. They nevertheless continued to the residence, where they heard a scream from inside. Knowing that the defendant was a suspected drug dealer and potentially violent, they demanded entry into the home. The daughter opened the door and told them everything was fine, there had been no assault and she had simply wanted a ride home. From where they entered, the officers could see a person lying down in the bedroom. They approached the man, searched him for officer safety and then conducted a warrantless search to locate any other occupants. During the search, certain items were noted that caused them to obtain a search warrant, following which drugs were found. The defendant's argument that the search was illegal was unsuccessful as the court found that, in these particular circumstances, the police had a responsibility to enter the home without a warrant, do a pat down search of the accused and search for other occupants. Once drugs were seen in plain view, they proceeded to obtain a search warrant. Judicial notice was taken of the fact that complainants in domestic situations often recant due to threats of coercion by their partners. The defendant appealed. Appeal allowed; conviction set aside; although a violation of the defendant's Charter rights had occurred, the record was insufficient for this court to engage in a s. 24(2) analysis. Although it was reasonable, in the circumstances, for the police to search for the girl, go to the defendant's home and not simply leave once she told them she was fine, the trial judge erred in failing to consider alternatives short of police entry (such as conferring with the girl after they had her step outside and close the door) and the search of the home, without a warrant. Police authority to investigate such a call includes locating the alleged victim and determining if their assistance is required, but, without more, does not extend to the entry or search of the premises.","The accused appealed his conviction for breach of s. 8 of the Charter by the police entry and search of his home without a warrant. The accused argued that the police were acting in the execution of their duty to protect life and prevent injury when they forcibly entered the home in response to a disconnected 911 call. He alleged that the call to the police was not a 911 call, nor was it a distress call, but rather a call by an alleged victim or from the accused's residence. Allowing the appeal and setting aside the conviction, that the trial judge erred in law in determining the police's authority to enter a residence, whether invited or not, and in searching to ensure that there were no other occupants. The evidence found as result of the searches was excluded pursuant to s. 24(2). The Court reviewed the jurisprudence regarding 911 emergency response calls and found that in the particular circumstances, which the accused was found guilty of several drug offences, the police had a responsibility to enter the residence. They entered the premises to ensure there were not any other occupants and to search to ensure he had no weapon. The trial judge failed to consider alternatives short of police entry into the home and the search of the home, all without a search warrant. In the circumstances, the call which triggered the police response was not 911, by the alleged victim, or from his home. At this point, she was still inside with the person reported to have abused her, and possibly under his control."

The tenant received notice of the hearing late on Friday when the hearing was set for Tuesday morning. She immediately requested an adjournment as she was unable to attend personally. The tenant also submits that the notice failed to disclose a significant aspect of the complaint, namely the conduct of her boyfriend. HELD: Appeal allowed and the matter returned to the Director to schedule a new hearing with at least 7 days clear notice to be given of the date. The decision to grant an adjournment is inherently discretionary and should be made with a view to what is necessary to ensure justice is done between the parties. This should include consideration of the complexity of the issues, the tenant's personal circumstances affecting her ability to attend in person on short notice and any prejudice to the landlord if the request is granted. There is no evidence that any of this was considered by the Hearing Officer. Three days (including a weekend) is not sufficient time to make arrangements and prepare for any hearing. It is clear that the tenant took the matter seriously and spent considerable time preparing written responses to the landlord's claim as she knew it to be. On the issue of sufficiency of the Notice, the Court found that while the Notice outlined many issues, it failed to disclose issues relating to her boyfriend. Since these issues were only discussed at the hearing the tenant was unable to attend she was not able to advise in person or in writing that her boyfriend was now incarcerated and the issue resolved. The Hearing Officer, in accepting evidence from the landlord about the boyfriend when neither the Hearing notice nor the landlord's complaint contained notice of it, breached the rule of natural justice and due process. The reasonableness standard of review applies here.","The tenant appeals from the decision of the Hearing Officer granting the landlord possession of her rental premises. This self-represented tenant included, as grounds of her appeal, 'procedural violations' and'misinformation as to the purpose of the hearing'. HELD: The appeal is allowed. 1) The three days notice given to the tenant was insufficient to allow her to make arrangements to personally attend the hearing. 2) The hearing notice was properly served personally. The tenant did not appear. No notice or warning was needed. 3) The Hearing Officer, in accepting this 'boyfriend related evidence' when neither the Hearing Notice nor the landlord's complaint contained notice of it, breached the rules of natural justice and due process. The decision of whether or not an adjournment should be granted is inherently discretionary. The decisions must be taken with a view to what is necessary to ensure that justice is done between the parties. The discretion must be exercised judicially by the application of proper legal principles.  4) The notice to tenant is required to contain sufficient particulars of the tenant's claim so as to enable her to prepare full and proper defence. 5) In this case the tenant took the process very seriously and spent a considerable amount of time preparing a written response to her landlord's claim as she knew it would be.

Awarding the plaintiff $285,000 out of the $3 million estate, that under the Testator's Family Maintenance Act the claimant need not show actual or urgent need or true dependency in order to succeed. To justify interference with a will a court must find a failure to provide proper maintenance and support and a moral claim to entitlement. The court must consider the magnitude of the estate, the circumstances of the claimant, the strength of his or her moral claim to a share in the estate, and the situation of others having claims upon the testator. This involves a very broad judicial discretion. Here, the plaintiff had established a strong moral claim and a failure to provide proper maintenance.","Two separate actions were commenced following the death of Rajbir Sandhu, professor of medicine at the University of Nova Scotia, in 1997. The first was commenced by Gurpreet Sandhu who claimed to be the wife of Sandhu and sought entitlement to her late husband's estate by 1998. Following certain pre-trial communications among counsel and discovery examinations of important witnesses, it became obvious that there were circumstances surrounding Sandhu's death which might reasonably be considered suspicious. Several procedural agreements were reached. The residue of the estate was to be divided, with the remaining 65 percent to go to the residuary beneficiaries."
4_2004skqb19.txt,"The applicant applied by originating motion for a declaration that the respondents, Zurich and Sovereign, were obligated to pay a proportionate share of defence costs to defend a claim brought against the applicant. The underlying action claims damages from the applicant with respect to the construction of a hog barn. The applicant was the general contractor. Each of the respondents issued a comprehensive general liability policy to the applicant. The law is clear that the pleadings determine whether or not the respondents have a duty to defend. If the claim alleges a state of facts, which would fall within the coverage provided by the policy, the obligation of the insurer to defend is triggered. The Court reviewed the claim and concluded that the true nature of the claim was that the applicant failed in its contractual duty to construct and deliver a hog barn suitable for the purposes intended. HELD: The application was dismissed with costs.  1) It is a fundamental principle of insurance law that a comprehensive general liability policy is not intended to be a means for a contractor to cover the expenses to correct its own faulty or defective workmanship. They are not performance bonds. 2) The claims in negligence are inseparable from the claims in contract and do not exist but for the contractual relationship. 3) The insuring agreement provided for the payment of all sums the applicant might become legally obligated to pay as compensatory damages because of property damage caused by an occurrence, which was defined to mean an accident. What is alleged in the underlying action was not an accident or occurrence. Further, the work/product exclusion clauses in the policies relieve the respondents from any duty to defend.","The applicant applies by originating a motion for a declaration that the respondents are obligated to pay a proportionate share of defence costs to defend a claim brought against them and others by Genex Swine Group Inc. (the 'underlying action'). The applicant specifies that each of the respondents issued comprehensive general liability policies in favour of Westridge. The respondents take the position that under the policies they issued they are not obligated to defend (and to pay defence costs) for the claims brought against Westridge and others in the underlying action. HELD: 1) The first premise for assessing whether an insurer's duty to defend has been triggered rests in the traditional 'pleadings rule', which is a three step process. Whether an insurer is bound to defend depends on the factors set out in the pleadings filed against the insured, usually in the form of a statement of claim. 2) The onus of establishing that the terms of the policy obligate the insurer to defend rests with the applicant. If the alleged negligence is based on the same facts, and resulted in the same harm to the plaintiff, the insurer is obliged to defend. 3) The mere fact that Genex alleges both negligence and a breach of contract is of no moment sufficient to change the plaintiff's obligation to defend by reason of an exclusion under the policy. This principle is congruent with the broader tenets underlying the construction of insurance contracts, namely the contra proferentem rule, and the principle that coverage provisions should be construed broadly, while exclusion clauses should receive narrow interpretation. 4) The plaintiff cannot change an intentional tort into a negligent one simply by choice of words."

In the meantime a notice of appeal of the judgment was filed on behalf of the respondent. At issue was the interpretation of ss(1) and (4) of s15 of the Court of Appeal Rules. The respondent's counsel took the position that with the filing of the notice of appeal this court became functus. The petitioner argued the order for exclusive possession is an injunction and therefore is not stayed by the notice of appeal. Alternatively that the giving of directions as contemplated by the judgment itself would not constitute the taking of any 'execution of the judgment' or the taking of any 'further proceedings in the action' and therefore would not contravene Rule 15.

The issue turned to Rule 15. 2)The Court interpreted two portions of Rule 15 as meaning that: 1) the execution of a judgment or an order awarding mandamus, an injunction, alimony or maintenance for a child or dependant adult was stayed pending the disposition of the appeal. 3) the giving of directions by the court would not constitute the taking of any action or directing of any part of the action as would not contravene Rule 15; and no writ of certiorari could be made. 4) the issue as to whether Rule 15 operates to stay an order of exclusive possession was raised in Young v.

That order had been made pursuant to s. 242 of The Planning and Development Act and required the respondent to comply with the zoning bylaw by desisting from operating an equipment storage yard on a parcel of land owned by him and to restore it to the condition it was in prior to his use of it. The respondent had purchased the land in 2009 and immediately began storing equipment and leaving junk cars and other materials on it. The applicant had tried to encourage the respondent’s voluntary cooperation with the bylaw but eventually issued the order. After the court granted the order, the respondent took no steps to comply with it and in August 2014, the applicant applied for an order declaring the respondent to be in contempt of court. The application was heard in September at which time the respondent submitted by affidavit that he had removed the old cars but believed that he was allowed to keep his equipment. He requested that he receive additional time. The respondent was given until December 2014 to comply with the order. At the hearing he deposed that he had spent a significant amount of time and money removing materials from the land and that he had found out from his counsel that his belief regarding the permitted use of the land was incorrect. Based on the appearance of the site, the applicant was not satisfied but agreed to adjourn the matter until May 2015 as nothing could be done during the winter. When the matter was reviewed in May, the respondent had removed more equipment but said that he was not able to move it all as he had no place to put the rest of it. The applicant requested that the court find the respondent in contempt and to impose appropriate penalties, authorize it to remove any remaining machinery and to add the costs of this removal and disposal to the taxes on the land and to make an order for solicitor-client costs in its favour. HELD: The respondent was found to be in contempt of court pursuant to Queen’s Bench rule 11-16(3) for his failure, without reasonable excuse, to comply with the terms of the May 2014 court order. The court authorized the applicant to remove and dispose of the equipment if the respondent had not done so within 30 days of the order issued. The court awarded solicitor-client costs to the applicant in the amount of $15,000 because of the respondent’s continued and unjustified failure to comply with the zoning bylaw. As the applicant might incur additional costs to remove the equipment, those costs would be added to the tax rolls of the property and become payable by the respondent if he had not purged his contempt within the allotted time.","The respondent is the owner of land located within the Rural Municipality of Edenwold No. 158. It was granted an order (2014) requiring the respondent to comply with the February 3, 2014 order. The development officer of the RM applied for an order declaring the respondent in contempt of court for his failure to comply (dismissal of equipment, breach of zoning order); and for solicitor and client costs. The respondent contends that he has not complied with the orders nor has he done as much as he can to comply. HELD: The application for contempt is granted and the matter is adjourned to February 2, 2015. The court is satisfied that the matter has reached a point where it calls for an amount of 'indemnification for costs reasonably incurred' by the respondent. It is not unusual for there to be a genuine issue between the parties as to whether there has been substantial compliance with any given order. This is not such a case. In fact, it is more likely that the respondent has simply not liked how the Zoning Bylaw impacts his personal interests and he has therefore chosen not to complywith it. The Court is concerned that any additional financial sanction may be more akin to punishment and may cause severe hardship to the appellant."

HELD: Appeal allowed. 1)The trial judge erred with respect to the nature of the charge when she focussed on post-driving conduct when the charge was cared and control. In her analysis she made inaccurate assessments of the evidence and the conclusions of the trial judge thereon. The acquittal because of a reasonable doubt on the.08 charge did not have, expressly or inferentially, included in it finding that he accepted the testimony that the accused's blood alcohol was between.068 and.08 at the time of driving. It was inconsistent with the facts and the judgment of the judge on those facts, which are his sole province, to say that the appellate court judge did not see any indicia of impairment. 2)The court found that the evidence raised reasonable doubt as to the appellant's condition and that reasonable doubt ought to have been exercised in the applicant's favour. The conviction cannot stand. The appellant is acquitted on the count of impaired driving."

The issue was whether this was a case involving the law of nuisance. Private nuisance is generally described as unreasonable interference with an occupier's use and enjoyment of their land.

For the plaintiffs and awarding aggravated damages in the amount of $1,000 to the male plaintiff for frustration/hardship and $5,000 to the female plaintiff for mental distress/follow up treatment. The court distinguished between punitive and aggravated damages and noted that the defendants' breach of contract did not have to be 'wanton or reckless' for the plaintiffs' claim in mental distress to succeed. These damages arose naturally from the breach and were foreseeable at the time the contract was executed.","The plaintiffs sought damages for mental distress following an aborted real estate transaction. The defendants had refused to honour an agreement made by the plaintiffs and their solicitor, who had advised them that they would have to sell their home in order to avoid judgment against them. When the offer to purchase the condominium did not close, the plaintiffs' solicitor sent a letter to the defendants' solicitor requesting further information and obtaining financing. The solicitor then served a series of Interrogatories upon the defendant's solicitor seeking to verify the solicitor's correspondence and correspondence with the plaintiff's solicitor, seeking further information. The defendant solicitor then proceeded to file a Change of Solicitor form indicating that the plaintiffs would henceforth represent their own interests and identifying their proper address. The move to Ontario was delayed by three days due to a mechanical defect in the chimney. The plaintiff incurred further debt of approximately $20,000 due to the delay in obtaining financing from the bank which had previously been approved for a mortgage by the defendants. She also incurred further arrears in the mortgage and travel costs related to the purchase of the condo. Application for summary judgment granted. The law has changed and continues to evolve. At common law damages for breach of contract were traditionally limited to those related to compensation. However, in this case the defendants were totally irresponsible in failing to obtain financing which could have been avoided had we known earlier about their dishonesty with respect to financing.

8_2012skqb249.txt,"The accused was convicted of aggravated assault after stabbing another person several times in the mid-section. The Crown brought a dangerous offender application. The accused was 22 years old at the time of sentencing. His prior criminal record consisted of mostly youth convictions. The offender was a known member of an aboriginal gang. The evidence suggested he was somewhere in the middle of the gang hierarchy. The accused had professed some desire to leave the gang. He had written an article directed at other youth warning them of the pitfalls of gang affiliation. The article was published in a book distributed to at risk youth. The accused had looked into getting help to leave the gang, but admitted on the stand that he was not prepared to take steps to leave because he might need protection from the gang in the penitentiary. While incarcerated, he had gang drawings confiscated from him and he had been jumped by members of a rival gang while in custody. The accused had shown some initiative in taking anger management courses and had completed his GED while incarcerated. HELD: The offence was a serious personal injury offence within the meaning of s. 752 of the Criminal Code. The criminal record together with the evidence heard at the hearing establishes that when the accused has committed violent offences he has been under the influence of alcohol or drugs, under supervision by court orders in the community, has used a knife or had one in his possession and most of the offences were a result of the accused's affiliation with the Indian Posse gang. The Crown has established a pattern of repetitive behaviour within the meaning of s. 753(1)(a)(i). Dr. Holden assessed the accused and found him to be a high risk to re-offend violently. The Crown has also proven that the accused constitutes a threat to the life, safety, and physical or mental well-being of other persons as set out in s. 753(1)(a)(ii). The accused was declared a dangerous offender. However, the Court found that given the accused's youth, the fact that he had not had any of the intensive programming that is available in a federal institution and the fact that there was some chance the accused might leave the gang, a determinate sentence and long term supervision order would adequately protect the public. In imposing a determinate sentence, the Court also considered that the accused's acts of violence, with the exception of the predicate offence, had generally resulted in less than severe injuries to the victim and the accused had voluntarily taken some steps to address his issues while incarcerated. The accused was sentenced 6 years or 72 months in custody, less credit for remand, to be followed by a 9 year supervision order under s. 753.4(b).","The accused was found guilty of aggravated assault contrary to s. 268 of the Criminal Code and breach of an undertaking. He was sentenced to an indeterminate sentence. The Crown applied to have the accused declared a dangerous offender. The accused had a long record of offences, including eight weapons related offences, four break and enter, one of which was aggravated assault (s. 145(3) of the Code), and one of several break and enters (misdemeanors). The Crown called expert evidence about street gangs and gang activity in the prison. There was evidence from the correction workers employed at the prison where the accused worked. HELD: The Court held the predicate offence was a serious personal injury offence within the meaning of s. 752 of the criminal Code. The Court found that the accused should be found dangerous offender within s.753(1)(a)(i) and he should be sentenced to a term not exceeding fourteen years. Given the conviction and Criminal Code provisions for imprisonment, the Court was satisfied that the predicate offences were serious personal injuries offences. The offender had a lengthy record as a result of the offences committed."

It also applied for an order giving directions respecting the exercise of the rights of the secured party with the prior interest. At issue is what is meant by 'possession' in s.34(2)(a) and when Lake Air obtained possession or constructive possession of the trailers. HELD: The application was allowed with costs from Humboldt.  1)The parties filed an agreed statement of facts and focused on the priority issue as if the application had been brought under s.66. 2)'Constructive possession' means possession of the collateral by 'another person at the request of the debtor' as set out in s.34(2)(a). What constitutes 'possession' of collateral by the debtor within s.34(2)(a) was in dispute. Unless the property qualifies as 'collateral' a person cannot possess it as a 'debtor' within the meaning of the priority section. 3)The case law in Saskatchewan has interpreted 'possession' to constitute more than mere physical possession. Sections 22 and 34(2) of the new Act are essentially unchanged except for the addition of the constructive possession. S.22(2) restricts the scope of constructive possession somewhat but it applies only to s.22 not to s.34. 4)A person is not in constructive possession of collateral within s.34(2)(a) unless that person is a 'debtor' as defined, unless the collateral is 'collateral' as defined and unless another person 'obtained physical possession of the colateral at the request of that debtor'. 5)The first term of each lease agreement contained an acknowledgement by Lake Air that the trailer was delivered by Associates at the date and location set out in the lease. Such a clause is inconsistent with Lake Air having actual or constructive possession at an earlier date. Lake Air did not have constructive possession prior to December 1997 through either Bell or Mid-Canada. Neither was in possession of the trailers at the request of Lake Air.  6)The protection the Act gives to purchase-money security holders should be interpreted broadly. To deny Associates priority over Humboldt would provide Humboldt with an unmerited windfall at the sole expense of Associates who gave full value for the purchase-money security interest it obtained from Lake Air.","The respondent applied under s63 of the Personal Property Security Act for an order declaring the priority of competing security interests held by the respondent and Humboldt in two reefer trailers. The respondent argued that the purchase money security interests in the two trailers were acquired pursuant to its leases of the trailers to Lake Air in 1997 and 1998 and that accordingly Associates could not rely on s34(2) for priority because its purchase-money security interests were not perfected within the 15 days of that date as required by the section. HELD: The application was allowed and the respondent was ordered to pay costs from the respondent. 1)It was obvious that before December 22, 1997 the trailers were not in the physical possession of the respondent until the first term of each lease agreement contained an acknowledgement by Lake Air that the respective trailers were delivered to it by Associates at the location and on the date set out in the lease.  2)The respondent did not haveconstructive possession prior to December 22/97 through either GJ Bell or Mid-Canada. Neither of these companies was a debtor as defined by the Act.  3)Although each of these cases were decided under the former Act, sections 22 and 34(2)(a) are essentially unchanged except for the addition of the concept of constructive possession which was not discussed in the original Act. The wording of the provisions respecting possession and constructive possession was similar to that of the Act in that the word 'debtor' used to mean debtor. The buyer is not necessarily to be construed adebtor as defined, unless the collateral is collateral, and unless another person 'obtained' physical possession. 4)A person is not in constructive possession of collateral within the meaning of the section if another person obtained possession at the request of a debtor. 5)The application of the applicant was allowed. It was ordered that its purchase and money security interest in the trailers have priority to the respondent's security interests. 6)The issue to be determined was what is meant by the term 'possession' in the Act and when in thecircumstances of this case, the Lake Air obtained possession or constructive possession."

The plaintiff argued that a contract was created and that it complied with the statute because he made his offer in writing, via an internet-based land auction program, and the acceptance was orally communicated by a telephone conversation. Therefore, all the requisite elements of a valid land sale were present. The defendant had used a website to list 17 quarters of land for sale, including six quarters of relevance to the action. The website was intended to connect sellers of farmland with interested buyers in a type of “non-binding auction” to permit sellers to gauge interest in their land, find the best possible price and avoid realtor’s commissions if a sale were completed. The listing showed three groups of the farmland for sale, described as 1) three adjoining quarters (the subject quarters); 2) two quarters (the adjacent quarters) and 3) one quarter (unsold quarter). In his online comments to the defendant during the auction, the plaintiff said that he wanted all five quarters (the subject and adjacent quarters). The plaintiff bid on each of the above parcels and had the highest bid on the subject quarters, but that in itself did not guarantee the purchase under the terms of the online auction program. He stopped bidding on the adjacent quarters because he thought they were becoming overpriced. After the auction, the plaintiff consulted with family members regarding whether to pursue negotiations with any of the bidders. They discussed the problems that would occur if the subject quarters were separated from the adjacent quarters because the two blocks were owned by different individuals. The defendant then telephoned the plaintiff and gave him two package options for the sale, both of which resolved the identified problem by including the purchase of the adjacent quarters. The package options were to purchase the subject and the adjacent quarters for $1,050,000 (which was 5 percent more than the $625,000 the plaintiff offered for the subject quarters and his last bid of $375,000 on the adjacent quarters) or the subject quarters and one of the adjacent quarters for $840,000. At the end of the conversation, the plaintiff testified that he wanted to be sure that regardless of his response to the package option offers, he would be able to buy the subject quarters for $625,000. The plaintiff did not have concerns about the purchase because he said that the defendant told him that “we had them”. He believed that this indicated the defendant’s willingness to accept his bid on the subject quarters and that if he accepted either of the two options, then either of the newly accepted offers would replace the agreement respecting the subject quarters. The defendant’s interpretation of the conversation was that he declined to accept the offer on the subject quarters until he heard back from the plaintiff respecting the package options and then he would decide whether or not he would sell the subject quarters. He either misheard or misunderstood the plaintiff’s question about the subject quarters and denied that he gave any assurance that he would sell them to him regardless of his response to the package offers. The plaintiff called the defendant shortly after the first conversation and advised that he would not accept either of the package option offers but would immediately bring the deposit for the purchase of the subject quarters. The defendant told him to “hold off”. The plaintiff interpreted that to mean that there was no urgency regarding the deposit rather than that no agreement existed respecting the subject quarters. The defendant testified that he said he was not prepared to accept the deposit at this time, which meant that he was not prepared to accept the plaintiff’s bid on the subject quarters. Three days later, the defendant emailed the plaintiff and said that he would not be accepting the bid. The issues were: 1) whether a contract was formed; 2) if so, did the Statute of Frauds apply.  HELD: The plaintiff’s action was dismissed. He had not established on a balance of probabilities that he and the defendant were parties to a valid and enforceable agreement of sale regarding the subject quarters. The court found with respect to each issue that: 1) there was no contract. In interpreting the words of the first telephone conversation and the context of the bidding process, using the standard of the reasonable bystander, there was no consensus ad idem between the parties. The second telephone conversation had done nothing to alter that finding. Both the plaintiff and the defendant reasonably believed different things; and 2) the Statute did not apply as there was no contract.","The plaintiff and defendant, both farmers, became involved in a lawsuit regarding the sale of three quarters of land owned by the respondent. The defendant listed his farmland for sale on an online auction platform. The respondent listed his land in an attempt to create an open bidding system to allow farmers to explore the market but not necessarily conclude with sale of the land. The issue in this lawsuit is the application of the Statute of Frauds to the land sale agreement. HELD: The plaintiff must prove on a balance of probabilities that a contract was created between the respondent and the respondent respecting the Subject Quarters and that the formalities of the statute of frauds have been satisfied. Proof of damages will follow if the court finds that an agreement was created.  1) By inquiring into the words used by Mr. Petrie and Mr. Ziola and their interaction through the bidding and post-bidding process, the court is not opening the door to considering evidence of what was actually going on in these men's minds. 2) In the first telephone conversation, the plaintiff registered for a Farmers Post account. He indicated that he wanted to be sure that regardless of his response to the package offers, he would be able to buy the subject Quarters.  3) The second telephone conversation was only brief minutes, probably even seconds in duration. The conversations are all that possibly created a contract of purchase and purchase between the parties respecting the farm property. The central issue in the lawsuit is how the parties' words and context were used to create the essential essential elements of a valid contract. These elements include an intention to create legal relations, peace of mind, stability and respect for the other party's right to make an informed decision regarding the purchase of the subject quarters. 4) The parties agree that the requirement of writing under the Statutes is an additional requirement to permit sellers to gauge interest in their land, seek out the best possible price and avoid the costs of realtor's commissions if a deal is not made. 5) There are several explanations for how things went wrong in the understanding between the plaintiff and the defendant, other than the inaccurate and dishonest testimony of any of the parties."

Although he alleged that he would suffer unnecessary hardship if kept in custody because he would fall behind in his schoolwork, prior to being remanded the youth had been asked to leave his high school as a result of safety concerns in the school. Application for release pending appeal dismissed. The young person would not suffer unnecessary hardship as he was able to attend high school classes several times per week in the youth facility while he awaited his appeal and, even if his appeal was successful, he would only have served four months custody before it was heard. Given the circumstances of the aggravated assault and his record of violent offences and numerous breaches of court orders, the court was not persuaded that the youth's release would be in the public interest.","The victim of a drive-by shooting appealed his sentence of 365 days, comprised of 243 days custody followed by 122 days supervision in the community. HELD: The application for release pending appeal was dismissed. The sentence was not sufficiently meritorious that, by the time his appeal was heard, he would likely already have served more than what is determined to be a fit sentence, and thereby suffer undue hardship if he is not released. The court found that the appellant had not met the onus on him under s. 679(4)(a) of the Criminal Code to be much more stringent than for an appeal against conviction."
e_2009nssc318.txt,"The mother applied for retroactive support (table amounts and s. 7 expenses) for two adult children. The father resisted the application in relation to the oldest son on the basis that he was no longer a dependant child when it was filed. The evidence showed the son finished university before the application was filed. His graduation took place after, at which time he was already working full time and living with his girlfriend. He lived with his mother for few months because of relationship problems, but later moved back in with the girlfriend. He also received some assistance from his parents when he took time off work to retrain. The father felt the mother's application in relation to the younger son should be limited because of her unreasonable delay in making it. He argued retroactivity should be limited to three years from the date he received the application (months after it was filed). The mother argued formal notice was given when her lawyer sent a letter requesting additional support several years earlier. She asked the court for support retroactive to three years before that date, or longer (based on what she alleged was blameworthy conduct on the father's part). The evidence showed the mother was slow in responding to the father's request for particulars. Despite threatening legal action several times, it took her years to file the application. The wife's application for retroactive support in relation to the oldest son dismissed. He was no longer a child of the marriage when it was filed. He became independent when his schooling finished and he started working and living with his girlfriend. While his parents provided assistance during his relationship troubles and retraining, they did so voluntarily and not out of any legal obligation. Support for the younger son to be reassessed retroactive to three years from the date the application was filed (as opposed to received). The mother unreasonably delayed her claim by allowing it to languish for years. While normally the letter from her lawyer would be said to constitute effective notice, the notice here was voided by the mother's failure to prosecute the matter. The father did not engage in blameworthy conduct: he made efforts to respond to and settle the mother's claims; he paid a significant level of support; and he reasonably believed he was meeting his obligations. Here, the need for certainty for a payor parent weighs in favour of the father.","The parties married in 1982 and were divorced in 2001. They have two children, aged 23 and 19. The oldest child, who was not a child of the marriage at the time of the application, left the charge of his parents and established an independent household without the consent, agreement, approval or financial support of his siblings. He and his partner took up residence in a downtown Toronto apartment. The issues raised were retroactive review of the base table amount of child support paid by the respondent and the Respondent and their contribution to the section 7 (special expenses) expenses for the children. The respondent argued that although the parties' corollary relief judgment provided for a shared parenting arrangement and an equal sharing of all special and extraordinary expenses, the retroactive recalculation should be limited to three years prior to October 9, 2008. HELD: 1)The Court did not have jurisdiction to consider the application of the respondent for retroactive variation of support and a readjustment of the claim for section 7 expenses pertaining to the older child.  2)The court reviewed the law as explained by the Supreme Court of Canada on the issue of retroactive child support and determined that the principles regarding retroactive and blameworthy conduct applied equally to s. expenses. 3)The trial judge was aware that some situations required a change in circumstances, but he did not allow this to happen in this case. 4)The respondent's application to vary was based primarily on jurisdiction and not to the result. The court found that the respondent had the right to choose how the money that should be going to child support is to be spent; it is not for the court to decide that his/her support obligation can be acquitted by buying his child a new bicycle. 5)There was no arbitrary cut-off point based either on age or scholastic attainment. The trial judge must not be blind to prevailing social and economic conditions."

The mother was mentally competent and able to manage her own affairs at all times prior to her death; the Power of Attorney was granted solely for the mother's convenience as she was physically infirm. The daughter could only be called upon to account for her use of the Power of Attorney if it was used when the mother was incapacitated.","The plaintiffs sought a detailed accounting from their sister of her dealings with their mother's financial affairs pursuant to a Power of Attorney.

4_2006nssc88.txt,"The parties were married for thirteen years and had four children, who resided with the mother immediately following the divorce. The father paid one monthly sum ($6,000) comprised of both spousal and child support. Over a ten year period, all of the children had graduated from high school; two of the children had moved in with the father and he provided support directly to the other two children while they continued their education. After the first two children moved out of the mother's home, the parties orally agreed to reduce the child support payments. The parties were unable to negotiate a further reduction in the combined child and spousal support after the third child moved out of the mother's home. Since the parties' separation and divorce, the mother had not seriously pursued any educational retraining or furthered her education in her field of expertise; since the children had become independent, she occupied herself with volunteer work. The father now applied to terminate spousal support. The father shall continue to pay the sum of $3,000 per month as spousal support for one year; for the following year, the support will be reduced to $2,500 per month; in the following year, support shall be reduced to $2,000 per month, after which support will cease completely; the father shall continue his direct support of the children remaining dependant as they complete their current courses. Although the mother's effort in looking after four children and her absence from the workplace during the children's early years were significant factors, she had ignored her responsibility to move towards some sort of self sufficiency; given the number of children, the court extended the formula under the Spousal Support Guidelines beyond the maximum 13 year period; however, the mother must develop a reasonable strategy immediately to ensure that she either begins work in an area with better employment prospects or immediately attends courses to upgrade, refresh or enhance her ability to support herself.","The parties, who were married in November 1980 and began living separate and apart in August 1993, entered into an oral agreement in which the respondent was to pay $6,000 per month. There was no financial contribution by the mother to the children in the father's care. The father paid by post-dated cheques directly to the mother and the mother destroyed any cheques she received in the previous $2,500 amount; the father took responsibility for $69,500 in matrimonial debt and any other debt in his name. The agreement was recognized by Maintenance Enforcement and the parties' obligations under the Corollary Relief Judgment and refers to s. 17 of the Divorce Act. The mother alleged that she received no money in September and October 2001, when the children left the mother's care and moved with their father to Scotland, to pursue employment and self sufficiency. She claimed that she had no income and that if the father were to receive the garnishee he would have to pay directly to her. She alleged that he owed her $52,000 in spousal and child support for the 2005 and 2006 years. Monthly payments of $1,836 were made to Maintenance Enforcement in the amount of $163.92 and the balance was deducted from the husband's ongoing support payments. The husband continued to pay support as originally ordered. In the absence of documentation to support the claim, it is impossible to determine the amount owing under the old agreement. The parties entered into the oral agreement with the intention of reducing the monthly support payments from $5,000 to $3,000 and the standard variation clause was contained in the Separation Agreement. The payments were consistent and there was no evidence that the mother was a party to the agreement and any financial contribution was made by the father. The wife was unable to locate any documentation that would have allowed her to locate the actual payments. She had no contact with the husband, who was paying support directly and was assisting the wife by assisting her with the children's education. In January 2006, the husband ceased paying support and Maintenance Enforcement returned the post dated cheques. She asserted that she did not have any difficulty in future to pay the costs of their children's post-secondary education and that the husband was assisting her directly. She also claimed that one missed payment would bring the full balance due.

He was suspended from the program since approximately March 2000. There have been a number of legal proceedings between the applicant and the University since then. An appeal committee of the University held that the applicant be allowed to resume his residency training on probationary terms. This decision has not been implemented. At issue is a College of Medicine policy governing students who are funded by third party organizations or governments. The applicant is such a student. His third party funding was depleted during the time he was suspended. The College of Medicine insists he must find a third party sponsor prior to being allowed to resume his program. The Lieutenant Governor requested that a judge of the Court of Queen's Bench perform her role as visitor in this matter. HELD: 1) The court found the College of Medicine has not been objectively reasonable in the exercise of its discretion to insist that the appeal committee decision will not be implemented until such time as the applicant obtains third party funding. The court found it did not properly or fairly apply the third party funding policy on the facts. 2) The applicant is entitled to relief. The appeal committee decision will be implemented by the College of Medicine if the following conditions are met.

Further, PAIRS will enter into an agreement with the College of Medicine waiving the financial terms of the PAIRS agreement with respect to the applicant for the duration of his residency. 3) The applicant will be responsible for paying tuition fees, administration fees, insurance fees and any other college fees payable by other medical residents but he will be granted a credit for the fees deducted by the College of Medicine during the time he was suspended.","At issue was a College of Medicine policy governing students who are funded by third party organizations or governments. The policy states that in order for a student to return to the college of medicine he must acquire third party funding. This funding was depleted during the period of suspension. The student insists he must find a third party sponsor prior to being allowed to resume his program. HELD: There is no dispute on the facts. Both parties relied on the record developed in earlier proceedings. In the context in which the question arises, and the object and purpose of the policy, the exclusivity of the jurisdiction extends to judging that the university satisfy standards that are fundamental to the administration of justice in every sphere. It is important to maintain the integrity of the college's supernumerary resident policy, and to avoid what it perceives to be potential problems with other government agencies, and potential financial implications for itself, if it should make an exception. The fact that the student had not yet exhausted his appeals within the internal laws of the University, and specifically to the Council of Student Appeals and Academic Matters, suggests that systemic forces were at work beyond the student's control."

She sought to introduce fresh evidence bearing upon the circumstances leading up to the divorce. Dismissing the appeal with costs, that even with the new evidence, the appellant still failed to demonstrate an adequate excuse for not responding to the divorce proceeding.

d_2013skca21.txt,"The appellant appealed the Queen's Bench decision that denied him damages for defamation (see: 2010 SKQB 249). The trial judge held that the defence of qualified privilege protected the Union and its representatives (the defendants in the action) when the latter republished a grievance defaming the appellant by falsely accusing him of having participated in the harassment of an employee. The trial judge fixed a provisional award of $25,000. The appellant's grounds of appeal were that the trial judge erred in finding that the defence applied and by assessing damages at $25,000. The respondents cross-appealed on the ground that the trial judge had erred in denying them costs. HELD: The Court held that the trial judge had erred in finding that the defence of qualified privilege applied. Although she correctly identified the law, she had not correctly applied it because she had not given sufficient effect to 1) the wording of the defamatory expressions; 2) the circumstances in which they were published and, in particular, the chronology of events and the separate instances of publication; 3) the persons to whom the words were published; and 4) whether what was published on each occasion was germane and reasonably appropriate to the specific occasion. In general, the Court noted that the respondents could have fulfilled their duty to notify its membership of the grievance filed by the member who alleged the harassment and made its effort to find witnesses to support the member's grievance by sending out a general notice. It did not need to name the appellant and make the allegations it did to achieve its goal. The respondent overreached, thereby placing the statement that the appellant had participated in the harassment of the employee outside the ambit of the defence of qualified privilege. The Court awarded general damages in the amount of $100,000. It held that the trial judge's assessment of damages was erroneous and founded upon mistaken principles of law. The Court was not bound by the range of damages mentioned by the Supreme Court in the Church of Scientology decision but only to apply the principles established in it to the context of this case. The provisional award of $25,000 for general damages was erroneous because the respondents published the documents by mailing them and placing them on the Union's website, over the strong objections of the employer. The respondents left the documents on the website for 6 months after the employer demanded that they be removed. The respondents had never offered an apology and appeared not to have recognized the harm that had been caused to the appellant. An award of aggravated damages was subsumed in the general award and the Court agreed with the trial judge that punitive damages were not warranted because the respondent had not been motivated by malice. The respondent's cross-appeal was dismissed without costs. However, their position was clearly correct in the circumstances: it was not appropriate for the trial judge to decline to order costs in their favour on the basis of 'mixed results', because in defamation cases, the results are invariably mixed.","HELD: The court allowed the appeal and fixed general damages at $100,000. The court found that the trial judge erred by finding the defamatory statements were protected by qualified privilege. The words in question had been posted at the Hospital and on the Union's website. The Union, Mr. Ross and Mr. Nowaselski are the respondents to the appellant's appeal and appellants by way of cross-appeal. The appellant is the former Director of the Veterinary Teaching Hospital, which encompasses approximately 600 faculty, staff and students and serves approximately 12,000 members of the public each year, as well as functioning as a teaching facility. Dr. Rubin was recruited by the Union and became the Director in 2002. He was then forced to return to his previous position as a full-tenured Professor at the University of Veterinary Medicine. He commenced an action in defamation against the Union, alleging that there was no merit to the defamed statements and that their contents would tend to lower the plaintiff's reputation in the eyes of a reasonable person. The trial judge found that these statements were capable of bearing defamedatory meaning notwithstanding the overarching labour relations context and that the words posted on the union's website were more appropriately considered with respect to the defences to the tort of defamation than the defence of absolute privilege."

The Chambers judge held that the separation agreement had not revoked the will and the former wife was entitled to the testamentary gift. The mother of the deceased appealed.

The executrix applied to have the gift of the deceased's estate bequeathed to the appellant. The appellant appealed the order. Appeal dismissed; the judge's reasoning was flawed. He relied on Billing, supra and Eccleston, supra; he failed to give any meaning to the express words used by the jurisprudence of the time period. He failed to consider whether the former spouse had expressly renounced any right to share in the estate of her brother; whether the appellant had immediately renounced her right to have any inheritance in the will by signing it or whether she had contractually bound herself to renouncing any inheritance after the death of her husband; whether there was any evidence that a contractual promise to renunciation, given for consideration before a former spouse, binds a person to renounced an interest in something to which he or she has no legal interest.

Application dismissed; she was the spouse of the deceased and was entitled to survivor benefits pursuant to the plan; the estate should commence an action in the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia against the respondent and the respondent for payment into the estate of the Pension plan entitlement earned by the applicant and for reimbursement by the Respondent of the amounts already paid to her; the respondent is in a direct conflict with the applicant regarding the continuing payment of the survivor benefit. The deceased was employed by Marine Atlantic for approximately thirty-one years. The Intestate was collecting the pension from the respondent at the time he retired in October 2006. The testator had made arrangements with Marine Atlantic to designate himself as single. There is no documentary support for this assertion, even if there were, the respondent took no steps to change the respondent's status in law, that is, he never divorced the applicant."
6_1994canlii4076.txt,"The parties divorced - the appellant later appealed the trial decision dividing property between them as separated spouses. Her appeal was allowed in part, the court holding the judge erred in ruling inadmissible certain evidence about the value of scallop licences. The matter was remitted to Supreme Court for determination on evidence to be adduced by the parties of the value of the respondent's fishing operation. In preparation, the appellant applied to the Supreme Court for an order to inspect the respondent's bank records pursuant to s. 21(1) of the Evidence Act. The respondent argued he had limited involvement in the enterprise being discovered. The judge granted the order with limitations: the examination was to be limited to income received by the respondent and covering the period from the trial date forward. The appellant appealed, arguing the limitations disallowed full disclosure. In the interim, the respondent went into bankruptcy and argued the examination would be fully conducted by the trustee. Allowing the appeal, that a possible duplication was no reason to limit full disclosure.","This was an appeal from a decision of the Supreme Court in Chambers granting an application under s.21(4) of the Nova Scotia Evidence Act ordering inspection of banking records to the appellant but imposing two limitations. The respondent had since gone bankrupt and the appeal had been allowed. The appellant contended that the examination ordered by the Chambers judge was nothing but a duplication of the detailed and searching examinations that will be made of his assets by the trustee in the bankruptcy proceedings. The Chambers judge held that he would grant the order respecting examination of the records respecting Fundy Associates Limited and the motor vessel with two limitations; the examination should be limited to income received by the respondent and the examination would only cover material from that time forward. Dismissing the appeal, that while the two restrictions are insufficient to limit full disclosure, in the context of securing full disclosure the Court ordered that the records be deleted."
c_2006skqb87.txt,"The appellant appeals its conviction of selling tobacco to a minor contrary to s. 8(1) of the Tobacco Act. The appellant argues that the learned trial judge erred in law by applying an unreasonably high standard of due diligence to the facts of the case. HELD: The appeal is allowed, the conviction is quashed and a verdict of acquittal is entered.  1) The court reviewed in detail the steps the appellant had in place. 2) The court was of the view that the trial judge erred in applying an unreasonably high standard for this defence. The trial judge applied a standard of due diligence that required the appellant to be able to prove that there were no other possible precautions or action that could have been taken to prevent the company's cashiers from selling cigarettes. This standard exceeds the requirements of a reasonable person. By applying a higher standard of due diligence, the trial judge erred in law. Had the appropriate standard of due diligence been applied to the facts of this case, the appellant would have succeeded.","The defendant was convicted of unlawfully furnish a tobacco product to a young person contrary to s. 8(1) of the Tobacco Act and a $3,000 fine was imposed as sentence. The defendant appealed the conviction on three grounds: the trial judge erred in law by applying an unreasonably high standard of due diligence to the facts of the case; The trial judge failed to apply the doctrine of stare decisis; and the verdict was unreasonable by being inconsistent with the acquittal of the appellant in the case of R. v. Westfair Foods Ltd. HELD: The appeal was allowed. The conviction was quashed, the sentence vacated and an acquittal entered. 1)The trial judge was required to consider what a reasonable person would have done in the circumstances to avoid the offence. A reasonable person is not required to possess extraordinary or great diligence or to exercise extreme care that a person of unusual prudence would apply. 2)The evidence at the trial suggested that prior to the incident, the defendant had an established system created to prevent the commission of the offence of selling tobacco to minors.  3)Westfair had a system that prevented the cashiers from selling cigarettes to minors, which was essentially the procedure followed by the defendant in this case.  4)A trial judge could not have found that a defendant had taken all reasonable care in establishing proper system to prevent their cashier from selling tobacco products to minors and that he took all reasonable steps to prevent its commission. A trial judge must have considered whether the accused reasonably believed in a mistaken set of facts which, if true, would render the act or omission innocent. 5)The court judge should have inquired whether the employee of the store had been properly trained in the Tobacco Sale Policy and its computer software policy, which would have allowed the cashier to enter the customer's date of birth when tobacco product was sold. The employee should have been accompanied by the Tobacco Enforcement Officer during this compliance check.  6)Costs of the appeal were awarded to the defendant."
e_2009skca138.txt,"This appeal concerns the assessment for municipal purposes of a building located in the City of Regina and used commercially as an enclosed shopping mall. The building was assessed in each of the years 2003 and 2004 on the basis of its 'fair value' as determined by the City Assessor. The owner of the building, the corporate appellant, was dissatisfied with the Assessor's determination of fair value and appealed the assessment to the local Board of Revision, then to the Assessment Appeals Committee of the Saskatchewan Municipal board. The appeals were allowed in part, but the corporate appellant remained dissatisfied. It applied for leave to appeal to this Court pursuant to s. 33.1 of The Municipal Board Act. The issues on appeal all relate to the determination of the fair value of the building and, more particularly, to the market adjustment factor used in that determination. The grounds take issue one way or another with the inclusion of the sales of the Southland and Victoria Square Malls in the array of sales from which the MAF was derived, or alternatively, with the adjustment of the sale price of these properties. HELD: Appeal dismissed. The appeal in relation to the treatment of the sale of the Victoria Square Mall fails, as does the appeal concerning the sale of the Southland Mall. The Court notes that other companies, owning or operating similar malls, also took issue with their 2003 and 2004 assessments. They, too, appealed to the Board of Revision and then to the Assessment Appeals Committee. They too were granted leave to appeal to this Court on the same grounds as the appellant in this case. Counsel for the companies agreed to treat this appeal as representative of the other appeals and to be bound by the result of this appeal. These other appeals are also dismissed.","The applicant company appealed its assessment of a building located in the City of Regina and used commercially as an enclosed shopping mall, known as the Normanview Mall. The company was dissatisfied with the Assessor's determination of fair value and appealed the assessment to the Board of Revision, then to the Assessment Appeals Committee. The Committee did not find any material error on the part of the Committee as they did not reach the conclusion that the sale price was not in dispute. The issue was whether the Committee erred in law in upholding the decision to include the sale of the mall in its determination of an appropriate MAF. HELD: Appeal dismissed. 1) The assessment of the shopping mall came to rest on the determination of the fair value of the building and, more particularly, on the market adjustment factor used in that determination. 2) The committee did not look at the importance, generally, of the sale verification information and the information it yielded, ascribing more importance to this information than is warranted by the Assessment Manual or the Cities Act. 3) The Committee found nothing requiring them to either exclude the sale from consideration in calculating the MAF or to adjust the sale sale price beyond the adjustments he had already made. 4) The sale price satisfied the remaining criteria of Document 1.1.6 (c) and was of considerable importance and merited considerable weight. 5) While the Committee may have regard for the sales of each of the malls even though the sale be part of a portfolio sale that includes other properties located outside the Province, it cannot be said on the facts of the case that the assessment committee erred."
c_2003skqb519.txt,"The Court was presented with a consent judgment. The respondent was unrepresented. The Court found the terms of the consent judgment were so unfair as to be unconscionable. HELD: The Court refused to issue the order on the grounds that the Court must not be seen as legitimatizing, condoning, acquiescing or approving of an unconscionable bargain.","The Court presented with a form of judgment bearing the consents of the two parties. At first blush, the Court should grant the parties the relief they appear to jointly be seeking. However, the terms of the proposed judgment were unconscionable. There was not equality in the bargaining positions of the parties and the petitioner was prepared to forfeit her right to spousal support and the right to divorce. The parties appeared content to receive assets mainly in the value of her car, which represented her receiving about 13% of the net value of the family property estate, leaving the remaining 87% to be the petitioner's share. The proposed judgment was improvident. The petitioner was not contacted nor did she file any material on her own behalf from which might gauge the level of her knowledge of the law and the rights that she had thereunder. HELD: The Court must refuse the application. 1)No reasonable person would conclude that the proposed judgement was anything but unconscionsable and would speculate that at some point in the future, the petitioner will come to realize how patently unfair the proposal was to her. 2)The parties did not need Court order nor judgment to attain their apparent goals. It was certainly open to them to proceed with this arrangement without the formality of a judgment or contract. They were not required to pay child support and there was equality in bargaining positions. 3)When a party is confronted with the reality of its obligations under the Family Maintenance Act, the economic value of releasing the petitioner from her obligation to pay support may be less than $1,600."
b_1991canlii4359.txt,"The applicants sought a stay of proceedings pending review of an arbitration award. The union had alleged the employer violated the collective agreement by the way positions for the rank of lieutenant were filled in the fire department two years prior. As a result of the arbitration award, several lieutenants were demoted to the rank of firefighter. Denying the stay, that (1) there was no arguable issue to be tried on appeal; (2) there was no evidence the applicants would suffer irreparable harm if the stay were not granted; (3) the balance of convenience weighed against the applicants; and (4) there were no exceptional circumstances.","The applicants filed an application for an order setting aside an arbitration award made by the employer. The union alleged that the employer violated Article 23.01 of the collective agreement by the manner in which the promotion of lieutenants in the Halifax fire department was conducted. The employer sought to use inexperienced personnel in an acting capacity until a new routine was devised. The grievance arose through arbitration pursuant to a collective agreement between the parties and the employer alleges that the promotion was being challenged by the grievance. The applicants sought to have the arbitrator's award set aside. HELD: Application dismissed. 1)The Court had jurisdiction to deal with the issue of costs. 2)The application for stay was originally phrased under Civil ProcedureRule 62 and issued preliminary ruling indicating that only dealt with matters before the Appeal Court and not this court. Jurisdiction however, clearly lies in this court under the JudicatureAct of 1989. 3)In this case the Court was unable to find that the union suffered irreparable harm. 4)The Union's position that the costs should go with the arbitration award was that the number of people affected was much smaller and would be primarily the seven who were demoted who were now from time to time acting lieutenant. The movement that might have been brought about if those who had done nothing wrong could not be expected to materialize in any real measure until after the matter had been heard."
5_2016skqb384.txt,"Criminal Law – Motor Vehicle Offences – Driving with Blood Alcohol Exceeding .08 – Conviction – AppealConstitutional Law – Charter of Rights, Section 10(b) – Appeal The accused appealed her conviction under s. 253(1)(b) of the Criminal Code of driving with a blood alcohol content over .08 on the grounds that the trial judge erred in law finding that there was no breach of her s. 8 Charter rights or of a breach of her s. 10(b) Charter rights. The first ground pertained to the defence’s contention that the officer who stopped the accused and made the breath demand did not have sufficient evidence of impaired driving. The officer testified that he was patrolling for impaired drivers on the night in question and observed the accused make a very tight right-hand turn, entering the untraveled portion of the road where the snow was soft. He noticed that her eyes were glassy and she was slurring her speech. She had just lit a cigarette, which suspects often do to mask the smell of alcohol. When she did put the cigarette out, he smelled alcohol on her breath. He asked her to step out of the vehicle and noticed that she swayed while standing still. She walked with a wide stance to the police cruiser and had to lean against it to maintain her balance. When he first asked the appellant if she had had anything to drink, she said that she’d had three but later said that she’d had five. He arrested her and made the breath demand. The defence argued that the trial judge erred in failing to consider other evidence that other vehicles had made similar turns and that the appellant did not require any assistance in leaving her vehicle and walking to the police cruiser, among other things. With respect to the second ground, the appellant advised the officer that she wanted to speak to a specific lawyer after being arrested. At the detachment, the appellant located the lawyer’s number and the officer dialed it. A voice message was left on the lawyer’s telephone but no return call was received. The officer advised the appellant she could call another lawyer, and initially she responded that she did not want to but wished to provide a breath sample. The officer was about to read her a waiver of her right when the appellant indicated that she wanted to call another lawyer. The officer called the number but received an after-hours message. He asked the appellant if she wanted to try another lawyer and she declined, stating that she was satisfied with leaving a message. She then provided her first breath sample. The defence argued at trial that the officer failed to advise the appellant of the availability of Legal Aid and failed to provide the Prosper warning, thereby breaching s. 10(b) of the Charter.  HELD: The appeal was dismissed. The court found that the trial judge had not erred: 1) by finding there was no s. 8 breach. The judge had not made any findings of fact that were not supported by the evidence nor did he fail to consider relevant evidence when he found that the officer had sufficient evidence that objectively supported his belief that the appellant’s ability to drive was impaired; and 2) by finding that there had been no breach of s. 10(b). The appellant had failed to act diligently in pursuing her right to speak with a lawyer and provided a clear and unequivocal indication that she had abandoned her right to counsel when she said she was happy leaving a message.","The appellant appeals her conviction under s. 253(1)(b) of the Criminal Code, RSC 1985, c C-46, of driving with a blood alcohol content of over.08 on the following grounds: The trial judge erred in law in finding there was no breach of her s. 10(b) Charter rights; the trial judge failed to consider that other cars had previously made a tight turn as evidenced by other tire tracks in the soft snow; the appellant pulled over appropriately after being signalled to do so; the officer did not observe any smell of alcohol emanating from the appellant's breath during the driving test and the appellant did not display any signs of intoxication. HELD: The appeal is dismissed. 1) Contrary to popular belief, there was sufficient evidence to support the officer's contention that the appellant was impaired by alcohol. The standard of review on a summary conviction appeals is based on an error of law, failure to consider the evidence in its totality and/or an error respecting a specific piece of evidence. 2) On the whole of the evidence, the appeal court properly found that there was a sufficient evidence, when viewed objectively, that there were reasonable and probable grounds for the officer to believe the appellant had, within the preceding three hours, driven while impaired or while over the proscribed limit. 3) The standard required for an effective waiver of counsel is very high. 4) The test of whether there was an honest belief that a person who is legally impaired requires assistance to walk or enter vehicle. The police officer is not required to have overwhelming evidence of impairment. 5) The evidence is not palpable or overriding error.  6) There was a palpable and overriding (or manifest) error on the part of the officer in making the decision to stop the appellant as he observed her walk over the snowbank and enter the police cruiser without assistance. The officer was aware of other vehicle tracks in soft snow and that she would have not been the first person to make a similar tight turn. The appellant challenged the objective basis for that belief, namely that there had not sufficient evidence that her ability to operate motor vehicle was impaired."
5_2017skqb167.txt,"Family Law – Custody and Access – VariationFamily Law – Custody and Access – Voices of the Children Report In 2012, after a trial, it was determined that the child should be parented on a shared basis with a one-week rotation between parents. An order was never issued and therefore, no judgment was taken out. The applicant now applied to have a formal judgment issued, and to vary the decision in favour of her having primary residence. Alternatively, she sought a Voices of the Child report. The applicant indicated that the child expressed a desire to live with her full-time. The parties’ affidavits conflicted as to their behaviour. The applicant indicated that the child told her he was required to continue skiing with the respondent even though he was having a seizure. She also indicated that the child told her that the respondent told his roommate he was going to stab the applicant and he called her crazy. HELD: The court found it appropriate to order a Voices of the Child report. It was determined that the variation application decision was dependent on the report. There were more issues at play than a bald statement by the applicant that the child requested to live with her full-time. The child was an appropriate age for the report, being over 12 years old. He was able to communicate effectively and the report would be meaningful to the court. The order was to be paid for through resources provided to the program. The parties were prohibited from discussing the report process with the child and they were ordered not to influence, coach, sway, or prompt the child towards particular views or statements for the purposes of the report. The application was adjourned sine die returnable not sooner than 14 days after the report was received by all parties. The judgment was directed to be issued.","The applicant seeks a Voices of the Children (here a Voice of the Child as V. is the only person in issue) report to ascertain V.'s wishes and gain clarity on his best interests. HELD: The application is to have formal judgment issued and to vary that decision in favour of her having primary residence and in the absence of an order varying the shared parenting order, the application is based on an alleged change of circumstances which includes V. expressing a desire to live full-time with R. If a variation is not ordered at this time absent the report, the parents will be severely strapped financially and are unable to afford the cost of the report. It is to be borne through resources provided to the program aside from the parents.  1) The parents are prohibited from having their children speak with each other or to the media and it is appropriate to have the report be prepared and submitted to the parties and to the Court.  2) There is an independent assessment of each child's wishes with respect to her mother's proposed move back to Assiniboia and there is a resumption of a shared parenting arrangement. 3) The children's affidavits are conflicting and there are conflicting accounts of what each child hopes for and their wishes are not being reliably communicated to the court. This is an important matter that must be finalised by the end of the application period.  4) It is in the best interests of all children to have their own voice heard by an impartial and professionally trained individual who can advise the Court in that regard."

He stole $23 from a convenience store, while armed with a tire iron. At the time, he was celebrating his birthday and was inebriated. This was his first offence. The Crown appealed the sentence. Allowing the appeal, setting aside the sentence and imposing a sentence of two years in a federal institution, followed by one year probation, with an order prohibiting possession of firearms following release. Although there were some mitigating factors, they were not such as to call for a suspended sentence considering the serious nature of the offence and its prevalence.","The respondent pled guilty to a charge that he stole a sum of money from the victim when armed with an offensive weapon, a tire iron. He was sentenced to two years in a federal institution to be followed by probation for one year on the terms and conditions as set out in the probation order of the trial judge. The Crown now sought leave to appeal and if that be granted, appeals from that sentence. The respondent was convicted of the robbery. He had grade 11 education, was unemployed and had an admitted drug problem. He informed the trial Judge that he wanted help for his addiction problem. The trial judge suspended the sentence, imposed a three year probation order, and imposed a two year probation prohibition order. He is prohibited from having in his possession any firearm or ammunition or explosive substance for a period of time commencing on the day the order is made and expiring five years after the time of his release from imprisonment. A prohibition order under s.100(1) of the Code should have been imposed. The sentence was not fit."
b_2002skqb131.txt,"The Crown appealed the dismissal of charges of impaired driving and driving with a blood alcohol level exceeding .08. The trial judge held the circumstances supported a special plea of autrefois acquit and that the manner of proceeding by the Crown was an abuse of process at common law. Alberta did not withdraw or abandon the charges and suspended his driving privileges for 3 months. Upon request, SGI also suspended his Saskatchewan driving privileges. At issue was whether the Alberta court lost jurisdiction; if so, whether that gave rise to a plea of autrefois acquit in Saskatchewan; apart from any loss of jurisdiction did the police procedure amount to an abuse of process at common law. HELD: The Informations were stayed. The trial judge erred in finding a plea of autrefois acquit was applicable but was correct in concluding Alberta lost jurisdiction. 1)The Information remained dismissed for want of prosecution. Jurisdiction over the respondent was lost when the information was not available in the Alberta Provincial Court, the appearance notice was not confirmed and the matter could not be dealt with (R. v. McGinnis). The Alberta court could have regained jurisdiction by issuing a summons or warrant within 3 months of February 6, 2001. A summons was not issued until August. The information was by then deemed to have been dismissed for want of prosecution pursuant to s.485(3). 'Deemed' in s.485(3) does not mean 'presumed until otherwise proven'. It means that the information is dismissed without any action by the court. Once dismissed the proceeding could only be recommenced with consent of the Attorney General or leave of the court, neither of which were obtained. 2)With respect to jurisdiction in Saskatchewan, s.476(b) grants concurrent jurisdiction to any province in which the offence may have been committed or committed within 500 metres of any province in order to prevent a charge from failing because of uncertainty as to location. The section was not intended to permit simultaneous prosecutions in two provinces or in a second province in the event of a failure in the first. 3)The respondent's appearance in a Saskatchewan courtroom as a result of a summons did not revive jurisdiction in Alberta. The Alberta proceeding was deemed to have been dismissed for want of prosecution on May 6, 2001. The charges have not been disposed of within the meaning of s.730(3). There was no finding in respect of which an appeal can be taken. The special plea of autrefois acquit is not available in these circumstances. 4)The prosecutorial conduct of the police in proceeding simultaneously in two provinces amounted to an abuse of process. The respondent was obliged to defend identical charges arising out of the same incident in two provinces for almost a year at substantial cost and stress. The police acted with arbitrary purpose and without regard for the principles of fundamental justice. The lack of malice or improper motive does not preclude a finding of abuse of process.","The summary conviction appeal by the Crown was brought when the trial judge dismissed charges of impaired driving and driving with a blood alcohol level exceeding.08 percent. The trial judge held that the circumstances supported a special plea of 'autrefois acquit' which would have allowed charges to be laid in both provinces but for a 'de facto' acquit. The Alberta proceeding was deemed to have been dismissed for want of prosecution. HELD: 1)The trial judge erred in law in finding that the court had lost jurisdiction as he specifically found that if there was loss of jurisdiction it was over the offence, but in dismissing the Information he relied on the provisions of s. 485(2) of the Criminal Code which relate to losing of jurisdiction over the accused and not the offence. His conclusion that the proceedings were abusive was in accordance with the information before him. The informations sworn on March 1, 2001 and March 29, 2001 in this proceeding were stayed for an abuse of process. 2)The special plea was not available in the circumstances of this case. The Saskatchewan court did not lose jurisdiction over either the offence or the respondent. 3)Even if jurisdiction was lost over the person in Alberta, that jurisdiction was regained, according to the Crown, when the respondent attended court in Saskatchewan on May 7, 2001 as a result of a summons that must have issued within three months of February 6, 2001. The deemed dismissal did not preclude recommencing the proceedings in Saskatchewan. 4)The Court was unable to agree that an appearance by the respondent in a Saskatchewan court as a consequence of a provincial court summons issued before May 7/2001 revived jurisdiction over him in Alberta. The manner of proceeding by the police in either province (deemed to have failed to remand or suspend privileges for three months in the same province until February 8/2001 when asking that charges be laid therein, much of the expense and emotional trauma could have been avoided. 5)The Special Pleadings of Autrefois Acquit and Automatic Conviction were stayed."
b_2016skqb166.txt,"HELD: The court held that it did not have the power to approve the proposed plan of arrangement. The court applied the rules of statutory interpretation, specifically the presumption of coherence and overlap, to the provisions of the Act and found that the applicant was using s. 186.1 for a purpose that the legislature did not intend. The applicant could have proceeded to dissolution under Division XVI. In s. 210(m) the legislature intended to give the court the ability to order disposition of property of creditors and shareholders but not to deal with a shareholder’s right to distribution on dissolution.","Shareholders approved a plan of arrangement and sought an order approving it pursuant to s. 186.1 of the Business Corporations Act and s. 210(m) of the Director of Saskatchewan Corporations Branch. The Director opposed approval of the arrangement on the basis that s. 204 of the Act requires a corporation to distribute its assets among its shareholders according to their respective rights. The proposal of FCC proposed to distribute all of its net proceeds to those of its shareholders who have 'proven claims in establishing their status as Shareholders rather than having portion of the proceeds revert to the Minister of Finance in the right of Saskatchewan pursuant to the SBCA.'s rationale for the arrangement was that the Shareholders have already sustained a significant loss on their investment as result of the oppressive acts of former management. The plan proposed for the corporations contemplates an outreach or advertising program to be conducted over the next two years with the goal to reach at least some of the missing shareholders. The purpose of the plan is to allow the corporation to dispose of any property belonging to creditors or shareholders who cannot be found. HELD: The court adopted an interpretation that was appropriate for the purpose set forth in the Act.  1) The court could not find any evidence that the SCCA was being used by FCC for a purpose which the legislature did not intend. The context within which this was provided must be considered. 2) There was no conflict between the power given by the court in s. 185(l) to permit the court to override the mandatory directions contained in ss. 220 and 221 and with that of the Court in s.(l) allowing the Court to approve a proposed interim or final distribution to shareholders in money or in property. The Court could order that rather than the real estate being liquidated, it be divided among the shareholders in a specie proportionate to their entitlement as shareholders.  3) The Court was satisfied that the proposed distribution of funds by FCC was a perfect solution for the problems identified by the applicants. The proposed arrangement did not involve any elements of change of control or of shareholders being required to exchange one type of shares for other assets or any arrangement that facilitates an ongoing existence of the corporation. 4) The decision does not engage the arguments and issues that are in play in the present situation."

Report by Back-Track Investigations and Special Services Ltd. supports the plaintiff's belief that damage occurred to their back yard lawn was caused by run-off and/or leaching of a substance from the alley. However, the evidence does not support that. In preceding years, before it was moved to the Statchuk yard, it was used to store tools, machinery and applicators. The floor in it replaced before moving to his yard. HELD: The plaintiff's claim was dismissed.

HELD: The husband's obligation to support the wife should end. He was entitled to an exemption for this amount pursuant to s. 23 of the Matrimonial Property Act. 1)The loan was used to pay debts incurred by the wife prior to the marriage. 2)The wife's health was fragile and it was illogical and unfair that he should be required to share payment of them. 3)The husband was to pay retroactively $700.00 per month. 4)The court reviewed the condition, means, needs and other circumstances of each spouse prior to marriage and determined that $49,000 was the value to be divided."

In an addendum, he said the answer to question should be no. It seems clear that he was referring to question 5, rather than question 4. The result is the same. The case was put to the court below prematurely, with the result that it was put on what was essentially a hypothetical basis, and Charter decisions should not be made without sufficient factual base. There was no evidence that the appellants or any of them had yet suffered any adverse consequences as result of the impugned legislation, although proceedings were pending before the Labour Relations Board which might result in adverse consequences. More particularly, there was no suggestion that anyone had lost their job or had been in any way penalized for refusing to either pay union dues or to join the union, nor was there any evidence as to why anyone objected to being a member of the bargaining unit in question or the union in question."
c_1995canlii5987.txt,The accused was charged with sexual assault and was tried in the Court of Queen's Bench. The evidence at trial indicated that the alleged acts had occurred prior to the accused becoming an adult. He had not been ordered transferred into adult court under s.16 of The Young Offenders Act. HELD: Accused acquitted. 1)The Judge was satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused had sexually assaulted the complainant. 2)Because the complainant's evidence suggested that the assault occurred while the accused was a young offender the Judge concluded that the Court of Queen's Bench was without jurisdiction in the matter.,"The sole issue before me was whether it was proven beyond a reasonable doubt that the sexual assaults alleged occurred on or after October 22, 1986, the date that the accused became an adult. The case had not yet come to a Youth Court transfer and a concurrent proceeding was pending in Youth Court. HELD: 1)The accused was acquitted of the charge in the indictment. 2)The complainant was not as credible as the accused as she was and although the one or two incidents of improper touching took place after the sexual intercourse incident, she quite frankly admitted that he had attempted to have sexual intercourse with her when she was or was 9. He subsequently moved from the Indian Reserve to Prince Albert while he was still young and had no further contact with the complainant. 3)The Court of Queen's Bench accordingly had jurisdiction only when a matter is transferred to it pursuant to s.6 of the Young Offenders Act."
5_2001canlii345.txt,"The accused was charged with operating an overweight vehicle on a weight restricted road contrary to s.38(1)(b) of the Highways and Transportation Act. No permit had been issued for the tractor trailer. The defence argued the document entitled 'order for road restriction on provincial highway #332 pursuant to s.35 of the Highway Traffic Act' was not proof of the Minister's order according to law; even if the document is proof, the order is a 'regulation' under the Interpretation Act and so the provisions of the Regulations Act applies; since those requirements have not been met, the Crown has not established an order had been made for the purposes of this case. HELD: It was not proven beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused violated s.38(1)(b). It was not established that the order was published for the purpose of this prosecution nor that the document filed in court is proof of the order itself.  1)It is well known that in a criminal case a provision that enables the Crown to expeditiously prove certain elements of an offence must be strictly satisfied. Since a violation of the HTA is prosecuted under s.4 of the Summary Offences Procedure Act, which in turn adopts the Criminal Code summary conviction procedure, the Crown must strictly comply with the provisions respecting proof.  2)It is mandatory for the Minister to give notice of the order and there was no evidence he exercised his discretion by determining the most advisable manner in which notice was to be given. The Minister failed to take appropriate steps to cause notice of the order to be given. The Department of Highways placed road signs warning and advising of weight restrictions on the highway and along grid roads accessing #332, but no notice was given to the general public. Notifying persons who reside or do business in the immediate area of the road is not sufficient to satisfy the requirement to publish. 3)Even if it could be said sufficient notice was given, it could not be concluded that the endorsement upon the order that the order 'conforms to the original' meets the statutory requirement that the copy must be a certified copy 'under the hand of an officer or person in whose custody the...public document is placed' (s.12 SEA) since it was not known if she had custody of the document or under the hand of any of the persons set out in s.7(c) of the SEA since her official capacity is not described. The order was not published in the Saskatchewan Gazette and so a copy of the order so published could not be produced (s.7(a) SEA). It was not proven that the copy of the order had been printed by the Queen's Printer (s.7(b) SEA).","The accused was charged with operating a motor vehicle that violated the Minister's weight order contrary to s38(1)(b) of the Highways and Transportation Act, 1997. The accused was stopped by a Swift Current police officer as he was proceeding through a rural area when he noticed a tractor trailer travelling in an easterly direction. The police observed the trailer and noticed that it was overweight. The officer stopped the vehicle and found that the trailer was operated by the accused. The RCMP had erected road signs warning and advising of weight restrictions on highway #332. The Provincial Court did not issue notice to the municipal division in which the grid roads were located and to entities that were involved in the transport of goods. The Department of Highways had also erected signs warning of an alternative truck route. No other notice was given to the municipality. The municipality appeared to have taken it upon itself to advise persons in its municipal division affected by the weight restriction and to advise other persons in the immediate area that were in the business of hauling. Traffic signs were located along #332 and #332 in various locations along grid roads. There was no publication in any other print media in the area."
3_1997canlii11384.txt,"The Minister of Social Services applied for an order that the Public Trustee be served with notice of a protection hearing and act as litigation guardian for H.B. who was alleged to be of unsound mind. H.B.'s child born in 1995 was apprehended at birth and was currently subject of a child protection hearing. The Minister relied on the Public Trustee Act and, alternatively, on the court's inherent parens patriae jurisdiction.HELD: The Public Trustee was appointed amicus curae to act on behalf of H.B. upon being satisfied she is unable to act for herself. An assessment was ordered pursuant to s32 of the Child and Family Services Act. The order was to issue unless the Public Trustee shows cause as to why it is not the appropriate party within 10 days from the date of this order. 1)While the wording of s32 is ambiguous the Public Trustee was correct that the Act does not authorize it to represent an adult under a mental disability other than where a property interest is involved. Nowhere does the Act authorize the Public Trustee to act as personal guardian of a dependant or mentally incompetent adult. The PT Act does not authorize its appointment as litigation guardian in the matter of child protection proceedings. 2)Pursuant to its parens patriae jurisdiction the Court has a responsibility to protect the interests of H.B. who requires independent representation to ensure her rights are protected. If the court failed to intervene H.B. will be left in limbo, a victim of the system.","The Minister of Social Services applied for an order that the Public Trustee be served with notice of a child protection hearing and act as litigation guardian for H.B.

HELD: An order was issued pursuant to s. 32 of The Child and Family Services Act.  1)The Act does not authorize the appointed trustee to act as a litigation guardian on behalf of the child. 2)S. 32 is considered in the context of the entire Act. It is intended to authorize the public trustee to protect and administer the property of infants and dependant adult children. Nowhere does the Act authorize the the public trustee, within 10 days from the date of this order, shows cause as to why it is not the appropriate party to act. 3)The public trustee best fits the criteria enunciated by Wright J. in Szwydky v.

The defendant published the news it received from the police, a proven reliable source. 3)Nothing pointed to the defendant as being the cause for the loss of profits by the plaintiff's roller rink operation. The business was on a down side at the time. The assault occurring where it did was not the fault of either party. If it had a bearing on the immediate attendance figure it was minimal and the plaintiff did no promotion whatsoever to increase attendance.","The plaintiff's radio station reported that a 12 year old girl had been sexually assaulted at a roller rink located close to Carpet World and across the street from the defendant's prison.

e_1996canlii5466.txt,"This was an appeal from a trial court decision questioning whether the trial judge erred in determining that the appellant's rights under s.7 and s.8 of the Charter had not been violated. When man involved in an accident checked himself into hospital, the attending physician informed the RCMP of the accident and an RCMP officer came to the hospital. As the appellant had indicated to the physician that he had been drinking, the RCMP constable read demand for blood sample, which the attending physician attempted to obtain. The appellant refused and asked to speak to his lawyer. Unable to contact lawyer, the appellant refused to supply blood sample and was charged with refusal under s. 254(2) of the Criminal Code. The trial judge had held that as the physician attempted to obtain sample for medical purposes, he was not acting in the capacity of agent of the state, and his actions were not subject to the Charter. Dismissing the appeal, that while there may have been some issues of breach of confidentiality, the physician's actions were not analogous to search and seizure within s.8 of the Charter. The trial judge did not err in determining that the appellant's rights were not violated under either s.7 or s.8 of the Charter.","This was an appeal against a decision wherein the appellant was convicted of an offence contrary to s.254(5) of the Criminal Code. The officer who had accompanied the accused to the hospital for treatment for injuries received in a single motor vehicle accident had asked him if he had been drinking and when the accident had occurred as this information might be important to the treatment he might give. The doctor prepared a medical report for the hospital in response to a written request by the police, which included the results of the blood alcohol tests. The first blood sample was taken by the officer for medical purposes while the accused was unconscious contrary to an explicit refusal by the appellant to provide a sample under any circumstances. In the present case, the obtaining of the information from the doctor as the basis of formulating the demand is not analogous to a search and seizure within the meaning of s.8 of the Charter. The trial judge did not err when she found the appellant's rights under s.7 were not violated."
8_2016skqb154.txt,"HELD: The order was granted. Following the expiry of the current temporary order, the court found that the children were in need of protection pursuant to s. 11 of The Child and Family Services Act. As the father had taken no steps to deal with his anger, violence and alcohol issues, the children continued to be in need of protection as they were likely to suffer physical harm at his hands. Their psychological well-being required that they remain in protection to allow them to deal with the trauma they had suffered while they were in his care. Therefore, the court found that because the children were doing well in foster care and did not wish to be returned to their father and that the expert had advised against them having any further contact with him, it would make a permanent order rather than a long-term order.","The Ministry sought a permanent wardship order with respect to two children. The parents of the children, despite being more or less involved with the proceedings for some of the period since the proceedings began, did not appear for the trial of the action. HELD: The Court found the children to be children in need of protection pursuant to s. 11 of the Act. The Ministry presented its evidence completely and provided a full and complete argument in support of its recommendation in this matter. Counsel for the children participated fully in the trial process and presented argument in advocating for their interests. The Court also found that the parents had not taken measurable steps to deal with their anger, violence and alcohol issues. The children were exposed to violence on the night of July 7, 2013. There does not appear to be any adult person able or willing to provide for their needs. As such, the children are exposed to emotional and physical harm."

The residential school was located at Beauval in the Province of Saskatchewan. The accused was considered the golden-haired boy of the priests and nuns and was very popular with the boys at the school. He developed the intermural hockey, competitive fastball and softball teams and the Beauval Warriors, which was the regional champion hockey team through most of the years. There were times when the relationship with various boys crossed the line from appropriate and acceptable behaviour to become acts of sexual assault and sexual interference. The Court was required to take into account the potential distraction of the trier of fact from its proper focus on the facts charged and the potential for undue time consumption."
c_2012skqb372.txt,"The plaintiff purchased insurance from the defendant. In 2000, the plaintiff's farm was damaged by a fire. He commenced an action against Wawanesa Insurance Company in 2001. In 2006, the plaintiff commenced an action against the defendant, alleging that the defendant was in breach of contract or negligent for failing to obtain full replacement value insurance coverage for the plaintiff. The defendant filed his defence in April 2007. Mediation took place in September 2010 and examinations for discovery were held in May 2011. At that time, the defendant asked the plaintiff to disclose the amount recovered in the Wawanesa lawsuit and the plaintiff refused. The defendant brought this application for relief that: 1) The plaintiff's action be dismissed for want of prosecution; or 2) The plaintiff be required to disclose the amount recovered in the other lawsuit. The defendant argued that the delays between the issuance of the statement of claim to the examination for discovery and then the delay between the time of mediation to May 2012 when the plaintiff's counsel filed the reply to undertakings were both inordinate.HELD: The Court applied the test established in International Capitol Corp. v. Robinson Twigg &amp; Ketilson to determine whether or not a matter should be struck for want of prosecution. The Court found that the first delay was inordinate but because the plaintiff and defendant both acknowledged that the action against the defendant would only proceed depending on the outcome of the claim against Wawanesa, the delay was excusable. The Court found that the second delay was excessive, but was not sufficient to strike the claim on that basis. Applying the factors provided in Capitol, the Court found:1. Stage of litigation: It did not occur at an early stage of the litigation as the matter could well go to pre-trial conference. 2. Impact of delay: The delay was not causing any problems for the defendant. 3. The context in which the delay occurred: the delay in question was actually only one year during which the plaintiff's counsel did not respond in a timely fashion to undertakings. 4. Reasons offered for delay: Counsel was busy and it had to determine which undertaking could or could not be answered. 5. The role of counsel in causing the delay: The Court held that the delay caused by the plaintiff's counsel should not be a reason to deprive the plaintiff of his claim for actions beyond his control. The Court denied the application to strike the plaintiff's claim but ordered that the plaintiff disclose the amount obtained in the Wawanesa action on the basis that this case fell into the exception to the policy which protects settlement communications. Here, the communications sought by the defendant were relevant and necessary to avoid double recovery.","FIAT: The applicant brings an application to strike the plaintiff's action for want of prosecution or for compel the plaintiff to disclose the amount recovered from its lawsuit with Wawanesa Mutual Insurance. HELD: 1) The delay from June 2010 to May 2012 is a delay from May 2011 and solely on the head of counsel for the plaintiff for not responding in a timely fashion to the undertakings. This matter is at a point where it could well go to pre-trial conference. Therefore it is not at such an early stage that it would lead the Court on its own to strike. 2) As the defendant is retired from active business, this delay is not causing him any professional embarrassment or damage to reputation. The context in which the delay occurred is that of a one-year period when it took plaintiff's counsel from that time until May 2012 to file its reply to undertakings (this was approximately 2 weeks after the application for this motion had been filed). 3) The plaintiff has made its case and ordered the specific amounts for each structure for which it settled its claim to be disclosed.  4) The Court of Appeal has set out the principles for determining whether or not a claim should be struck. It found that for the initial period of May 2006 to May 2010 the delay was inordinate but excusable. It would be to the defendant's advantage to allow matters to play out in the suit against the defendant in hopes that a complete resolution could be had. This appears not to have been the case and after the resolution with the defendant matters have progressed on a bit of a tighter time line. The plaintiff argues that it was understood between the parties that the action against Mr. Hoeppner would only proceed depending on the outcome of the claim against him. 5) The amount arrived at in the minutes of settlement be disclosed if those settlement amounts relate to structure by structure.  6) Costs of the application were ordered to the plaintiff in the amount of $12,000."

Based on the applicant's income, his child support payment is reduced from $500 per month to $425 per month.  2) The applicant is in arrears in the amount of $56,365.60. He has provided little explanation for his failure to pay the child support he was ordered to pay other than he was stubborn. It is apparent that he had the ability to pay. The application for rescission for arrears is dismissed.","FIAT: The applicant applies pursuant to the Inter-jurisdictional Support Orders Act for a variation of support for the parties' one child, Desiree May Braun-McLaughlan, born February 14, 1992. Mr. McLaughlan seeks both a variation in regard to his ongoing child support payments as well as rescission of arrears which have accumulated under the original child support order. HELD: 1) The respondent resides in British Columbia and Ms. Braun resides in Saskatoon. It is fair to adjust the respondent's ongoing child care payments as at November 1, 2006. Given that the applicant is currently earning the sum of $45,784 per year, he can afford to pay a reasonable payment towards the outstanding arrear. 2) The applicant appears to be suggesting that his payment of ongoing support, and any payment he must make towards arreaars, leaves him in financial difficulties, given he has remarried and has two more children. However, in order to allow rescission, would have to determine that he has, firstly, present inability to pay the child support and then, secondly, that he will not in the future be able to pay. 3) There are factors that should be looked at in the capacity of an ongoing support enforcement enforcement enforcement officer, including whether the ongoing payments are set out in the original order and whether ongoing payments have been rescinded. The respondent has failed to provide the Court with an explanation as to his significant delay in seeking relief from child support. Further, upon reviewing the income tax summaries filed by the respondent, it appears that he did have the ability to pay in some of the years since the order was granted in light of his residence and the fact that he was awarded child support in 1995 and 2002."

d_2000canlii19583.txt,"The accused was charged with assault causing bodily harm contrary to s.267(b) of the Criminal Code. HELD: The accused was found guilty.  1)The case law from other jurisdictions was reviewed. Given the law as it presently stands in Saskatchewan the Crown does not have an obligation to prove that bodily harm caused by the assault was objectively foreseeable and that the assault would subject the victim to the risk of bodily harm. The Court of Appeal expressly stated that R. v. Nurse was incorrectly decided and prefers the approach in R. v. Brooks which held the elements of assault causing bodily harm consist of the mens rea to commit the assault and the intentional application of force which results in bodily harm. 2)The victim would not have suffered bodily harm if the accused had not assaulted him. The assault was more than an insignificant or trivial cause of the bodily harm. While the bodily harm resulted directly from third parties falling on top of the accused and the victim, the third parties involvement was due entirely and as a direct result of the actions of the accused. It was clearly the accused who initiated the pile up. The accused placed the victim in a dangerous position, similar to that in the Samuelson and Brooks decisions. A very short period of time elapsed between the assault and bodily harm.","The accused was charged with assault causing bodily harm contrary to s. 267(b) of the Criminal Code. The accused testified on his own behalf and called his son-in-law, Richard Schmitt, as witness. The facts as outlined by the accused on the one hand, and by the Crown on the other are at variance in material ways. While the bodily harm resulted directly from the effect of third parties falling on top of the accused and Mr. Brown, the third parties involvement was due entirely and as direct result of the actions of the defendant. The defendant placed the victim in a dangerous position, similar to the accused in the Samuelson and Brooks decisions. The second question must be answered in the negative: would the accused have suffered bodily harm if the accused had not assaulted him? (2) Was the assault a contributing cause of bodily harm, in that it was more than an insignificant or trivial cause? HELD: The accused was convicted of the assault as charged. The Court held that the deminimus test of causation did not violate s. 8 of the Charter, either on the principles of fundamental justice or of being too vague. In reviewing case law from other jurisdictions, it was important to note that given the law as it presently stands in Saskatchewan, the Crown does not have an obligation to prove that bodily harm caused by the assault was objectively foreseeable and that the assault would subject the victim to the risk of death. 1) The Court of Appeal expressly did not follow R.v. Nurse (1993), which found that the Crown did have to prove objective foreseeability. 2) In the case at bar, two questions must be posed: (1) Would the victim have suffered physical harm if he had not been assaulted; (2] Was the accused's cheering 'kill him, kill #57' when his son was laid out on the ice after having been checked from behind; and (3) was the defendant's cheering while he was driving his car in front of the motorhome on the painted median on the highway. After the victim stopped behind him the accused opened the victim's door and pulled him out by the arm. Both were then immediately hit hard by a third vehicle. The third unrelated witness, Mark Anderson, did not see the event.  4) The defendant was convicted at trial. He was acquitted on the basis that the mens rea to commit the assault, that is the intentional application of force to the person of the victim, and that such force resulted in bodily harm. 5)"

c_2013skqb155.txt,"The Crown appealed a decision of the Provincial Court dismissing an application for a recognizance pursuant to s. 810.2 of the Criminal Code. The judge held that the usual rules of evidence pertaining to criminal trials apply to a s. 810.2 hearing and that records kept by the Correctional Services of Canada (CSC) were inadmissible as business records under s. 30 of the Canada Evidence Act. The respondent had been convicted in 2009 of robbery with violence, assault causing bodily harm, assault and three counts of violating bail. He was sentenced to three years' imprisonment. In May 2010, the CSC referred the respondent's case to the National Parole Board (NPB) with a recommendation that he be detained until warrant expiry, in accordance with s. 129(2) of the Corrections and Conditional Release Act (CCRA). The recommendation was based upon the character of the respondent's offences and where there are reasonable grounds to believe that the offender is likely to commit another offence causing death or serious harm if released on parole. The NPB ordered that the respondent be detained in custody until the expiry of the sentence. Reviewed annually under the CCRA, the CSC prepared another assessment in 2011 and the respondent was not released from custody until March 2012. At that point, a 'warrant expiry package' was prepared by a parole officer, comprised of CSC records relating to the respondent, including a criminal profile report, the assessment for decision reports and copies of the NPB's reasons for ordering detention. These records were sent to the RCMP in Saskatchewan. The officer concerned then swore the information under s. 810.2, stating that he believed that there were reasonable grounds to believe that the respondent would commit a serious personal offence as defined by s. 752 of the Code. The application for a hearing was commenced in August 2012. The parole officer and the RCMP officer were called to testify and the Crown applied to have the documents in the package admitted into evidence, and the respondent opposed the application. The judge refused to allow the admission of the report, the assessment and the NPB reasons for ordering detention based upon R. v. Fontaine and R. v. Toulejour. Based on the business rules exception, the judge held that the criminal report profile was inadmissible because it was a copy and not accompanied by supporting affidavits as required by s. 30(3) of the CEA. HELD: The Court held that the application was allowed. The Supreme Court had confirmed that s. 810 hearings are not criminal trials and that the rules of evidence in criminal trials do not apply. Hearsay evidence is admissible and the judge is to determine whether or not sufficient weight can be given to the hearsay evidence to establish reasonable and probable grounds required for the individual to swear the information to justify the fear of harm to others by the respondent. The Court held that all of the CSC records submitted as part of the package were admissible under the CEA. The Court directed that the matter be returned for a new hearing of the original application.","This is an appeal from the decision of the Provincial Court dismissing an application for a recognizance pursuant to s. 810.2 of the Criminal Code. The issue is whether the usual rules of evidence pertaining to criminal trials apply and that hearsay evidence was inadmissible. Hearsay evidence is admissible. The court found that in the circumstances the judge had found, the usual rule of law regarding the use of hearsay is not applied in this case. The Crown applied to have the criminal profile report, the assessment for decision reports and the NPB's reasons for ordering detention admitted into evidence. The defendant opposed the admission of these documents. HELD: 1) The Court found that s.810 hearings are not criminal trials. The normal criminal rules of law apply. The phrase'satisfied by the evidence adduced' does not require formal sworn evidence such as viva voce evidence commonly called in criminal proceedings. 2) There are many proceedings in our criminal law and Criminal Code that allow evidence that does not meet the admissibility rules prescribed for criminal trials to be admitted and serve as the basis for the decision. The Court also found that the Crown applied for admission of certain documents which did not meet this standard. 3) The accused was not released until the sentence expired in March 2012. The accused's case was referred to the National Parole Board (NPB) for a detention hearing and its written reasons were found to be not signed. 4) With respect to the assessment of decision reports, the Court held that they were created for litigation purposes as referred to in s.30(3) of the Canada Evidence Act which states that the purpose is to mete out criminal punishment or that it has a 'true penal consequence.' 5) In this case the Court also held that records kept by the Correctional Service of Canada (CSC) were inadmissible as business records under the business record exception to the hearsay rule as enacted by s. 30 of the Criminal Code. 6) On the issue of costs, the court ordered costs in the amount of $10,000 to be paid by the Crown to the defence. 7) The court also ordered general damages to the accused for breach of bail and disbursements of solicitor-client costs. 8) The CPB's written reasons for detaining the respondent in custody were found not to be signed. 9) On appeal"

He was sentenced to 5 years imprisonment after having been given credit of 1 year for the time served on remand. The appellant appeals both his conviction and sentence. On the conviction appeal the appellant raises a technical ground in relation to the manner in which the appellant was charged as well as issues of the propriety and fairness of the cross-examination of himself by Crown counsel, the admissibility of his criminal record at trial, and the admissibility of opinion evidence proved in the testimony of the Crown's expert witness on accident reconstruction. He also argues that the trial judge failed to find that the fact that the appellant was impaired at the time of the collision was the cause of the collision and that his conclusion was unreasonable and against the weight of the evidence. HELD: Appeal dismissed.  1) The trial judge has a discretion pursuant to R. v. Corbett, [1988] 1 S.C.R. 670, to exclude prejudicial evidence of prior convictions in an appropriate case. This discretion is exercised by the trial judge on the application of an accused at the close of the Crown's case. See R. v. Underwood, [1998] 1 S.C.R. 77. As such an application was not raised in this case, and the questioning about previous convictions by the Crown was not objected to when it occurred, and the issue of the appellant's previous alcohol related offences was raised in the appellant's own examination in chief, this court concludes that there is no basis for this Court to conclude that the cross-examination was inappropriate or that the evidence adduced was inadmissible.  2) It is not proper for Crown counsel to ask an accused on cross-examination to explain the testimony of a Crown witness, and that it is highly unfair and prejudicial to require an accused to agree with a Crown witness or stigmatize that witness as a 'liar'. Crown counsel should not have put these sorts of questions and the trial judge ought not to have permitted them. Defence counsel did not object to them. However, this Court is not satisfied that this error had any effect on the trial and this ground of appeal fails.  3) The Crown elicited opinion evidence from Constable Gibson in the area of accident reconstruction. No evidence was at any time offered as to his expertise to do so, other than his curriculum vitae, which was filed. This witness's evidence as to how the bodies might have moved in the vehicle in the course of the collision and its aftermath, and in particular, his conclusory opinion that Ms. McDermott was the passenger and Mr. Bear the driver, ought not to have been received in the absence of a ruling that he was qualified as an expert in relation to those matters, and that his expertise was necessary in relation to the subject matter of his testimony, and that his opinion was based on facts before the Court. 4) The appellant was charged and convicted with offences pursuant to s. 255(2) and s. 255(3) of the Criminal Code. The appellant argues that conviction requires that the appellant has been charged with an offence pursuant to s. 253(a). There is no merit in this ground of appeal. Impaired driving causing death and bodily harm are routinely charged in this manner. 5) This Court's review of the cross-examination of the appellant supports the trial judge's assessment of it as unbelievable. In light of the trial judge's findings of credibility, and the results of the DNA analysis of the samples taken, the evidence overwhelmingly supports the verdict reached by the trial judge that the appellant was driving. The conclusory opinions expressed by Constable Gibson in relation to the movements of the occupants in the truck, and as to who was driving the vehicle, played no meaningful role in a conclusion that was, compelled by the remaining evidence. Notwithstanding the errors apparent in the receipt of opinion evidence from Constable Gibson, there was no substantial miscarriage of justice. The appeal from conviction is dismissed. 6) The trial judge did not commit any error of principle in coming to the conclusion that an appropriate sentence was 6 years imprisonment. While the sentence is at the high end of the available range, it is not outside the range available in the circumstances of this case.","The appellant was convicted by a Queen's Bench judge sitting alone and found guilty of operating a motor vehicle while his ability to operate the vehicle was impaired by alcohol, thereby causing the death of Tanya Bergen, contrary to s. 255(3) of the Criminal Code, and causing bodily harm to Helen McDermott. He was sentenced to five years imprisonment after having been given credit of 1 year for the time served on remand. He appealed both his conviction and sentence imposed. HELD: Appeal dismissed. 1)The trial judge clearly has discretion, pursuant to Corbett, to exclude prejudicial evidence of prior convictions in an appropriate case. However, this discretion is exercised by the trial judge on the application of an accused at the close of the Crown's case. As such an application was not raised in this case, the questioning about previous criminal convictions by the Crown was not objected to when it occurred, and the issue of whether it was the appellant who was the driver of the truck at the time the collision occurred. 2)The appellant's evidence as to how the bodies might have moved within the vehicle in the course of the collision and its aftermath was prejudicial. It is clear that the existence of an alcohol related record was raised by the appellant's own counsel and that the extent to which he had an 'alcohol problem' was put in issue. 3)In all of the circumstances of this case the appellant was, in the context, prejudiced by the questions and the responses of his own counsel. In the context of the entire cross-examination, these questions and his responses were relatively innocuous and did not play a major role in the evidence of the appellant."
d_2013skca10.txt,"The appellant plead guilty to two counts of sexual assault, was declared a dangerous offender and sentenced to an indeterminate sentence. The appellant appealed the sentence arguing that the sentencing judge failed to give adequate consideration to the assessment of two expert witnesses who testified that they thought the appellant should be found a long-term offender. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. The sentencing judge was not bound to accept the assessment of the experts. Both experts testified that the appellant's risk to reoffend sexually was moderate to high and was extremely high if he did not receive treatment. Both experts based their opinions, in part, on the idea that the appellant had been a model inmate. Both experts believed the appellant's self report about his behaviour in custody, despite having reached the conclusion that he was a pathological liar. Both experts appeared to take the accused at face value when he said he was motivated to change. In fact, the evidence from correctional officials suggested that the appellant was prone to violent, aggressive and irrational behaviour in custody. He had shown on numerous occasions that he would not follow the rules in the institution and had been involved in several attempts to smuggle drugs into the jail, including picking up a package in the washroom of the court house during his dangerous offender hearing and convincing his lawyer to bring his baby into the jail with drugs in his diaper. The accused had committed two sexual assaults within months of being released from a previous sexual assault sentence. The trial judge was correct to emphasize protection of the public and was entitled to discount the opinion of the experts because it was based on incorrect assumptions. In supporting the sentencing judge's opinion that the accused would not take treatment because he refused to accept responsibility for his offences, the Court of Appeal noted that the accused had stated in his Notice of Appeal that he was serving a life sentence for two sexual assaults that he did not commit and the fact that he sent a letter to the Court saying that he had been falsely accused and did not sexually assault anyone. In addition, the Court considered fresh evidence that the appellant had refused to transfer to another institution in order to participate in high-intensity sex offender treatment pending his appeal.","After the defendant pled guilty to two counts of sexual assault, the Court declared him a dangerous offender and sentenced him to an indeterminate sentence. The defendant appealed. He argued that during the dangerous offender hearing the judge failed to give adequate consideration to the experts' assessment of the two expert witnesses who both recommended that he be declared a long-term offender instead of an dangerous offender. He also conceded that the trial judge's view that the defendant was not willing to take treatment because he refused to accept responsibility for the sexual assaults was prophetic. He followed this up with a letter to the court stating that he was doing a life sentence for two sexual assaults that he did not commit. He then proceeded to commit another sexual assault against a young prostitute whom he had picked up and brought to the defendant's assistance. This offence occurred in 2002 and 2003 respectively. Both the defendant and the prostitute had been in custody since July 2005 for four degrading sexual assaults upon vulnerable women and had yet to take the high intensity sexual offender treatment which the experts acknowledged was pre-requisite for rehabilitation. Defendant appeals from this sentence. HELD: Appeal dismissed. 1) The judge was not bound to accept the assessment of two experts who were premised upon two assumptions. The first being that the reports of the defendant on remand were true and second, he assumed that the same individual was genuine when he stated he wanted to change. The second assumption was that the evaluations of the experts were based upon fact. The judge instructed himself properly on the law and noted the appropriate authorities in order to decide the contested issue, namely the third point in s. 753.1(1) of the Criminal Code which states that there is a reasonable possibility of eventual control of risk in the community. The third and fourth assumptions, which were not emphasized by the judge, were not overemphasized by the appeal judge. 2) The defendant was found to be in good health and appeared to be doing well in the early stages of his rehabilitation. His rehabilitation efforts were focused on reducing his risk of re-occurrence of sexual offences. The fact that he had not committed any of the offences and was willing to cooperate with the assessment was a sufficient reason to impose an indefinite sentence of indefinite imprisonment. 3) There are countless other examples of defendant's disruptive and violent behaviour while incarcerated that would deter others from participating in sexual offender rehabilitation programs. However, the defendant has not shown that he has committed these offences. He has consistently refused to participate in rehabilitation programs and has refused to denounce them."
d_2006nsca24.txt,"In the context of a divorce proceeding, the husband filed an interlocutory application for, inter alia, the termination of spousal support, and the sale of the matrimonial home. The Chambers judge ordered that the matrimonial home be sold and the assets equally divided between the spouses. The wife appealed. Appeal allowed; certain provisions of the Order struck or temporarily lifted to permit the parties a reasonable opportunity to make timely alternative arrangements to resolve the matters in issue consensually, short of selling the matrimonial home; the court's intervention was necessary to prevent a patent injustice. There was no mention of any division of matrimonial assets in the notice filed by the husband and in the unique circumstances of this case, it was unrealistic and unfair to address the issue of selling the house without at the same time taking into account its value and the parties' individual contributions to that value.","The husband applied for an interlocutory order that the matrimonial home be put up for sale without delay or impediment. The wife had been cut off her social assistance disability benefits and would not receive any further income until she started receiving old age security and CPP. She also sought title to her house back. The husband applied to have the home sold, claiming a reversible error in two respects: first, that he had no evidence before him to justify selling the home and divide the proceeds of sale equally between the parties, and secondly, he was influenced by irrelevant considerations relating to the behaviour of the appellant. HELD: Appeal allowed with costs. The case could not be heard again. Findings of credibility were entirely within the province and did not require any comment from the Court, should he choose to take up the case again. The facts and history of the case were obviously well known to him and it might accelerate these proceedings and bring about a more timely conclusion if he were able to hear it."
8_2007skqb419.txt,"In January 1992, the parties agreed the petitioner would pay child support of $300 per month and that it would be without tax ramifications to either party. As of September 2007, the petitioner has arrears of about $2,900. He now applies to set his child support obligation and deal with the arrears. The petitioner claims he has been paying too much in child support under the Guidelines. HELD: 1) In terms of ongoing support, it is appropriate to determine the petitioner's income on the basis of the three year average of his employment income being $21,834 and add to that the $5,100 in rental income for a total of $26,934. The petitioner is actively engaged in farming. He pursues reasonable off farm income. In the absence of something further, the Court was not prepared to impute income. He shall pay child support of $221 per month.  2) In terms of the payor's ability to pay at the time the arrears accrued, the petitioner says he was paying in excess of his legal obligation. It is true that if one looked to his employment income the table amount would be approximately half of the $300 per month non-taxable that the petitioner agreed to pay back in 1992. However, one cannot ignore the fact that he agreed to pay it. He did nothing to seek to change this obligation in all of the intervening years. The petitioner's farming operation affords the petitioner an opportunity to manage his financial affairs. By reporting a farm loss each year, the petitioner in fact pays less tax on his employment income than he would otherwise pay. In the circumstances the Court was not prepared to rescind any of the arrears.","The petitioner seeks an interim order setting his ongoing child support obligation as well as addressing the arrears. The parties subsequently entered into an agreement whereby the parties agreed the $300 per month would be greater than their legal obligation. Arrears have accumulated and the petitioner seeks to expunge them. The petitioner is part of a family farm operation. He supplements his farm income with working for part of the season at a local sporting store. This generates some rental income. The respondent takes the position that the petitioner's line 150 income does not reflect his ability to pay. HELD: 1) The child support order of December 11, 1991 was registered in this Court January 27, 1992 pursuant to s. of The Reciprocal Enforcement of Maintenance Orders Act, 1983. The Family Maintenance Act, 1997, S.S. 1997, c.C-8.2 as am. and The Children's Law Act,1997, C.F-6.1 as am are holding funds obtained through federal garnishment. 2) The respondent is cognizant of the fact he agreed to pay $300.00 per month non-taxable in 1992. He did nothing to seek to change this obligation in all of the intervening years. 3) The petitioner's farming operation affords the petitioner an opportunity to manage his financial affairs. By reporting a farm loss each year the petitioner in fact pays less tax on his employment income than he would otherwise pay. In the circumstances the Court was not prepared to rescind any of the payments."
2011skpc153.txt,The accused was charged with dangerous driving. The evidence established that the accused was observed driving a black Mustang that accelerated quickly from a red light. The police officer observed the vehicle accelerate over a period of two to three blocks and used radar to clock the vehicle's top speed at 140 km/hr. The posted speed limit is 60 km/hr. The intersection was near a church and school yard. There is a bend in the street near where this speeding occurred. HELD: The accused was convicted of dangerous driving. The accused was travelling well over twice the posted speed limit for that portion of roadway. The bend in the road adds to the danger. The accused was driving within the confines of a city and his actions were planned and deliberate. His conduct is a marked departure from the standard expected of a reasonably prudent driver.,"The accused was charged with operating a motor vehicle on a highway in a manner that was dangerous to the public contrary to s.249(1)(a) of the Criminal Code. HELD: The accused was found guilty. The evidence was straightforward and uncontradicted. The accused voluntarily undertook to drive his vehicle and accelerate to this rate of speed for a short period of time, a marked departure from the standard expected for reasonably prudent drivers. The driving must be amarked departure from that of a reasonably prudent driver. The mens rea was inferred from the driving conduct."
8_2008skqb481.txt,"FIAT: The applicant seeks an order setting aside a wage assessment certificate issued by the Director of the Labour Standards Branch (the Director) and filed with this Court. The applicant disputes liability for the amount set out in the wage assessment and claim that he inadvertently and innocently missed the time within which to file an appeal. The issues are whether this Court has jurisdiction to set aside the Director's certificate filed with the Court of Queen's Bench, if so what criteria ought to be applied in determining whether the Court should exercise its discretion and whether the applicant has satisfied the criteria. HELD: 1) Even though an appeal from a wage assessment to the appeals board and an appeal from an adjudicator to the Court of Queen's Bench both require 'appeals' within '21 days', an appeal to the Court of Queen's Bench is a true appeal while an 'appeal' to the appeals board is essentially a request for a de novo hearing. Consequently, this Court concludes that the consequences of missing the time limitation are not necessarily the same. 2) This Court does have jurisdiction to deal with an applicant's request, on a director appeal, because it is not a 'true appeal' that questions a decision made by an independent adjudicator after a hearing. Accordingly, the reasoning of this Court in Farmers of North America Inc. v. Langridge, 2004 SKQB 375, is not applicable. A finding that this Court is without jurisdiction to set aside a judgment, obtained without any independent adjudicative process, regardless of the basis upon which that judgment was obtained, is inequitable and at odds with existing practices and procedures. Section 62.4(4) of The Labour Standards Act states that a certificate filed pursuant to s. 62.4(3) has the same force and effect as if it were a judgment obtained in the Court of Queen's Bench for the recovery of a debt. This Court certainly would have jurisdiction to determine whether or not the applicant's application to open up a noting for default should be granted pursuant to Rule 114(3), Rule 271 and Rule 346. It follows that this Court is able to look behind the filing and examine the circumstances under which that judgment was entered. The Court of Queen's Bench is a superior Court charged with the administration of justice and enjoys inherent as well as statutory jurisdiction. This inherent jurisdiction cannot be removed by either level of government without constitutional amendment. 3) It is fair and equitable to apply, by analogy, the principles and resulting rules formulated relating to opening up a default judgment to the applicant's request to set aside the judgment registered in circumstances where he has failed to file an appeal disputing a wage assessment to the registrar of appeals.  4) The evidence is that the applicant is a businessman running a commercial enterprise in Foam Lake. It is expected that somebody in his position would have the savvy to read, review and understand the document, or at least seek assistance from someone who could help him. The applicant either failed or declined to read, or chose to ignore, the plain language of the documents served on him by registered mail. This amounts to wilful blindness at the very least. Numerous cases hold that wilful blindness is not sufficient reason to set aside a noting for default. In these circumstances the Court is not prepared to exercise its discretion in favour of setting aside the Director's certificate filed as a judgment of this Court.","FIAT: The applicant brings an application seeking an order setting aside a certificate issued by the Director of the Labour Standards Branch and filed with the Court of Queen's Bench. The applicant disputes liability for the amount set out in the wage assessment and claims that he inadvertently and innocently missed the time within which to file an appeal. HELD: 1) The Court does have jurisdiction to deal with an applicant's request, on a director appeal, because it is not a true appeal that questions a decision made by an independent adjudicator after a hearing. 2) There is no dispute as to whether the applicant was served with the documentation by registered mail. The registered letter clearly stipulates that should the applicant wish to appeal he must take certain steps within 21 days. 3) The applicant either declined to read, or chose to ignore, the plain language on the document. This, at the very least, amounts to wilful blindness. 4) The application is to be made as soon as possible after the judgment sought to be set aside comes to the attention of the applicant in the event of any delay. An adjudicator appeal is essentially a request for a de novo hearing. 5) There are at least two bases upon which it can be found that the Court is clothed with jurisdiction to exercise its discretion and provide remedy in appropriate circumstances. The first is that the principles and the rules that flow from them and which have developed in relation to the opening up of noting for default and in setting aside default judgments ought not be limited to situations where judgment of this Court was obtained as a result of the failure of an employer who has missed the 21 day limitation for the recovery of debt. The second is that there is no provision in the Act allowing for an extension of time in which to bring an appeal outside of the mandatory time limitation for that time. In such circumstances, the Court has jurisdiction to set aside the certificate. Time limits must be strictly enforced. Time is not given to applications that ask for a hearing or to requests that are set aside before a hearing can proceed to adjudication. The Court is not obliged to open up a judgment on the basis of that failure."
9_2008skca107.txt,"This appeal arises from a dispute between the appellant, Dr. Huerto and the respondent Government of Saskatchewan, over the payment for medical services provided by Dr. Huerto to his patients. Over a period of approximately 10 years, the Government withheld payment in relation to what eventually amounted to some 12,000 of the appellant's accounts. The Government indicated through the use of a billing code, that the accounts would not be paid until further information was provided. The appellant believed the use of the billing code was unlawful and chose not to provide additional information. He started an action in the Court of Queen's Bench to compel payment of his accounts. His claim was largely dismissed on the basis that the action was premature. The appellant appeals from the Queen's Bench ruling and the Government cross-appeal in relation to the limited aspect of the case in which Dr. Huerto enjoyed success. HELD: Appeal and Cross-appeal dismissed.  1) Section 17(1)(c) of The Saskatchewan Medical Care Insurance Act is to the effect that the intention and purpose of the Act is not to establish a medical care insurance plan under which 'the exercise of professional judgment by physicians is in any way diminished'. This broad statement of principle should not be read so aggressively as to mean the Government, as the payor in a publicly funded health care system, has no right to ask questions about the accounts presented for payment by physicians. The Government has not denied payment of the appellant's accounts. Nor has it received the requested information from the appellant. The actions (the Protocol) taken by the Government cannot be characterized as an amendment of the Payment Schedule. The Protocol is an administrative tool which sets out the situations in which the appellant will be asked for further information about the provision of specific services. This is fully in line with the terms of the Schedule. 2) Section 5(1) of the Regulations should not be read as meaning the Government is entitled to ask for additional information about a service if, and only if, the nature of the service is 'unusual'. Rather, it simply stipulates that additional remarks must be included in an account rendered with respect to an unusual service. This does not imply the government can request extra information only in relation to an unusual service. A physician's obligation to include certain material in an account and the Government's authority to ask for additional information are ultimately two quite different things. 3) The Court does not accept that the appellant's claims were barred by s. 16(1) of the Act. It would be perverse to read the Act as requiring that, in order for an account to be paid, every bit of information demanded by the Government through the use of a billing code, or otherwise, must be supplied before the expiration of the 6 month period established by the Regulations. An account submitted the day before the expiration of the 6 month deadline would be voided by the application of the billing code. An account submitted well in advance of the expiration of the 6 month period would also be effectively denied if a request for further information was not made until at or near the end of the six month time limit, with the result that there was insufficient time for a physician to respond before that limit was exceeded. These potential problems are especially troublesome because there is an element of subjectivity in the application of the Protocol and even the most diligent physician might not accurately anticipate when an account or accounts will attract a request for extra comment. 4) The Court cannot accept the Government's submission that the trial judge should have declined to deal with the appellant's claim because the appellant had not fully pursued possible appeals to the Medical assessment Board. The Legislature in s. 40(3) of the Act has expressly provided that the appeal procedure established pursuant to the Act does not prejudice a physician's right to pursue matters in the courts. It stands entirely at odds with the notion that the appeal procedures in the Act should be read as being comprehensive and exhaustive.","Dr. Huerto commenced an action against the Government in the Court of Queen's Bench to compel payment of his accounts. Over a period of approximately 10 years, the Government withheld payment in relation to what eventually amounted to some 12,000 of his patients. He appealed from the Queen’s Bench ruling which held that the Government had no authority to create an individualized payment schedule for medical services provided by the physician. He argued that the trial judge should have declined jurisdiction because the physician had failed to take advantage of the internal appeal procedures available to him. The Government cross-appealed on the basis that the Protocol and MCIB's related use of the AU code are invalid because they amount to an attempt to regulate his pattern of practice. HELD: Both the appeal and the cross appeal must be dismissed. 1) The principles of the Payment Schedule are not inconsistent with s. 17(1)(c) of the MCIA. However, the application of the Protocol is necessary to understand the broad outline of the scheme which governs payment for physician services in Saskatchewan. 2) There are situations where the Government has the right to ask for additional information before agreeing to pay an account. The Protocol is best characterized, perhaps among other things, as a means by which MCIB, on behalf of the Government, can request further information in circumstances where there are concerns about the relationship between the service covered by an account and other services. 3) In this case, the physician chose not to respond to the requests for further information, or to make any reasonable effort to do so, rendered this aspect of his claim premature. 4) The large majority of his claims are barred because they were not submitted within 6 months of the date the services in question were provided.  5) The trial judge awarded him 30 percent of the billings for 16 patients for whom he had submitted additional information in April 1996. He declined to award any damages with respect to the rest of the accounts."
4_2005nssc253.txt,"The plaintiff in a rear end motor vehicle accident applied for summary judgment and an interim payment. The defendant argued that there was an arguable issue to be tried in that even if one accepted the plaintiff's evidence, there was the issue of contributory negligence to be considered. The defendant also argued that he did not see any brake lights on the plaintiff's vehicle and thus there was an issue as to whether or not they were working. Application for summary judgment granted as to liability with damages to be assessed; application for interim payment dismissed. There was no 'air of reality' to the defence; to strike the plaintiff's vehicle from behind on these facts meant that the defendant was travelling too close or didn't have proper care or control of his vehicle. However, the affidavit evidence showed that there were several other factors affecting the plaintiff's health besides the injuries sustained in the motor vehicle accident; serious issues existed between the parties at to whether or not the plaintiff's injuries sustained in the motor vehicle accident resulted in any ongoing inability to work in any capacity; any amount of assessed damages which might be arrived at would largely depend upon credibility and the medical evidence at trial.","This was an application for an order for summary judgment pursuant to Civil Procedure Rule 13.01 and an interim payment under Rule 31.01. The plaintiff was operating her motor vehicle and said in her affidavit that she was struck from behind by the defendant. The defendant argued there were significant other factors that would contribute in significant way to her current health complaints. Defence argued there was no 'air of reality' to the plaintiff's argument. Application allowed; judgment entered against the defendant with costs in the cause of the action. Although there was an air of reality to the defendant's argument, it was not the function of the court to determine the matter of an interim payments to make findings of credibility or even to dwell on them. There was a risk that the plaintiff might be unable to establish the motor vehicle accident resulted in her suffering injuries. Judgement was entered against both the defendant and the plaintiff on the basis of conflicting reports and material from both parties. It is not the court's role to determine whether a summary judgment is appropriate, but rather to order an order of interim payment."

The marriage had been traditional, with the wife being the primary caretaker of the children. Both children were heavily involved in sporting activities and the father felt that since he was retired, he would be better able to ensure their attendance at various games and practices. The mother, who had recently commenced employment as a social worker, felt that the current interim arrangement was difficult for the children in that they would forget their school books at the other parent's residence and were sometimes left alone for extended periods at the father's residence. Children placed in the custody and primary care of the mother; until the separation, the mother had been the primary caretaker of the children and she appeared to have a stronger emotional bond with them; the father had been physically, emotionally and verbally abusive to the wife throughout the marriage and seemed incapable of putting the children's needs above his own; and the mother was much more likely than the father to encourage the children to have contact with the other parent. Although the father was retired and might have more time to spend with the children, this did not outweigh all of the other factors.","The parties, who were married in 1986 and had four children, separated in 2004.

The respondent, who was 65 years old and retired from the federal government, drove a cab on a part-time basis. The wife was the primary parent and had three children from their first marriage. They separated in October 2005. They have not resumed cohabitation as husband and wife since that date. There is no possibility of reconciliation.

The applicant demonstrated there was a serious question to be tried but failed to demonstrate it would suffer irreparable harm. The delay (the action was commenced February 16, 1998) was considered.

(the defendant) from producing and marketing potassium sulphate and restraining the defendants from selling, marketing or otherwise disposing of it during the life of the injunction. The factual foundation upon which the applicant relies is that the plaintiff entered into the Technology Licensing Agreement with the view to considering Big Quill's application for an interlocutory injunction restraining and prohibiting them from using the technology licensed to it by the defendant. The defendant denies that it has a proprietary interest in the scientific principles for which the agreement was signed.

The application for leave to cross-examine is granted.","The plaintiffs applied for certification of a proposed multi-jurisdictional class action involving Paxil (paroxetine hydrochloride), a prescription drug approved in Canada for the treatment of depression, anxiety disorder, panic disorder and other conditions. The plaintiffs claim that Paxil is ineffective and harmful to persons under 18 years of age. An affidavit sworn by the respondent states that there was an increased risk of adverse events including but not limited to suicide, suicidal tendencies, aggressiveness, hostility and mania associated with the use of Paxil but have continuously failed to warn consumers. HELD: The application for leave to cross-examine is granted. The cross-examination will not result in an injustice to the respondent but will assist the Court in applying the criterion set out in ss. 6 and 6.1 of The Class Actions Act to the certification application.  1) The common issues being put forward for certification will not enable the respondent to recover anything for the issues important to him. He will be confined to pursuing an individual claim. 2) The applicant has assured the plaintiff that the proposed cross- examination is expected to take no more than 1/2 day and it will be conducted at any reasonable location chosen by the applicant and plaintiffs' counsel. 3) The Court will be assisted by as full picture as possible of the nature and scope of the proposed litigation, including an indication of what may be ambiguous, expanding or narrowing the scope of what is said in the affidavit, or exploring matters going to the credibility of the affiant."
e_1991canlii4217.txt,"The plaintiff appealed the defendant's decision to grant a partial tax refund only under the Health Services Tax Act. The plaintiff had sought a full refund of tax paid on refrigeration equipment at a pickled herring plant (whose product was to be supplied on contract overseas) on the ground the equipment was used in the 'manufacture or production of goods for sale.' The contract stipulated that most of the processing occur at controlled cold temperatures. The defendant apportioned tax based on the time the equipment was used in the actual 'transformation or conversion' of the product. For the plaintiff, that (1) the tax exemption did not depend on the extent to which the equipment was used in the manufacturing process; and (2) since the contract required most of the process to occur under refrigeration, the use of a cold room was part of the 'manufacture or production' of the product.","Continental Seafoods applied for a refund of health services tax paid on refrigeration equipment which was installed in a new facility for pickled whole herring. This product was mainly to be supplied on contract to the Soviet Union. The contract contained stringent quality specifications, including a phase where the pickling occurs in a cooler facility for 28 to 45 days at a strictly controlled temperature of 0ºC to ‑2ºC. The use of a cold room in the process performed a function that was part of the manufacture or production of the product. The claim for refund was dismissed and the assessment for health services conducted by the Provincial Tax Commissioner upheld. The appellant contended the Minister and the Commissioner were incorrect in not allowing the exemption in full. In reviewing the history of the legislation and particularly s. 10(1)(h)(I) and (j), it was concluded that the exemption does not depend on the degree to which the goods are used in the manufacturing process. The issue was whether the tax paid should have been apportioned based on the use of the refrigeration facility. HELD: The appeal was allowed and the appellant was awarded its costs. 1)The practice of apportionment of tax on a prorated basis was rejected in Silver Spoons Desserts. Enterprises Ltd. v. Nova Scotia (Minister of Finance), 77 N.S.R. (2d) 363; 191 A.P.R.(1j) and 327 (S.C.A.D.) (Attorney General) which determined there is no power under the Act for the Commissioner to assess a tax on an ex parte basis on the extent the machinery or equipment is used in manufacturing or production. It would appear that the practice has been rejected here. 2)Continental paid no Health Services tax in that it was directly paid by the two contractors. The insurer was the only party with the right to seek refund."
3_2000canlii19624.txt,"The accused was charged with operating a motor vehicle while impaired contrary to s.255(1) and s.253(a) of the Criminal Code and with having consumed alcohol in such a quantity that his blood alcohol concentration exceeded .08 contrary to s.253(b) and s.255(1). The accused contended his right to be secure against unreasonable search and seizure as guaranteed by s.8 of the Charter and his right not to be arbitrarily detained or imprisoned as guaranteed by s.9 of the Charter were breached. In issue was whether the RCMP officer had the jurisdiction to carry out his duties as a peace officer in the City of Prince Albert; if so, was he acting in the lawful execution of his duties in conducting random stop. HELD: The accused was found guilty of driving with a blood alcohol level greater than .08. A judicial stay was entered in relation to the impaired count on which he would have been found guilty if it were necessary. 1)The language used by Parliament in the Royal Mounted Police Act is clear, broad and unambiguous as it was their obvious intention to create a police force that operates without jurisdictional barriers throughout the entire country of Canada. When there is a limitation on their duties it is clearly stated. The Police Act does not mention any exclusivity between one force and another. Given the ultra vires statute construction doctrine it would not be appropriate for provincial legislation to take away powers given by the Federal legislation. The Police Act must be read in context as providing a manner of funding policing not a manner of taking away jurisdiction granted to RCMP officers. 2)The law is now clear that the police can detain vehicles as long as they do so for the purposes of checking for sobriety, licences, ownership, insurance and other mechanical fitness of motor vehicles. The R. v. Emke decision is outdated. 3)The officer was acting in the lawful execution of his duty. There was no breach of the accused's rights under the Charter.","The accused was charged with operating a motor vehicle while impaired contrary to s. 255(1) and s. 253(a) of the Criminal Code, and driving while over the legal border in violation of s. 27(5) of that Act. The police officer was on duty in uniform and driving a marked police vehicle when he observed the accused and passenger, both in the front seat and in the mid rear, proceeding west on 28th Street. The vehicle signaled right and the officer observed an out of date sticker on it's license plate. The officer engaged the police lights and observed the vehicle hit the curb, bounced off the curb and then proceeded to stop within 30 feet of the vehicle. He asked the driver why he had not stopped and the accused gave a strong reply saying that he was in the lawful execution of his duty and that he had 'all the powers, authority, protection and privileges that a peace officer has by law.' The officer concluded that the words 'are assigned' refer to the three distinct objects and not to specific areas of jurisdiction where Royal Canadian Mounted Police officers are employed within the province. The accused blew 170 and 160 on the breathalyser tests and 160 and 160 respectively on the second and third tests. He was arrested at 11:50 p.m. on the same night. The RCMP are responsible for policing in every part of Canada. They are not responsible to operate in any specific geographic area unless there is an agreement between the province and the federal government. The Police Act must be read in context as providing a manner of funding policing not as taking away jurisdiction granted to R.C.M.P. officers by the Crown. The ultra vires statute construction doctrine, it would not be appropriate for provincial legislation to take away powers given by Federal legislation, but would be appropriate in a manner in which the legislature exceeded its jurisdiction."
2_2002nssc284.txt,"Following a four day trial, the plaintiffs were successful in the recovery of the sum of $29,150 against the defendant. Under the usual tariff, costs would be fixed at $4,725. The plaintiffs sought substantially increased costs on the basis that the defendant should have admitted liability at the outset rather than forcing the plaintiffs to trial. Solicitor and client fees totaled over $21,000. Costs fixed at $10,000 plus disbursements; there was no obligation on the defendant to admit liability but considering the amount of legal fees incurred in relation to the amount recovered, it was appropriate to go outside the tariffs.","Counsel had been unable to agree on costs after a four day trial. The plaintiffs were successful in recovering the base amount claimed but did not succeed in their claims for aggravated and punitive damages. The defendant should be substantially increased above the usual party and party costs because, as he contended, the trial extended over 4 days and it did not unduly prolong the proceeding. Costs should be calculated on the amount involved under Tariff A.  Costs awarded to the plaintiffs plus disbursements of $1,050.00 plus $2,957.83 for a total of $21,663.48. This may appear to be a disproportionate amount of costs in view of the relatively moderate recovery rate the plaintiffs were able to recover. However, the plaintiffs are entitled to recover their own money and there was no cost to the defendant at the outset."
2_2002nspc20.txt,"The defendant plead guilty for failing to comply with s. 153(1) of the Income Tax Act for failing to remit to the Receiver General of Canada money deducted and withheld from salaries, wages, or other remuneration paid to its employees. A fine was imposed pursuant to s. 238(1) of the Act. The defendant had filed for bankruptcy and argued that under s.168.1 of the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act, he is discharged from all debts except matters referred to in subsection 178(1) of that Act.S. 238(1) of the Income Tax Act, falls within the definition of any fines, penalties, and restitution order as set out in s. 178(1) of the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act.  The Court's jurisdiction to make an order pursuant to s. 238(1) of the Income Tax Act is unaffected by a bankruptcy proceeding.","The respondent had pled guilty to 12 counts under the Income Tax Act failing to remit to the Receiver General, money deducted and withheld from salaries, wages or other remuneration paid to the employees of Halifax Regional Protection Services Limited (HMPS) by failing to make payment of $22,069.23 to Canada Customs and Revenue Agency. Following the tender of guilty pleas and the imposition of fines, the Crown sought an order of compliance pursuant to the provisions of s. 238(2) of the Income tax Act, ordering the respondent to make payments of the total sum of $25,758 to the receiver. At issue was whether the Crown had jurisdiction to issue an order pursuant to s241(2), ordering the payment of the amount of $21,758 or some part thereof by the respondent. HELD: The respondent was found to be an officer and director of HRS at all times material to these offences. He operated the company with another unnamed investor. The Crown did not contest the Defence submission that the accountant and investor were officers, directors or shareholders in HRS. It was not established that either of these individuals held substantial amounts of money in their financial circumstances or the prospect of recovery from them. The evidence and submissions did not establish the existence of the matters set out in s232(2). The Court concluded that the Crown's jurisdiction to make an order under s241 (1) was unaffected by the bankruptcy proceedings and the certificate of discharge arising therefrom. The respondent's ability to pay by him was not relevant."
4_2017skqb205.txt,"Civil Procedure – Queen’s Bench Rules, Rule 3-72, Rule 3-84Statutes – Interpretation – Enforcement of Money Judgments Act, Section 5, Section 8 The proposed plaintiff, Alternatifbank (Abank) applied pursuant to Queen’s Bench rules 3-72 and 3-84 to be added as a plaintiff to the action of the plaintiff, Sekerbank, against the defendants and to amend the statement of claim. ABank asserted a debt claim against the defendants. The defendants applied pursuant to s. 8 of The Enforcement of Money Judgments Act (EMJA) to terminate the preservation order, which prohibited any dealings with 850,000 shares, or alternatively they sought an order reducing the number of shares subject to the order and requiring the plaintiff to post $3 million as security pursuant to s. 5(7) of the EMJA and $40,000 security for costs. Regarding ABank’s application, it argued that its claim in debt against the defendant arose out of the same transaction based on the allegation that Arslan transferred the shares to a trust (the other defendant was the trustee) in June 2013, the time at which he stopped paying his debts in full and thus denied it the opportunity to collect its debt. ABank sought the same relief as Sekerbank: judgment against both defendants under The Fraudulent Preferences Act and The Fraudulent Conveyances Act. The defendants argued that the limitation period that applied to ABank’s claim had expired and the application should be denied. Regarding the defendants’ application, they argued that the plaintiff’s strategy in the Saskatchewan action was to await the outcome of the proceedings they had initiated in Turkey against the plaintiff. The Saskatchewan action was independent from the Turkish action, and the plaintiff’s approach was unacceptable in the circumstances of the preservation order made against them in 2014. The plaintiff had not prosecuted its actions against them without delay as required by s. 5(c) of the EMJA. The defendants asserted that the share prices increased since 2014 and were now worth $18 million more than the plaintiff’s claim. If the preservation was not terminated, they requested that the number of shares be reduced to 100,000. HELD: The proposed plaintiff’s application was granted. The defendants’ application to terminate the preservation order or to reduce the number of shares subject to the order was dismissed. The court ordered the plaintiff to post $1 million as security under the EMJA and an additional $40,000 as security for costs. The court found that although the limitation period had expired, it would add ABank as a plaintiff and amend the statement of claim pursuant to s. 20 of The Limitations Act, because to do so would not create a wholly new proceeding and the defendants had not provided evidence that they would suffer prejudice. The preservation order was not terminated after the court reviewed the history of the proceedings in both Saskatchewan and Turkey and found that the plaintiff had not failed to prosecute its action without delay. The court found that there was insufficient evidence to justify the reduction in the number of shares subject to the order.  The information of the value of the security fell short of demonstrating a sufficient change in circumstances, especially in light of the addition of ABank’s claim. The court found that the order should be modified under s. 5(7) of the EMJA to have the plaintiff provide security because there was evidence that the trust may have suffered and could suffer losses in the future as a result of the order. The order for security for costs was justified based on the considerations specified in Queen’s Bench rule 4-24.","The defendants applied to terminate the preservation order pursuant to s. 5 of The Enforcement of Money Judgments Act (EMJA). The order prohibited any dealings with 850,000 shares of Alliance Green Traders pending a final decision on the merits of the plaintiff's claims against the defendant in Turkey, and the conclusion of this action. The defendants sought an order reducing the number of shares subject to the order and requiring the plaintiff to post $3,081,463.14 as security pursuant to ss. 5(7) of the EMJA, and $40,000 security for costs. Application to amend the order was denied. The court exercised its discretion to order that the plaintiff be added as a plaintiff and that the statement of claim be amended in accordance with the draft Amended Statement of Claim."
b_2007skqb388.txt,"The accused was found not guilty of having care or control of a motor vehicle while his blood alcohol content was over .08. The certificate of analysis was excluded as a result of the trial judge's decision that the accused's s. 8 Charter Rights had been violated. The trial judge found that the officer did not have reasonable and probable grounds to make the breathalyzer demand. HELD: The trial judge erred in determining that in the totality of the circumstances it was not objectively reasonable for the officer to have relied on the accuracy of the ASD test. A new trial is ordered.  1) There is no fixed rule or formula that an officer must follow when determining whether or not to wait 15 minutes prior to administering a road side test. In this case, the trial judge appears to have concluded that the officer who administered the ASD would not have relied on the results, or should not have so relied, if her partner had informed her of the empty beer can with fresh suds in it that he found at the scene. Implicit in this finding is the conclusion that the existence of the beer can would make a difference to the officer's assessment of whether she should wait 15 minutes for any mouth alcohol to dissipate before she could rely on ASD test results. 2) The trial judge made the same error that was dealt with by the Ontario Court of Appeal in R. v. Einarson. 3) The accused told the officer that he had been drinking in the car 'earlier'. Even if the officer had been told of her partner's discovery of an empty beer can at the scene, it would not constitute 'credible evidence' that the accused consumed alcohol within that 15 minute time frame. Whether or not the accused had consumed beer within 15 minutes of taking the test on the ASD is pure speculation.","The appellant was found not guilty of having care or control of a motor vehicle while his blood alcohol content was over.08. This was the inevitable result of the trial judge's decision that the certificate of analysis could not be tendered as evidence at trial. The trial judge concluded that contrary to s. 8 of the Charter the officer did not have reasonable and probable grounds to make the breathalyzer demand and that pursuant to s24(2) the admission of the Certificate of Analysis could bring the administration of justice in disrepute. HELD: The appeal was allowed and the acquittal set aside. The appeal is set aside and a new trial must be held. 1) It was found that in the totality of the circumstances it was not objectively reasonable for the officer to have relied on the accuracy of the ASD test. In so concluding, that R. v. Novakoski, 2004 SKPC 121 (CANLII) and R v. Claypool, 2003 SKPC 116 (CanLII), all of which restated the principle of honest belief based on reasonable grounds about whether short delay is necessary to obtain reliable reading. 2) The court erred in determining that in all of the relevant circumstances it wasn't objectively possible for the police to have used the accurate test. 3) There was no pass off between the officer and the officer that the evidence was there for both of them in that the officer either did not get or did not rely upon the accurate information, such as the fact that the driver was observed leaving the bar. In such circumstances, the officer who administered the ASD would not have relied upon the results of the test in any event. 4) The mere possibility that driver has consumed alcohol within 15 minutes before taking the test on the ASD is pure speculation. Likewise, whether the wet ground near the driver's side of the vehicle was just urine is also speculation."
d_2013skqb394.txt,"HELD: The Court held that the replacement of former Queen’s Bench rule 212 requiring the production of documents “relating” to any matter in question and rule 222 permitting examination for discovery “touching” the matter in issue in the action by new rules 5-6, 5-18 and 5-25, which use the phrase: “relevant to any matter in issue”, showed the intention that the broad relevance test was no longer applicable. The test under the new Rules was whether the matter qualifies as being material to the action based upon the matter as pled and whether the evidence tends to prove or disprove the matter in issue. This inquiry must be balanced against the notion of proportionality set out in the foundational rules. The Court dismissed the application, excepting the requested order under 3) wherein the defendant would fulfill its undertaking to have certain employees provide responses. With respect to the rest of the relief requested under 1), which involved the undertaking that the defendant would search its records regarding the loading of railcars, the Court held that the as matter was not an issue in the action, based upon a review of the claim as pled. Having regard to proportionality under the new rules, the defendant should not be required to answer the question in light of the effort and expense required versus the possible benefits. The Court held that the plaintiffs were not entitled to ask the defendants to review a binder containing hundreds of pages of invoices assembled by the plaintiff regarding its expenditures incurred as a result of the derailment in order for it to advise the plaintiff which invoices the defendant believed were not related to it. It was the plaintiff’s burden to prove its damages and the defendant was not required to assist the plaintiff to do so. The plaintiff’s requested undertaking for the defendant to provide any background documents and information that went into the preparation of sketch of the railcar in question by the defendant’s adjuster was also denied. The adjuster’s file was subject to litigation privilege and unless it was tendered as evidence at trial, there was no implied waiver of that privilege. Regarding the plaintiff’s request in 2), the Court agreed with the defendants that that plaintiff’s request that the defendant answer questions now, rather than after it had completed questioning of the plaintiff, was premature. The defendant had not yet taken a position on the cause of the derailment and they would advise the plaintiff when they had developed one. Rule 5-31 makes it an ongoing obligation to correct answers and there was no evidence in this application that the rules had not been complied with. The Court awarded costs in the amount of $1,500 to the defendants due to the complexity of the application, requiring the submission of briefs of law and the amount of time taken to argue them matters in Chambers.","FIAT: The plaintiff, CN applied to the Court seeking orders that the defendants, Clarke Transport and Clarke Transport, answer certain questions which they refused to answer on discovery. The application raises interesting issues with respect to the proper scope of questioning or examination for discovery. HELD: 1) The Court found that when the Court moved from the words of touching and relating to any matter in issue, it intended to move away from the broad relevance test that existed under the former Queen's Bench Rules. 2) It is clear that the insurance adjuster's file would be subject to a litigation privilege. Clarke should not be required to answer questions which are not answered in the course of their investigation. 3) While there may be many situations where it is entirely appropriate and an efficient approach to ask a defendant whether they accept certain costs or expenses incurred as a result of the action, the approach taken here of presenting several hundred pages of invoices and other documents and asking the defendant to advise which they say relate and do not relate to the derailment is of such a nature and scale that it is not appropriate. It is ultimately a plaintiff's burden to prove its damages and a defendant is not required to assist plaintiffs to do so. 4) The applicant's refusal to provide answers to questions which were not answered on discovery is in breach of the plaintiff's (and defendant's) obligations under the Rules. 5) Although there is no unanimity of opinion as to the extent to which a matter of railcars previously loaded by Clarke may be relevant to the issue of negligence in loading the subject car, there is a continuing obligation to correct, as soon as practicable, an answer that becomes incorrect or misleading as result of new information. The Court was unable to find much to assist in that regard."

The basis of the application is that the parties participated in a Collaborative Law process whereby it is alleged that Mr. Therrien alleged that confidential information was shared. The applicant submits that it would be a conflict of interest for the lawyer, who took part in the collaborative law process, to continue to represent the applicant, as the issues have not been settled. The parties were given leave to file additional evidence on the issues which were in conflict. The additional evidence did not resolve the conflicts. HELD: The application is granted. The court ordered the withdrawal of the solicitor as counsel and the parties may proceed to a pre-trial and a trial if necessary. 1) The court agreed that the only way to resolve the conflict would be by holding a viva voce hearing. 2) The solicitor agreed to withdraw from the role of counsel so the parties could proceed to pre- trial if needed. There is no order as to costs.  3) The conflict in the facts was apparent at the time of the initial application. The new evidence does not resolve either the conflicts nor the need for an interim court order providing that the children, who were the focus of the discussions, can continue to act as their lawyer at trial. There was no evidence that either of the parties would be required to withdraw. 4) The parties agreed that they would both withdraw as counsel for the plaintiff based on the evidence.

e_2007skqb367.txt,"The plaintiff is an employee of the City of Saskatoon and member of the Union. He commenced this claim based on the Indemnity Clause contained in the Union's bylaws. The plaintiff asserts he is involved in Union related litigation and is thus entitled to the benefit of the indemnity clause. HELD: The plaintiff's application for summary judgment is dismissed. The within action is dismissed in full. 1) The essential nature of the debate between the plaintiff and the Union relates to the interpretation of the indemnity clause in the Union bylaws. This is precisely the type of internal dispute that is not within the exclusive realm of the Labour Relations Board.

He has incurred no legal fees, other than disbursements, but he nonetheless asserts that he is entitled to $50,000. The figure of $50,000 is proffered by the plaintiff as an appropriate sum as he expects the defendant has spent at least that much defending all four actions. 3) It is plain and obvious that the plaintiff's claim is grounded on an interpretation of the indemnity clause that is so illogical and inconsistent with its plain wording that it cannot succeed. The plaintiff's claim for reimbursement of costs not incurred is equally incapable of success.","The plaintiff, an employee of the City of Saskatoon and member of the Saskatoon Civic Employees' Union, commenced this action under the simplified procedure of Part 40 of The Queen's Bench Rules seeking judgment for $50,000. The plaintiff asserts he is involved in Union related litigation and is entitled to the benefit of the indemnity clause. The dispute distills to an interpretation of the terms of the Union membership contract in sum, the very type of debate contemplated by the Supreme Court in Berry v. Pulley. HELD: The Queen has jurisdiction to entertain the plaintiff's claim and his application under Rule 485 for summary judgment. 1) In the absence of a clear and enforceable provision excluding his access to the Courts, the debate in the Fourth Action is indistinguishable from the dispute in McNairn. It is plain and obvious that the plaintiff is not entitled to indemnify under the by-laws. This is exactly the type of internal dispute that is not within the exclusive realm of the Labour Relations Board. The forum for this contest is The Queen’s Bench Court.

HELD: The accused are sentenced to 40 months imprisonment for the offence of robbery with violence and 4 months consecutive for the offence of having their faces masked. Having regard for the fact that the accused have been in custody for nearly 10 months, the Court gives them two for one credit for time served in remand which is 20 months. The sentence is 2 years to be served in a federal penitentiary. The sentence takes into consideration their lengthy record of offences committed as young offenders, the gravity of the offence, the violence used against the victim, the fact that a high speed chase ensued in the city, and the need to deter not only these accused but other who might consider committing the offence of robbery.","The accuseds were found guilty after trial of committing two offences contrary to s. 344(b) of the Criminal Code and with intent to commit an indictable offence having their faces masked. The accuseds had been in custody since January 31, 2007 and were serving time on remand at the time of their appeal. The Crown sought to have the accuseds sentenced to more than two years in federal penitentiary than is presently served. HELD: 1) The Court addressed the aggravating and mitigating factors as well as the effect of the violence committed against the victim. 2) The accused's criminal records showed failure to respond to progressively longer and more restrictive sentences. The sentence that each of them will serve from this date is 2 years to be served in a federal penultimate. The Court of Appeal took into account the fact that both accuseds have lengthy record of offences committed as young offenders, the gravity of the offence, the need to deter not only these individuals but also anyone else who might consider committing the offence of robbery. They were sentenced to four months imprisonment consecutive to the sentence for the robbery with violence. 3) The sentences were based on principles outlined in s. 718 of the Code. The principles were summarized in R. v. Alexson (1996), 137 Sask. R. 236 (SK CA), 138 Sask. C.A., June 1991) and were applicable to this case.

6_2011nssc48.txt,"The two plaintiffs were forced to jump from the window of their third-floor apartment after a fire erupted in the building. The fire alarm system was not functioning and, despite being aware of previous problems with the 25-year-old system, the defendant had never maintained or inspected it; the self-closing hallway fire doors were continually in an open position; the battery-operated fire alarm in the plaintiffs' apartment was not functioning; and the plaintiffs were unaware of whether their smoke detector was wired into the building or was their responsibility. The male plaintiff suffered serious fractures to both ankles and a fractured fibula. He underwent four surgeries, was non-weight bearing for three months and was unable to run or engage in various sports. Although he had returned to work as a production worker, his condition would continue to deteriorate due to post-traumatic arthritis, most likely resulting in a future ankle fusion. The female plaintiff suffered a pelvic ring injury with bilateral pelvic and sacral fractures, a fractured elbow and a broken rib. She underwent surgery on her pelvis, was unable to look after her own hygiene for five months and developed bursitis in the hip. She continued to experience pain in the tailbone with extensive sitting and in the elbow with extension of the arm, had a permanent loss of elbow extension and walked with a limp. The worsening of her pre-existing anxiety and depression led to the diagnosis of post-traumatic stress disorder. The landlord argued that the plaintiffs' injuries had not been caused by any of its actions. Male plaintiff awarded the sum of $75,000 for general damages, $15,000 for past and future loss of valuable services and $45,000 for loss of earning capacity; female plaintiff awarded the sum of $55,000 for general damages, $35,000 for past and future loss of valuable services and $75,000 for future loss of income. Although there was no evidence that the defendant was responsible for the fire, its conduct created an unreasonable risk of harm in the event of a fire. Without evidence as to how much time the plaintiffs would have had to escape down the stairwell or how long they would have had to wait for the fire department had the smoke or fire alarms activated, the 'material contribution' test was applied to the causation issue. When the plaintiffs first awoke, the fire had already worked its way up through the attic hatch to the roof, where the flames in the eaves were visible to the plaintiffs. Smoke and fire were able to flow freely through the adjacent stairwell as a result of the fire door being left open, and the failure of the smoke detectors and fire alarms allowed the smoke and fire to progress before being detected by the plaintiffs. The female plaintiff was found to have no meaningful residual earning capacity due to the combination of her physical and psychological injuries.","The plaintiff and her partner were in an apartment building when the fire broke out. The plaintiff fell from the third floor of the building and suffered serious injuries. The defendant acknowledged it owed a duty of care to the plaintiffs to ensure they were reasonably safe from injury while residing in the premises. Liability and damages at issue in this case. Although there was no evidence the defendant was responsible for the fire, the defendant's conduct created an unreasonable risk of harm in the event of a fire. The fire alarm system was not functioning at the time of the fire and the door to the plaintiff's apartment was blackened. There were problems with the fire alarm systems not functioning prior to the fire which was known to the supervisor; the defendant did not maintain, test, inspect or inspect its fire engine system that was in excess of 25 years old; and yearly testing of the smoke alarms was required. The plaintiffs suffered damages but denied they were caused by any act or omission by the defendant."

He had obtained a Bachelor of Science degree but was unable to complete his final year of Veterinary Medicine because he had received the maximum amount of financing available. The bankrupt had been employed for 5 years as a taxi driver earning a less than average income; he lived at home with his parents; he was single with no dependents. He was reluctant to leave secure employment in an effort to obtain employment related to his educational qualifications. Counsel for the objecting creditor argued that the bankrupt had a minimal income and had the capacity to make small payments toward his obligation. HELD: An absolute order of discharge was granted in accordance with the principles of The Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act.,"The bankrupt obtained a Bachelor of Science degree in Chemistry and an Advanced Certificate in Science-Physio as a result of student loan funding. He was indebted to Canada Student Loans in the amount of $22,338.99 and Saskatchewan student loans in the amounts of $18,241.39. The Saskatchewan program objected to the automatic discharge of the bankrupt. HELD: After carefully considering the submissions and bearing in mind the objects and principles of the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act, an absolute order of discharge is appropriate.  1)The bankrupt is just shy of his 30th birthday. He is living at home and working and living with no dependents. The net income is modest and well below the superintendents guideline for a single person. The trustee, on the other hand, recommends an absolute discharge. 2)While the court was not impressed with the bankrupt's attitude, it would be futile to impose a conditional order of discharged in this situation due to his low income. The bankrupt is obviously very intelligent and capable individual. sincerely hope he finds a way to complete his degree in veterinary medicine at some point in the future."
2_2005skpc39.txt,"The accused is charged with driving while over .08 contrary to s. 255(1) and s. 253(a) of the Criminal Code and impaired driving contrary to s. s. 253(b) and 255(1) of the Code. HELD: The accused is not guilty on all counts.  1) A breath test and demand should be made as soon as the officer forms the requisite grounds for making it. Those grounds did not change between the time the accused refused to provide an ASD sample at 8:17 a.m., when the officer arrested her for impaired driving and 8:40 a.m. when the officer read the accused the breathalyzer demand. There was no reason for the breath demand not being made forthwith. The rights of the accused under s. 8 and s. 9 of the Charter were breached. 2) The officer did not have reasonable and probable grounds for making the breathalyzer demand. The officer testified she gave the ASD demand to find out if the accused had alcohol in her system. When the accused refused, the officer arrested her for impaired driving. The officer was unsure of whether the accused had alcohol in her system when she read the accused the ASD demand and there was no new evidence gathered between 8:17 a.m. and 8:40 a.m. to justify the breath demand. The evidence does not support a subjective honest belief on the part of the officer that the ability of the accused to operate a motor vehicle was impaired by alcohol. As the breath sample evidence was obtained as a consequence of the breach of the s. 8 and s. 9 Charter rights of the accused, it should be excluded from evidence pursuant to s. 24(2).  3) The accused testified that she had been drinking alcohol and was feeling the effects of the alcohol at the time she was operating the vehicle. She said she knew the alcohol would kick in and that she was not really feeling the effects until she arrived at the police station. She offered an explanation for her difficulty in driving testifying that she was tired. The evidence of the officer, which was insufficient to support a belief of impairment as a prerequisite to a breath demand, cannot prove impaired driving. There is insufficient evidence to conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused's ability to drive was impaired by alcohol at the time she was driving.","The accused was charged with two counts of impaired driving. The accused argued that the undertakings were not made forthwith or as soon as practicable and her rights under s. 8 and s. 9 of the Charter were breached. HELD: The accused was found not guilty of the two charges. The evidence of the officer did not support a belief of impairment as prerequisite to a breath demand and the breath sample evidence was insufficient to prove impaired driving beyond a reasonable doubt. As there was no evidence before the Court of the undertaking alleged in Counts 1 and 2, the accused's right to be charged with refusing to comply with the breathalyzer demand was not breached. The Court found that the officer had not reasonable and probable grounds for making the demand as the driving evidence was not gathered between 8:17 a.m. and 8:45 am. Therefore, the evidence did not Support a subjective honest belief on the part of the police officer that the ability of the accused to operate a motor vehicle was impaired by alcohol."
2_2009skpc71.txt,"Mr. Kenny is charged under The Wildlife Act Regulations, 1981 with use of a searchlight when hunting. Specifically, the section reads: 11.1(2) For the purpose of ensuring the safety of hunters and the public, a searchlight shall not be used for the purposes of hunting wildlife. The case was decided on the basis of credibility. The Court reviewed the requirements for assessing credibility and found it did not believe the accused. The Court stated that, on all the evidence, it was convinced beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused was using a searchlight for the purpose of hunting wildlife. HELD: The accused is guilty as charged.","The defendant was charged under The Wildlife Act Regulations, 1981 with the use of a searchlight when hunting. The vehicle was observed to travel approximately 14 kilometres in an easterly direction and then turn north for a short distance on the Torch Trail. At the onset of the trial, the Crown closed its case and the sole defence witness was the defendant. Although the defendant was driving slowly at night, the vehicle was under surveillance on continuous and ongoing basis for approximately 30 minutes. The three occupants of the vehicle were seated next to 30-30 rifles, one of which had one live round in the chamber and four live rounds in the magazine, the rifle that was in the back seat was loaded with live rounds and the spotlight and a cassette tape of bull and cow mating sounds were located on the rear seat of the truck. All three occupants were cooperative and cooperative with the officers who pulled them over, and admitted that they had fallen asleep within minutes of getting into the truck as they were tired from their day of hunting. There were some uncontroverted facts, all of which were consistent only with an inescapable inference that the Defendant was employing the searchlight for the purposes of hunting wildlife. The terms 'hunting' and 'wildlife' are all defined in the Act or the Regulations. The defendant stated that he had dropped his son and nephew off in the forest earlier in the day and had returned to pick them up later in the evening. However, he stated that it took him 45 minutes to arrive at the location where he picked them up, and that his two young nephews fell asleep within five minutes of driving through the forest. He acknowledged that his son had been attacked by moose earlier that day and was seriously concerned that he might have been injured by wayward moose."
b_1999skqb39.txt,HELD: The grandparents were granted access one Saturday every second month from 10:00 a.m. to 4:00 p.m. It would be in the best interests of the child to have some ongoing relationship with both his maternal and paternal grandparents. The father lived in Alberta and may not be able to exercise the degree of access he was seeking. The relationships were separate with unique characteristics.,"The paternal grandparents sought an order granting them access to their grandson R.D.G., born December 1995 pursuant to s. 6.1(1) of the Children's Law Act, 1997. The applicant paternal grandparents opposed the access and suggested that any access being exercised by the applicants should be exercised during the access periods granted to their son P.J.B. As their son does not reside in Saskatchewan but rather in Alberta, am of the view that he may well not be able to exercise the degree of access which he seeks or indeed has been granted by this Court in fiat being released concurrently with this one. HELD: 1 Saturday access period every two months would be appropriate under all the circumstances and 2 months in advance. The respondent was to fix each access period two months prior to the order.  1)It would be in the best interests of the child to have some ongoing relationship with both his maternal grandparents, and his paternal grandparents. The material satisfies me that the applicants are responsible individuals who have genuine affection and concern for the child. While they are separate relationships with unique characteristics to each of them, their relationship should be less frequent than that which would be granted to the child's father."
3_2005nssc122.txt,"The 23 year old defendant pled guilty to two counts of breaking and entering a dwelling house and one count of breaking and entering a shed. He cooperated with the police and provided evidence against his co-accused. He had a previous criminal record, which included convictions for mischief, theft, break and enter, breach of an undertaking and possession of stolen goods. Defendant sentenced to four years imprisonment; in assessing the appropriate sentence, the court allowed a credit for time already served (which was served virtually throughout in protective custody), a credit of 25% for the fact that the defendant had pled guilty and a further reduction of one and a half years for the defendant's assistance in pursuing the successful prosecution of his co-accused.","The accused, who had previously entered guilty pleas to eight counts contained in an indictment, was charged with breaking and entering and theft. The charge was originally a charge of aggravated assault but the accused plead guilty to breaking and enters and stole property. The accused was convicted of being a party to the unlawful causing of bodily harm. The evidence in the case was that the accused had a Grade X education and that he had sporadic employment over his adult years. HELD: The appropriate sentence is a term of four years and six months in a federal institution, with a period of six years incarceration. The aggravating circumstances of the offence and the fact the accused was driving his vehicle upset gave rise to the possibility of a DNA order. A further ten years incarceration would be justified."
7_2007skqb28.txt,"The respondent was charged with impaired driving contrary to s. 253(a) of the Criminal Code and driving while over .08, contrary to s. 253(b) of the Code. The Crown appeals the acquittal on the charge under s. 253(b) of the Code. At trial the Crown argued that, prior to searching the vehicle and having close contact with the accused in the police car, the RCMP officer did not have a reasonable suspicion that he had alcohol in his body and therefore did not make a screening device demand immediately. On appeal the Crown submits that the trial judge accepted this and therefore there was no unlawful detention and the lapse of 17 minutes from the time he was placed in the back of the police vehicle until a demand was made. The Crown submits that the trial judge was in error in concluding that the 17 minute delay was not warranted or necessary and that there was no breach of the accused's right to be free of arbitrary detention within the meaning of s. 9 of the Charter. HELD: The appeal is dismissed. It appears that the officer may have been anxious to search the vehicle in anticipation that more than just a charge of impaired driving could be supported. Had he proceeded with a quick search of the vehicle and then proceeded with the demand in a short time period that may have been a reasonable violation of the accused's Charter rights. It is obvious from the evidence that in the course of searching the vehicle, the police officer returned to the police vehicle where the accused was detained and he had a further conversation with him, following which he returned to continue his search of the vehicle. In the circumstances, the delay of 17 minutes from when the police officer should have made the demand but did not and detained the accused in the locked police vehicle while he conducted a search of the accused's vehicle without arresting him, advising him of his rights and conducting a search of his vehicle is a violation of potentially three separate Charter rights. The evidence of the subsequent breathalyzer and certificate of analysis is conscriptive evidence obtained following the breach of the accused's Charter rights and the trial judge properly ruled that pursuant to s. 24(2) of the Charter the evidence should be excluded and the charge dismissed.","The accused was charged with impaired driving contrary to s. 253(a) of the Criminal Code and driving while over.08 contrary to S.253(b). The Crown appealed the acquittal on the charge under s.253.(b). HELD: 1) The delay of 17 minutes from when the police officer should have made the demand but did not and detained Shire in the locked police vehicle without arresting him, advising him of his rights and conducting a search of his vehicle is a violation of Shire’s Charter rights. 2) In the circumstances of this case, which was not a random vehicle stop, the officer was aware that there was a suspected impaired driver and therefore should have been prompted to make a demand. However, the roadside demand was not made as required by s.254(2) and because there was an open container of alcohol (i.e. in a travel mug) found within easy reach of the driver. The police officer believed that he would be issuing a ticket under the Alcohol and Gaming Regulation Act and that the travel mug was found during the course of the search and after Shire had been placed in the vehicle. The officer did not have a reasonable suspicion that he had alcohol in his body and therefore did not make the demand immediately. The delay in taking the test and in advising the accused of his right to retain and instruct counsel was excusable and the charge was dismissed. 3) There were circumstances that should have prompted the officer to embark on an investigation of his possible impairment by alcohol. There were detaining and dealing with an obstreperous passenger while the search was being conducted at the side of the road. During this time the officer noted an odour of alcohol from the accused and made a roadside screening demand which resulted in a 'fail' reading. The evidence of the subsequent breathalyzer and a certificate of analysis was conscriptive evidence obtained following the breach of his Charter rights and the trial judge properly addressed that fact and properly determined that the evidence should be excluded from the evidence."
2_2008nssm16.txt,"The claimant purchaser brought an action for breach of contract and negligent misrepresentation, claiming that although the defendant vendors had advised her that there had been some damage to the chimney base in the residence, she had been told that this was a minor problem which was under repair and she had not been properly advised of a history of repeated flooding.  Following the purchase of the property, the claimant had commenced renovations and discovered extensive mould or rot throughout the basement, to such an extent that the entire basement had to be gutted, disinfected and rebuilt. She also claimed that a buried cistern was discovered in the backyard, which had been partly filled with earth but still filled up with rainwater and melted snow, and that the water had nowhere else to go but against the foundation. When the defendants brought a motion for non-suit at the conclusion of her case, the unrepresented claimant expressed surprise and dismay that her case could be dismissed before both sides had testified as she expected her remaining evidence to come out through the defendants' testimony. Motion granted; the claim against the defendants is dismissed; it is the responsibility of the buyer to verify the accuracy of the Property Condition Disclosure Statement (PCDS) and, in this case, the claimant had made no inquiry as to the statements made by the defendants of structural problems or unrepaired damage or leakage in the foundation. The claimant had notification, both in the PCDS and from her home inspector, that there were leakage problems in the basement and the inspection report had advised her of the need to make further enquiries. There was no evidence the latent defects (the cracks in the wall, the mould and the rotten wood) were visible to the defendants when they occupied the home, that there was continual leakage of which the defendants were aware or that the defendants had performed any repairs to the home during their occupancy to cover up the wood rot. Although there was evidence that the defendants were aware of the cistern and had not disclosed this to the claimant, there was no evidence to conclude that the cistern was causing the problem.","The claimant claimed $25,000 for damages for a house sale because the disclosure statement did not disclose a history of repeated flooding. The claimant alleged there was damage to the chimney base, which was under repair and the heavy rain would cause seepage in the furnace room. This was a minor problem and the sellers did not omit that the place had flooded on at least one occasion. The Claimant alleged the Defendants burned out his shop vac cleaning up water in the basement and asked to borrow the neighbours' shop vac. The shop vac was found on two different walls neither of which was the complainant's. There were watermarks coming down the cement wall behind the windows and on the floor in the recreation room. The claimants claim they suffered any damage due to any non-disclosure, misinformation or misrepresentation, nor is any damage casually connected to any act or omission of the Defendants. HELD: The claim was dismissed. The court held that it was necessary to allow the parties to present all the facts that can be proven in a court of law, which is part of the make up that is imposed upon the litigants and those that hear the case. It would appear that the case could be dismissed before both sides have testified.  1)The court found that there was no evidence of negligent misrepresentation or that the claimant had breached her contract by asking the sellers to sell the property as is. 2)The doctrine of merger was not used to determine the sufficiency of evidence but rather to determine whether there was enough evidence to support a reasonable conclusion that the claims are not present in the present state of the property. 3)The test for a non-suit motion was not set out in the judgment of the Small Claims Court but rather in the decision of a trial judge. The decision of the trial judge was based on the principles of law and was not trying to restrict the evidence. The common person is not operating on a level playing field when facing an opposing counsel with vast experience and law degree. There was no sense in limiting the evidence to the barest details. 4)The plaintiff was awarded costs of the motion."
e_1999canlii6888.txt,"The plaintiffs sued based on a contract between the parties that required the defendant to share the proceeds of milk quota sales. The defendant took the position that the contract only required the sharing of fluid milk quota sales, and not all milk quota sales. The plaintiff sought rectification of the contract to change the wording of the contract to milk quota sales from fluid milk quota sales. Finding for the plaintiff and granting rectification, that the parties clearly intended to have the contract cover all milk quota sales. The proceeds from all sales are to be divided between the parties.","The plaintiffs sought rectification of the agreement terms in regard to the sharing by all three of them in the proceeds from any sales of milk quota by the defendant. The defendants had each formed a new company under the company name of A.A. Putnam Sons Limited. The operation consisted of a dairy farm with about 250 milking cows, a beef operation, a trailer park and a gravel pit operation. The defendant sold the operation to three brothers. The three brothers each formed new company at that time with Gene owning the dairy farm and Lorne owning the trucking company. Gene became manager of the dairy operation in 1989 and was able to testify based on his knowledge of the relevant quota schemes and his experience as a result of the operation. He was also a lawyer. He drafted security documents for the defendant which showed the effective date of the new quota scheme. Gene testified that he was the drafter of the two documents and he drafted the agreements. He said he understood the agreement to mean that he and his father had to share proceeds from the sale of only Fluid Milk Quota and not all quota sold. He also indicated that he engaged an accountant for advice on possible conflict of interest. The plaintiff was awarded $33,800.00 in the amount of $45,000.00."
e_2005skqb263.txt,"Accused is charged with second degree murder in the death of his estranged wife. The Crown sought to admit into evidence a number of statements that were made by the deceased to several crown witnesses concerning two previous incidents she had with the accused in the weeks prior to her death. In the first incident, the accused is alleged to have choked the victim after he confronted her about where she had been. In the second incident the accused confronted the victim and beat and choked her and then sexually assaulted and threatened to kill her. The Crown seeks to admit this similar fact evidence and several hearsay statements to prove the issues of motive, intent and modus operandi. HELD: The statements by the deceased are not admissible. The prejudicial nature of the similar fact evidence has not been overcome by its probative value. It is well established law that similar acts and other discreditable conduct evidence is presumptively inadmissible and that similar fact evidence is the exception to this. To determine its admissibility, three things need examination, 1) the probative weight of the evidence, 2) the assessment of the prejudice and 3) the weighing of the probative value versus prejudicial value. In examining the probative weight of the evidence, factors to be considered include the issues in question, the presence or absence of collusion, similarities and dissimilarities between the facts charged and the similar fact evidence and the strength of the evidence that the events occurred. The two previous incidents are extremely prejudicial in nature leading to potential moral prejudice. That is, reprehensible nature of the assaults could lead the jury to rely on the prohibited inference that the accused is the type of person who could have committed the crime. There is also a great risk of reasoning prejudice. That is, admitting the similar fact evidence may distract the jury from their proper focus which is the second degree murder charge. There is a possibility that the jury will equate the intention to harm with the mens rea required for a murder conviction. With respect to the hearsay evidence, the Court held that statements made by the deceased to her friends, family and colleagues concerning the threats and assaults will not be admitted. The test of necessity is clearly met by the fact that the person making the statements in now deceased and not able to testify. However, the Court was concerned about the reliability of the statements since there is nothing that would serve as convincing indicia of reliability adequate to offset the absence of an oath.","The Crown sought to admit the two previous incidents of choking as similar fact evidence to prove issues of motive, intent and modus operandi. The accused was charged with assault causing bodily harm, sexual assault and threatening to kill after she confronted her husband with the information that she had previously been assaulted by him. The defence argued that the evidence had not been overcome by its probative value and it should not be admitted in order to ensure the possibility of a fair trial. HELD: The evidence was admitted as an exception to the presumptive inadmissiblilty of similar facts evidence and was admissible on a principled basis. There was a serious potential for moral prejudice based on the existence of several hearsay statements made by the accused to her friends, family and co-workers as well as the possibility that the trial judge would equate the intention to harm with the mens rea required to be convicted of murder. It was necessary to examine the issue for which the Crown seeks to adduce the evidence.  1) The trial judge must not invade the province of a trier of fact and condition admissibility of hearsay on whether the evidence is ultimately reliable. However, it will need to examine whether the circumstances in which the statement was made lend sufficient credibility to allow a finding of threshold reliability. 2) The existence of collusion, similarities and dissimilarities between the facts charged and the same facts, and the alleged intent to harm all contribute to the same circumstantial guarantees of trustworthiness. Spousal abuse is an aggravating factor for the purposes of sentencing under s. 718.2 of the Criminal Code. The reprehensible nature of the brutal assaults, even in the absence of the sexual assault, could lead the jury to rely on the prohibited inference that the accused is the type of person who could have committed the crime. There is a great risk of reasoning prejudice by admitting the same fact evidence."

The applicant obtained judgment against the respondent May 11, 1987 in the Court of Queen's Bench for Alberta in the sum of $11,634.74. Sokulski, the respondent's DEFENDANT applied to have the judgment set aside and if no appeal is taken the funds, including any accrued interest, will be paid to each of the defendants. HELD: The Court made no order as to costs as this chambers application would have been unnecessary had the proper procedures been followed in the first instance.  1)The Chambers judge exercised his discretion to set aside the judgment obtained against the non-appearing garnishees.  2)The money should be paid out. If the plaintiff has any deficiencies it must be made clear to the defendants that the Court has exclusive discretion to make payments. 3)The chambers judge erred by freezing the money already paid into Court under the invalid garnisihee summons pending resolution of the trial of the action. There is no good case for the funds to be paid back to the creditors. There has been no application by the judgment debtor to set up a payment bank or for the payment of monies out of court to the plaintiff. 4)There are a number of deficiencies in the procedure adopted. First, the chambers judge did not properly bind the money in question.

The court awarded costs to the plaintiff fixed at the amount involved - the quantum of general damages. The parties were unable to reach an amount of settlement. In this matter, the defendant argued that the costs should be fixed at the amount actually recovered by the plaintiff.

HELD: The Court granted the application and dismissed the second application. 1)On the basis of all of the affidavits, the original action as amended from time to time and as adjudicated, the agreed statement of facts and the present pleadings, the entire decision and order of the trial judge was set aside and leave to appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada was denied. 2)The memorandum to the Chief Judge in 1993 did little, if anything, to justify or excuse the 'wait and see' attitude of the defendant in its failure to bring forward a claim in negligence. It was clear that the defendant was considering all its legal remedies and avenues for relief for non-closure and it did not intend to proceed with the same action. Many tens of thousands of dollars by the parties, not to mention court time and resources, would have to be expended on relitigation of the same issue.  3)The Court found that the application should have been dismissed because of a fundamental inconsistency in that argument.  4)Costs of the application were awarded to the plaintiff on the first application plus disbursements to be taxed if they cannot be agreed upon."

Decisions on child and spousal maintenance, including costs of access and counselling had been reserved. HELD: 1)The respondent was to pay interim maintenance of $388 per month for the child residing with the mother and $350 per month for interim spousal maintenance. Under the guidelines he would be required to pay $1,165 per month for three children at an income level of $38,000. No abatement was made in view of the petitioner's modest income. 2)The respondent was to assume costs of twice monthly access by the petitioner and counselling costs. 3)The petitioner was to keep the respondent informed of her employment status and revenue. 4)Interim custody and access was to be reviewed July 4/97 if the parties had not settled the matter.","FIAT. The court reserved a decision on the questions of child and spousal maintenance including costs of access and counselling. The respondent's 1996 income included the following: Employment 22,950 Unemployment insurance benefits 5,197.00 Town councillor's indemnity 700.00 Total $28,847.00 The petitioner's position was rosy. She was in receipt of unemployment insurance benefits $318 every two weeks plus whatever casual work she could obtain. Her employment with the respondent's company was terminated. Her income from casual employment was sporadic. It was reasonable to assume that any income she earned in excess of $42.75 bi-weekly will be deducted from her UIC benefits. An attribution of income of $800 per month was fair for the current determination of maintenance. In terms of child support at an income level of $38,000 the respondent would be required to pay $1,165 per month for three children or $388.00 per month per child. The matter of interim custody and access shall be reviewed in July 1997. HELD: 1)The respondent was to pay interim maintenance to the petitioner in the amount of $388 per month payable on the first day of each month commencing on February 1, 1997 and continuing until further order of this Court.  2)The petitioner was to have access to Kimberley and Lauri twice monthly. If there is a significant change in her income level an application to vary may be brought by the respondent.

The defendant was not satisfied with the plaintiff's work, hired a third party to fix the plaintiff's work and refused to pay the plaintiff. The plaintiff sued for payment of the outstanding account HELD: The plaintiff's claim is dismissed. The Court found enough evidence to conclude that the central purpose of the contract for installation was not achieved and that there was a breach of the implied condition that it would be performed in a workmanlike standard. As the plaintiff's workmanship constitutes a breach of contract, the defendant's damages are set off against the claim.","HELD: The action was set down for summary trial with no examinations for discovery or pre-trial conference. The procedure at trial would be the procedure for a simplified trial as set out in Saskatchewan. The plaintiff was entitled to damages. The issue before the court was whether the plaintiff was liable to pay the builder's lien under the Builders' Lien Act. The purpose for the contract for installation was not achieved and there was a breach of the implied condition of the contract that it would be performed in a workmanlike standard. The builder's claim was found to be breached. The cost of repair was to be slightly less than the cost quoted by the plaintiff. The defendant was awarded judgment against the plaintiff in the amount of $2,800 with interest to date of judgment and judgment entitling the plaintiff to maintain his lien. The court found that the plaintiff's workmanship was not up to industry standards and the installation of drip capping, mitred corners, properly caulk, and lock in the soffitting appeared to be critical for proper drainage of water away from the garage. Although the plaintiff instructed the defendant to perform the installation services in a particular manner, in the absence of any specifications, the quality of installation was of such standard as to amount to poor workmanship."
d_1991canlii2552.txt,"The appellant, which was a wholly owned subsidiary of a major international company, induced the respondent to enter a franchise agreement by making representations as to the viability of the venture. The appellant sought to recover its losses from the respondent and relied on an exclusionary clause. Allowing the appeal in part, that (1) the agreement was unconscionable, having regard to the unequal bargaining power of the parties, the fact that the agreement was prepared by the appellant, and the fact that the appellant induced the respondent with its promotional brochure and its verbal representations as to the venture's viability to enter the franchise agreement; (2) the appellant cannot rely on an exclusionary clause given its unconscionable conduct; and (3) the appellant's claim for the value of the inventory together with pre-judgment interest was payable by the respondent. In a dissenting opinion, it was held that neither the appellant's conduct nor the franchise agreement was unconscionable; rather the respondent was an experienced businessman and the representations as to the venture's viability were mere projections, which he should have realized were unreliable.","The appellant was a wholly owned subsidiary of Imperial Oil involved in the distribution and sale of automotive parts and related products. Prior to 1985 that activity, exclusively wholesale, was achieved through a nation wide network of outlets leased from the appellant and operated by agents on a commission basis. Those agents were not required to make personal investment in the franchise, provide staff of two, rather than three, and were financially responsible for the inventory. The appellant knew from the outset that Murphy was not going to operate the franchise full-time, but would rely on the former Atlas employees. The trial judge found that such a conclusion could not be made based upon the evidence. Accordingly, the appellant appealed. Dismissing the appeal, that the trial judge made certain findings of fact which affected the appellant's assessment of the facts. Amongst many factors, among them, the exclusionary clause in an agreement between the parties does not foreclose the respondents' right to rely upon the breach of a warranty."

Yellow Quill First Nation applied for intervenor status. The trial judge found, without giving reasons, that the project was a development as defined in the Environmental Assessment Act and the application for mandamus was adjourned sine die. HELD: The appeal was granted and the order set aside without costs. 1)The proposal was not a development as defined in s 2(d) of the EAA. The Department of Agriculture, the Department of the Environment and Resource Management were of the opinion that the KSS project was not a development as defined in the Act as it did not come within any of the criteria listed in s2(d). 2)The Environmental Assessment Branch was of the opinion that no significant impacts on the environment would occur or if they do, mitigation measures would be implemented to reduce or eliminate the potential for significant environmental impact.  3)It was not necessary to decide whether Yellow Quill or the respondents had standing to privately enforce a public right. 4)In light of the decision the following were not in issue: whether the respondent should have applied by way of judicial review in the nature of certiorari; the relationship between the Environmental Assessment and Agricultural Operations Act; and whether a proponent of an intensive livestock operation can be required to make an application under the Agricultural Operations Act and to carry out an environmental impact assessment under s9 of the EAA.","The respondents applied to the Court of Queen's Bench for a declaration that the intensive livestock operation being constructed by Kelvington Super Swine Inc. (KSS) was a development pursuant to s. 2(d) of The Environmental Assessment Act. The second issue on the appeal was whether the respondents should have applied by way of judicial review in the nature of certiorari to set aside the order of the Minister of Agriculture as opposed to applying for declaration. The Minister had previously granted KSS intervenor status. The respondents sought an order for mandamus compelling KSS to conduct an environmental assessment. KSS did not seek costs. HELD: The KSS proposal was not a development as defined in s.2(d). The Court found that the evidence filed by the appellants, the respondents and the intervenor was not credible and unsubstantiated, speculative, conjectural and irrelevant material. Even if the affidavits were taken at their highest probative value they did not prove on the requisite standard of proof that the project was development. 1)The Court did not consider the application by HL Pork Producers Ltd. requesting intervenor Status. It was not necessary to consider whether it or the respondents have standing to privately enforce a public right. 2)There was no evidence of a significant public concern expressed about the possible environmental effect of these proposals in the Kelvingtons area by some groups. 3)The affidavit material filed on behalf of the appellant and the respondents was admitted. 4)The chambers judge found that KSS was not engaged in resolving a fundamental issue between the public and private parties.  5)The issue of whether the KSS project is development was not raised privately.

7_2003skqb255.txt,"The father was unemployed by reason of health problems and was in arrears on the December 13, 2002 child support order for $454 per month. He was seeking damages against the federal government for alleged abuses suffered while attending an Indian Residential School. The mother sought to attach the possible damage award for child support. HELD: The first $50,000 of any settlement proceeds, after payment of reasonable solicitor fees and disbursements, shall be paid into Court by his counsel. The Court agreed with the conclusion in Anderson that an order can be made with respect to damage awards even though, at the moment of the order, there is only a cause of action in existence and no precise amount of damages are known. There was no question that a cause of action or chose in action is property and thus the subject of an order under the Family Maintenance Act s.8. It is of no consequence that the order may be in another form such as money. To adopt any different analysis would be to unnecessarily limit the remedial application of s.8. Given the overarching purpose to ensure property is not wasted, thus impairing or defeating a claim under the FMA, it was logical orders can be made by the Court that are ancillary or a natural incident of the primary order preserving the property. The mother was awarded costs of the application set at $350.","The parties have three children aged four to eight years. The respondent is involved in a litigation against the Government of Canada wherein he seeks damages for abuse he allegedly suffered while attending an Indian residential school. Affidavits indicate that examinations for discovery are complete but the respondent's solicitor handling the claim advises no offer to settle has been received. Since the issuance of the order the respondent has been, for the most part, unemployed by reason of health problems and, as a result, arrears of child support are constantly accruing. HELD: In the event the respondent receives a settlement in his law suit for abuse suffered at the Indian Residential School, the first $50,000, after payment of reasonable solicitor fees and disbursements, shall be paid into Court so that the parties might speak to the distribution of same. The threshold to be met in such an application is simply that the disposition or wasting of the asset would impair or defeat a claim under the Act. It is not offensive to direct that the defendant's counsel, at the time of such settlement, if there is a settlement, pay monies into Court. Such an order does not impact the rights of the petitioner's counsel but merely imposes a clerical task which is natural incident to the preservation of an asset in debate."
9_2006nssc379.txt,"The Minister sought numerous orders for production of medical and various other files (including the mother's complete medical files from her family physician, the Nova Scotia Hospital and another hospital, and her files from a woman's shelter and an addiction treatment and prevention service) in an ongoing child protection proceeding. The mother argued that the records sought were irrelevant and that if there was any relevance, they were privileged, were unnecessary to the fair disposition of the proceeding, and their production would not save costs and would be injurious to the public interest. The addiction prevention and treatment service, Nova Scotia Hospital and mental health clinic records and files are ordered to be produced; the medical records of the family physician, the hospital and the woman's shelter are not ordered to be produced as these files would contain some irrelevant information and the relevant information could be obtained by other means. In a child protection proceeding, documents may be relevant to prove a protection finding, to monitor compliance with existing orders, or to develop and evaluate a plan of care. Records held by individuals or organizations to whom an individual has been referred as a result of a child protection proceeding are not privileged as no confidentiality could be expected in those circumstances. Records held by individuals or organizations whose services were accessed independent of a court order or the Minister's involvement that would ordinarily attract privilege may be ordered to be produced in child protection proceedings. However, if the information contained in the records can be obtained by a means targeted specifically to produce the relevant information, then orders for production for all of the records will not be necessary to the fair disposition of the proceeding. Also, since such records contain irrelevant, as well as relevant material, such an order would violate the privacy protections found in the Charter and be injurious to the public interest.","The applicant sought 13 orders of production for documents prepared by and in the possession of persons and organizations who had provided services to the applicant. The applicant argued that this was an attempt by the Minister to quash the applicant's requests for records. The Minister had refused to supply the applicant with the complete medical record, file and chart of the applicant, her pediatrician, her family physician, the Early Intervention Clinic and the Capital Health Addiction Prevention and Treatment Services. Application granted; the applicant was to have the records prepared for an independent parental capacity assessment with psychological component. Although the applicant may not be a parent or guardian of the child, the Minister had an obligation to investigate any information that may be of interest to her, and to protect the privacy of witnesses and others whose names appeared in the records sought. This admission rendered further proof of the allegations irrelevant. The records were not relevant for this purpose. The application for the production of the records was dismissed. The court found that the Ontario legislation specifically provides the threshold for determining relevancy for documents requested. The threshold is that a document may be relevant. While it may be easier for the applicant to request than to prepare a report or answer interrogatories, the purpose of this application is to secure the just, speedy and inexpensive determination of every proceeding. The nature of these proceedings have very serious consequences for parents and for their children and demand a heightened concern for accuracy in fact finding."

The lift ceased to operate and San Diego contacted the Abilities Council which claimed ownership to the lift. San Diego was awarded judgment for the depreciated value against Kapronczai who joined the Jabours as third parties claiming over against them for the San Diego claim. HELD: The appeal was dismissed against the plaintiff and the third party. 1)The wheelchair lift never became part of the realty notwithstanding how it was affixed. It was not the intention of either party that it become part of the realty. The intention of the parties is a prime factor in determining whether something is affixed to and becomes part of the realty. 2)The manner of attaching the lift only to the concrete slab arguably showed an intention that it not be permanent and part of the property.  3)Section 237(2) of the Land Titles Act protects a purchaser of realty against an unregistered interest in that realty. Interest is defined in s.237(1)(a)as any estate or interest in land. It is not intended to protect the purchaser of realty to which something is affixed that is not intended to the knowledge of the purchaser to be part of the realty.

2_2000skqb301.txt,"Plaintiff, as litigation guardian for his four daughters, alleged that the defendant, in breach of a trust, wrongfully retained $20,000 to which his daughters are entitled. Mabel, mother of the plaintiff and the defendant, set aside $20,000 in a bank account. Prior to her death, Mabel gave written instructions to the defendant to give $5,000 to each granddaughter. The defendant claimed that the money was to be held to pay the estate's expenses and then be divided among Mabel's children. The money was never issued to the granddaughters. The plaintiff claims that the written instructions to the defendant constituted the establishment of a trust and that the defendant is the trustee of the money for the benefit of the granddaughters. HELD: Plaintiff's claim dismissed with costs to the defendant to be taxed at double column 2. An incomplete voluntary transfer will not be construed as a declaration of trust unless it appears that there is an intention to declare a trust, and not merely make a transfer. Mabel's written instructions do not contain any words that could possibly be construed as a declaration of trust. She intended to make monetary gifts. The fact that the defendant did not take the necessary steps to complete the intended gifts during Mabel's lifetime does not result in that intention being converted into a declaration of trust. As to costs, the plaintiff alleged that the defendant committed fraud and this was never withdrawn nor proven. Asserting an unfounded allegation of fraud justifies a special order as to costs.","The plaintiff alleged that the defendant had wrongfully, in breach of a trust, retained the sum of $20,000 to which his four daughters were entitled. The plaintiffs four children were born in 1992, Mabel placed $17,500 in a bank account in the name of the plaintiff and added $8,000 in 1995 to the account as joint owner. The plaintiff's wife, the mother of the four granddaughters, testified that she took the instructions home with her after she had read the notes Mabel had given her. The instructions were given to her in 1992. The following Sunday, Pennefather died before Royal Trust Company had completed the instructions by transferring the funds to the credit of the annuity contract of Daisy McIntyre. The deceased had been diagnosed with cancer in late 1997. It was terminal, she was dying on March 24, 1998 at which time the bank account was still in the plaintiff's name. HELD: The written instructions were never provided to the plaintiff. The defendant became the sole trustee for the account for the benefit of the plaintiffs four grandchildren.  1)An incomplete voluntary transfer will not be construed as a declaration of trust unless it appear that there is an intention to declare a trust and not merely to make a transfer. 2)An individual does not create an equity in the favour of the trustee. If a settlement is intended to take effect by transfer, the court will not hold the intended transfer to operate as a trust of trust, for then every imperfect instrument could be made effectual by being converted into a perfect trust. 3)The written instructions do not contain any words which could possibly be construed a declarationof trust. The trust is not validly created where there is mere intention of creating trust, or voluntary agreement to do so, and the settlor himself contemplates some further act for the purpose of giving it completion."

The Rentalsman's order required the tenant to pay $2,930.01. The tenant appealed on the grounds the Rentalsman erred in law, as the decision was patently unreasonable as unsupportable by the facts; there was a denial of natural justice and due process because there was insufficient notice of particulars of the cleaning claim to allow the tenant to prepare a full and proper defence. The tenant argued there was a denial of natural justice and the decision should be overturned because he was not aware he could ask for an adjournment to present further evidence. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. The tenant was not denied natural justice or due process. While the description of cleaning did not specifically state the number of hours or hourly rate, it was sufficient to alert the tenant that it was for hours of work as well as for painting. The Rentalsman's decision, made after reviewing pictures, repair bills and the statements of house cleaners, who indicated the hours worked and their hourly rate, was not patently unreasonable as being unsupportable by the evidence.","The tenant appealed the Rentalsman's decision. The tenant had claimed damages for rent loss, cleaning costs, damages to the premises and utilities which were not paid. At the appeal hearing, the tenant took the position that the notice he received of the cleaning claim as set out on the hearing notice was inadequate and that when he attended for the hearing before the Rentalman he was not prepared to refute the amount of the clean claim. Further, he argued he was unaware he could ask for an adjournment to present further evidence.

c_2009skqb514.txt,"FIAT: The respondent mother filed a motion asking for an order quantifying child support arrears which she claims are due and owing pursuant to the order of Gunn, J. in September, 2008. She also asks that the Court determine the ongoing child support amount to be paid by the petitioner father. The Court questioned whether this application was more in the nature of a variation of the Gunn, J. order. It is clear that there has been a change since September 2008 with respect to the residency of one of the children.HELD: 1) The father's unusual 2008 taxation year has led to the parties taking very different positions as to how the father's income should be calculated. The father argues that it would be appropriate to average the father's income for 2006 to 2008. The mother argues that his income is the sum set out on line 150 of his tax return. She argues that his total income is the sum of $302,196 for the 2008 year. The father's argument is that the severance he received in 2008 should not be included in his income. It is well established that severance pay represents an acceleration of income that would have been paid over a period of months. It is also well established that income for the basis of calculating child support should be determined on the basis of severance pay plus whatever other earnings the payor may have. The severance is included as part of the father's income. 2) The capital gain which shows on the father's 2008 income tax return shall not be included in his 2008 income. The father agreed as part of the distribution of family income to assume responsibility for the capital gain on the real estate he was receiving as part of the family property division. The gain does not reflect income actually received by the father and there will be no 'year to year' capital gains. See Andersen v. Andersen (1997), 32 R.F.L. (4th) 177. 3) The father's income for 2008 is $270,300.  4) If the parties were to proceed in accordance with their own agreement and consent order, the father would be forced to pay on his inflated 2008 income. However, the mother would then be forced to pay back to the father the overpayment. As of May 2009 the father's income is the sum of $160,000. 5) The mother shall have her costs of $600.","The mother has filed a motion in this matter requesting an order quantifying child support arrears which she says are due and owing pursuant to the 2008 order. In addition, she requests that the court determine the ongoing child support amount to be paid by the petitioner father. HELD: 1) The father's income is $160,000. With respect to the capital gain shown on the father's 2008 income tax return, it is clear that the father will not earn the sum of $270,000 in the 2009 taxation year. The father agreed as part of the distribution of the family property between the parties to assume responsibility for a capital gain on the real estate he was receiving as a result of the 2007 order. This gain does not reflect income actually received by the father and there will be no 'year to year' capital gain unless the father has gains on other property. 2) It is well established that severance pay represents an acceleration of income that would have been paid over a period of months. There is, however, very clear evidence before the Court of the father that the current income is a non-reoccurring amount which should not be included in the determination of his 2008 income. It is clear on the evidence before this Court that the Father will not be able to support on an income of this size over the coming years. In light of the fact that the 2008 year was an extraordinary year for the father given his severance package, it would be unfair to have the father continue to provide support on the basis of an income in that amount when the evidence is clear he will earn income of approximately $100,000 less than that amount. If the parties proceeded in accordance with their own agreement and consent order and the father would be forced to pay on his inflated 2008 income, the mother would be required to remit back to the father the overpayment. 3) The amount of s. support owing and owing to the mother is $19,721. This is based solely on his 2007 tax year and not an averaging of his previous three years. As the Gunn J. order is premised on the child, Adam, residing with the mother and the child David residing with either parent, clearly some variation is warranted both with respect to quantifying support and ongoing support. 4) The Court of Appeal in Andersen v. Andersen, 1997 CanLII 1163 (BC SC) has reviewed the decision of the British Columbia court in Andersen. They agree with the Court in that their decision of Andersen that Andersen is an Andersen"
3_1999canlii12258.txt,An appeal from an order varying a child maintenance order which had been based on a written agreement between the parties entered into a week before the Federal Child Support Guidelines came into effect. The application to vary made about a year later was based mainly on the coming into effect of the guidelines. The decision to not to allow evidence on all issues because of conflicting affidavits gave rise to the first ground of appeal. The appellant also argued that the judge erred in finding that an order to vary would not be inequitable within the meaning of s.17(6.2) by reason of the terms of the written agreement and resulting order which contained special provisions to benefit the children. He also objected to the s.7(1)(f) order for $230 per month for extraordinary extracurricular expenses. HELD: The appeal was dismissed with the exception of the payments under s.7(1)(f) which were set aside. 1)The applicant was not denied the right to lead evidence on any relevant issue. Although the judge made no reversible error the procedure followed was not approved of. The principles stated in Zaba v. Bradley were reaffirmed. 2)No reversible error was found in the finding the appellant did not have custody of or access to the children for enough time to bring him within s.9; that the appellant's income for purposes of the Guidelines should include the bonuses received from his employer; and that he did not have a business based in his home. 3)The judge erred in not addressing the question as to whether the expenses were extraordinary within the meaning of s.7(1)(f). The activities were ordinary given the income of the parents and fell within the table amount fixed under s.3(1)(a).  4)Each party was to bear his/her own costs.,"The parties appealed an order which varied a child maintenance order. The original order had been based on a written agreement between the parties entered into about a week before the Federal Child Support Guidelines came into effect. The judge at the hearing of the appeal was faced with conflicting affidavits. She thought that evidence was required on only three issues which she proceeded to define. The appellant argued that he was denied the right to lead evidence respecting matters relevant to the underlying issues. HELD: The portion of the judgment relating to payments under s. 7(1)(f) of the Guidelines is set aside. The appeal is dismissed. 1) The judge erred in requiring the appellant to pay a portion of them under s71(f) in addition to the table amount fixed under s3(1(a). 2) There was no reversible error in the judge's decisions, supported by written reasons, that the appellant did not have custody of or access to the children for enough time to bring him within s. 9 of The Guidelines; the appellant's income should include bonuses he received from his employer in 1996 and 1997 and (c) Mr. Elliott had not a business based in the home. 3) There were no reversible errors by the judge in her reasons for judgment, which were reviewed in all of the circumstances of this case."
5_2008nssc77.txt,"The claimant brought an action in the Small Claims Court to enforce a default judgment it had been granted against the defendant in Alberta for breach of contract. The claimant attempted to proceed in Nova Scotia on the basis of reciprocal enforcement under the common law or enforcement of the debt as a contract. The adjudicator dismissed the action, finding that the Small Claims Court did not have the authority to enforce an order arising from a foreign jurisdiction and that it could not proceed with the claim for breach of the agreement under the contract as there was no evidence that the Alberta action had been withdrawn, struck or transferred out. The adjudicator also found that the defendant had not attorned to the jurisdiction of the Alberta court. The claimant appealed. Appeal dismissed; although the adjudicator's interpretation of sec. 15 of the Act and his finding that the defendant had not attorned to the jurisdiction of the Alberta court when there was no evidence before him on that issue constituted errors in law, the present claim was beyond the scope of the Small Claims Court Act, given that the adjudicator would first be called upon to settle a dispute regarding the original court's jurisdiction, the locus of the original contract and a factual dispute concerning attornment.","The claimants commenced an action for breach of contract against the respondent in the Alberta Court of Queen's Bench and obtained default judgment for an amount not cited. The respondent did not file a defence and the claim was reduced from the amount of its judgment to fall within the monetary limits established by the Small Claims Court Act and in the alternative, enforcement of the debt as contract. The trial judge found that s. 9 of the Act did not provide the Court with authority to enforce an Order arising from foreign jurisdiction. He further determined that, although the Court had jurisdiction to proceed with the claim for a breach of the agreement under contract, it was prohibited as there was no evidence 'that the Alberta action was withdrawn, abandoned, struck out or transferred' pursuant to s. 15 of the act. Rather than determine a claim based on a fixed amount, it is apparent an adjudicator, in a case of this nature, would be called upon first to settle a dispute regarding the original Court's jurisdiction, the locus of the original contract, and a factual dispute concerning attornment. Taking into account the purpose of the legislation, the remedial goals, the underlying values of efficiency and access to justice, and the potential for a complex and lengthy fact finding process, the present claim extends beyond the authority of the small claims court."
2_1999nsca132.txt,"The respondent filed an interlocutory notice, ex parte application, against the intended defendants, seeking an interim injunction. The applicant union applied for leave to obtain intervener status as a party pursuant to Rule 62.35, or as amicus currie pursuant to Rule 8.02, or alternatively as an intervener pursuant to Rules 5.02, 5.04, and 8.01(1), and to bring an appeal from orders made by a Supreme Court judge in proceedings brought by the intended plaintiff against the intended defendants. Rejecting the applications, that a Court of Appeal judge sitting in chambers does not have the jurisdiction to grant intervener status or to join a person as a party to a proceeding. Furthermore, as the union was not a party to the original proceeding, and was not joined as an intervener, or as a party defendant, by order of a Supreme Court judge, it does not have standing to file an appeal.","The union applied for leave to obtain intervener status as a party pursuant to Civil Procedure Rules 5.02, 5.04, and 8.01(1) and to be joined as an amicus curiae, or as an intervener by order of the Supreme Court pursuant to Rule 62.35. The Union opposed all of the applications advanced by the union, arguing that the trial judge erred in law in permitting the sole defendant(s) to stand as sole defendants in the proceeding, and in denying status to the union. The only person serving on the Union's behalf was a lawyer for the Union. Allowing the application, that the Union has the status to file an appeal unless it is first joined in either of the two capacities by the Court of Appeal. There are, to the best of the knowledge, no reported decisions in this jurisdiction dealing with an application by a non-party to be added to a proceeding as a defendant, as an Intended Defendant or as a sole defendant under the Judicature Act which incorporated the ancient practice of the Chancery Act. HELD: The application was dismissed. The court ordered that the union should continue to file appeals until further court order.  1)The Court found that the application to join the Union was not supported by affidavits or any other affidavits filed by the Union on its behalf. It was not necessary to refer the issue of joinder to the Court as it was not a party to the proceeding. 2)There were no errors in law or jurisdiction by the court in reviewing the application of the Union as an individual or in any way related to the application for intervention to this Court. 3)The Union had not been prejudiced in any event. 4)The court dismissed the application as not having jurisdiction to hear the application pursuant to s.59.35 or s.8.01. 5)It held that it had jurisdiction by virtue of the authority granted to it by s. 46 of the Judicialature Act that incorporated the archaic practice of chancery in England and Wales. In addition, the court had jurisdiction in cases where a party or persons, other than those of an individual, wished to proceed or intended to proceed, were subject to the jurisdiction of the Court."

With respect to EK the Department seeks an order placing him with the Minister until his 16th birthday. This order was granted at trial. The parents do not oppose the applications with respect to JS and EK but the mother seeks the return of CS to her care. HELD: JS is in need of protection and he shall be placed with SK for an indefinite period. JS shall not be returned to live with his parents without a further order of this Court. This does not prevent JS from spending unsupervised time with his parents including overnight visits. CS is in need of protection and she shall remain in the custody of the Minister for a period of 3 months. During that time, the parents shall work with DCR to develop a case plan for CS's return. TK will have a mental health assessment as arranged for by DCR and will follow any recommendations of the mental health professional and participate in the Victim Intervention Program. KS will attend any session at Alternatives to Violence arranged for by DCR. 1) The Court was satisfied that the children were exposed to domestic violence or severe domestic disharmony. 2) Matters did not move quickly once the children were placed in the care of DCR. Instead of working with DCR to ensure a smooth reintegration of the children into their home, the parents vacated their apartment, moved to Alberta for a while, lived in a series of motels, camped at SK's apartment building and even lived in a tent. During that period of time, some of which encompassed the trial, the Court was not satisfied that there was an adult person who was willing and able to provide for the children's needs. The children are in need of protection within the meaning of s. 11 of the Act. 3) There is a reasonable prospect of change within a reasonable period of time. KS has quit drinking. TK is now employed. KS has attended some anger management programming flowing from his criminal conviction. The parents have a residence. TK is taking medication which promotes the continuation of her mental health. DCR acknowledged that there are no current issues with TK's mental health and that have not been for some time. TK says she is prepared to work with DCR to ensure the return of her children. The Court accepts TK's disinclination to work with Ms. Fraser. The success of the involvement of DCR in the life of this family would be enhanced with the assignment of another worker.","The Department of Community Resources seeks orders pursuant to The Child and Family Services Act placing the respondent with the Department until age 18 and placing the child with his grandmother as a Person of Sufficient Interest pursuant to s. 37(1)(b). The children have the same biological parents. The respondent does not oppose the applications in respect of the respondent and [E.K.] but seeks the return of [C.S.] to her care. HELD: 1) The respondent did not attend the pre-trial or the trial. He was served with the notice of the application and the trial on the issue of custody. 2) In the course of the trial, the respondent will consider the best interests of the child, the importance of continuity in the child's care and the possible effect on the child of delay in making a decision. 3) The evidence in the trial is conclusive that the respondent was a person of sufficient interest in the respondent. The Court finds that it is appropriate for the respondent to have generous and flexible access to the children, and that the Department should obtain information about the respondent's treatment compliance with her mental health facilities. 4) There is no evidence that criminal charges were laid as a result of this information. 5) The child is 11 years old and in Grade 8. The child who is the subject of this investigation is 11 year old status Indian whose name is included in a Band List or who is entitled to have his name included in his Band List. The court finds that 11 year olds who are in need of protection do not have the means to achieve this level of protection. They are at the age of 12 years of age and can be placed in the care of any adult on an equal or greater basis. 6) There are no circumstances to justify the permanent placement of the children in the custody of an adult on the basis that the child has a significant history of domestic violence and may be of interest to the respondent in some capacity. The administration of justice is in the minority and it would be inappropriate for the Court to order an order permanently committing the child to the Department. 7) The Court does not consider the evidence in support of this finding sufficient to justify an order for custody. 8) The children are 11 and 12 years old. 9) The Apprehension is a serious case of neglect and the Court found that 11 children of this age and of any other age group are at risk of exposure to harmful interaction for sexual purpose, including involvement in prostitution, drugs, or violence. 10) The Children have been"

The Provincial Director was concerned that, because S.T.T. had not followed through with his treatment, he was at a high risk to offend again. HELD: The application lacked compelling reasons to keep the young person in custody.  1) This was the first experience with an application of this nature in Saskatoon and the Court provided a detailed discussion of the procedure for the benefit of future applications. 2) The application was not brought in a reasonable time having regard to all of the circumstances. The young person must be put on notice that the application is being made. 3) The Review (Progress) Report is a form of disclosure for the young person and should be available well in advance of the hearing.","This was an application by the Provincial Director pursuant to s. 98 of the Youth Criminal Justice Act for continuation of the custody portion of a custody and supervision sentence made under s. 42(2)(n). The Young Person was 18 years old when he appeared on the application. He had served 180 days in custody and had only 90 days remaining for the community supervision portion. The issue was whether the young person was likely to commit a serious violent offence before the expiry of the youth sentence, which would be a relatively short period of time where the application was brought near the end of his sentence. HELD: The youth was ordered released pending a full hearing. The court was instructed to consider the merits of the application on a prima facie basis. There was no defect that was fatal to the decision regard remand or release pending the hearing. There are a number of alternatives short of continuing open custody which can increase the level of supervision and are to be taken rarely. However the test for continued custody does not appear too stringent as the court need only be satisfied on reasonable grounds of the governing criteria for continuation. There is also no evidence of pattern of persistent violent behaviour. The young person had been convicted of assault, robbery, assault with a weapon and had served a portion of his youth sentence in community under supervision. There were no new offences committed while he was in custody."
8_1997canlii9861.txt,"This was an appeal from a Supreme Court decision dismissing certiorari applications to quash three orders of the Labour Relations Board ordering the appellant to reinstate the respondents and pay them compensation for dismissing them due to their support of a union. The appellant alleged that the Board's order should be quashed because it failed to give reasons for its decision. Allowing the appeal and remitting the matter for rehearing, that there is an implied duty on a tribunal to provide written reasons whenever substantial issues are involved and the reasons for the tribunal's decision are not obvious from a review of the issues and the record. In this case, the order of the Board imposed significant financial liability on the appellant, and the issues were complex and the concerns of the parties were substantial. As a result, the Board acted in a patently unreasonable manner in giving its decision without providing reasons.","The respondent hotel manager appealed three orders of the Labour Relations Board (Nova Scotia) ordering her to reinstate the individual respondents, to pay them compensation, and to refuse to reconsider the first two orders. Other respondents Hotel Employees Restaurant Employees Union, Local 662, union and Attorney General had all raised concerns about the quality of housekeeping in the respondent's hotel. The respondent was attempting to intimidate its employees to compel them to refrain from being members of a trade union. The union filed a complaint against the respondent in the same terms. Its members were the head housekeepers, the assistant housekeeper, the desk clerk and the maintenance man. The Board dismissed the application for judicial review. The Chambers judge dismissed the applications, finding that the decisions of the Board were protected by the privative clause in s. 19(1) of the Act. In the absence of even brief reasons, reviewing Court on judicial review cannot determine whether the decision-makers (the delegates of the Minister) are applying consistent and lawful criteria in making decisions that an individual is a danger to the public in Canada."
1990canlii2449.txt,"This was an appeal from a decision dismissing the appellant's application for an order in the nature of certiorari to quash the decision of the Social Assistance Appeal Board for the City of Halifax which affirmed the rejection of the appellant's application for municipal social assistance as an expectant mother. The appellant was a pregnant unmarried 16 year old living with her parents at the time of her application for social assistance. The trial judge concluded that under Municipal Assistance Policy 1.2.5 the applicant was not eligible since she was not a single head of a family maintaining a home for herself and her dependant child. Allowing the appeal, that s. 23(1) of the Social Assistance Act places a mandatory responsibility upon social service committees to provide assistance for all persons in need as defined in s. 19(e) of the Act. Pursuant to this statute, the City of Halifax has approved municipal assistance policies and Policy 1.2.5 relating to an 'Unmarried Mother - Pending Birth' was intended to set out the circumstances under which an unmarried mother was to be eligible. It was not intended that the appellant have to be already maintaining a home for herself and one or more dependant children. In a dissenting opinion, Chipman, J.A. concluded that as the provision with respect to an 'Unmarried Mother - Pending Birth' came under the heading 'Single Head of Family', the provision is merely an extension to include within the definition of a single head of a family an unwed mother whose child is not yet born. The requirement that she be a single head of a family maintaining a home still stands.","An unmarried, pregnant, 16 year old girl applied to the Social Services Department of the City of Halifax for municipal social assistance. Her application was refused because she was under 19 years of age and was living with and being supported by her mother and stepfather. The Appeal Board quashed the application for certiorari to quash the decision of the Social Assistance Appeal Board which confirmed the denial of the appellant's application for municipal assistance as an expectant mother. Dismissing the appeal without costs, that the Appeal Board erred in interpreting Halifax Social Services policy 1.2.5 as it did in treating the provision in question as creating a discretionary right to assistance. The Board misinterpreted the wording of the policy, which provided that an unmarried mother, pending the birth of her first child, could qualify for assistance if she was completely maintaining herself without any family support. The fact that the respondent's stepfather was the head of family and maintaining the household in which she lived was not evidence that she qualified as a person in need under the policy."
c_1999canlii12244.txt,"The insurer appealed the October 1998 order which dismissed the appellant's motion for dismissal of the insured's action and for summary judgment on its counterclaim for insurance premiums payable under the hail insurance contract. The insured had signed a promissory note and tendered a cheque payable in September 1996 but stopped payment and advanced a claim of set-off. HELD: The appeal was allowed in part under Rule 129 without prejudice to the plaintiff's right to proceed for the alleged loss of $38,585. 1)The appellant was granted leave to amend its statement of defence by pleading the relevant statutory conditions in the Saskatchewan Insurance Act and any additional material facts and new matters raised by the amended statement of claim. The plaintiff was granted leave to reply. Each party was permitted to re-open the examinations for discovery. 2)The insured had no defence to the counterclaim for premiums which was a separate action. The prayer for relief was amended to claim the full amount of the premiums which were payable with interest at the rate of 10% as stipulated in the promissory note together with costs on the applicable tariff in Queen's Bench and in the Court of Appeal on single column 5.","The appellant appealed an order entered in Queen's Bench on October 15, 1998 dismissing the motion for summary judgment on its counterclaim for insurance premiums payable by the plaintiff under the hail insurance contract in question. Although the plaintiff's claim is fixed at $3,373.50 being the amount of an appraisal award, the respondent challenges the validity of this appraisal award purporting to be made under The Saskatchewan Insurance Act and the statutory conditions that govern such appraisals. The appellant seeks to recover the balance of the premiums payable. The respondent has stopped payment of the same with claim of set-off being advanced. This appeal should be allowed in part because the appellant has satisfied the criteria in Bombardier Credit v. Kostuchuk et al., 1994 CanLII 3870 and is entitled to judgment for $10,870 with interest at the rate of 10% as stipulated in the promissory note, plus costs in Queen Bench on the applicable tariff and costs in this Court on single column 5 and the appellant's prayer for relief in its motion is amended to claim the full amount of the premium payable."
b_2000skqb572.txt,"The accused was charged with sexual assault under s.271 of the Criminal Code. Although the DNA evidence established he had sexual intercourse with the complainant, neither had any memory of it due to their self-induced states of intoxication. Defences raised were consent, an honest but mistaken belief that she gave her consent, and extreme drunkenness such that he was so intoxicated that he was not in a conscious state and was incapable of forming any intent to have sexual intercourse without consent. HELD: The accused was found guilty.  1)Although the defence of 'extreme intoxication' is successful in the rarest of cases, the accused established the Daviault 'extreme intoxication' on a balance of probabilities. He would have been acquitted had it not been for s.33.1 which does away with this defence in sexual assault cases.  2)The court was satisfied on a balance of probabilities that his extreme level of self-induced intoxication rendered him incapable of making a conscious decision to have sexual intercourse with the complainant with or without her consent. The court was satisfied that the complainant had not done anything to suggest that she would consent. The accused was incapable of considering the issue of consent and accordingly did not have a mistaken belief or reasonable grounds for such a belief. It was clear from the testimony of an 11 year old that the intercourse took place long after the complainant passed out. She was incapable of giving consent after that time. Her assertion of lack of consent was inherently unreliable due to her lack of any memory of events that occurred before, during and after the alleged assault and would have been more in the nature of an assumption than a fact, but was found to be consistent with all the other evidence. It was not relevant that she may have withdrawn consent. 3)There was no evidence to give his second defence (that he honestly believed he had her consent) an air of reality. His assertion that she must have consented or he would not have done it was speculative assumption, not evidence. 4)Section 33.1 provides that the act of becoming voluntarily intoxicated to the extent of being incapable of controlling one's behaviour constitutes criminal culpability sufficient to found criminal liability for offences committed against the bodily integrity of others. The public outcry and Parliamentary response to Daviault strongly indicate that s.33.1 is not only consistent with the objectives of the Charter but is justifiable and essential in a free and democratic society. Of four recent cases that held Criminal Code s.33.1 violates the Charter, two held it was saved by s.1 while two held it was not saved by s.1 of the Charter. 5)Section 33.1(1) provides the lack of general intent or voluntariness is not a defence to an assault charge described in ss.(3)if it resulted from self-induced intoxication or the accused departed markedly from the standard of reasonable care generally recognized in Canadian society. The three sub-conditions described in ss.(2) concerning marked departure constitute criminal culpability similar to recklessness. Criminal culpability is not dependent on wilful intention to cause harm but on the wilful intention to engage in conduct that incurs the risk of harm without caring whether or not harm ensues. 6)The strong dissent in Daviault indicated those who render themselves incapable of knowing what they are doing through voluntary consumption of alcohol or drugs possess a sufficiently blameworthy state of mind that their imprisonment does not offend the principle of fundamental justice which prohibits the imprisonment of the innocent. The court has broad discretion to differentiate in sentences imposed for offences that were deliberately committed and those that were committed involuntarily because of self-induced intoxication.","The accused was charged with sexual assault contrary to s. 271 of the Criminal Code. The DNA evidence established that the accused had sexual intercourse with the complainant. However, neither the accused nor the complainant, due to their respective self-induced states of intoxication, had any memory of the sexual intercourse. HELD: The accused was acquitted. 1) The Court had broad discretion to differentiate in sentences imposed for offences that were deliberately committed and those that were committed involuntarily because of self- induced intoxication. 2) The defence of 'extreme drunkenness' was successful in the rarest of cases. The accused testified that he was so intoxicated that he could not remember the events of the previous evening and that he never considered the issue of her consent or lack of it. It was difficult to understand how someone who was so grossly intoxicated could be capable of having sexual intercourse that involved penetrating the complainant and ejaculating semen into her vagina. 3) There was no evidence tendered at the trial that was inconsistent with the testimony of the accused. Nor was there anything in the evidence of the witnesses who were called by the Court to be inconsistent with his evidence as to the state of his intoxication. 4) In a case like the one before me, the accused's defence of extreme drunkenness was successful. He argued that he didn't even think about having sex with her but that he did so because she had no direct knowledge or recollection of what she actually did before, during or after the alleged assault. 5) The evidence of his 11-year old son was consistent with all the other evidence adduced by the defence. 6) The accused admitted that he had been drinking heavily and was in a state of intoxication. He did not have any recollection of the conversation or of the time of the assault. 7) The court had discretion to refer to the transcript of the Parliamentary response to the Daviault case (as termed by Romilly J. in R. v. Brenton, 1999 CanLII 13930) as an air of reality."

He was released from custody on his consent to a term that prohibited him from picketing or carrying placards pending his trial. He later applied for a review of the order and sought an amendment permitting him to picket lawfully. HELD: Application dismissed. Amendment refused. If the accused was permitted to picket there was a substantial likelihood that he would commit another offence while on bail pending his trial on the four existing charges. The justice granting the judicial interim release order was therefore correct to impose a complete prohibition on picketing.,FIAT. The accused applied for a review of theterms of his judicial interim release. He was charged with four counts of defamatory libel under s.300 and 301 of the Code. He sought an amendment by adding the phrase'regarding Sgt. Brian Dueck or Carol Bunko-Ruys'. HELD: The application was denied and the existing order stood. The picketing prohibition term imposed by the justice with the consent of the accused was reasonably constituted as a condition of his release from custody. But for this condition the justice might well have ordered the accused detained in custody on the ground that there was a substantial likelihood that he would commit a criminal offence if he were not prohibited from picketing prior to his trial.

Hypothetical questions seeking his opinion consequent upon his professional experience could be asked where his and C&amp;L's conduct were in issue. The officer's expert opinion could not be sought on matters not raised in the pleadings. 2)The disclosure and production of documents was justified under the broad relevance test. A party is entitled to discovery of a document if it directly or indirectly enables him to advance his own case or destroy that of his adversary or may fairly lead to a form of inquiry which may have either consequence. 3)The 'damage claim documents' had been provided. There should be a sameness in the manner and isolation of the documents in the discovery process undertaken by each party. Whether the memoranda of discussions with third parties were privileged or irrelevant was a matter for the trial judge. 4)The issue of compelling a response to undertakings had been resolved. 5)The request for an order for an immediate pre-trial conference was redundant as there was no basis for one until the action was ready for trial. 6)Leave to further amend the statement of claim pursuant to Rule 165 had been granted.,"FIAT. The chambers judge on the return date granted an order directing the defendants to respond to the undertakings given in the examination for discovery of Krake and ordered that the plaintiff's action be struck with costs without further order. HELD: The order of the Court was granted in the context of the principles set out in the earlier pleadings and comports with the general principle that a party is entitled to discovery of a document or record if it directly or indirectly enables him to advance his own case or destroy that of his adversary, or may fairly lead to a form of inquiry which may have either of these consequences. The disclosure and production of the documents in question will not hamper the search for truth, and it should help to isolate the areas of contention for trial purposes. There is no basis for a pre-trial conference until the action is ready for trial.  1)The plaintiff was not required to answer certain questions outlined in the pleadings or any proper questions arising from further and better production of documents by Coopers Lybrand (as may be ordered).  2)Parties were to provide the plaintiff with specific information on audit working patterns related to investments made by Saskatchewan Trust Company and the requisite part of the document referred to as'matters for attention of partners as at December 31, 1985' must be produced.  3)Costs were awarded to the plaintiff."

HELD: There was no breach of the accused's Charter rights. 1) There is no evidence to establish that the accused did not speak to legal counsel. The agreed statement of facts establishes that the accused asked to speak with Ms. Bohachik, a lawyer with Legal Aid. The police officer put the accused in contact with legal aid duty counsel instead. When the officer told the accused that Ms. Bohachik worked with Legal Aid the accused said 'ok, Legal Aid is fine'. The accused was put in contact with Legal Aid duty counsel. There was no breach of the accused s. 10(b) rights.  2) Applying the common law definition of arrest to the present situation, it is apparent that telling a person that he is no longer under arrest, without releasing him from custody, does not terminate the arrest. It is only by ending the custody of the accused by releasing him that the arrest is ended and the accused is 'un-arrested'. It was agreed that the officer had sufficient grounds to arrest the accused. The arrest being legally made, it follows that the arrest continued until it was legally ended by his release. The arrest continued throughout the search and seizure at the police station. The Court finds that his continued detention after the purported 'un-arrest' constituted a de facto arrest. 3) There is no evidence that the accused misunderstood his actual status or that he was prejudiced by the 'un-arrest'. The accused has not established that he was the subject of 'unreasonable search or seizure' resulting in the violation of his rights under the Charter.","The accused was charged with aggravated assault. Prior to his trial, the accused gave notice that he would be making an application to the Court for a ruling that the accused's rights under s. 8, 9, and 10 (a) and (b) of the Charter had been infringed and sought remedy for that infringement. At the trial, Crown counsel called six witnesses to testify and during the course of the evidence of the sixth witness, requested that the Court enter a voir dire. The purpose of the voir net was to hear and determine an application by counsel for the accused for a finding that the rights of the accused under ss. 8 and 9 (a and b) and s. 10(b) and 10(c) had be infringed. HELD: 1) The Court found that the initial arrest was lawful, was not terminated by the purported 'un-arrest', and continued throughout the search and seizure at the police station. The accused's continued detention after the purported “de facto” arrest constituted a de facto arrest as described in Latimer. 2) The accused misunderstood his actual status in any way, or that he was prejudiced by the 'uncertainty' resulting in the unjustified search or seizure resulting in a violation of his rights under the Charter. In the present case the accused was not only put in direct contact with counsel by telephone but was also put in contact with legal aid duty counsel. He was given the opportunity to consult counsel and treated in all respects as though he was in custody after an arrest."

The original five year lease for use of the Jubilee Building as a bingo hall between Fundraising td. and REAL was assigned to GCB with REAL's written consent. GCB further sublet the building without REAL's consent or knowledge. Written notice of renewal was not sent to REAL. The basis of GCB's application was estoppel on the basis that REAL entered negotiations regarding a relocation of the bingo hall and then began to deal directly with CGB's sub-tenant after the renewal date had passed. HELD: The application was dismissed. Costs in the cause. 1)There was no evidence that Fundraisers, the original party to the lease, attempted to exercise the option to renew. 2)GCB did not have a strong prima facie case on the merits. It appeared that there were no negotiations between GCB and REAL. 3)There would not be irreparable harm. Under the current arrangements, the bingo would be operated by RCBA. If successful at trial the damages to GCB can be easily calculated based on the time it was unable to occupy the premises. 4)On balance GCB failed to satisfy the burden of proof that the inconvenience it will suffer by the refusal of the injunction will be greater than that suffered by REAL if granted.","The plaintiff applied for an interlocutory injunction restraining the defendant from entering into any lease with the plaintiff and permitting the operation of a bingo hall by the defendant except as a tenant. The defendant had refused to renew the lease and the plaintiff applied to have the injunction quashed. Application dismissed. The plaintiff must be able to show that an injunction until the hearing is necessary to protect him against irreparable damage and loss, mere inconvenience is not enough, and the defendant has failed to satisfy the burden of proof that the plaintiff will suffer as a result of the refusal of the injunction. HELD: The application for an interim injunction was dismissed. It would appear there were no negotiations between the parties and there was no promise on the part of the defendant that it would follow up on these discussions, nor was there any discussion about exercising the option to renew either through the plaintiff or directly.  1)The plaintiff had failed to show the defendant, the party with whom it had contracted, exercised or attempted to exercise the Option to renew. 2)The defendant had not shown a sufficient prima facie case on the merits that it could have obtained a binding injunction. 3)The applicant had entered into a verbal agreement to terminate the lease without any prior written notice as required by the terms of the lease. 4)There was no evidence that the parties met once to discuss the future of the hotel. The parties did not have any discussions about the possible venue for bingo. 5)The Applicant failed to demonstrate that the inconvenience it would suffer by the refusal was greater than that which would be suffered if the injunction was granted."

He alleged that the investigators had improperly obtained and used the contents of his email, some of which were subject to solicitor and client privilege. In the context of the certiorari application, the company president successfully argued that the Commission's return should contain the fruits of the investigation so far and that he should be entitled to examine one of the investigators for discovery. The Commission appealed, arguing that the underlying judicial review application was improper and premature and thus, the procedural orders should not have been made. Appeal allowed; the underlying judicial review application is stayed; the stay may be lifted by a judge of the Supreme Court on application with notice; the Order of the chambers judge on the procedural matters arising in that application is set aside. The underlying judicial review application was premature because the Commission should have had the opportunity to consider and address the company president's complaints. The decision as to whether or not to release the information sought required the balancing of competing interests in light of the overall statutory scheme and the specific circumstances of the case; the Commission was in the best position to conduct such an exercise.","The respondent received an investigation order for the investigation of the trading in the securities of Knowledge House, a company of which the respondent is President, CEO and Chair. The respondent applied to the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia for certiorari to quash that investigation and to return the documents to the RCMP. The chambers judge essentially granted the respondent's application and dismissed the Commission's's's. The Commission seeks leave to appeal. Its main argument on appeal is that the underlying judicial review application is improper and premature and that, as a result, the procedural orders under appeal should not have been made. There is no express language and no clear legislative intention in s. 29A to take away the inherent authority of the superior court to order production. The issues raised on appeal are how to balance two competing requirements: the applicant's need to know and the investigators need to keep secret; the Court must allow the Commission to address the issues raised in the appeal. HELD: The appeal is allowed and the matter is directed to the Court.  1) The Court must be cognizant of the fact that there are many administrative and practical issues to be addressed even before the privilege issue is addressed. 2) The application for judicial review is only necessary to deal with two of them. First, the applicant needs to know what the investigators did in order to mount his challenge. The investigators were obliged by statute to apply to court for a warrant before obtaining the material which the Commission obtained from Mr. Parish. Mr. Potter alleges serious impropriety on the part of the investigators and requires access to information about their actions. In the circumstances, the Court cannot defer to a decision that was not made at the preliminary stage of the investigation. To proceed with the appeal on this issue requires a balancing of the competing interests in light of the overall statutory scheme and the specific circumstances of the case."

The appellant contends that he was unaware that an accident had taken place until he returned from the store and the finding of the trial judge that the appellant must have known an accident took place before entering the store is contrary to the preponderance of evidence. The verdict is unreasonable, the appellant argues, since he had no duty to report an accident which he didn't know had happened prior to returning from the Store. There was no palpable or overriding error.  1) The trial judge did give sufficient reasons for her decision and took into consideration all of the relevant evidence and the law in reaching her decision. 2) The court did not rely upon the testimony of any witness that was inherently improbable, and she applied the correct burden of proof, beyond a reasonable doubt, in reaching the verdict. 3) The verdict was not unreasonable and there were no palpable, overriding errors.  4) The Court was entitled to assess credibility of the independent and appellant, deciding to prefer the evidence of the independant witness to that of the appellant."

The children enjoyed their school activities in an area that both parties lived in and were familiar with. Pursuant to the respondent's previous order, the children had access in that area, which was in the municipality, and were in the best interests of the children, as well as their extended family and community.

7_2006nspc61.txt,"A young person who suffered from considerable mental health issues and was in the permanent care of the Minister of Community Services applied to have the court exclude the public and the media from her court convened pre- sentencing conference. The purpose of the conference was to assemble various professionals from diverse fields to discuss the complex issues surrounding the young person and to provide recommendations to the court as to an appropriate sentence. Various of the professionals had expressed their concern as to their ability to participate in the conference if the media was present. Application for access by the media denied; order granted excluding the public and the media from the pre-sentencing conference; the benefits of an exclusion order outweigh the deleterious effect of restricting the public's right to freedom of expression and the freedom of the press. Although the court convened hearing is a public proceeding to which, prima facie, the open court principle applies, the attendance, cooperation and participation of the invitees to the conference (all professionals who were bound by laws, policies and agreements of confidentiality) was strictly voluntary and many, if not all, would be unable and unwilling to participate in a conference that was open to the public and the media. The administration of justice was furthered by the court obtaining the best possible information from those identified as best able to provide it so that recommendations flowing from the conference would lead to the best sentence for the youth. There were no alternative measures which would prevent or reduce the risk of non-participation by the professionals.","Counsel for the young person made an application under s. 132 of the Youth Criminal Justice Act (YCJA) requesting that the court exclude the public and the media from a pre-sentencing conference scheduled for December 11, 2006. The Crown, the youth person and the defendant applied to have the conference excluded from the court convened pursuant to s. 19 of the Act. The purpose of the conference was to provide recommendations on a sentence for T.C. This case attracted considerable media attention because of a concern raised by some members of the youth community regarding the adequacy of government programs and support for the youth who apparently suffers from mental health issues and who is in the permanent care of the Minister of Community Services. In turn, this case raised interesting issues regarding the conferencing provisions of the YCJA, the 'open court principle', the 'dagenais/Mentuck test' and the discretionary power of the court to exclude member of the public from the conference. HELD: The application was granted. The court ordered that the conference be held in open court. The request for exclusion order relating to the conference related only to the request for an exclusion order. There was no evidence before the court rebutting the open court principle and support an order pursuant to sec. 132. The burden of displacing the general rule of openness lies on the party making the application. The test to be applied, commonly referred to as the 'Dagenaises' test, requires a balancing of competing interests, that is, freedom of expression and other important right and interests. Discretion must be exercised in accordance with the Charter, whether it arises under the common law, under statute (as is the case here) or under rules of court."

This agreement held that the sum of $550 (adjusted for inflation) is to be paid to the wife until she dies or remarries, whichever comes first. The applicant paid this amount (except for a unilateral deduction in 1995) for over 25 years. The basis of his application is that he is now retired and earning less income. In addition, the respondent now earns part-time income that she did not have at the time of the agreement. At the time of the agreement, the wife raised the couple's five children and received child support from the applicant. HELD: The application is dismissed with costs to the respondent. The SCC has held that in order for a Court to vary support provisions in a valid settlement, separation agreement or consent order, a material or radical change in circumstances causally connected to the marriage needs to be established. Retirement of one of the parties was reasonably foreseeable at the time they entered into the agreement. It was also foreseeable that retirement income is most often less than employment income. This is not the kind of radical unforeseen change in circumstance required to vary the support. The preamble of the parties' agreement states that they intended it to be a complete and final settlement. The applicant has always earned considerable income and continues to have a better standard of living than the respondent. The respondent's modest income does not provide grounds to vary the agreement as she still has a much lower standard of living that the applicant, even after receiving the spousal support.","FIAT.

The trustee maintained the bankrupt was repeatedly advised or cautioned that bankruptcy may not affect the majority of his creditors. Subsequent appraisals placed the value of his unfinished home at $150,000 rather than $40,000. The bankrupt was now eligible to obtain mortgage financing but first had to get out of bankruptcy. The bankrupt had attempted an orderly payment of debts prior to bankruptcy and had considered proposal post-bankruptcy. HELD: The application for an order annulling the assignment was dismissed. 1)The bankrupt met the definition of an insolvent person at the date of the assignment. It would be dangerous to set a precedent which would allow such an application because of post-bankruptcy circumstances. An improved financial situation and the ability to pay debts in full should not be used as criteria to launch section181 application. 2)The bankrupt had not filed monthly financial statements nor made payments as agreed to cover the costs of the administration of the estate.

e_1999skqb151.txt,"The farm implement dealer and the defendant entered a standard form Finance Lease Agreement which provided for an 'advance payment' and semi-annual installments with the final 'termination value' payment to be paid at the defendant's option if he elected to purchase the sprayer. The central issue was whether the Agreement was a lease and liquidated damages should be awarded in accordance with clause two, or a conditional sales security agreement whereby the dealer was restricted to repossession and sale by s.46(2) of the Saskatchewan Farm Security Act. HELD: The plaintiff's claim was dismissed with costs on Column 3. 1)The Agreement was a conditional sales contract whereby title was reserved until the defendant elected to make the final payment. The transaction falls within the ambit of the Saskatchewan Farm Security Act and the dealer's right to recover the unpaid purchase price is restricted to repossession and sale. Although the dealer framed the Agreement as a lease the Agreement itself used notions of retail financing and secured party. Nomenclature such as principal, past due interest, conditional sales contract, purchase of equipment, and retail sales contract were used. The construction and interpretation of the nature of the Agreement is a question of law. The Agreement had many attributes of ownership and collectively showed that the defendant acquired a substantial interest in the sprayer. He had possession and unrestricted right to use the sprayer with high base hours. The total payments were equivalent to the total payments under sales contract. The defendant had the option to acquire title by making the final payment. He bore the risk of loss and obligation for maintenance and insurance. 2)The court could not determine whether the option price would be substantially less, equal or more than the June 2002 fair market value of the sprayer. 3)If the Agreement is lease the defendant's consent to give up possession was conditional upon his release from further liability. Case Credit cannot foreclose the entitlement to 40 days notice and take possession of the sprayer by relying upon conditional unwritten consent. To validate early repossession would defeat the intention of the legislation to protect creditors. Case could take possession only in accordance with Part IV of the SFSA. 4)If the Agreement is lease and covered by the SFSA, the defendant would be released from all liability under s.55. It would be unjust to make any further order in a summary trial without the benefit of discoveries or pre-trial conference and without evidence of the fair market value at the time of seizure. 5)If the Agreement is lease and not covered by the SFSA, it would be held that the dealer was not barred by implied acceptance of the condition the defendant be released from further liability because of the exclusionary clause. Judgment would have been granted for $42,089 with costs on Column 3.","The issue was whether the Agreement was a lease or a security agreement. The dealer and the owner entered a standard form Finance Lease Agreement which provided for an 'advance payment' of $9,320 and the same amount by semi-annual installments commencing December 15, 1997 and continuing until June 15, 2002 with the final 'termination value' payment of $23,650 to be paid at the owner's option if he elected to purchase the sprayer. The evidence was clear that the parties treated the trade-in as the advance payment even though the value of the trade in did not equal the amount of the advance Payment; the difference being $679.33 (between $10,000.00 and $8,320.67). HELD: The claim was dismissed. The defendant was awarded costs on the basis of Column D of the Tariff of Costs. 1)The Agreement had many of the attributes of a lease but the Agreement itself used notions such as retail financing and secured party. It would be unjust to make any further order under the Act in these circumstances and in the absence of a evidentiary basis, for example, of the fair market value at the time of the seizure as required for an order under s.55(c) of the Act. 2)Only if the Agreement is lease and is not covered by the Saskatchewan Farm Security Act, would the Court be able to ascertain the market value in June, 2002 and in light of the evidence that it depends on market fluctuations, cannot determine whether the option price would be substantially less than the fair value in May 2002 or equivalent to it, or more."
c_2008skca28.txt,"The appellant agreed to buy a two-story condominium unit from the respondent developer. The building permit had not been obtained, nor had condominium titles been raised at the time the sale agreement was entered into. In the course of construction the respondent opted not to proceed with the two-story unit, revising it to a single story unit which was offered to the appellant. The appellant did not accept the offer, and registered a miscellaneous interest against the title to the entire parcel of land. The appellant sues for specific performance of the agreement and in the alternative, damages. The developer succeeded in obtaining a court order discharging the miscellaneous interest. The Court's jurisdiction to hear the appeal is found in s. 111 of The Land Titles Act, 2000. The issue is whether the appellant possessed an interest in land so as to support the registration of a miscellaneous interest. HELD: Appeal dismissed.  1) Before a condominium plan as defined in The Condominium Property Act, 1993 comes into being, there is nothing in the Act which directly or inferentially entertains the prospect that a purchase of a 'proposed unit' can constitute an interest in land, or a registrable interest for the purposes of s. 50 of The Land Titles Act, 2000. 2) The Act expressly prohibits the registration of any charge against the common property. The appellant is not entitled to rest his claim to a registrable interest in the surface parcel on the basis of a notional claim to rights in 'common property'. Common property, by definition, does not come into existence until the condominium plan comes into effect. 3) For the purposes of s. 50 of The Land Titles Act, 2000, the appellant had no basis in law, or under The Condominium Property Act, 1993 for asserting an interest against the surface parcel owned by the respondent.","The appellant agreed to purchase a two-storey condominium unit from the respondent, developer. It was the only planned unit of its kind in the warehouse the developer proposed to convert to a 26 unit condominium complex. The developer decided not to proceed with the two-story unit, revising it instead to a single story unit (Unit 5). The appellant registered a miscellaneous interest against the title to the entire parcel of land on which the warehouse stood. The respondent later sold the unit to third party purchaser for damages. The appellant appealed. The preliminary question is whether the appellant possessed an interest in land. HELD: Appeal dismissed with costs. 1) There is nothing in the reasons of the Chambers judge which indicate that she in any way touched upon the substantive issue, namely the issue whether the purchase agreement was frustrated by supervening events. 2) The appellant had no basis in law, or under The Condominium Property Act, 1993, for asserting an interest against a surface parcel owned by the respondent.  3) The Chambers judge did not err in the result as the appellant at no time possessed a registrable interest in the land. In any event, the issue of frustration was not before the Court in any event.  4) The respondent had not filed a statement of defence at the time it made the application and the issues lacked refinement. The determination of appropriate remedies was premature at that stage of the proceedings."

If an offender is exempted from payment of the victim surcharge, it is also mandatory that the Court give reasons. The sentence is varied to include an order requiring the respondent to pay a victim surcharge in the amount of $30.","The Crown appeals the sentence to the extent that the victim surcharge was waived. The sentence was made on the basis that the trial judge did not comply with the mandatory provisions of s. 737 of the Code. Section 737 states: 737. (1) Subject to subsection (5), an offender who is convicted or discharged under section 730 of an offence under this Act or the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act shall pay a victim surcharges in addition to any other punishment imposed on the offender. (2) The sentencing judge failed to comply with s 737(1) of the Criminal Code or, alternatively, the explicit provisions of ss 737(5) and (6) of ss 604(a). This sentencing judge has consistently and consistently raised the issue of undue hardship. This is particularly true where the respondent has not requested an exemption pursuant to s. 730(5). In this case, the sentencing judge raised the maximum amount of surcharges by 15 per cent. The maximum surcharge is $30 which is paid by the Respondent through March 5, 2007. The Crown gave 30 days from the day of the sentencing to pay the surcharge to the respondent."

The appellant's memorandum of law and oral argument only addressed whether the police officer had reasonable and probable ground to arrest and demand his breath sample and asserted a violation of his rights pursuant to s. 8 and 9 Charter of Rights. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. The trial judge tested the officer's credibility and the judge's conclusion was supported by facts. The officer's belief was based on the observation that the appellant was driving with a flat tire, with windshield wipers operating on a clear night, as well as slurred speech and bloodshot eyes. The officer had reasonable and probable grounds to demand a sample of the appellant's breath.","An appeal from a conviction in the Provincial Court of Saskatchewan that the appellant did, having consumed alcohol in such a quantity that the concentration thereof in his blood exceeded 80 milligrams of alcohol in 100 milliliters of blood, operate a motor vehicle contrary to s.255(1) and s.253(b) of the Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1985, c. C-46. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. It was not clear that the officer observed the bloodshot eyes of the appellant after making the formal arrest as argued by the appellant. The trial judge was in a position to test the credibility of the officer. In coming to his conclusion he considered the totality of the evidence, the trial judge's conclusion was supported by the facts. The appellant's memorandum of law and oral argument dealt only with the contention that the police officer did not have reasonable and probable grounds to arrest him and to demand that he provide a sample of his breath for analysis, thereby infringing his right under ss. and of the Charter of Rights and Freedoms, Part of the Constitution Act, and in excluding the evidence pursuant to s8, 8, or 10(b). The officer testified to a whole list of factors in her evidence. There was not the slightest indication that she didn't make observations or truly act upon them. The video confirms that she was correct in most of those observations. The subjective element in determining whether she had reasonable or probable grounds (e.g. to make a demand for a breath sample) is not present in the determination of the reasons."
5_2007skpc74.txt,"Decision, following a voir dire, on the admissibility of statements made by the accused to a police officer, beginning with: 'Excuse me, I was in a roll-over accident and I am intoxicated.' The officer, who observed symptoms of impairment, asked the accused how much he had had to drink and was told he had consumed about 15 beers. The officer placed the accused under arrest for impaired operation of a motor vehicle, and read him his Charter rights, the Police Warning and a Demand for Blood Sample. The officer then detained the accused by remaining with him while awaiting the Blood Kit to arrive and for a blood technician to take the blood. During this time, the officer interrogated the accused about the accident and the accused provided additional information. The Crown contended that if he was given the police warning then it would be clear to the accused that he did not have to continue to answer questions the officer's questions. The Defence argued that since the arrest and the blood demand were based upon self-incriminating evidence obtained by breach of the accused's s. 7 rights, the arrest was illegal and all evidence obtained thereafter should be excluded; or, at least, that the information obtained was illegally obtained and the police could not rely on that information to make the demand. The accused testified that he talked to the police officer only because he believed he had a legal obligation to do so, based on advice he had received from others that there was a legal obligation to report the accident promptly to the police. The Crown conceded that the accused did have a legal obligation to report the accident promptly, and that if the accused believed he was reporting the accident when he gave self-incriminating statements to the police officer as a result of that belief, those statements must be excluded according to law. HELD: All of the statements of the accused, including those made after the arrest, are excluded and will not form part of the Crown's case. The evidence obtained, and the statements, in particular, were self-incriminating and conscriptive. The officer was acting in good faith, not with serious intentional disregard of the accused's rights. He was not taking a statement under the Traffic Safety Act. He did not know that the accused was only saying things because he believed he had to under compulsion of statute. Even though the investigator did nothing that violated the accused's rights, they were nevertheless violated. Because the violation resulted in the making of statements that amounted to self-incriminating evidence, following the logic of the case law, it is necessary to exclude those statements. The accused did approach the police officer with the intention of reporting the accident as is required by the Traffic Safety Act. As such, and as the Crown correctly concedes, his initial statement, anything said by the accused while providing his personal information and the answer to any question while registering at the hospital are excluded from this trial. As the self-incriminating statements made under compulsion of statute have been excluded, it follows that any evidence that came about as a result of the officer following up on those excluded statements are also in breach of the accused's s. 7 rights.","The accused was charged with impaired operation, driving under the influence of alcohol and breach of his section 7 rights. The voir dire decision was made following a review of statements made by the accused to a police officer. The statements in particular were self- incriminating and conscriptive. The accused believed he was reporting the accident when he gave self-incriminating statements to the police officer as a result of this belief. HELD: The accused's statements were excluded from evidence at trial as they were not reasonable statements made under compulsion of statute. The admission of these statements would be clear to the accused that he did not have to continue to answer questions of the officer. 1) The accused responded to the officer that he knew his rights and understood the warning. 2) The Crown conceded that the accused had a legal obligation to report the accident promptly and if the accused believed that he was Reporting the Accident (as he believed he did) then the evidence must only be excluded based upon the factors expressed in R. v. Collins, [1987] and Stillman (1997), 113 C.C.C.(3d) 321. 3) The defence argued that since the arrest and the blood demand were based upon evidence obtained by a breach of the accused's s. 7 rights and was self incriminating, the arrest was illegal and exclude all evidence obtained thereafter, or at least that the information obtained was illegally obtained and the police cannot rely on that information to make the demand. The Crown contended that if the defence accepted that the officer had given the accused a warning and that he understood his rights, the warning and the demand for the blood sample and was'relatively co-operative throughout, the statements will be excluded because none of those statements amounted to a violation of his s.7 rights. 4) The Court held that the Crown could not rely on information obtained by the illegal or unauthorized disclosure of information. The defence also argued that there was nothing like a'realistic' reason behind the statements made, even if they were made under duress. The Court concluded that the evidence received by the officer was as the result of breach of a section rights, must now determine if the evidence so gathered must be excluded from the trial pursuant to s. 24(2) of the Charter. It is useful to divide the statements into groups. Those made before arrest and those given after the arrest are those that were made in good faith.

7_2018skca42.txt,"Criminal Law – Murder – Second Degree Murder – Conviction – AppealEvidence – Unsavoury Witnesses – Vetrovec Warning – Charge to Jury The appellant had been found guilty of second degree murder following a trial before a judge and jury. He appealed on the ground that the trial judge had failed to give the jury a Vetrovec warning regarding the testimony of his former common law spouse (S.S.) and a witness who had been his friend (W.D.) who was the source of the gun used in the shooting of the victim. The appellant’s trial counsel had initially identified the need for the judge to issue the warning because W.D. had an interest in the outcome because there were outstanding charges against him and because there was the potential that S.S.would be charged too, she would also have an interest in the case as well. During the pre-charge conference with defence counsel and the Crown, the trial judge noted that in giving the warning to the jury he would also have to convey a summary of the Crown’s confirmatory evidence. The defence counsel then withdrew his application. The victim had been a friend of the appellant. According to S.S.’s testimony, the appellant and the victim had pre-arranged a meeting in an abandoned farmyard. The victim worked as an automated teller machine (ATM) technician and as part of his job, he travelled between ATMs carrying cash. S.S. did not see what happened between the two men but heard two gunshots and then saw the appellant and the victim point guns at each other. She saw the victim on his knees pleading with the appellant and offering money in exchange for his life. The appellant instructed her to collect the money and the victim’s cellphone and place them in his truck and while she was doing so, she heard another gunshot and saw the victim lying face down and the appellant standing over him holding a gun. As she and the appellant left the scene, the appellant gave her the victim’s gun. The appellant hid the other guns and the money at another farm site and then dumped the victim’s cellphone and ammunition in a farm field. Apart from the handguns, none of the other items were ever recovered. The witness remained in a relationship with the appellant for another four years following the crime until November 2013. She was contacted by the police in February 2013 and denied any knowledge of the incident. At trial, S.S. testified that she was afraid of the appellant and he had warned her that as an accomplice, she was as involved as he was. When the RCMP contacted her again in May 2014, she again denied any knowledge but then told the officer what she knew because she felt safer and would receive protection from the appellant. S.S. did not have a criminal record, nor was she charged with any offence arising from this incident. The appellant testified that during the meeting in the farmyard, the victim produced two handguns and they began to test fire the weapons. The victim suggested that they stage a fake robbery. The appellant would rough up his friend and then take the cash from his truck. The victim became quite aggressive after the appellant hit him too hard and began chasing him with one of his guns. S.S. then took one of the guns and shot the victim three times. She took $23,000 in cash from his truck because she had financial problems. The testimony of W.D. was that the appellant had acquired two handguns, a Glock and a .22 calibre handgun, from him, ostensibly on behalf of another friend. Several days later, the appellant returned both handguns and reported that after his friend began to shoot at him with the .22 calibre, he had returned fired and shot him three times. On the appellant’s insistence, the witness changed the barrel of the Glock handgun several months later. The police arrested W.D. and charged him with unspecified offences arising from the incident. In the appellant’s version, he testified that the victim brought the guns to the meeting and assumed that he acquired them from W.D. He therefore returned them to W.D. after the incident and requested that he change the barrel on the Glock to protect W.D. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. The court found that the trial judge had not erred by not giving the Vetrovec warning. It was not mandatory for him to do so regardless of the position of the defence counsel. The judge was aware of the need for such a warning in the circumstances and after consulting with the Crown and the defence, he exercised his discretion to decide that he would not instruct the jury. The judge was aware that the defence counsel withdrew his application as a tactical decision to avoid having the judge repeat the Crown’s confirmatory evidence to the jury. The judge’s exercise of his discretion was entitled to deference.","The defendant was found guilty of the second degree murder of his common law spouse. The trial judge sought input from counsel as to whether Vetrovec warning should be given in relation to the testimony of Ms. Saxon and Mr. Windrum. After lengthy exchange between the Crown and defence counsel, defence counsel not only abruptly withdrew his request for a Vetrochio warning but insisted that it not be given. The defendant appealed. Appeal dismissed.  1) The defendant took the stand in his own defence. His version of events leading up to his interaction with Mr. Byer and his friend (who had been in the defendant's truck at the time of the murder) largely conformed to that of the Crown's argument. His decision to withdraw his application could only have been based upon a fundamental misunderstanding of the strength of the ballistic and scientific evidence and must be questioned in light of the circumstances of the case to determine whether the trustworthiness of that witness is impaired. 2) In some circumstances the trial judge may have erred in law in failing to give a sufficient warning. However, this factor on its own does not mandate a warning. There is no evidence to support the conclusion that the defendant changed the barrel of the handgun that changed the potential location of the bullet and the time period in which it fired the fatal bullet. The scientific evidence did not support the contention by the Crown that the bullet had changed in such a fashion as to change the barrel at the exact time it was fired. 3) The evidence implicating the defendant in the murder of Mr.Byer was circumstantial at best. The evidence arising from the pre-charge conference and the interaction with the defendant (who was in the driver's seat of his truck when the shooting took place) did not provide sufficient support for the defendant’s argument that a warning should have been given. 4) In the course of reviewing the evidence and assessing the credibility of witnesses who seek to avoid prosecution or incarceration by testifying for the Crown, the defendant fell into an unfair and unjustified trap. The sentencing judge did not give sufficient detail to the jury as to the dangers inherent in their testimony. 5) The court found no error of law on the part of the defendant as a judge as he gave no reasons for his decision not to give the warning. The appeal court also found that the error of a judge in not giving a warning could have been avoided if he had given a warning to other witnesses."
b_2004skqb105.txt,"FIAT: The defendant applied for security for costs in the amount of $50,000. HELD: The plaintiff was required to supply security for costs in the amount of $18,000. 1) The defendant proved facts, which demonstrated the existence of several of the criteria listed in Rule 538 of the Queen's Bench Rules of Court. The plaintiff failed to establish any of the situations listed in Rule 539.  2) The presence of a counterclaim does not necessarily or automatically prohibit the granting of an order for security for costs. Rather, it is a factor to be considered. In this case, the counterclaim was not a wholly distinct claim. It arises in respect of the same matter and transaction as the claim proper. 3) The defendant commenced the builders' lien action, long before filing a defence and counterclaim within this action. Had the counterclaim not been filed, an order for security for costs as requested would have been appropriate. It is somewhat artificial to now deny that relief because of the counterclaim, which has the effect of facilitating a disposition of all matters within one proceeding. 4) The plaintiff applied ex parte under s. 56(1) of The Builders' Lien Act to have the defendant's lien vacated.

It is somewhat artificial to now deny that relief because of a counterclaim which has the effect of facilitating disposition of all matters within one proceeding.  3)An order requiring security for cost will not have an adverse effect on the plaintiff's ability to defend against the defendant's counterclaim if the security is restricted to costs for the defence of the claim proper. 4)The presence of the counter claim does not necessarily or automatically prohibit the granting of an order for costs. In the alternative, the defendant has asked for a declaration that PricewaterhouseCoopers is liable for any award of costs that may be made. 539(c) should be exercised in the circumstances. 6)The defendant commenced another separate and distinct action (Q.B. 1438/99), which is the other action. That was the same subject matter and included all the parties involved in that accident. 7)A party counterclaim is not wholly distinct from the claim. There is a statutory regime but it is unlikely anything more would be ordered as it may adversely effect the plaintiff’s opportunity to defend the action. 8)Individual costs of the application were awarded."

HELD: 1)The jury may be advised of the prior accident, its date, that proceedings were commenced in this Court and date of those proceedings and that the accident was ultimately settled and the action discontinued. The terms of the settlement and the sum paid were not to be disclosed. Beyond the issue of privilege which was a complete answer to the request, revisiting that action was a more critical problem. The sum paid to settle the first action was not allocated to any head of damages so those issues would have to be transversed as well. 2)The applicant may introduce his prior medical records with respect to the 1985 accident subject to compliance with the usual rules as to notice and admissibility. 3)The statement of claim in that action could not be entered at this trial as it was not evidence.  At best it was a series of allegations made against the prior defendant. The applicant could examine the respondent as to particulars of her claim in the earlier action and refer to material paragraphs. 4)The applicant was restricted to using the respondent's examination for discovery in the prior action for the purpose of cross-examination.  5)Costs were reserved to the trial judge. 6)The previous judge did not intend to reserve his decision with respect to the hearing of this motion and there was no impediment to the matter being reargued and disposed of.","FIAT. The judge reserved his decision with respect to the hearing of the applicant's motion in conjunction with the proposed trial of the action.

The applicant may introduce these records into evidence subject to compliance with the usual rules as to notice and admissibility and may choose to require the medical witnesses in question to appear in person.

HELD: The accused was sentenced to 18 months in a provincial correctional institution. 1)It would be contrary to the administration of justice in view of the seriousness of the offence to allow the accused to serve his sentence within the community even though he appeared to satisfy the requirements of s.742.1(a) and (b) of the Code. There were numerous adverse impacts on the victim. 2)Mitigating circumstances included the absence of a criminal record; his abstinence from alcohol since the assault; the absence of penile penetration; his remorse and apology to the victim and to the court; his serious health problems; his ability to rehabilitate and the fact that he was a model citizen prior to the assault.","The accused was convicted of sexual assault. The Crown sought a sentence of 1/2 to 3 years for the offence. They indicated there was no prior romantic connection between the victim and the accused and that she pleaded with him not to do this. The property damage and vandalism had no connection to the case. HELD: A lower sentence was justified. A sentence of less than 2 years would be just and fair. The Court asked that the accused be given a non-custodial sentence as he had no prior criminal record and that the offence would not have occurred if he had not been drinking. He was prohibited from having any fire arms, ammunition or explosive substances for a period of ten years from his release from prison. The accused could not ignore the impact upon the victim. She lost her job in the community and was ostracized in the town. A lengthy sentence would seriously affect the accused's ability to rehabilitate."

HELD: The appeal was allowed and a new trial ordered. 1)Section 530(3) is mandatory in Canada in order to assist official language minorities in preserving their cultural identity. 2)The trial judge had no discretion and was obligated to put to the unrepresented the accused the right to be tried in either of the two official languages. 3)The failure by the trial judge to advise the accused in accordance with Section 530(2) constitutes a procedural wrong and constitutes a substantial violation of the accused's right to a trial in both official and foreign languages. 4)There is no substantial wrong with respect to the procedural or substantive right to make choice between the two languages.

c_1991canlii4362.txt,"The parties lived together for some 12 years before separating in 1988. The plaintiff was 53 and the defendant 60. The plaintiff sought an order under the Partition Act for the partition and sale of two properties owned jointly and a division of property owned by the defendant based on a constructive trust. The defendant owned and operated residential rental properties. The plaintiff, who had stopped working as a medical records technician in 1988, maintained the household and assisted in the business by answering phones, bookkeeping, showing apartments and helping with minor repairs. (1) that the plaintiff met the three requirements to prove an unjust enrichment by virtue of the plaintiff's contributions of time and money, namely (a) an enrichment, (b) a corresponding deprivation, and (c) the absence of any juristic reason for the enrichment. The proper remedy was an award of monetary damages representing 25% of the increase in the value of the defendant's assets during the relationship, not the imposition of a constructive trust; and (2) jointly held properties were to be sold pursuant to the Partition Act, unless the plaintiff elected to buy out the defendant's one half interest within 30 days.

For the twelve years between 1975 and 1988, the plaintiff earned $17,409.95 per year. Her income diminished due to reduced hours worked and in 1986 she stopped her employment altogether. Her average earnings over the years were $10,162.95. The constructive trust was found to have met the three requirements to prove an unjust enrichment including that the contribution was sufficient to entitle the plaintiff to an interest in the property and that the defendant was chargeable as a constructive trustee.

Although the signature card signed when the account was opened could not be found for the hearing, the probate court relied on the evidence of the bank representative (who testified that she had the card when she closed the account and she was 100% sure that the account was a joint account and who was able to present to the court the form of the applicable account agreement) in determining that the monies in the joint account belonged to the daughter.  It was also found, on a strong balance of probabilities, that the deceased intended to make an inter vivos gift to her daughter and, alternatively, that the evidence rebutted any presumption of resulting trust in favour of the deceased or her estate.

Assessing non-pecuniary damages at $60,000. In assessing pecuniary damages, the court accepted the defendant's expert evidence which led to the conclusion the plaintiffs businesses were marginally profitable. The defendants were ordered to pay $30,000 as real, net loss of future income. The court approved a 5% capitalization rate as being appropriate where there was an eight year term to age 65. The plaintiff settled his future Section B benefits just before trial. The court rejected the defence argument that they were entitled to a credit for present value of those benefits which represented a figure over seven times the settlement figure. The defendants were only entitled to a credit for sums actually paid to the plaintiff. The court rejected the plaintiff's actuarial report as being late and in breach of Civil Procedure Rule 31.08.","The plaintiff was seriously injured in a motor vehicle accident. His automobile was struck from behind. Although he was not hospitalized and never required surgery for his injury, he was by all accounts completely and permanently disabled for any type of employment for which he was suited by education, training or experience. The plaintiff was working six days a week on his farm and mill operations from dawn until dusk. He was hospitalized for seven days and then returned to work every day for six weeks. Three weeks after the accident he was sent to physiotherapy, then spent six weeks in the Rehab Centre. His condition worsened and he was unable to work any longer. He suffered headaches, blurred vision and vertigo. Depression and anxiety led him to restrict his analysis of the assets to three questions: 1) what the doctor's opinion on the whiplash type injuries was and how long it would take for the plaintiff to recover from the injury; and 2) if the injuries were not fatal to the plaintiff's recovery he would be permanently disabled from returning to any form of gainful employment.

c_1998canlii12367.txt,"The decision of the Board of Arbitration was held by the chambers judge to be fundamentally flawed in that the majority brushed aside basic grammatical conventions; had proceeded upon a bad principle of construction obviously weighted in favour of the grievance; had discarded the ordinary meaning of some words; and had violated the terms of the agreement precluding alteration of its provisions. She also held that one cannot ignore the phrase 'pursuant to Article 28 or 26', read it out of existence nor re-write it and that if the words were given their ordinary meaning the interpretation was patently unreasonable. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. 1)The trial judge did not err in concluding the majority decision of the Board of Arbitration was patently unreasonable. Its decision rested upon an interpretation of the collective bargaining agreement that the words of the agreement could not reasonably bear. 2)No material error was found in her analysis in finding that the decision was fundamentally flawed or in her analysis of the phrase 'pursuant to Article 28'. Nor in her identification or application of the governing standard of review. DISSENT: The appeal would have been allowed. 1)There was no dispute that the central issue, the reviewability of the board's interpretation, requires an application of the test prescribed by Shalansky. The Chambers judge did not follow that approach. Once it is accepted that there are two reasonable constructions, the suggestion of a reviewable error of law in consensual arbitration disappears. The decision can only be set aside if it involves an interpretation the words of the agreement could not reasonably bear. The patently unreasonable test is a very strict test. 2)The judge was wrong to use the Melford decision to support her conclusion that the Pool interpretation was the only one which the words of the collective agreement could reasonably bear. 3)Once the ordinary meaning of the words 'pursuant to' must be set aside by reason of their context in Article 16, the decision by an adjudicator to choose either 'for the purposes of' or 'subject to' is motivated more by the result desired rather than by fine legal principles of interpretation. Such policy decisions are better left to arbitrators in the field than to judges.","The appellant appealed the majority decision of the Board of Arbitration in the grievance of Lavern Chypiska. The Chambers judge found that the majority had brushed aside basic grammatical conventions, proceeded upon a bad principle of construction obviously weighted in favour of the appellant and had violated the terms of the agreement precluding alteration of its provisions, including alterations wrought by changing the ordinary meaning of any of the words in the agreement in the course of interpreting its provisions. The resulting interpretation was not necessarily unreasonable, as it was not patently unreasonable, and the appellant's argument that the words could not stand together was reasonable. Appeal dismissed. The appeal court found no material error in the analysis of the majority's approach to the interpretation of the provisions in question. It was not irrational for the court to conclude that the phrase 'pursuant to' as the phrase is used in the collective agreement does not mean'subject to' even though it is reasonable to choose 'for the purposes of' such a thing.

5_2006skca7.txt,"This is an appeal brought by the R.M. from a judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench determining that a mortgage held by the R.M. was subordinate to a mortgage held by the respondent Farm Credit Canada (FCC), even though the R.M. mortgage was registered before the mortgage of FCC. The R.M. had agreed with the mortgagor that its mortgage would be subordinate to that of FCC. The appeal raises the application of the priority provisions of The Land Titles Act, 2000 and in particular the application of s. 54 of the Act. HELD: The mortgage of the respondent has priority over the mortgage of the appellant. The appeal is dismissed with costs.  1) It is not necessary in this case to consider whether the priority provisions of the Land Titles Act are overridden by commercial postponement agreements in mortgages, or whether reliance by the competing security holder is necessary in order to displace the doctrine of privity of contract in relation to a covenant to postpone, for the court consider the matter to be governed by a consideration of the nature of the interest created by the R.M. mortgage in light of s. 54(3) of the Act. 2) Registration does not and cannot alter the nature of the legal interest granted by the instrument registered. In the present case the mortgage instrument states that it is pursuant to the prior Grant Agreement executed by the parties. This agreement, in turn, clearly provides that any security granted by Mainline to the R.M. is subject to the prior security interest of the respondent to the extent of $3,125,000. In effect, Mainline granted to the R.M. a mortgage of a limited interest, being Mainline's equity of redemption after any mortgage held by the respondent, to the extent of $3,125,000. The appellant admits that it was never intended, as between itself and Mainline, that it would obtain a security interest in priority to that of the respondent. Mainline granted a mortgage to the appellant subject to the prior interests, as defined, of the respondent and of CIBC.

HELD: 1) The trial judge held that the leasehold mortgage gave the appellant no enforceable rights against the respondent's fee simple interest, reasoning that the transfer of the fee simple title to the newly created surface parcel of land to Mainline by the CPR effectively terminated the lease, leaving no interest to which the respondent could attach. The appellant admits that it was never intended, as between itself and Mainline, that it would obtain a security interest in priority to that of the respondent by virtue of the filing of its caveat. 2) The respondent obtained, under the provisions of the Land Titles Act, priority over the prior equitable interest of the appellant by relying on its prior registration and priority provisions. 3) On the basis of the above authorities, the mortgage instrument states that it is pursuant to the prior Grant Agreement executed by the parties. 4) In this case the appellant's interest was an unregistered interest, but it did confer rights on the appellant and such rights were enforceable against Zirtz."

The victim did not provide a victim impact statement, but the court concluded that the event would have been terrifying for him. The gravity of the offence was high given the maximum sentence of life imprisonment. The court found the following mitigating factors: 1) guilty pleas; 2) the event was not planned in advance, it was prompted by alcohol use; 3) the assault was serious but brief; 4) the accused were all employed and contributing members of society; 5) the accused all accepted responsibility for the offence; and 6) the accused all complied with strict release conditions for three years. The aggravating factors were: 1) s. 348.1 of the Criminal Code was applicable to all accused even though their level of participation differed; 2) they entered the victim’s residence by breaking a window; 3) the crime was intense; 3) two of three accused had weapons and used them on the victim; and 4) the victim had some lasting injuries from losing three to four teeth. The court was prepared to extend leniency to the accused; however, some period of incarceration was found necessary to meet the objectives of deterrence and denunciation. A.H. was sentenced to 10 months incarceration, J.M. to 11 months incarceration, and N.F. to 12 months less a day incarceration for the break and enter charge and one year consecutive incarceration on the s. 85(2) charge.

They didn't ask to exclude the public from the hearing, nor did they seek a publication ban.  , the file will be sealed. While Rule 59.60 doesn't provide guidance on when it would be appropriate to seal a file, Rule 85.04(1) does. The SCC decision of Dagenais (and related cases) applies. A confidentiality order should only be granted when: necessary to prevent a serious risk to an important interest; there are no less intrusive measures available; and the benefits outweigh the costs. Personal embarrassment or damage to a party's reputation isn't enough. Here, the important public interest is the protection of personal identifiers (e.g. SIN's, addresses, bank account numbers and other personal information required on court documents). Having these identifiers accessible to members of the public can result in identity theft, which is a real and serious concern. The court is able to take judicial notice of the fact society values the prevention of identity theft (and that it exists in the first place). There are no less intrusive measures to prevent access to this personal information that aren't cumbersome and costly for the parties and court administration staff. The salutary effects of a sealing order outweigh its deleterious effects, especially since the public will still be permitted to access the court hearing and any decision that is rendered. The open court principle was crafted at a time when the internet wasn't a public source of information and manipulation.","The parties had both requested an order to seal the contents of their divorce file. They had done so after receiving a request from the media to examine that file. The media request was made according to the provisions of Civil Procedure Rule 59.60.

It is to solve the problem (in case such as this where there are no children) of how to divide property and provide support to an entitled party after relationship has ended. This work is conducted in an environment that must recognize and assist a significant number of petitioners and respondents who are self represented. These cases suggest confidentiality order should only be granted when (a) the order is necessary to prevent a serious risk to an important interest in the context of litigation because reasonably alternative measures will not prevent the risk; and (b) the salutary effects of a confidentiality order, including the effects on the public's expectation and the public and social interest in this issue do not outweigh its deleterious effects. The public interest in an open court is not completely circumscribed by this order."
b_2013skqb265.txt,"The appellant landlord appealed a decision of the Residential Tenancies hearing officer. The tenancy in question had commenced in April 2012. On September 18, the tenant had given six weeks' notice of her intention to terminate the tenancy. The term of the lease stated that it was for a term of 12 months (April 2012 to March 2013) and continuing thereafter from month to month until one of the parties gave one month's notice. The appellant did not try to rent the premises following receipt of the notice because he had decided to furnish the unit prior to re-renting. He spent $15,000 doing so and advertised the unit in mid-January, increasing the rent by $400 and obtained a new tenant as at February 1. Although it is not stated what relief the landlord sought from the Office of Residential Tenancies, the hearing officer stated in the decision that the lease was a month-to-month tenancy. The appellant argued that the hearing officer made errors in law in that he 1) misinterpreted s. 19(1)(g)(iii) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 in making that finding, as the lease was for a fixed term; and 2) misinterpreted s. 8(2) of the Act in finding that the landlord's efforts at mitigation were not reasonable within the meaning of the section and the landlord was legally disentitled by s. 8(1) of the Act. HELD: The Court held that the hearing officer had erred in law in finding that the lease was for a month-to-month tenancy. The one-month-notice provision only applied if the tenancy was extended beyond the fixed term. The appeal was allowed on this issue. The Court found that the decision of the landlord to furnish the premises was a business decision, and the result of this decision could not be attributed to the tenant. The Court dismissed the appellant's claim for loss.","The appellant landlord appealed a decision of the Residential Tenancies Hearing Officer in finding that the tenancy agreement was not a fixed-term agreement and that the landlord is legally disentitled to compensation pursuant to s. 8(1) of the Act. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. 1) The wording of the lease indicated it is for a fixed term from April 1, 2012 to March 31, 2013 and may thereafter be continued on month to month basis. The one-month notice provision was applicable only if the tenancy was extended to a month-to-month tenancy following the end of the fixed term. 2) The hearing officer misinterpreted ss. 19(1)(g)(iii) of The residential Tenancies Act, 2006 in finding the tenancy is not a long term agreement and thereby committed an error of law.  3) The respondent gave written notice to the landlord to terminate the tenancy in September 2012 in which she advised she was terminating the tenancy and giving up possession of the premises on the 31st of October, 2012.  4) The appellant did not attempt to rent the premises prior to re-renting it. He spent approximately $15,000 on furnishing the unit. He obtained a new tenant effective February 2013 at $2500 per month, which was $400 more than when the apartment was unfurnished. None of this macro decision can be attributed to the respondent."
b_2018skpc52.txt,"/n The accused was charged with violating s. 7(2)(b) of the Saskatchewan Fishery Regulations, 1995 by unlawfully fishing in an area of Canoe Lake, specifically Jans Bay, that had been closed to all fishing since 1993 because of overfishing by the local commercial fishery industry. The accused, a status Indian with Aboriginal and Treaty 10 rights, was fishing for food. He had used a net in the restricted area and had caught eight suckers, two walleye and one northern pike. The Bay was very close to the residence of the accused on the Canoe Lake First Nation and was his preferred area to fish. The remainder of Canoe Lake was subject to restrictions governing all fishing but open to unlimited Treaty sustenance fishing all year round. The accused admitted to the actus reus of the offence. Under the Constitutional Questions Act, 2012 the accused gave notice that he would argue that s. 7(2)(b) of the regulations was invalid because it restricted his Treaty and Aboriginal right to fish food in the restricted area as defined by the Regulations; infringed his Treaty and Aboriginal right to fish for food as protected by s. 35(1) of the Constitution Act, 1982; and infringed his Treaty and Aboriginal right to fish for food as protected by s. 25 of the Charter of Rights. The agreed Statement of Facts confirmed the accused’s Aboriginal Treaty status and right to sustenance fishing. The Crown’s major witness was an expert in fish biology and he testified that the restricted area had been closed to protect it for walleye spawning. He stated that the closed area could not be opened for sustenance fishing. The conservation effort had been supported by the Canoe Lake Band Council./n HELD: The accused was found guilty. The court found that the accused had failed to show a breach of his Treaty fishing right that would raise a defence or a Charter remedy to the charge against him: 1) the challenged regulations were within the implied common law limitations on Aboriginal fishing rights; 2) alternatively, the regulations fell within the provisions that permitted such regulations in Treaty 10; 3) alternatively, if they were not within the implied limitations of the right, the evidence had not established a prima facie infringement of the right; 4) alternatively, if there was a breach, it met the justification principles set out in Sparrow and Pierone.","The accused was charged with angling for and consuming fish in waters closed to the public pursuant to s. 7(2)(b) of the Saskatchewan Fishery Regulations, 1995. The issue was whether the accused, as a Treaty Indian fishing for sustenance/food was bound by the regulations, and if so, did the regulation violate his Treaty right to fish For sustenance or for food? HELD: The accused was granted a stay of the charge. The Court found that the accused’s evidence remained uncontradicted by any defence evidence. The evidence presented was that the co-op decided who was eligible to purchase a commercial fishing license and that the closure of Jans Bay appeared to infringe on his right to sustenance fishing. The Agreed Statement of Facts was also granted on the basis that the wording of the regulation to apply only to commercial fishing and did not constitute a protection of Treaty rights. As the accused was a status member of the Canoe Lake Band, he was intimately familiar with the regulations and their impact on the area."

The Court admitted a letter into evidence in which the accused attempts to induce a potential witness to fabricate an alibi for him. HELD: Accused found guilty. The accused was correctly identified. The Court drew an adverse inference against the accused by his attempt to induce a potential witness to fabricate an alibi by. The Court was convinced beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused's purpose in writing the letter was not to insure himself against the prospect of wrongful conviction, but to induce perjured evidence for his benefit in order to discredit the identification evidence adduced at the preliminary inquiry. The letter is direct evidence of where the accused was not at the time of the robbery and is corroboration for the identification evidence of the Crown witness.","The accused was charged with robbery. The defence applied to exclude the letter on the basis that it was obtained by an unreasonable search or seizure and thereby violated the accused's right under s.8 of the Charter of Rights and Freedoms. His letter was direct evidence that he was not at the Eureka Club at the time of the robbery and is corroboration for the identification evidence of the accused. HELD: The accused was found guilty. 1)The accused's failure to identify the accused at the preliminary, preliminary and trial (eight months after the robbery) and to present him with a picture of his girlfriend (who was standing between him and the robber) did not serve as a reason to suspect or reject his evidence. 2)The letter was not an alibi. It was not a lie. 3)The admission by the accused of being unable to identify himself as the person who committed the robbery was pure speculation. 4)The admissibility of the letter was high. 5)The allegation that the accused intended to fabricate the alibi was proven beyond a reasonable doubt. The accused did not meet the onus on him to prove his innocence, nor was it inferred from the letter that he did so wilfully."
5_2002skqb213.txt,"FIAT. The issue in this application to vary spousal support was whether there had been a material change in either the husband's or wife's employment status, financial means or needs, warranting an increase in spousal support since their 1999 interspousal contract. The wife requested a 50% increase based on the husband's income increase of 50%. She suffered from MS and was unable to work. HELD: Spousal support was varied to $3,500 monthly. The only material change in the wife's means and needs is that fact she is residing with a new partner who resides in her home in exchange for yard work and housework. Although he worked, he made no apparent financial contribution to the household. The wife was awarded costs fixed at $1,000.","FIAT. The issue was whether there had been a material change in circumstances by virtue of a change in either the husband's or wife's employment status or financial means or needs, warranting an increase in spousal support. The husband's position was summarized in his affidavit as follows: a 36% interest in trucking company called 'Titan Transport Ltd.' The wife was residing with a new partner. Their arrangement essentially allows him to reside in her home at no cost in exchange for his performing yard work and housework. The very duties her new partner was to perform were performed for the company's bottom line in 2001. The bonuses were based on the previous year's profits. The wife argued that the 'working bonus' did not have to be repaid to the corporation and there was no independent verification that the shareholders bonus must be repaid, or that they are, in fact, being retained in the company. Spousal and support will be varied to $3,500 per month effective May 1, 2002 and continuing on the first day of each month thereafter until further order. Costs will be fixed in the amount of $1,000."
e_2000nsca53.txt,"The appellant and respondent lived together in common law relationship for approximately ten years. Two children were born of the relationship; the parties owned home as well as other assets. They separated in 1995. The appellant brought an application under s. 275 of the Matrimonial Property Act seeking an equal division of assets. She also sought a declaration that the Charter is infringed by the definition of spouse in s. 2(g) of the Act, because it does not include or recognize her common law relationship. The Chambers judge dismissed the application. He found that marital status is not an analogous ground upon which to base claim of discrimination under s. 15(1) of the Charter; or, in the alternative, that s. 2(g) does not constitute discrimination under s. 15(1) of the Charter; or, in the further alternative, that if s. 2(g) is discriminatory, it is saved by s. of the Charter. Allowing the appeal, that marital status is an analogous ground, and that s. 2(g) is discriminatory under s. 15 of the Charter because it denies a person in a common law relationship benefits which are granted to a similar person in a marriage relationship. The Crown did not discharge its onus of proving that the discrimination is demonstrably justified in a free and democratic society. The court rejected the appellant's submission that common law should be read in to the Act, and instead declared s. 2(g) to be unconstitutional and of no force and effect. This declaration was suspended for 12 months to enable the legislature to devise new criteria for eligibility under the Act that do not infringe s. 15(1) of the Charter.","The appellant and the respondent lived together for ten years. Two children were born out of this relationship. The respondent separated in 1995. The appellant commenced an application under the Matrimonial Property Act seeking an equal division of the parties' assets. In conjunction with that application, the appellant sought a declaration that the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms is infringed by the definition of'spouse' in s. 2(g) of the MPA. The MPA does not apply to the appellant nor the respondent because they do not come within the definition in the Family Maintenance Act. Changes in the law of matrimonial property did not affect the right of the wife to seek maintenance (also called support or alimony) from her husband after divorce or separation. However, marital status was beyond the individual's effective control."
c_2009skqb433.txt,"The Ministry seeks an order under s. 37(2) which is a permanent committal and is a precursor to the boys Michael and David being placed for adoption. Art and Laura, the maternal grandparents oppose the application and want the boys returned to their care. The mother, Melody, supported her parent's application for custody. HELD: The boys are in need of protection and there is an order placing the boys in the permanent care of the Minister. As long as the boys are in foster care, the Ministry will make arrangements for the boys to have regular access to their mother and to Art and Laura.  1) There is no doubt but that Art and Laura love and wish the best for the boys. However, there are real concerns about Art and Laura' familial context. There is the fact that Art and Laura's own children were apprehended in 1989 and committed to the Minister. It is pertinent to note Art and Laura are estranged from four of their six children.  Two of Art's children claim he sexually assaulted them. When Melody testified she said her first preference was that the boys be placed with Mary Stevens, their foster parent, but did acknowledge that the boys would be in good hands with Art and Laura. 2) While the Court accepts that the Stevens home is a positive and nurturing one, there is no question it is not an ideal physical place for 9 people. With organization, routine and discipline however, it can function at a satisfactory level. Further, if an order is made under s. 37(2), the boys have the opportunity to be adopted. The Court cannot lightly preclude that possibility.","The Ministry of Social Services sought an order under s. 37(2) which is a permanent committal and is a precursor to the boys being placed for adoption. The boys were apprehended from the care of their maternal grandparents, A.H. and Laura. Art and Laura opposed the application and petitioned the Court to return their grandsons to their care. HELD: 1) The children were placed with the MSS. The Ministry seeks an order pursuant to s.37(1) which in this case is a temporary committal. The children have special needs of some sort, even high needs. The physical plant of the foster home must present some challenges. However, the Court was of the view that an adoption plan is unlikely due to reasons such as the age of the child or other circumstances. It is clear that the Stevens family has a laissez-faire approach to sexuality. The Court found that both the boys and their father, who was convicted of welfare fraud, had a similar approach to parenting. All the children had special needs or were in need of protection. The MSS knew that it had a moral and legal duty to ensure that foster homes had the necessary physical requirements to properly care for the children placed in such a home. It was also important to maintain the confidentiality of the parents' contact with the children. 2) The parents' children were found to be in the best interests of the children and, in the view of the Court, the most important to them, was to be placed with their biological father. The Children and Family Services Act sets out clear objectives. If a child is found to need protection, the court is required to look firstly at s.38(1), which requires determination of whether or not the children should be returned to parent, placed with a person of sufficient interest, or with the Minister for a temporary period of time. In this case the Court concluded that the parents did not pose a risk to their children. 3) The Court ordered that the boys should be apprehended and placed in the custody of the Minister until they were 18 years of age. The Family Services worker responsible for the Ministry's child and child welfare services (MSS) concerns for Michael and Laura were a factor in the decision to allow the boys to stay with the Stevens. The family had nine foster children at the time of the offence. The mother had worked through the criminal code convictions and various extracurricular activities to obtain employment. She was not familiar with the workings of the social services system"
c_2011skqb478.txt,"The accused was found guilty of possession of cocaine for the purpose of trafficking and possession of marijuana for the purpose of trafficking contrary to s. 5(3)(a) the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act, and having in his possession cash (almost $30,000) knowing it was obtained through the commission of an offence contrary to s. 354 and 355(a) of the Criminal Code. At issue was the accused's sentence. The Crown sought a global sentence of 5 years plus a forfeiture order of items seized, a fine in lieu of forfeiture for all cash used for legal fees, a mandatory weapons prohibition and sought bodily substances for DNA analysis. As the accused had been denied bail and had pre- trial detention of 15 months and 24 days, the defence sought one and one-half times credit for time served on remand.HELD: The accused had 9 prior drug convictions since 1999, two for trafficking in 2000 for which he received a 12 month sentence of incarceration and, in 2007, one trafficking and conspiracy to traffic which resulted in his receiving a 5 year penitentiary sentence. As the accused had been a compliant prisoner on remand, the Court granted him credit for 1.5 days for each day spent on remand for a total of 23 months and 21 days credit. The Court imposed a sentence of 30 months imprisonment, and ordered a DNA sample as well as a fine in lieu of forfeiture in the sum of $16,326 (being the sum transferred to the accused's legal counsel to pay his legal fees) to be paid within 60 days and, in default of payment, a term of imprisonment of 6 months consecutive to the term of imprisonment otherwise imposed.","The accused was found guilty of three counts contained in an amended Indictment dated December 12, 2011, charging him with the following offences: unlawfully possess a controlled substance included in Schedule 1 of the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act; unlawfully have in his possession property (or proceeds of property), to wit: cash of a value exceeding $5,000 knowing that all of the property was obtained (or derived directly or indirectly) as a result of the commission in Canada of an offence punishable by indictment contrary to s. 354 and 355(a) of the Criminal Code; possession and possession of drugs for the purposes of trafficking; breach of probation; failure to take into account the nature and quantity of the drugs found in the accused's possession; aggravating circumstances; his pre-trial detention which amounted to 23 months, 21 days credit; his deposition that he was a compliant prisoner, had no disciplinary issues or problems while on remand and that he would have qualified, had he been in the regular prison population, for a one-third reduction in his sentence for the current offences. The amount involved was $16,325.98 transferred from his person to his lawyer at his request to pay his legal fees; he had nine prior drug convictions since 1999, two for trafficking and one conspiracy to traffic which resulted him receiving a sentence of 5 years in the penitentiary; he was 34 years old and had a serious prior conviction record for drug trafficking and conspiracy to do so as well as a number of drug possession charges. While not a street level drug possessor, the accused had a previous drug related record which showed a sophisticated commercial enterprise that would warrant an extremely lengthy period of incarceration."
3_2004skqb379.txt,"FIAT: The issues to be determined on this application are custody, child support and cancellation of the arrears of child support. HELD: 1) On the issue of custody, the mere passage of time, in this instance 9 years, would constitute a material change in circumstances relevant to custody. The child is now 15 years old. The parties are not candidates for joint custody and shared parenting. The child's view of the dysfunctional relationship between her parents compels this Court to preserve the status quo as being in the child's best interests. The petitioner will continue as the sole custodian.  2) The access was varied in January 2004. Nothing has changed to warrant a variation. 3) There was no evidence to support the respondent's statement that the child is living with him half the time. There was no evidence or explanation as to why he has failed to pay child support, which creates the present arrears. The evidence with respect to the respondent's finances was unsworn and out of date. In oral argument, the respondent asserted that he contributed to his daughter's care and that he is contributing to her education trust fund. If these expenditures were in fact made over and above his own cost of living, the Court would be compelled to accept the fact that he has financial resources available to him other that the $9,940 of social assistance which is disclosed in his tax return and financial statement. 4) The essence of the respondent's application for variation of the child support is based on his claim that his health has precluded him from working. The respondent's doctor was examined and, based on that medical evidence, the Court could not conclude that the respondent's generalized anxiety and depression disorder is beyond his control. The evidence was that the respondent could choose to help himself by eliminating alcohol and marijuana use. The respondent failed to meet the burden of proof by demonstrating that his depression and anxiety disorder was the consequence of factors beyond his control and thus preventing him from working and having an income with which to pay his child support obligations during the period under review. The application for variation of child support and cancellation of child support arrears is dismissed with costs.","FIAT. The respondent applied to vary the support and access provisions of the May 2, 1995 judgment. The 1995 judgment provided for the divorce of the petitioner and distribution of matrimonial property estate to the couple as well as custody, access and support for the child of the marriage. At the time of the application, the petitioner was 13 years old and the respondent was in the primary care of her mother. She had been living with her father for the past six years and had declared her intention to relocate with the child to British Columbia in the fall of 2003. The petitioner claimed that he was unemployed since the year 2000 and that he relied solely on the respondent's evidence to prove he was so debilitated by his state of depression and anxiety that he could not and would not be able to earn a livelihood. HELD: The application was dismissed. 1)Nothing had changed to warrant a variation of the 1995 custody order. The material change threshold had not been met. 2)The respondent was to continue to be the sole custodian of the child. What remains to be determined upon this application are the matters of custody, child support and cancellation of the arrears of child support. 3)The 1995 judgment was no longer appropriate. The existing access order allows the respondent to define the extent of access or time spent with each of her parents. 4)The fact that the respondent is 15 years old does not mean that he is not in the child's best interests. 5)The mere passage of time, in this instance nine years, would constitute material change of circumstance relevant to custody.

HELD: The statements made by the complainant are found to be reliable and are therefore admissible.  1) Hearsay statement may be admitted on a principled basis, the governing principles are reliability and necessity. A number of cases have held that necessity is met when a witness recants or in some other fashion effectively holds hostage evidence that cannot be obtained from another source. 2) There is no other way to obtain the complainant's evidence.

Where the hearsay statement was made in circumstances which provide some guarantees of trustworthiness, the test for reliability will be met. The following circumstances are evidence of trustworthiness: the complainant arrived unexpectedly at her neighbor's apartment, she was upset and crying, she asked that police be called, she spontaneously described the assault, she repeated a consistent version to the police, she had fresh red marks which corresponded with her description of the assault and the accused verified aspects of her complaint with comments he made.","The accused was charged with assault contrary to s. 266.

Where the hearsay statement was made in circumstances which provide some guarantees of trustworthiness, the test for reliability will be met.  1) The complainant's evidence was important to the Crown's case and there was no other means of obtaining that evidence. Whether her alcohol consumption that night erased her recollection of events or whether she was a hostile witness was immaterial. 2) The accused's behaviour was aggravating in that it effectively held hostage evidence and the court need not determine the reason for the purpose of this application.  3) The Court found that the test of reliability was met when the complainant recanted on an earlier statement. The earlier statement was necessary evidence because evidence of the same quality could not be obtained at trial. The fact that a witness is available at trial does not preclude the prior statement from being 'necessary' as well."

b_2017skqb308.txt,"The Minister of Social Services applied for an order committing a two-year-old child to the care of his maternal grandparents for an indefinite period of time. The grandparents were previously designated as persons of sufficient interest. The child had lived with them since birth. The mother and father both suffered from addictions and had stopped living together by the time the child was born. The father had multiple criminal convictions, including drinking and driving offences and weapons offences. The mother’s relationship with her parents, family support worker and child protection worker during the course of the child’s life had been marked by volatility, argumentative behaviour and threats, one of which resulted in criminal harassment charges. The child was the subject of a protection order, which imposed conditions upon his parents. Neither meaningfully complied with the conditions set out in the protection order. Both parents testified at trial that their present circumstances were not suitable to raise a child. Each expressed intention to take steps necessary to provide a home for the child. Each parent asserted that a temporary order was appropriate. | HELD: The child was placed in the custody of his grandparents on an indefinite basis, which, while not temporary, was not as potentially immutable as a permanent order. That the child was in need of protection was not seriously challenged by either his mother or father. The prospect for change at the time of trial was limited to statements of good intentions. On their own, such statements were insufficient. There were opportunities for the parents to demonstrate a reasonable prospect for change. These opportunities were squandered and, in some cases abusively rejected by the mother.",HELD: The Court found that the parties were persons of sufficient interest regarding the child pursuant to s. 23(1)(a) of The Child and Family Services Act and that an indefinite order of protection was appropriate. The Ministry’s position was that both parties were able and willing to provide the minimum level of parenting required for the child to his needs. The Court also found that neither parent had demonstrated the kind of permanency that would justify any form of reunification now or in the foreseeable future.

The count particularizes in the alternative various ways in which the accused is alleged to have defrauded the investors of ICC by using funds of ICC to advance his or Schafer's interests. The case law cited by both parties clearly establishes that the word 'transaction' as used in s.581(1) is to be interpreted broadly and flexibly, and that a single transaction may, in this sense, include a number of acts or incidents occurring over a period of time. 2)Count 1 of the indictment was to be amended. The application to stay proceedings on the basis of findings made in the Schafer trial was allowed in relation to the particular charge in subpara.(b) of count 1 regarding use of ICC funds in the amount of $513,000 for Trirak along with subpara.(j) regarding alleged representations to ICC's investors that 30% of their investment would be invested in GICs. To allow the Crown to pursue these allegations would be an abuse of process. The Crown had indicated it would not proceed with subparagraphs (c) or (d). 2)There had not been unreasonable delay in light of the complexity of the charges, reasons for the delay, and the agreement by the applicant not to object to certain portions of delay. There was ongoing disclosure and there were various court appearances following the laying of charges.","FIAT: The accused applies for an order pursuant to s. 581(1) of the Criminal Code quashing a count of the indictment as amended on the ground that it applies to more than one single transaction; alternatively, an order staying the proceedings on the grounds of unreasonable delay in bringing the accused to trial. The Crown argues that the findings of Klebuc J. in the original indictment do not on proper interpretation exonerate the accused. HELD: The application to quash the count is dismissed. The Court concludes that the Crown is not bound by any factual or legal determinations made by the trial judge in the Schafer case. In fact, the Crown should have taken more seriously the allegation by the former that the accused had defrauded the ICC and its preferred shareholders of money in excess of $1,000. The applicant reasonably expected the Crown would carefully consider those findings and reassess its position in relation to the particular allegations against the accused and that it preferred to await the judgment of the Crown on that basis. Further, the applicant agreed to waive any objections to delay until the outcome of the trial in light of the new indictment. There was no promise by the Crown that it would be bound in its proceedings against the applicant by the findings in the previous indictment. It was more beneficial to both the Crown and the applicant to have the benefit of the judgment in the current matter before proceeding with the Leibel trial."
b_2018skqb188.txt,"HELD: The accused were each acquitted of all charges. The court believed the evidence provided by the two accused and found that it was possible that the lease represented the actual arrangement between them and O.G. and that they believed that there only 400 plants in the greenhouses and they were part of a legal grow operation. The letter provided by O.G. purporting to change the address of his licences was found to have been forged by him. Regarding the possession for the purpose of trafficking, the court found that it was not satisfied on the evidence that either of the accused ever had personal possession or control of the marijuana plants nor that they had joint or constructive possession by virtue of some arrangement with O.G. The accused had explained that the cash seized by the police from their house had been received by them after they sold a trailer.","HELD: The Court held that an amendment to an information expanding the time particulars of the offence could be made at trial based upon evidence that indicates the offence may have been committed within the amended timeframe. Since the evidence was to the effect that marijuana plants did not start arriving until early June, grant amendment of the indictment to cover the period March 1, 2016 to September 15, 2016. The Court found that the Crown had proven beyond a reasonable doubt that: a) they were unlawfully producing cannabis; b) they possessed the cannabis for the purposes of trafficking; c) the currency in question was obtained by the commission in Canada of an offence punishable by indictment. HELD: 1) The evidence established that the accused were active participants in the marihuana grow operation and were in the possession for the purpose of trafficking. 2) Based on the totality of the evidence, the only rational conclusion to be drawn in respect of the cash found in their residence is that it was property obtained by a commission of an indictable offence in Canada. [2] The Crown challenged the veracity of the accused's evidence. Given their testimony, the application of the principles of W.(D), 1991 CanLII 93 (SCC), [1991] SCR 742) is a major element of this case. More detailed analysis of their evidence is required."

The wife argued the agreement was not applicable to the present situation where they have separated and was only in effect during the time of the marriage or upon their deaths.

This is an appropriate situation to apply s.40 of the Family Property Act. The fact they each executed a will to give effect to that intention and the husband paid practically all of the day-to-day expenses led to the conclusion their verbal agreement should be considered binding, notwithstanding their marriage ended by separation rather than death. 2)The condominium purchased by the husband was the 'family home' as provided for in s.2(1)(a). There was no extraordinary circumstance as provided in s.22(1), which would prevent equal division of the value of the family home.

Neither s.34 or s.37 of the Criminal Code justified the assault. 2)The testimony of the Crown witnesses was accepted.

The victim suffered significant injuries to his head and face. He was not drinking on the occasion. The Crown called three Crown witnesses to testify. Two of the Crown's witnesses testified that Baikie was more aggressive than the Crown would have us believe and he threw a punch at the accused. One witness testified that he observed the accused make a motion or gesture that he interpreted as an invitation to become involved with him or 'bring it on'.

The accused's defence was that he threw the punch but his efforts were ineffectual and the accused took advantage of the situation to administer a 'beating blow' to him.

He may have thrown punch at him or attempted to do so but he was no threat to the accused and the 'accused in fact took advantage' of the circumstance to administer the beating blow to him which was not necessary to prevent him from falling out of the chair or to prevent the accused from getting knocked out.

1991canlii4370.txt,"The defendant lawyer was retained for the purpose of obtaining and disbursing mortgage funds. The plaintiffs, creditors of the defendant's client, sued the defendant for negligent misrepresentation, breach of trust and breach of undertaking. The defendant initially received three irrevocable letters of direction for payment of amounts owing on a construction project. When the project got into financial difficulty the defendant advised his client to seek separate counsel to deal with the creditors - suppliers. At a creditors meeting the defendant advised the creditors' counsel of the initial three letters of direction. The project was considered viable by the creditors and continued, with the defendant obtaining postponements of the three letters of direction. Further creditors' meetings were held, a Creditors' Committee struck, and subsequent letters of direction sent to the defendant by the client and certain creditors. The defendant, in acknowledging a subsequent letter of direction, made no mention of the earlier three letters, nor any explanation of 'all of the proceeds'. One member of the Committee was aware of the initial irrevocable letters of direction. On what was to be the final mortgage draw, the defendant requested and was refused a postponement of the initial three letters. With his client's consent, the defendant disbursed the funds, to pay off the initial three creditors, a mechanics' lien referred in one of the subsequent letters of direction, his legal fees and the balance as per a letter of direction received from two of three members of the Creditors' Committee. Dismissing the action, that (1) there was no negligent misrepresentation as the creditors had continued to advance supplies, not on the basis of the defendant's letter of acknowledgement, but because they considered the project viable. Further, certain other plaintiffs were not aware of the letter, and could not have relied on it. Other plaintiffs did not supply after the letter and therefore did not rely on it. The Court noted that on a balance of probabilities, the defendant's disbursement did not cause the demise of the project. At the time of the disbursement the project was still viable and the plaintiffs made their own decision to cease supplying and to lien the project;  (2) there was no breach of trust as the defendant had no fiduciary duty and had at no time acted for the plaintiffs;  and  (3) there was no breach of undertaking as the undertaking must be considered in all the circumstances, including knowledge of the plaintiffs, the other letters and meetings. The Court concluded that the member of the Creditors' Committee who was aware of the initial irrevocable letters had a duty to advise the other members. The documentation was clear that legal fees would be deducted and the Committee was also aware of the direction to pay the mechanics' lien.","The first mortgagee to the project, the second mortgagee, had received a number of irrevocable letters of direction which he acknowledged required him to pay the mortgage brokerage and architectural fees from the previous mortgage advance from the mortgagees. The project was financially tight from the very beginning. Some of the suppliers and creditors had become dissatisfied with the handling of the project funds by one of the principals of and was withdrawing its support. In early April 1987, the project manager, who had been retained by the creditors, requested that the funds be disbursed to other creditors. He was also requested to obtain postponements of the mortgage advances he was required to pay on the next mortgage advance. The plaintiff sued him claiming negligent misrepresentation and breach of trust. Dismissing the claim, that the defendant acted in good faith and was a conscientious solicitor, always attempting to be in strict compliance with the terms of his retainer and endeavouring to avoid any apparent conflicts of interest and to follow the instructions of his clients, subject to any limitations which had been placed upon him through his writing. There was no evidence of deliberate wrongdoing on the part of the defendant."
b_2018skqb197.txt,"HELD: The court sentenced the accused to a global sentence of 10 years for the manslaughter conviction. A one-year concurrent sentence was imposed for the conviction of prohibited possession of a firearm. The court gave him credit at the rate of 1:1.5 for his time on remand, resulting in a net global sentence of six years, five months to be served in a federal penitentiary. The Gladue report was considered and the background of the accused was assessed as an enormous mitigating factor. The court found that this was not an appropriate case to make an order pursuant to s. 743.6 of the Code both because of the multiple Gladue factors and because it had addressed the principles of denunciation and deterrence in the global sentence.","HELD: The Court sentenced the accused pursuant to s. 236(a) of the Criminal Code, RSC 1985, C-46 and his guilty plea to possession of a firearm while prohibited from doing so.  1) The sentencing principles outlined in s. 743.6 of the Code are summarized in this sentence: a global sentence of 15 years is appropriate in this case considering the multiple aggravating factors including the accused's serious criminal record including 55 previous convictions, 17 of which are for violent offences; the accused being subject to a firearm prohibition at the time of the offence; the fact that he was on a mandatory firearm prohibition and had been prohibited from possessing a firearm for 15 years; the evidence showed that the accused had temporarily overcome his demons with alcohol and was very remorseful. 2) The accused pled guilty to manslaughter. He was sentenced to 11 years, 7 months imprisonment and a 10 year global sentence with no parole eligibility until he had served half of his sentence pursuant to ss. 744.6(1). The accused showed no remorse for the killing, expressed no regret for his actions during the trial, nor expressed any regret for the loss of his ability to defend himself.  3) Although the Crown provided the Court with multiple cases, the Court reviewed all of the cases provided to it by counsel but, in particular, three cases the Crown was primarily relying upon in support of its position that a 15 year sentence was appropriate. The accused had 55 convictions on his criminal record; 17 of them for violence related offences; his attack on his landlord displayed a sustained attack on a vulnerable person. There were numerous Gladue factors that the Court should have further information about during the sentencing stage."

Twenty-two months passed between the laying of the charge and the trial date. Cote was not responsible for the delay and actively pursued a speedy trial. The delay was caused by the Crown's failure to provide timely disclosure. HELD: The charge was stayed. In applying the decision of the SCC in R. v.

The application is based primarily on the accused's position that he has been denied the right to be tried on the fraud charge within a reasonable time. HELD: 1) The length of delay is 8.5 months. The preliminary hearing was adjourned to June 8. 2) The Crown has conceded that it has been unable to meet the requirement of sufficient disclosure to permit the accused to make an informed election. 3) The delay occasioned by the Crown's delay is 9 months. 4) The trial judge faced with an application for a stay of the preliminary hearing on a balance of competing interests. The balancing of society's interest in requiring an accused to stand trial and right to trial within reasonable time is best achieved by examining whether the accused has been prejudiced by the delay. 5) In R. v. Morin, [1992] S.C.R. 771, the Supreme Court of Canada set out the factors it should consider in determining whether delay has been unreasonable. The Court found that the prejudice to the accused was substantial and sufficient to tilt the balance in favour of requiring a judicial stay."
e_2012skca69.txt,"The applicant applied for judicial interim release under s. 20(b) of the Extradition Act and s. 679 of the Criminal Code. Romania sought extradition of the applicant so that he might serve a 3 year prison sentence imposed as a result of a conviction in Romania for criminally negligent homicide with respect to a motor vehicle collision where the accused, while impaired, hit a pedestrian and killed him. The applicant offered surety from the Romania community in Saskatchewan who did not appear to have known the accused for long and offered to put up his car as bond. The applicant had common law spouse in Saskatchewan but owned no real property. HELD: Although the Crown conceded that the applicant had met the relatively low threshold of showing that his application for leave to appeal his extradition order was not frivolous, the Court of Appeal declined to release the applicant. The Court of Appeal held that there is an elevated risk of flight in light of the fact that the applicant has exhausted all appeals in Romania and is facing a 3 year prison sentence. Canada's international obligations in extradition proceedings require the Court to look more severely at the risk of non-appearance than it would if the application was made solely under s. 679 in respect of criminal proceeding in Canada. The sureties offered by the applicant were not sufficient to ensure his attendance at Court. The application for judicial interim release was dismissed.","The respondent applies for judicial interim release pursuant to s. 20(b) of the Extradition Act and s. 679 of the Criminal Code. The respondent is a Roma and Romanian national who has resided in Canada since his arrival here exactly eight years ago. Romania seeks the respondent's extradition from Canada so that he might serve a three-year prison sentence imposed as a result of his conviction, in that country, for criminally negligent homicide (an offence equivalent to that of manslaughter in Canada). The respondent states that he was detained by Canadian authorities for approximately 7 weeks during which time he made a claim for refugee protection pursuant to the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act. In his refugee claim documents, he disclosed his criminal conviction and sentence in Romania. He was ultimately released from detention in 2004 on the strength of $5,000 cash and a surety bond. He is currently residing in the United States and has the opportunity to make submissions to the Minister on any ground that may be relevant to his surrender, but he must make these submissions within 30 days of his committal order. Romania opposes the application. HELD: The application is dismissed.  1) The respondent's status as a Convention refugee and Canada's obligations under the Convention with respect to non-refoulement displace the limiting effect of its legal obligations under international extradition treaties on a level of acceptable risk under the 679(3)(b) test.  2) Romania's characterisation of the respondent as a flight-risk is minimal and the respondent has failed to proffer satisfactory evidence to overcome the heightened risk of his non-appearance. It is not appropriate to make such an inquiry either on the limited materials available to the Court or under s. 40 of the Code."

Both parties were ordered to have no contact with each other and the respondent was ordered to pay periodic child support if he got a job off the farm. HELD: The application was dismissed.

The court will taxed against the applicant and the proposed third party and designate the applicant with costs to the applicant. 1)Pre-trial proceedings will not be inordinate. The plaintiff's claim dates back to 1984. It can hardly be said any additional delay, due to third party proceedings, must necessarily result in dismissal of the application. Nor has the plaintiff established any prejudice. 2)The applicant has already established a prima facie claim for contribution and indemnity. There is no evidentiary threshold requirement that the parties meet on a case by case basis. 3)There may well be some delay in the plaintiff by allowing the thirdparty proceedings, but it will not prohibitively delay. There has been no prejudice in the pre-trial period. There was no indication that further steps would result in the disappearance of any evidence or that extra costs will be incurred in redoing steps already completed or that the process will become so cumbersome and complicated as to undermine the plaintiffs claim.  4)The application for an order granting the applicant leave to file a Third party notice in the within action was granted.

d_1999skqb276.txt,"FIAT. The plaintiff applied for summary judgment in his claim for dismissal without just cause. The plaintiff was initially hired as body shop foreman but additionally acquired the title of assistant manager. When the body shop manager became ill that work load also fell to the plaintiff. It was during this period that the performance of the plaintiff, described by the defendant as serious misconduct, resulted in his termination. There was no issue of a lack of mitigation as the plaintiff accepted a job with another autobody shop but at a much lower rate of pay. The action was brought pursuant to the simplified procedure outlined in Part 40 of the Rules of Court. HELD: Damages were to be calculated by the parties for the 7 month notice period based on his income and value of benefits over the previous year, less the 6 weeks pay received, and less wages and benefits received from his new employment. Jurisdiction was reserved to hear further evidence should the parties not reach agreement. 1)By using the words 'shall grant judgment unless', Rule 488 requires the presiding judge to grant judgment except in the circumstances outlined in s.488(a)and(b). The test is not whether there is contradictory evidence in the affidavits but whether despite the contradictory evidence the issue(s) can be decided in the absence of cross-examination and it would be otherwise unjust to do so. If the court can assume the defendant's evidence is true and still grant summary judgment there is no genuine need for a trial. 2)As noted in numerous decisions, whether an employer is justified in summarily dismissing an employee is ultimately a question of fact. The plaintiff was not terminated because of poor job performance in performing his contractual duties as foreman and manager but because of his alleged poor performance in doing the job normally assigned to two persons. The employer has the right to expect that employees will not disparage their immediate supervisors or other employees in the course of their employment and certainly not to clients or customers of the employer. The type of conduct here would not justify dismissal the first time it came to the employer's attention if the employee had been guilty of such conduct while performing only his own job function. 'Griping' is not uncommon in the workplace. The case law seems uniform that one or more warnings to an employee must be given before it can be said such activity 'fractures the employment relationship'. The category of misconduct can be said to change from poor attitude to disobedience or insubordination where dismissal results after one or more warnings. 3)The plaintiff was entitled to 7 months notice to reflect the fact that junior management positions are fewer in number and the considerable wage difference between management and non- management positions.  4)The plaintiff was entitled to taxable costs.","FIAT. The plaintiff applied for summary judgment in his claim for dismissal without just cause brought pursuant to the simplified procedure outlined in Part Forty of the Rules of Court. The defendant opposed the application and requested a summary trial. HELD: 1) Rule 488 sets out the test for summary judgement. The judge shall grant judgment unless (a) the judge is unable to decide the issues in the action in the absence of cross-examination; (b) it would be otherwise unjust to order summary trial, or (c) the trial of specified issue or issues (e) the plaintiff was entitled to taxable costs. 2) In the case of a person in the plaintiff's position, who occupied a junior managerial position in a very specific industry, the notice period selected should reflect that management positions are fewer in number than non-management positions, and that there is a considerable wage difference between a management position and a non- management one. 3) The plaintiff was able to obtain employment within approximately 2 and 1-half months of the end of the notice given to him by the employer at wage considerably below what he had earned with the defendant. The evidence established the plaintiff applied to numerous autobody businesses prior to accepting the employment he did and was not successful in obtaining an equivalent position at an equivalent salary. Taking all factors into account, this is an appropriate notice period to which the plaintiff is entitled. 4) Taking all of the defendant's material filed, it seems uniform that one or more warnings to an employee must be given before it can be said such activity 'fractures' the employment relationship.

2_2005skpc38.txt,"The accused is charged with driving without due care and attention contrary to s. 44(1) of the Highway Traffic Act. A pedestrian was crossing a road adjacent to a parking lot and, while walking directly in front of a stopped vehicle, was struck by the vehicle when it rolled forward. HELD: The accused is not guilty. The court accepted the accused's evidence that his vehicle rolled forward only a short distance of not more than one foot and not at a fast or accelerated speed and that the pedestrian was crossing outside of the cross walk and that the accused applied his brakes as soon as he saw the pedestrian. The accused did exercise due diligence.","The accused was charged with driving without due care and attention contrary to s. 44(1) of the Highway Traffic Act. The accused was on duty in a marked police car when the accused's vehicle rolled forward and collided with another vehicle. The second part of the Sault Ste. Marie test was whether the accused exercised due diligence applying an objective test in assessing carelessness and whether he has then shown, on balance of probabilities, that he exercised Due diligence in the context of the circumstances he encountered. The actions of the accused which could be considered careless are the speed at which he drove past the stopped vehicle, the location of the cross-walk, and his driving forward into the other vehicle. HELD: The officer was found not guilty of this charge. 1) The officer's evidence was that he did not touch the accelerator, and briefly took his foot off the brake, and then immediately reapplied the brake after seeing the other officer's vehicle. This vehicle only moved a short distance forward before striking the accused. The officer did not gesture or give any other cause for concern other than the complainant's statement to his wife that the vehicle could slow down. The Crown suggested that the accused had an oblique motive for doing so, perhaps thinking that the officer was being insolent and returning to set him straight. The defence suggested the accused should have simply continued driving. 2) The accused's evidence that neither was waving their arms or giving any other reason other than that of a person they later determined to be a'sir' did not lock upon impact. The Court was satisfied that the Crown had proved the accused drove careless. There could be no other reason on the evidence presented for the officer to have stopped his vehicle. He was crossing a parking lot when he was struck by the vehicle. As he was crossing the road, he was asked to assist another officer on a non-priority matter. He reversed his vehicle and crossed the street directly in front of the police vehicle. There was no one else on the scene at the time and the officer immediately applied his brake when he saw the accused cross the street. He took steps both to assist the officer by asking if he required an ambulance and to have other officers attend at the scene."
b_1996canlii5028.txt,"Guardian was the general liability insurer for Kellogg. Royal was the primary insurer as holder of Kellogg's blanket fleet coverage. Kellogg's employee was involved in a motor vehicle accident while on company business but was driving his wife's vehicle at the time of the accident. Royal denied coverage and refused to defend on the basis of an exclusionary provision regarding the use of substitute automobiles. It was held at trial that Royal was not obligated to participate. HELD: 1)The case law reveals some inconsistencies with respect to the relationship between the duty to defend and the coverage provided by the policy. Where the policy clearly does not provide coverage, the insurer had no duty to defend. Where a policy only provides coverage for some allegations the insurer is only obligated to defend those allegations which may trigger the obligation to indemnify. When a policy is ambiguous some courts have adopted Thames and have stated the mere possibility that the policy may provide coverage is sufficient to oblige the insurer to defend. 2)Section 209 provides no guidelines as to the scope of the inquiry the judge may engage in. The chamber judge did not define the scope of his inquiry and stated that the standard suggestion that Guardian must raise an arguable point was 'off target'. To determine whether an insurer has the obligation to defend a chamber judge must examine the coverage provided by the policy. The judge made no finding of ambiguity in the exclusionary provision. He simply determined the Honda was not covered by the Royal policy and did not decide the issue of indemnity. 3)The affidavit evidence indicated that the parties lived in the same premises thus that argument was without merit. CONCURRING JUDGMENT: The appeal was dismissed for different reasons.  1)There has been an acceptance of the general concept that the duty to defend is broader than the duty to indemnify. To order an insurer to defend a chamber judge need be less sure the policy provides coverage than would be the case for an actual determination of liability under the policy. 2)There was a factual element which could not be determined on this application such as whether a partially deflated tire constitutes a breakdown within the meaning of the policy and whether the automobile the employee was driving was owned by someone living in the same dwelling. 3)The question centered around the words used in clause 5 of the policy and who it referred to. There were inconsistencies in terminology. The policy should not be interpreted as though the restriction it contains on what automobile can be used as a temporary substitute should be ignored.","An appeal from an application for directions to determine whether Royal had an obligation to defend after a motor vehicle accident occurred. At the time of the accident, McLeod was on company business and was driving his wife's Honda because his company car had a deflated tire. At issue was whether the chambers judge incorrectly decided the issue of indemnity when he engaged in determination of which insurer was obligated to defend the action and if so, whether the Chambers judge erred in his application of the principles of contract interpretation. HELD: Appeal dismissed. 1)No matter the scope of the inquiry the duty to defend arises only when the pleadings disclose a claim which, if proven at trial, would be covered by provisions in the insurance policy. 2)The chambers judge did not have the factual basis before him to support his interpretation of the policy and form his conclusions. 3)The standard by which the obligation of Royal to defend is determined is broader than that of a duty to indemnify. 4)In the present case, the respondent is the primary insurer as the holder of the blanket fleet coverage of Kellogg. The chambers judge recognized this but did not define the scope. He simply said in response to Guardian's argument it merely must raise 'an arguable point' that the standard suggestion by Guardian was 'off target'. 5)A more restricted inquiry on s.209(1) could reduce the potential for inconsistent judgments created by the operation ss. 209(1), 209(3) and 209(4) of the Act."
d_2007skqb324.txt,"This is an application by the accused for an order that evidence obtained by way of a telephone interception be ruled inadmissible because it is irrelevant. Alternatively, the accused seeks exclusion of the intercepted communication on the basis that it was conducted in violation of s. 8 of the Charter and ought to be excluded under s. 24(2). The accused is charged with abuse of a position of trust contrary to s. 153(1)(a) of the Code. HELD: The evidence is admissible. The accused's application is dismissed. 1) After examining the transcript of the conversation, it is immediately evident that the contents of the communication are relevant. The complainant and the accused are discussing the intimate details of their relationship. The conversation is logically probative to the charge. 2) The learned provincial court judge did in fact have sufficient evidence before him to issue the telephone intercept authorization. The complainant was prepared to initiate a telephone call to the accused and engage him in a conversation which would likely cause the accused to make admissions or statements which could be confirmatory of her allegations. 3) The authorization clearly permits the police to intercept private communications in relation to an offence under s. 271(1) of the Code. That investigation was live and bona fide at the time that the authorization was obtained. The law in this country is that evidence of other crimes revealed during the course of a lawful intercept process does not render the evidence obtained inadmissible in relation to an offence not named in the authorization. The focus is on whether the interception was lawfully obtained and executed, not on what is discovered. Here the police obtained a valid authorization to intercept private communications in relation to an offence under s. 271(1) of the Code. During the investigation of that charge, they obtained evidence which is relevant to an offence under s. 153(1)(a) of the Code. The fact that the offence of s. 153(1)(a) is not named in the authorization nor included as an offence for which an authorization to intercept private communications could be obtained, does not affect the admissibility of the evidence. Therefore, there is no Charter breach. 4) Even if the evidence was obtained in violation of s. 8 of the Charter, such evidence is considered non-conscriptive evidence. Where the evidence is non-conscriptive, the court ought to go on to do a balancing as to whether or not the evidence ought to be excluded pursuant to s. 24(2) of the Charter. The factors to be considered are trial fairness, seriousness of the breach and the effect of exclusion. In this case if there is a breach, it was not serious and was inadvertent, the result of unmindful draftsmanship. There is no evidence of bad faith. There is no evidence of manipulation. The seriousness of the breach, if there was one, was minimal, and to admit the evidence would not bring the administration of justice into disrepute.","The accused was charged with two counts of sexual assault contrary to s. 271(1) and s. 273(2)(c) of the Canada Act being Schedule B to the Charter. The accused argued that the evidence obtained by way of a telephone interception was inadmissible because it was irrelevant. HELD: The accused's application was dismissed. 1)The evidence was relevant and admissible in that it did not violate the accused's s. 8 Charter rights. 2)The accused's argument that the police purposely navigated around the fact that offences under s. 153(1)(a) are not eligible for intercept was not supported by the evidence. The fact that the accused was denied his right to choose his audience does not mean that what he said to the complainant was compelled. The surreptitious recording did not compel or coerce the appellant to speak. The recording was not conscriptive evidence in the sense described in Stillman. 3)The Court did not conduct a review de novo. This court was not mandated to second-guess the issuing judge but must merely examine the original material in order to determine whether there was an appropriate basis for the order. The intercepted communication was non-conscriptive. 4)Even if the evidence was obtained in violation of s.8 of the Charter, such evidence is considered to be non-consecutive evidence. 5)In this case if there was a breach it was not serious and was inadvertent. There was no evidence of bad faith. The Court viewed the seriousness of the breach to be minimal and to admit the evidence would not bring the administration of justice into disrepute. 6)There was no Charter breach. The evidence was admissible and ought not to be excluded. 7)The breach did not breach the Charter at all. 8 is a Charter offence. The Act specifies the offences for which private communications may be intercepted and the evidence collected is limited to those specified offences. 8)The authorization clearly permits the police to intercept private communications between the complainant and the accused wherein the complainant would attempt to engage the accused in conversation concerning the alleged improper activity. There is no evidence that information concerning the offence would be obtained through the interception sought when the complainant engaged the accused and engaged him in conversation involving their alleged sexual activity. As a result, there is no breach of s8. 8. The reason the accused chose not to issue an exclusion order was because the judge had sufficient evidence before him to issue the warrantless intercept authorization. 8"

When, as here, a witness recants, the requirement of necessity is established. The real issue is whether the prior statement meets the test for reliability. When, as here, there is only one demonstrably false piece of testimony in the statement, which does not implicate anyone but rather attempts to exonerate someone, the Court was not prepared to say ipso facto the statement is unreliable. 2)The independent evidence sufficiently corroborated her statement in enough different particulars that, but for the demonstrably false portion, it met the threshold of reliability.","FIAT.
