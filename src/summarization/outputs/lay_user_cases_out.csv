"This was an application pursuant to The Inter-jurisdictional Support Orders Act for a declaration of paternity and child support. HELD: By agreement there was an order pursuant to s. 45 of The Children's Law Act, 1997 declaring the respondent the biological father of the child. The respondent does not currently earn sufficient income to pay child support. He was to advise the petitioner within 30 days if he receives an offer of employment or contract and if so, the terms of his employment including his gross income. 1) The respondent's ability to earn income is limited by his health to sedentary types of employment. There is no suggestion or evidence that his pursuit of education is unreasonable.  2) An individual who chooses to be underemployed or unemployed to avoid paying child support is 'intentionally underemployed or unemployed'. That is not the only circumstance envisioned by s. 19(1)(a) of the Guidelines. The Court adopted the reasoning of the Manitoba Court of Appeal in Donovan v. Donovan and the Ontario Court of Appeal in Drygala v. Pauli and found that 'intentional' extends to situations where a parent required to pay child support chooses, for whatever reason, to earn less than they are capable of earning. The fact that the parent chooses to be underemployed or unemployed, brings their situation within the meaning of 'intentional' and creates the circumstances envisioned by s. 19(1)(a). The reason for such a choice does not change the fact it is intentional, but it may impact on the Court's decision whether to exercise its discretion and impute income.","FIAT: An application pursuant to the Inter-jurisdictional Support Orders Act for a declaration of paternity and child support. The parties never lived together but had an intimate relationship which resulted in the birth of a child, [K.V.P.A.], born December 7, 1995 (age 8). HELD: The application was granted. 1) The Court must consider what is reasonable under the circumstances. The applicant must establish that circumstances exist which would cause undue hardship if the Table amount of support is ordered. If this test is met, then the parties' standard of living must be reasonable in the circumstances and does not warrant the imputation of income. 2) There are two lines of judicial authority dealing with the meaning of 'intentionally under-employed or unemployed' One line of authority holds that “intentionally” means “voluntarily”. It applies where parent chooses to be under-employment or unemployed. No specific intent to evade child support is necessary. There is no answer for person liable to support child to say he is unemployed or does not intend to seek work or that his potential to earn income is an irrelevant factor. There are no agreements or court orders with regard to child support obligations in furtherance of unrealistic or unproductive career aspirations. The Court has the discretion to impute income to the applicant where it considers that appropriate in these circumstances. It will not be presumed simply because the applicant has the legal responsibility for another child or children and/or because her current income is lower than that of the other spouse. The evidence in this case does not support finding of intentional unemployment. 3) There is a duty to seek employment in case where parent is healthy and there is no reason why the parent cannot work. It is appropriate for the Court to determine whether the child support should be set at a rate higher than the table amount based on undue hardship. The court has discretion to exercise its discretion and impute."
"This was an appeal from a dismissal of an application to quash the decision the arbitrator interpreting an agreement entered into between the appellant and the respondent. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. The interpretation of the arbitrator was a possible interpretation on a legal and grammatical analysis of the entire agreement, and was not patently unreasonable.","This was an appeal from a dismissal of an application to quash the decision of the arbitrator interpreting an agreement entered into between the appellant and the respondent. The arbitrator found the phrase in question to be ambiguous and outlined the reasons why each of the competing interpretations might be chosen. He concluded that the phrase 'any employer' in the context of this collective agreement, is an unambiguous one. The grievance failed because the burden of proof placed upon the union to convince it on balance of probabilities that its interpretation is the correct one."
"An appeal of an award of $1,245. The tenant's father contacted him about the hearing while he was out of the country. The father appeared at the hearing and objected to service of the hearing notice. HELD: The appeal was allowed. The award was set aside and a new hearing was ordered. The Deputy Rentalsman committed an error in law by denying 10 days notice. The Landlord and Tenant Act s.60(5.1) empowers the Rentalsman to validate a defective service provided the notice came to the attention of the person to be served. The day the notice was received and the day of the hearing must be excluded in calculating the notice period (Interpretation Act s.24(4)). In this case the tenant received only 8 days notice. No costs.","This was an appeal by a tenant against a decision awarding his former landlord $1,245.00. The appeal questions the correctness of the award and the validity of the notice of the hearing. HELD: The appeal is allowed; the award is set aside; and there be a new hearing on a date to be fixed by the Rentalsman. There will be no costs. The deputy landlord acted pursuant to s. 60 of The Residential Tenancies Act, S.S.S., c. R-22. It follows that in this case the tenant received only eight days notice. He was entitled to insist on ten days notice and by denying him that period of notice the Deputy landlord committed an error in law."
", The Crown appealed the acquittal of the respondent on a charge of assaulting his wife. The trial judge had found the respondent, who had taken a sleeping pill and was drunk at the time of the assault, did not have the intent to commit the assault. Allowing the appeal, that voluntary intoxication cannot be considered as raising a reasonable doubt as to intent in a general intent offence unless the degree of intoxication is so extreme that the accused did not even possess the minimal intent to perform the actus reus because his state was akin to automatism or insanity. The Court noted that no medical evidence as to the affect of the sleeping pill with the alcohol was adduced, nor was there any evidence concerning the strength of the pill or the amount of alcohol consumed and concluded that the evidence supported the conclusion that the respondent appreciated the circumstances of the assault, even though he could not remember it afterward. The Court set aside the acquittal and entered a verdict of guilty pursuant to s. 686(4)(b)(ii) of the Criminal Code as it had concluded that the respondent 'should have been found guilty but for the error in law'.","This was an appeal from the acquittal of the respondent on a charge of assaulting his wife. The evidence indicated that the respondent had come to visit his estranged wife. He complained of being tired and suffering from insomnia. She gave him a sleeping pill at about 1:00 p.m. and told him that he should not consume alcohol. He left shortly thereafter taking a quart of whiskey with him. At approximately 2:00 a.m., he returned to the respondent's residence without any clothes on. He was intoxicated. He got angry with her when she asked him what he was doing. She advised him against drinking and pushed him against the wall. He did not respond. The respondent was found guilty. The Court found that voluntary drunkenness is not generally a defence to general intent offences. It is only in cases of extreme drunkenness that evidence of intoxication is capable of raising reasonable doubt as to an element of general intent."
"The respondent mother applied to lift the stay of execution imposed by Court of Appeal Rule 15(1) when the appellant father appealed the trial judge's decision to award custody of the parties' son to the mother with the child to have access to the father for one extended weekend per month during the school year (see: 2013 SKQB 212). The trial judge had found that both parties had exhibited a lack of interest in their child and there was little to distinguish either of them as the better custodial parent. As the mother had facilitated the father's access to the child and he had not demonstrated the same willingness and that the most important relationship in the child's life was with his sister, who resides with the mother, the trial judge found that it was in the child's best interest to foster that relationship and grant custody to the mother. HELD: The Court granted the application. There would be no harm to the child if the stay was lifted. The father was directed to perfect his appeal and the stay of proceedings arising from Court of Appeal Rule 15(4) was also lifted.","The applicant mother sought a lifting of the stay of execution on the judgment of the trial judge (indexed as 2013 SKQB 212 (CanLII)) which was automatically imposed upon the father's appeal from that decision. The trial judge addressed whether it would be in the best interests of the child to grant custody to the father or to the mother in accordance with the factors set out in s. 8(a)(i) of The Children's Law Act. The father's seeming inability to facilitate the child's access to his mother and his sister, especially where access has been ordered by the court, is of considerable concern."
