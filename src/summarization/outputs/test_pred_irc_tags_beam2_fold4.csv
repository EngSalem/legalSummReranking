Judge applied the test that the justice of the peace `must be satisfied on reasonable grounds.' Substantial compliance found and warrant upheld.,"The respondent, a justice of the peace, issued a search warrant to search a dwelling house for weapons allegedly used in an attempted armed robbery. The applicants sought an order quashing the warrant on the grounds that the said search warrant was unlawfully and invalidly issued in excess of the jurisdiction of the Respondent. HELD: The application was dismissed. 1)The respondent acted within her jurisdiction in issuing the search warrant.  2)The information sworn in support of the application failed to disclose the existence of reasonable and probable grounds to believe that the items sought to be seized would be found at the location which was to be the subject of the search.  3)As the respondent acted in her jurisdiction, the application is dismissed."
1990canlii2449.txt,"This was an appeal from a decision dismissing the appellant's application for an order in the nature of certiorari to quash the decision of the Social Assistance Appeal Board for the City of Halifax which affirmed the rejection of the appellant's application for municipal social assistance as an expectant mother. The appellant was a pregnant unmarried 16 year old living with her parents at the time of her application for social assistance. The trial judge concluded that under Municipal Assistance Policy 1.2.5 the applicant was not eligible since she was not a single head of a family maintaining a home for herself and her dependant child. Allowing the appeal, that s. 23(1) of the Social Assistance Act places a mandatory responsibility upon social service committees to provide assistance for all persons in need as defined in s. 19(e) of the Act. Pursuant to this statute, the City of Halifax has approved municipal assistance policies and Policy 1.2.5 relating to an 'Unmarried Mother - Pending Birth' was intended to set out the circumstances under which an unmarried mother was to be eligible. It was not intended that the appellant have to be already maintaining a home for herself and one or more dependant children. In a dissenting opinion, Chipman, J.A. concluded that as the provision with respect to an 'Unmarried Mother - Pending Birth' came under the heading 'Single Head of Family', the provision is merely an extension to include within the definition of a single head of a family an unwed mother whose child is not yet born. The requirement that she be a single head of a family maintaining a home still stands.","An unmarried, pregnant, 16 year old girl applied to the Social Services Department of the City of Halifax for municipal assistance. Her application was refused because she was under 19 years of age and was living with and being supported by her mother and stepfather. Subsequent to the decision of the Board, the appellant gave birth to a child. The municipality provided assistance since the birth of that child. In defining persons in need, the committee must have regard to s. 19(e) of the Act and s. 1(m) and 2(1)(d) of Municipal Services Code. The Board's reason for refusal was that the paragraph having to do with unmarried parents pending birth was not mandatory but rather discretionary. The appellant appealed. Dismissing the appeal, that the trial judge erred in misapprehending the municipal social assistance scheme and M.S.A. Policy 1.2.5."
1991canlii4370.txt,"The defendant lawyer was retained for the purpose of obtaining and disbursing mortgage funds. The plaintiffs, creditors of the defendant's client, sued the defendant for negligent misrepresentation, breach of trust and breach of undertaking. The defendant initially received three irrevocable letters of direction for payment of amounts owing on a construction project. When the project got into financial difficulty the defendant advised his client to seek separate counsel to deal with the creditors - suppliers. At a creditors meeting the defendant advised the creditors' counsel of the initial three letters of direction. The project was considered viable by the creditors and continued, with the defendant obtaining postponements of the three letters of direction. Further creditors' meetings were held, a Creditors' Committee struck, and subsequent letters of direction sent to the defendant by the client and certain creditors. The defendant, in acknowledging a subsequent letter of direction, made no mention of the earlier three letters, nor any explanation of 'all of the proceeds'. One member of the Committee was aware of the initial irrevocable letters of direction. On what was to be the final mortgage draw, the defendant requested and was refused a postponement of the initial three letters. With his client's consent, the defendant disbursed the funds, to pay off the initial three creditors, a mechanics' lien referred in one of the subsequent letters of direction, his legal fees and the balance as per a letter of direction received from two of three members of the Creditors' Committee. Dismissing the action, that (1) there was no negligent misrepresentation as the creditors had continued to advance supplies, not on the basis of the defendant's letter of acknowledgement, but because they considered the project viable. Further, certain other plaintiffs were not aware of the letter, and could not have relied on it. Other plaintiffs did not supply after the letter and therefore did not rely on it. The Court noted that on a balance of probabilities, the defendant's disbursement did not cause the demise of the project. At the time of the disbursement the project was still viable and the plaintiffs made their own decision to cease supplying and to lien the project;  (2) there was no breach of trust as the defendant had no fiduciary duty and had at no time acted for the plaintiffs;  and  (3) there was no breach of undertaking as the undertaking must be considered in all the circumstances, including knowledge of the plaintiffs, the other letters and meetings. The Court concluded that the member of the Creditors' Committee who was aware of the initial irrevocable letters had a duty to advise the other members. The documentation was clear that legal fees would be deducted and the Committee was also aware of the direction to pay the mechanics' lien.","The plaintiff sought to disburse funds from two mortgage brokers to the project in order to avoid possible fluctuation in interest deductions, MacAdam's fees and other encumbrances. The first mortgagee was disbursed in early April of 1987. The second mortgagee, the first one, had become dissatisfied with the handling of the project funds by one of the principals of and was withdrawing its support. The project was financially tight from the very beginning and cash flow was continuously problem. The plaintiff sought postponements of the mortgage advances in order that the funds may be diverted to other creditors. The plaintiffs failed to establish the basis for a claim under breach of trust on this ground. Any claim under this ground was dismissed."
1994canlii5055.txt,FIAT The accused was charged with four counts of defamatory libel. The alleged defamatory words were on a placard he exhibited while picketing in a public place. He was released from custody on his consent to a term that prohibited him from picketing or carrying placards pending his trial. He later applied for a review of the order and sought an amendment permitting him to picket lawfully. HELD: Application dismissed. Amendment refused. If the accused was permitted to picket there was a substantial likelihood that he would commit another offence while on bail pending his trial on the four existing charges. The justice granting the judicial interim release order was therefore correct to impose a complete prohibition on picketing.,FIAT. The accused applied for a review of the terms of his judicial interim release. HELD: The application was denied and the existing order stood.  1)The picketing prohibition term imposed by the justice with the consent of the accused was reasonably-justified as a condition of his release from custody. But for this condition the justice might have ordered that the accused be detained in custody on the ground that there was a substantial likelihood he would commit a criminal offence or aninterference with the administration of justice.  2)The Charter rights were not breached.
1995canlii6138.txt,FIAT The Defendants were consulted by the Plaintiff and her mother 11 years earlier with respect to commencing an action for personal injuries arising out of a motor vehicle accident. The Plaintiff was only 12 at the time. No action was commenced with the result that the original action was now statute-barred. She waited 5 years after she attained the age of majority before taking this action against the Defendants. The Defendants applied to stay the action on the basis that they had never been retained. HELD: Application dismissed. Infants with bona fide causes are privileged suitors. An infant 'should not be visited with the sins of the next friends and litigation guardians who preceded him/her in the same action'.,"FIAT. The applicants had destroyed their files, the death of the plaintiff's mother and the diminution of memories over a period of 11 years. HELD: The application was dismissed and costs were to be paid to the trial judge. 1)The decision did not recognize the contingent element involved in the situation of an infant plaintiff. 2)The plaintiff was not able to explain why she waited for five years after she attained majority before consulting counsel except to say that she did not believe she could do anything as result of the original advice she and her mother received from Judge Lavoie. 3)There was some prejudice to the applicants by virtue of the destruction of their files and the loss of memories."
1996canlii5602.txt,"The respondent pled guilty in provincial court to a charge of break, enter and theft for breaking into his neighbour's house and removing lingerie from a chest of drawers in the master bedroom.. He was sentenced to pay a fine of $2,500 or 50 days in default, plus a victim fine surcharge of $250 and three years probation. The terms of the probation order included a direction that the respondent pay restitution to the victims in the amount of $300, that he not have contact with the victims and that he continue treatment with his psychiatrist. The Crown appealed the sentence, alleging that it inadequately reflected the element of deterrence. Dismissing the appeal, that the trial judge considered the correct principles of sentencing . This was a unique case where it was apparent that the respondent did not commit the offence for the usual reasons and that he required psychiatric treatment.","This was an appeal by the Crown from a sentence imposed by a Provincial Court judge for a break, enter and theft charge to which the respondent pled guilty. The Crown had obtained full-time employment with the Armed Forces for six months. The respondent had, by the time of sentencing, obtained full time employment. He had recently obtained employment. The sentencing judge was obviously persuaded that there was more hope for rehabilitation if he was able to continue the sessions with his psychiatrist and retain the employment opportunity. The trial judge considered the correct principles of sentencing in this unique case."
1996canlii6754.txt,"A radio station reported that a 12 year old girl was dragged and sexually assaulted behind a roller rink or between the rink and a store. The owner of the rink claimed financial compensation for a subsequent decline in his business which he alleged was a direct result of the broadcast. The script and reel had been destroyed and it was impossible to recreate exactly what was aired. HELD: The action was dismissed with costs. 1)Nothing that the defendant published was false, malicious, dishonest, negligent or recklessly published without careful justification, improper motive or excuse. 2)The station followed the CRTC Regulations and was exonerated entirely by its controlling body. The defendant published the news it received from the police, a proven reliable source. 3)Nothing pointed to the defendant as being the cause for the loss of profits by the plaintiff's roller rink operation. The business was on a down side at the time. The assault occurring where it did was not the fault of either party. If it had a bearing on the immediate attendance figure it was minimal and the plaintiff did no promotion whatsoever to increase attendance.",The plaintiff and two juvenile offenders were found to have been sexually assaulted by two juveniles at a roller skating rink. The plaintiff's radio station was the only one in the city that reported the news. The station was fined and the action was dismissed with costs. The court found that the defendant had published the news that it received from the police. The defendant had not interfered with the court's investigation of the sexual assault. It published the information that it had been provided to the police for eight weeks. The Court found that it was always a proven reliable source of information. It was not the defendant's intention to publish the information as it was not reliable.

She sought to introduce fresh evidence bearing upon the circumstances leading up to the divorce. Dismissing the appeal with costs, that even with the new evidence, the appellant still failed to demonstrate an adequate excuse for not responding to the divorce proceeding. There was no evidence that the appellant did not understand her legal entitlement at the time the agreements were signed, or that she did not appreciate that a divorce proceeding had been commenced.","This was an appeal from the granting of, uncontested, divorce and corollary relief judgments. The appellant argued that the underlying separation agreement was unconscionable and unduly harsh. She sought to admit fresh evidence bearing upon the circumstances leading up to the divorce.

1997canlii9636.txt,The applicant sought an order pursuant to s.130 of the Land Titles Act and s.56 of the Enforcement of Maintenance Orders Act for an order relieving the estate from payment of maintenance ordered in 1972. The respondent objected to the application being brought on behalf of the estate as Olson was neither executrix nor a beneficiary under the Will. The Will had not been admitted to probate. The respondent had divorced testator in 1972 and was granted child support of $60 per month and monthly spousal support of $40. The applicant who cohabited with the deceased since 1978 transferred her home to him in 1980 as joint tenants and he transferred his two and one-half quarter sections of farm land to the applicant. The applicant suggested there was an agreement whereby the respondent lived rent free in the matrimonial home in lieu of support. The respondent received welfare to support herself and the children and had had no funds to pursue enforcement of the unpaid support payments. HELD: 1)The style of cause was amended to show Olson as applicant. She was an interested party within the meaning of s.56 of the EMOA and entitled to bring the application on her own behalf. The respondent was not misled and there was no prejudice. 2)The Land Titles Act was of no assistance to the applicant. The application was to be determined upon s.56 of the EMOA and whether it would be grossly unfair and inequitable to refuse the application. 3)The maintenance order constitutes a charge upon the land and the applicant obtained title to the land subject to that charge. There was no evidence presented either of consideration being paid nor of what became of the income generated by the land prior to the deceased's death.  4)A trial of an issue was ordered to determine what if any portion of the arrears should remain a charge upon the lands.

The deceased had been granted a decree of divorce from the deceased. The decree gave her custody of their two children who were then 10 and and child support of $60 per month. The Will was admitted to Probate. The applicant objected to the application being brought on behalf of the estate. She contends the applicant has no standing. HELD: The application was granted. The maintenance order constitutes a charge upon the land and the applicant obtained title to the land subject to that charge.  1)The respondent was nether the executrix named in the Will nor a beneficiary. The will has not been admitted to the Probate Court. 2)The applicant was awarded spousal support of a sum of $40.00.

The trial judge concluded on the evidence that the blood alcohol level at the time of the offence was different from the time of the offence, and found that the Crown could not rely on the presumption of identity. He ruled, however, that they could rely on the presumption of accuracy, and placed an onus on the appellant to raise a reasonable doubt on the whole of the evidence. The appellant appealed. Allowing the appeal and ordering a new trial, that the trial judge committed a fundamental error of law by ruling that when the Crown is forced to rely on the balance of the evidence, the accused must raise a reasonable doubt, a burden that clearly remains on the Crown.","This was an application for leave to appeal from a decision in the Supreme Court of Canada dismissing an appeal from the appellant's conviction under s. 253(b) of the Criminal Code. The Crown adduced breathalyzer readings of 110 and 120 milligrams. The appellant testified that he had consumed five pints of beer during the course of the afternoon, the last shortly before being stopped by the police. In cross-examination the expert was asked to relate the readings shown by the tests to the alcohol consumed by the appellant. He stated that the readings were not consistent with the evidence of consumption given by the accused. The trial judge concluded that the appellant had not raised a reasonable doubt on the whole of the evidence. HELD: The appeal was allowed and a new trial ordered. 1)The appellant's evidentiary burden was not raised. While the trial judge may have been referring to the evidentiary burdens, he went further and stated that he did not raise that reasonable doubt.

HELD: 1)The jury may be advised of the prior accident, its date, that proceedings were commenced in this Court and date of those proceedings and that the accident was ultimately settled and the action discontinued. The terms of the settlement and the sum paid were not to be disclosed. Beyond the issue of privilege which was a complete answer to the request, revisiting that action was a more critical problem. The sum paid to settle the first action was not allocated to any head of damages so those issues would have to be transversed as well. 2)The applicant may introduce his prior medical records with respect to the 1985 accident subject to compliance with the usual rules as to notice and admissibility. 3)The statement of claim in that action could not be entered at this trial as it was not evidence.  At best it was a series of allegations made against the prior defendant. The applicant could examine the respondent as to particulars of her claim in the earlier action and refer to material paragraphs. 4)The applicant was restricted to using the respondent's examination for discovery in the prior action for the purpose of cross-examination.  5)Costs were reserved to the trial judge. 6)The previous judge did not intend to reserve his decision with respect to the hearing of this motion and there was no impediment to the matter being reargued and disposed of.","FIAT. The respondent's prior medical records were examined for discovery in the prior action for the purpose of cross-examination. HELD: The terms of the settlement should not be disclosed nor the sum paid to settle the claim. The release completed by the respondent was part and parcel of that settlement. Beyond the issue of privilege, the more critical problem was the more important problem of revisiting the action. The sum paid in the first action was not allocated to any head of damages so the jury would ultimately be obligated to revisit the whole matter as preliminary to making a decision with respect to the present action."
1998canlii13585.txt,FIAT. Exclusive possesson and ownership of the matrimonial home was granted to the petitioner in May 1998. At the time of the trial they were leading separate lives but under one roof as neither would vacate the home. Given the respondent's age (77) the court did not want to specify a date that he had to move from the home. He had not left the home and the matter was scheduled to be heard June19/98. In the meantime a notice of appeal of the judgment was filed on behalf of the respondent. At issue was the interpretation of ss(1) and (4) of s15 of the Court of Appeal Rules. The respondent's counsel took the position that with the filing of the notice of appeal this court became functus. The petitioner argued the order for exclusive possession is an injunction and therefore is not stayed by the notice of appeal. Alternatively that the giving of directions as contemplated by the judgment itself would not constitute the taking of any 'execution of the judgment' or the taking of any 'further proceedings in the action' and therefore would not contravene Rule 15. HELD: All applications should be made to the Court of Appeal as the matter was now before that court. No case law could be found in support of either party. It was unnecessary to decide the issue as to whether Rule 15 operates to stay an order of exclusive possession.,"FIAT. The court delivered a judgment under which exclusive possession and ownership of the matrimonial home was granted to the petitioner. At trial, both parties were leading separate lives but under one roof as neither of them would vacate the home. The final paragraph of the judgment reads: ""[18] Although this Court has ordered that the petitioner is entitled to exclusive possession of the home, it is expected that counsel will assist the parties in determining a reasonable time period for the petitioner to move from the home."" HELD: The issue resolved around the interpretation of two subclauses (1) and (4) of Rule 15 of the Court of Appeal Rules. Rule 15 operates to stay an order of exclusive possession was raised in Young v. Young, 1986 CanLII 3216 (SK CA), R.F.L. (3d) 314 but not decided."

The applicant required leave under s.7 of the Contributory Negligence Act and Rule 107A(c) of the Rules of Court. HELD: Leave was granted to file a third party notice. 1)The low threshold for the establishment of a prima facie claim was met. 2)The delay would not be inordinate. The plaintiff's claim dated back to 1984. The parties were not ready for trial. No prejudice was established.  3)The third party's liability, if any, will have to be determined on a case by case basis. Each individual action brought by a former student at the residential school is different in nature. 4)The applicant was granted costs of the application against the plaintiff and the First Nation.","The plaintiff alleges that the applicant, the Attorney General of Canada, as the employer of Starr, was responsible for his conduct.

The proposed third party claims it will suffer prejudice if it is joined as a party. There are many claims arising from alleged abuse at the residential school which could result in applications to join it as third party.

2008skpc160.txt,"The accused is charged with aggravated assault. A voir dire was held to determine whether the accused's s. 8, s. 9, s. 10(a) and s. 10(b) Charter rights were breached. HELD: There was no breach of the accused's Charter rights. 1) There is no evidence to establish that the accused did not speak to legal counsel. The agreed statement of facts establishes that the accused asked to speak with Ms. Bohachik, a lawyer with Legal Aid. The police officer put the accused in contact with legal aid duty counsel instead. When the officer told the accused that Ms. Bohachik worked with Legal Aid the accused said 'ok, Legal Aid is fine'. The accused was put in contact with Legal Aid duty counsel. There was no breach of the accused s. 10(b) rights.  2) Applying the common law definition of arrest to the present situation, it is apparent that telling a person that he is no longer under arrest, without releasing him from custody, does not terminate the arrest. It is only by ending the custody of the accused by releasing him that the arrest is ended and the accused is 'un-arrested'. It was agreed that the officer had sufficient grounds to arrest the accused. The arrest being legally made, it follows that the arrest continued until it was legally ended by his release. The arrest continued throughout the search and seizure at the police station. The Court finds that his continued detention after the purported 'un-arrest' constituted a de facto arrest. 3) There is no evidence that the accused misunderstood his actual status or that he was prejudiced by the 'un-arrest'. The accused has not established that he was the subject of 'unreasonable search or seizure' resulting in the violation of his rights under the Charter.","HELD: The voir dire was to hear and determine an application by counsel for the accused for a ruling that the accused's rights under the Charter had been infringed and seeking remedy for that infringement. 1)The Court found that the initial arrest was lawful, was not terminated by the purported 'un-arrest', and continued throughout the search and seizure at the police station. Even if the accused were in error in that finding, his continued detention after the purported un-ar arrest constituted a 'de facto' arrest as described in Latimer. The accused had not established that he was the subject of an unreasonable search or seizure resulting in a violation of his rights under s. 8 of the Charter. The Court held that even though the police had made a conscious decision not to arrest the accused, their treatment of him amounted to 'dejure' arrest and not an arbitrary detention, the accused was not at risk of suffering unnecessary harm."
2011skpc153.txt,The accused was charged with dangerous driving. The evidence established that the accused was observed driving a black Mustang that accelerated quickly from a red light. The police officer observed the vehicle accelerate over a period of two to three blocks and used radar to clock the vehicle's top speed at 140 km/hr. The posted speed limit is 60 km/hr. The intersection was near a church and school yard. There is a bend in the street near where this speeding occurred. HELD: The accused was convicted of dangerous driving. The accused was travelling well over twice the posted speed limit for that portion of roadway. The bend in the road adds to the danger. The accused was driving within the confines of a city and his actions were planned and deliberate. His conduct is a marked departure from the standard expected of a reasonably prudent driver.,"The accused was charged with operating a motor vehicle on a motorway in a manner that was dangerous to the public. The accused was stopped behind the officer at a red light at a busy intersection. Both vehicles were travelling west. The officer locked in what appeared to be the accused's greatest speed, at one hundred and forty kilometres an hour in a sixty kilometre zone. There was one other vehicle left behind when the officer locked the vehicle speed at sixty km/h. HELD: The evidence was straightforward and basically uncontradicted. While the speed was a marked departure from the standard expected for a reasonably prudent driver, the conduct was a'marked departure' from the acceptable standard expected. The mens rea was inferred from the driving conduct. The driver was guilty as charged. The driving was marked a departure from that standard expected of a reasonably- prudent driver. The defendant was guilty of driving dangerously. The court found that the accused voluntarily undertook to drive his vehicle and accelerate to this rate of speed on a stretch of road. While it was a slight departure, in my view such conduct is a'marks departure' of the standard expect for a reasonable prudent driver.' The driving must constitute a marked a marked change from the Standard expected for reasonably prudent drivers. The Court found that Huseini was guilty."

The Union was not joined as a parties by the order of the Supreme Court but was not a party to the proceedings. The Union opposed all of the applications. The union's application to be joined as an amicus curiae or intervener was dismissed for the reasons set forth by Justice Tidman in Adams. HELD: The Union does not have the status to file an appeal unless it is first joined in either of these two capacities as a result of the application presently before the Court. 1) The Union is not joined by a party by the Court as it is not an intervenor by the Rules of Court. 2) The Court is not bound by Rule 5.07(e)(i) nor by Rule 8. The Court has jurisdiction to grant intervener or amicus in civil appeals. 3) The court has jurisdiction under Rule 7 of the Judicature Act to consider applications by persons who are interested in an appeal. 4) There are no reported decisions in this jurisdiction dealing with an application by non-party to be added to a proceeding as defendant, or as a defendant pursuant to Rule 7. It is convenient to deal with these applications by first considering the Union's request to be join as an interlocutor, pursuant to Rules 62.35; secondly, as party to an application pursuant to rule 8.05; and finally as party pursuant to the Rule 62.31. 5) There is no evidence that the Union was directly affected by the provisions of Rule 7 nor that the Court has any jurisdiction to entertain an application for joinder under Rule 5(e). 6) The union was not part of the proceedings in Adams and was not party to any of the proposed applications. 7) The proposed application by the union to be substituted by an amici, or an interveneur, is not supported by the application of the Union. 8) The alternative application that it be joined by an interested person or an interested party should be dismissed as well."

Mabel, mother of the plaintiff and the defendant, set aside $20,000 in a bank account. Prior to her death, Mabel gave written instructions to the defendant to give $5,000 to each granddaughter. The defendant claimed that the money was to be held to pay the estate's expenses and then be divided among Mabel's children. The money was never issued to the granddaughters. The plaintiff claims that the written instructions to the defendant constituted the establishment of a trust and that the defendant is the trustee of the money for the benefit of the granddaughters. HELD: Plaintiff's claim dismissed with costs to the defendant to be taxed at double column 2. An incomplete voluntary transfer will not be construed as a declaration of trust unless it appears that there is an intention to declare a trust, and not merely make a transfer. Mabel's written instructions do not contain any words that could possibly be construed as a declaration of trust. She intended to make monetary gifts. The fact that the defendant did not take the necessary steps to complete the intended gifts during Mabel's lifetime does not result in that intention being converted into a declaration of trust. As to costs, the plaintiff alleged that the defendant committed fraud and this was never withdrawn nor proven. Asserting an unfounded allegation of fraud justifies a special order as to costs.","The plaintiff, as litigation guardian of his four daughters, alleged that the defendant had wrongfully, in breach of a trust, retained the sum of $20,000 to which his daughters were entitled.

The written instructions did not contain any words which could possibly be construed as a 'trust'. The plaintiff became the trustee of the sum for the benefit of the four granddaughters. The plaintiff intended to make monetary gifts to her four grandchildren. The bank account was sold and the balance in the account was divided equally.

The intention of the parties is a prime factor in determining whether something is affixed to and becomes part of the realty. 2)The manner of attaching the lift only to the concrete slab arguably showed an intention that it not be permanent and part of the property.  3)Section 237(2) of the Land Titles Act protects a purchaser of realty against an unregistered interest in that realty. Interest is defined in s.237(1)(a)as any estate or interest in land. It is not intended to protect the purchaser of realty to which something is affixed that is not intended to the knowledge of the purchaser to be part of the realty. The defendants purported to sell that which was not theirs giving a claim for damages. The Provincial Court judge dismissed the claim against the third party, the Jabours, on the facts.","This was an appeal from a Provincial Court decision on a Small Claim. It involved the question of whether something affixed to a realty is fixture that passes with title to the realty. The respondents (third parties at trial) owned title to house property and caused the property to be affixed by use of anchor bolts in concrete slab poured for the purpose of a wheelchair lift loaned to them by the Saskatchewan Abilities Council for their disabled foster child. The Abilities Council wanted the wheelchair lift back but San Diego negotiated a purchase for a total of $2,769.29 for which she got judgment. Although it was not a finding of the trial judge the manner in which it was determined, although it was a finding the trial court judge the intention of the parties was a prime factor in determining whether a substance affixed thereto becomes a part of the property, the intention was not the prime factor. The appeal was dismissed both as it affects the plaintiff and the third party."

Children to remain with the mother until the end of the school year, at which point primary care of the children will be granted to the applicant; child support adjusted accordingly. The mother's decision to move was not in the children's best interests and it was done either to frustrate or with a callous indifference to the children's relationship with their father.","The parties were to share joint custody of the children. The respondent was to have access with the children every Tuesday and Wednesday from after school until the end of the school year.

HELD: The accused is not guilty on all counts.  1) A breath test and demand should be made as soon as the officer forms the requisite grounds for making it. Those grounds did not change between the time the accused refused to provide an ASD sample at 8:17 a.m., when the officer arrested her for impaired driving and 8:40 a.m. when the officer read the accused the breathalyzer demand. There was no reason for the breath demand not being made forthwith. The rights of the accused under s. 8 and s. 9 of the Charter were breached. 2) The officer did not have reasonable and probable grounds for making the breathalyzer demand. The officer testified she gave the ASD demand to find out if the accused had alcohol in her system. When the accused refused, the officer arrested her for impaired driving. The officer was unsure of whether the accused had alcohol in her system when she read the accused the ASD demand and there was no new evidence gathered between 8:17 a.m. and 8:40 a.m. to justify the breath demand. The evidence does not support a subjective honest belief on the part of the officer that the ability of the accused to operate a motor vehicle was impaired by alcohol. As the breath sample evidence was obtained as a consequence of the breach of the s. 8 and s. 9 Charter rights of the accused, it should be excluded from evidence pursuant to s. 24(2).  3) The accused testified that she had been drinking alcohol and was feeling the effects of the alcohol at the time she was operating the vehicle. She said she knew the alcohol would kick in and that she was not really feeling the effects until she arrived at the police station. She offered an explanation for her difficulty in driving testifying that she was tired. The evidence of the officer, which was insufficient to support a belief of impairment as a prerequisite to a breath demand, cannot prove impaired driving. There is insufficient evidence to conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused's ability to drive was impaired by alcohol at the time she was driving.","The accused was charged with impaired driving and driving while her ability to operate a motor vehicle was impaired by alcohol or drug, and failure to comply with conditions.

The appellant argues that without expert evidence called by the Crown to prove it was not possible for the appellant to have swerved in the manner he testified to create the same physical evidence shown in the photographs, the Crown has failed to prove that the appellant drove through the stop sign. In other words, the trial judge could not simply rely on his own experience to find that the appellant could not have been able to manoeuvre the minivan in the way he described. HELD: Because the Crown's evidence was not the only rational conclusion to be drawn by the trier of fact, the Crown has failed to prove the case beyond a reasonable doubt. While no accident reconstructionist was available to check the accident scene after the incident, the Crown could have called an expert to testify whether the defence's theory could hypothetically be rational.

Having regard for the fact that the accused have been in custody for nearly 10 months, the Court gives them two for one credit for time served in remand which is 20 months. The sentence is 2 years to be served in a federal penitentiary. The sentence takes into consideration their lengthy record of offences committed as young offenders, the gravity of the offence, the violence used against the victim, the fact that a high speed chase ensued in the city, and the need to deter not only these accused but other who might consider committing the offence of robbery.","The accuseds were found guilty of robbery with violence and assault with a weapon.

2_2008nssm16.txt,"The claimant purchaser brought an action for breach of contract and negligent misrepresentation, claiming that although the defendant vendors had advised her that there had been some damage to the chimney base in the residence, she had been told that this was a minor problem which was under repair and she had not been properly advised of a history of repeated flooding.  Following the purchase of the property, the claimant had commenced renovations and discovered extensive mould or rot throughout the basement, to such an extent that the entire basement had to be gutted, disinfected and rebuilt. She also claimed that a buried cistern was discovered in the backyard, which had been partly filled with earth but still filled up with rainwater and melted snow, and that the water had nowhere else to go but against the foundation. When the defendants brought a motion for non-suit at the conclusion of her case, the unrepresented claimant expressed surprise and dismay that her case could be dismissed before both sides had testified as she expected her remaining evidence to come out through the defendants' testimony. Motion granted; the claim against the defendants is dismissed; it is the responsibility of the buyer to verify the accuracy of the Property Condition Disclosure Statement (PCDS) and, in this case, the claimant had made no inquiry as to the statements made by the defendants of structural problems or unrepaired damage or leakage in the foundation. The claimant had notification, both in the PCDS and from her home inspector, that there were leakage problems in the basement and the inspection report had advised her of the need to make further enquiries. There was no evidence the latent defects (the cracks in the wall, the mould and the rotten wood) were visible to the defendants when they occupied the home, that there was continual leakage of which the defendants were aware or that the defendants had performed any repairs to the home during their occupancy to cover up the wood rot. Although there was evidence that the defendants were aware of the cistern and had not disclosed this to the claimant, there was no evidence to conclude that the cistern was causing the problem.","The plaintiff claimed $25,000 for damages for a claim for damages that the disclosure statement did not disclose a history of repeated flooding. The claimant alleged there was damage to the chimney base, which was under repair and the heavy rain would cause seepage in the furnace room. HELD: The claim was dismissed. 1)The court found that there was insufficient evidence to establish that the place had flooded in the past. 2)The defendant offered a plethora of defences, including a doctrine of caveat emptor and relying upon the law of agency. 3)The Court found that the plaintiff had proven or provided the court was sufficient evidence to show they had a case which was recognized by the law. 4)The test on a non-suit motion is whether the plaintiff has established a prima facie case, or, as it is sometimes described, whether a jury, properly instructed on the law could, on the facts adduced, find in favour of the plaintiff. The court concluded that this was not the case. 5)It is necessary to allow the parties to present all the facts that can be proven in a court of law. The test is whether a claim is made for damages based on a failure to disclose the facts relevant to a claim. 6)The plaintiff has demonstrated that the respondent did not make out her claim as evidence of the necessary elements to prove the claims are not present. 7)The evidence is not conclusive. 8)The judge must consider the sufficiency of the evidence, not the weight or the believability of evidence."
2_2008skca172.txt,"The appellant was tried by Queen's Bench judge sitting alone and found guilty of operating a motor vehicle while his ability to operate the vehicle was impaired by alcohol, thereby causing death contrary to s. 255(3) of the Criminal Code, and causing bodily harm contrary to s. 255(2) of the Code. He was sentenced to 5 years imprisonment after having been given credit of 1 year for the time served on remand. The appellant appeals both his conviction and sentence. On the conviction appeal the appellant raises a technical ground in relation to the manner in which the appellant was charged as well as issues of the propriety and fairness of the cross-examination of himself by Crown counsel, the admissibility of his criminal record at trial, and the admissibility of opinion evidence proved in the testimony of the Crown's expert witness on accident reconstruction. He also argues that the trial judge failed to find that the fact that the appellant was impaired at the time of the collision was the cause of the collision and that his conclusion was unreasonable and against the weight of the evidence. HELD: Appeal dismissed.  1) The trial judge has a discretion pursuant to R. v. Corbett, [1988] 1 S.C.R. 670, to exclude prejudicial evidence of prior convictions in an appropriate case. This discretion is exercised by the trial judge on the application of an accused at the close of the Crown's case. See R. v. Underwood, [1998] 1 S.C.R. 77. As such an application was not raised in this case, and the questioning about previous convictions by the Crown was not objected to when it occurred, and the issue of the appellant's previous alcohol related offences was raised in the appellant's own examination in chief, this court concludes that there is no basis for this Court to conclude that the cross-examination was inappropriate or that the evidence adduced was inadmissible.  2) It is not proper for Crown counsel to ask an accused on cross-examination to explain the testimony of a Crown witness, and that it is highly unfair and prejudicial to require an accused to agree with a Crown witness or stigmatize that witness as a 'liar'. Crown counsel should not have put these sorts of questions and the trial judge ought not to have permitted them. Defence counsel did not object to them. However, this Court is not satisfied that this error had any effect on the trial and this ground of appeal fails.  3) The Crown elicited opinion evidence from Constable Gibson in the area of accident reconstruction. No evidence was at any time offered as to his expertise to do so, other than his curriculum vitae, which was filed. This witness's evidence as to how the bodies might have moved in the vehicle in the course of the collision and its aftermath, and in particular, his conclusory opinion that Ms. McDermott was the passenger and Mr. Bear the driver, ought not to have been received in the absence of a ruling that he was qualified as an expert in relation to those matters, and that his expertise was necessary in relation to the subject matter of his testimony, and that his opinion was based on facts before the Court. 4) The appellant was charged and convicted with offences pursuant to s. 255(2) and s. 255(3) of the Criminal Code. The appellant argues that conviction requires that the appellant has been charged with an offence pursuant to s. 253(a). There is no merit in this ground of appeal. Impaired driving causing death and bodily harm are routinely charged in this manner. 5) This Court's review of the cross-examination of the appellant supports the trial judge's assessment of it as unbelievable. In light of the trial judge's findings of credibility, and the results of the DNA analysis of the samples taken, the evidence overwhelmingly supports the verdict reached by the trial judge that the appellant was driving. The conclusory opinions expressed by Constable Gibson in relation to the movements of the occupants in the truck, and as to who was driving the vehicle, played no meaningful role in a conclusion that was, compelled by the remaining evidence. Notwithstanding the errors apparent in the receipt of opinion evidence from Constable Gibson, there was no substantial miscarriage of justice. The appeal from conviction is dismissed. 6) The trial judge did not commit any error of principle in coming to the conclusion that an appropriate sentence was 6 years imprisonment. While the sentence is at the high end of the available range, it is not outside the range available in the circumstances of this case.","The appellant was found guilty of operating a motor vehicle while his ability to operate the vehicle was impaired by alcohol, thereby causing the death of Tanya Bergen, contrary to s. 255(3) of the Criminal Code and causing bodily harm to Helen McDermott. He was sentenced to 5 years imprisonment after having been given credit of 1 year for the time served on remand. The appellant appeals both his conviction and sentence imposed. HELD: Appeal dismissed. In all of the circumstances of this case, the appellant was prejudiced by the questions and the trial judge ought not to have permitted them."

Specifically, the section reads: 11.1(2) For the purpose of ensuring the safety of hunters and the public, a searchlight shall not be used for the purposes of hunting wildlife. The case was decided on the basis of credibility. The Court reviewed the requirements for assessing credibility and found it did not believe the accused. The Court stated that, on all the evidence, it was convinced beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused was using a searchlight for the purpose of hunting wildlife. HELD: The accused is guilty as charged.","The defendant was charged under The Wildlife Act Regulations with use of a searchlight when hunting. The section of the Act that prohibits the use of searchlight for the purposes of hunting wildlife was amended in 2007 to include the phrase 'hunting for wildlife' in the meaning of 'wildlife'. The defendant admitted to driving around in the dark, looking for a moose, but admitted to only seeing one moose. He also admitted that he had seen one in the forest earlier that morning, had then gone shopping in Prince Albert with his wife, and had returned to pick up his son and nephew after they had spent the night in a nearby forest. The Crown closed its case and the sole defence witness was the defendant. HELD: 1) Having gone through that analysis and for the reasons that follow, I do not believe the evidence of the defendant and am not left in doubt by it. On all of the evidence, am convinced of his guilt beyond reasonable doubt.  2) Having went through that Analysis, and for reasons that followed, the defendant is not left out by it and I am convinced that he is not in any doubt by the evidence.  3) On all the evidence the defendant was, as he says, looking at wildlife, and he was driving slowly on roads that were in prime hunting area, it is not credible to believe he happened to run into the complainant's wife. It is not reasonable to believe that he said that he was going into the forest to pick his son up, and that this woman would then ask him to look for her husband, who happened to also be in the same forest hunting. 4) The defendant was convicted of possession of a weapon during a search for wildlife. 5) The Court was satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that the evidence was not supported by the Crown's analysis of the facts. The Court held that the defendant's evidence was unreliable and the Court did not believe it."
2_2011nssc290.txt,"Rule 85.04 – Order for confidentiality The parties moved under Rule 59.60 to have the court seal their file after media asked to view it. They didn't ask to exclude the public from the hearing, nor did they seek a publication ban.  , the file will be sealed. While Rule 59.60 doesn't provide guidance on when it would be appropriate to seal a file, Rule 85.04(1) does. The SCC decision of Dagenais (and related cases) applies. A confidentiality order should only be granted when: necessary to prevent a serious risk to an important interest; there are no less intrusive measures available; and the benefits outweigh the costs. Personal embarrassment or damage to a party's reputation isn't enough. Here, the important public interest is the protection of personal identifiers (e.g. SIN's, addresses, bank account numbers and other personal information required on court documents). Having these identifiers accessible to members of the public can result in identity theft, which is a real and serious concern. The court is able to take judicial notice of the fact society values the prevention of identity theft (and that it exists in the first place). There are no less intrusive measures to prevent access to this personal information that aren't cumbersome and costly for the parties and court administration staff. The salutary effects of a sealing order outweigh its deleterious effects, especially since the public will still be permitted to access the court hearing and any decision that is rendered. The open court principle was crafted at a time when the internet wasn't a public source of information and manipulation.","The parties had both requested an order to seal their divorce file. They had done so after receiving a request from the media to examine that file. The media requested that the file be sealed to protect their reputation and to allow the Maintenance Enforcement Program to find a payor of spousal or child support or to issue garnishment against wages or income tax refunds or to suspend driving privileges. Both parties requested access to the court file after delivery of written notice of the request for access. HELD: The court found that the salutary effects of a sealing order do outweigh its deleterious effects. The public interest in an open court is not completely circumscribed by this order. The court has a supervisory and protecting power over its own records. It has a duty to protect the privacy of witnesses or children. It is not the case that the public has an interest in and expects personal identifier information to be protected in order to prevent identity theft. The general public has a right to know what evidence is likely to be called in matrimonial cause, what might be expected by division of property and how that evidence might be put forward. There must be some social value or public interest of superordinate importance in the context of these proceedings. There is a social value to be derived from the public expectation that personal identifiers will be kept private and confidential. The risk of identity theft is real. Should not have to wait until it occurs to recognize that risk. There are circumstances where the court must be open to public scrutiny to prevent serious risk to an important interest. There has to be a general interest in preserving confidential information. The applicant and respondent have both raised one proposition that has decided does not constitute a'social value' or public interests of super-ordinate importance' in this context. It does not require the court to consider the underlying principles set out in Dagenais and Canadian Broadcasting."

In my view, the trial Judge did not directhimself upon the law, the evidence, or the Governing principles. The findings were clearly wrong. The conclusions reached were clearly reasonable. The decision was unreasonable. It is an established law that an appeals court should never interfere with findings of truth by a judge unless they are not adhered to.

HELD: An order for a trial of the issue. 1)The respondent wife was entitled to the petitioner husband's support upon the respondent's obtaining full time employment. 2)The petitioner husband was responsible for child care expenses. 3)The court reviewed the evidence and found that the respondent had made an agreement in 1989 which reduced the maintenance from $1,200 per month to $500 per month, which amount was paid from August 1989 up to 1993. Further agreement was made increasing the monthly maintenance to $554.13 and further increasing the maintenance in January 1994 to $570 for hockey expenses. Any monies payable by the petitioner to the respondent wife on account of child support will be increased on the anniversary date of the order and every year thereafter in accordance with Family Law 5."
3_1997canlii11384.txt,"The Minister of Social Services applied for an order that the Public Trustee be served with notice of a protection hearing and act as litigation guardian for H.B. who was alleged to be of unsound mind. H.B.'s child born in 1995 was apprehended at birth and was currently subject of a child protection hearing. The Minister relied on the Public Trustee Act and, alternatively, on the court's inherent parens patriae jurisdiction.HELD: The Public Trustee was appointed amicus curae to act on behalf of H.B. upon being satisfied she is unable to act for herself. An assessment was ordered pursuant to s32 of the Child and Family Services Act. The order was to issue unless the Public Trustee shows cause as to why it is not the appropriate party within 10 days from the date of this order. 1)While the wording of s32 is ambiguous the Public Trustee was correct that the Act does not authorize it to represent an adult under a mental disability other than where a property interest is involved. Nowhere does the Act authorize the Public Trustee to act as personal guardian of a dependant or mentally incompetent adult. The PT Act does not authorize its appointment as litigation guardian in the matter of child protection proceedings. 2)Pursuant to its parens patriae jurisdiction the Court has a responsibility to protect the interests of H.B. who requires independent representation to ensure her rights are protected. If the court failed to intervene H.B. will be left in limbo, a victim of the system.","The Minister of Social Services applied for an order that the Public Trustee be served with notice of a protection hearing and act as litigation guardian for the mother of a child who was apprehended at birth and is currently the subject of child protection hearing. HELD: 1) The court relied on the Public Act s. 32(1)(d) and s. 43.1 as amended and, alternatively, on the court's inherent parens patriae jurisdiction. 2) The wording of s.32 is somewhat ambiguous. In certain jurisdictions Public Trustees have by statute been given specific authority to act as a litigation guardian on behalf of the child. However that does not fully determine the issue. The Minister contends the court can and should appoint the public trustee as a lawyer for H.B. Nowhere does the Act authorize the public trustee to act in the manner that it should. If the court fails to intervene in this regard, H.'s son will be left in limbo, a victim of the system. 3) The Public Truste Act does not authorize the Public trustee to act on behalf the person alleged to be of unsound mind in the matter of her son. It is intended to protect and administer the property of infants and dependant adults. Now there is a conflict (if such there be) between the Public and Queen's Bench Rules 22 and 46, the Act must prevail."
3_1998canlii1477.txt,"The plaintiff was subcontracted by the City of Dartmouth to build a sports field. The defendant were the project consultants for the City, and were involved throughout the tendering process and construction. Their report indicated a number of significant potential problems. The plaintiff was not made aware of the report when it bid on the project. The plaintiff subsequently became aware of the problems, which made their work more costly. After completing the work, it commenced a claim for the additional work which had to be performed due to the undisclosed site conditions. The defendants were joined by the City as a third party to that action. The plaintiff was successful at trial, but the decision was overturned on appeal. The plaintiff then commenced the present action directly against the defendant, alleging negligent misrepresentation. The defendant applied to strike the action on the basis of res judicata and abuse of process. Granting the application, that the present cause of action is the same one litigated in the first action, simply under a different legal concept. To allow the plaintiff to relitigate the same action on the same factual basis would be an abuse of process.",HELD: The Court granted the application. The Court held that it would not grant the application on the basis of the doctrines of res judicata and abuse of process. It held that the Court had not considered the issue of whether the plaintiff should relitigate the action on the same factual basis on a different legal concept as it considered it did not proceed with. It dismissed the application and dismissed the action. The court found that the application was not by itself a determinative issue.
3_1999canlii12258.txt,An appeal from an order varying a child maintenance order which had been based on a written agreement between the parties entered into a week before the Federal Child Support Guidelines came into effect. The application to vary made about a year later was based mainly on the coming into effect of the guidelines. The decision to not to allow evidence on all issues because of conflicting affidavits gave rise to the first ground of appeal. The appellant also argued that the judge erred in finding that an order to vary would not be inequitable within the meaning of s.17(6.2) by reason of the terms of the written agreement and resulting order which contained special provisions to benefit the children. He also objected to the s.7(1)(f) order for $230 per month for extraordinary extracurricular expenses. HELD: The appeal was dismissed with the exception of the payments under s.7(1)(f) which were set aside. 1)The applicant was not denied the right to lead evidence on any relevant issue. Although the judge made no reversible error the procedure followed was not approved of. The principles stated in Zaba v. Bradley were reaffirmed. 2)No reversible error was found in the finding the appellant did not have custody of or access to the children for enough time to bring him within s.9; that the appellant's income for purposes of the Guidelines should include the bonuses received from his employer; and that he did not have a business based in his home. 3)The judge erred in not addressing the question as to whether the expenses were extraordinary within the meaning of s.7(1)(f). The activities were ordinary given the income of the parents and fell within the table amount fixed under s.3(1)(a).  4)Each party was to bear his/her own costs.,"The appellant appealed an order which varied a child maintenance order. The original order had been based on a written agreement between the parties. The respondent had custody of or access to the children for enough time to bring him within s. 9 of the Guidelines. Absent any evidence to the contrary, it seems to us that the activities were ordinary activities and the expenses were of an ordinary rather than an extraordinary nature, given the income of the children's parents. The judge erred in requiring the appellant to pay a portion of them under s. 7(1)(f) in addition to the table amount fixed under s3(1) as she thought that evidence was required on only three issues. The appellant objected to payment of these amounts only because the respondent never consulted him in respect of incurring the expenses. She then proceeded on the assumption that the appellant objected only because he was denied the right to lead evidence on any relevant issue. HELD: The appeal was set aside. The portion of the judgment relating to payments under s7(1(f) of the guidelines is set aside and the appeal is dismissed. There was no reversible error in the judge's decision, explained in the reasons for judgment, to reject the appellant's arguments respecting that issue. Similarly, we can find no error in either the judge’s decisions supported by written reasons, that (a) the appellant did not have custody or access of the parties for enough amount to bring them within s9 of the guideline; (b) Mr. Elliott did not own a business based in the home; and (c) Mr Elliott did have no business based here."
3_2000canlii19624.txt,"The accused was charged with operating a motor vehicle while impaired contrary to s.255(1) and s.253(a) of the Criminal Code and with having consumed alcohol in such a quantity that his blood alcohol concentration exceeded .08 contrary to s.253(b) and s.255(1). The accused contended his right to be secure against unreasonable search and seizure as guaranteed by s.8 of the Charter and his right not to be arbitrarily detained or imprisoned as guaranteed by s.9 of the Charter were breached. In issue was whether the RCMP officer had the jurisdiction to carry out his duties as a peace officer in the City of Prince Albert; if so, was he acting in the lawful execution of his duties in conducting random stop. HELD: The accused was found guilty of driving with a blood alcohol level greater than .08. A judicial stay was entered in relation to the impaired count on which he would have been found guilty if it were necessary. 1)The language used by Parliament in the Royal Mounted Police Act is clear, broad and unambiguous as it was their obvious intention to create a police force that operates without jurisdictional barriers throughout the entire country of Canada. When there is a limitation on their duties it is clearly stated. The Police Act does not mention any exclusivity between one force and another. Given the ultra vires statute construction doctrine it would not be appropriate for provincial legislation to take away powers given by the Federal legislation. The Police Act must be read in context as providing a manner of funding policing not a manner of taking away jurisdiction granted to RCMP officers. 2)The law is now clear that the police can detain vehicles as long as they do so for the purposes of checking for sobriety, licences, ownership, insurance and other mechanical fitness of motor vehicles. The R. v. Emke decision is outdated. 3)The officer was acting in the lawful execution of his duty. There was no breach of the accused's rights under the Charter.","The accused was charged with two counts of impaired driving. The accused was on duty, in uniform, and driving a marked police vehicle. The officer observed that the vehicle displayed an out of date sticker on it's license plate in violation of S. 27(5) of the Highway Traffic Act. He engaged the police lights, followed the vehicle north on 4th Ave. West, bounced off the curb, then proceeded to stop within 30 feet of the vehicle. When the officer approached the driver, he asked him why he had not stopped. He could not understand the reply. He asked the accused if he wished to call a lawyer. The police officer asked him to return to the police station where he remained for another two minutes. The Crown argued that the language used by the police was clear, broad and unambiguous as it was their obvious intention to create a police force that operates without jurisdictional barriers throughout the entire country. HELD: 1) The Police Act must be read in context as providing a manner of funding policing not a manner to taking away jurisdiction granted to R.C.M.P. officers by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police Act.  2) The police act is to be read as providing for the purposes of policing, not a way of taking away it's jurisdiction. 3) The language used in the police act was clear-cut, broad, unambiguous and in harmony with that intention, object and scheme and with the general body of the law. There is no good public policy reason for the police officer to be excluded from operating in any specific geographic area. It would not make sense for the legislature to limit the opportunity for policing of community by making sure fewer police officers are able to act in any particular setting within the province. 4) In reviewing the scheme and object of The Royal Canadian RCMP Police Force it was clear that section and section of the Act operate to render the Royal Canadians Mounted police officers part of 'police force for Canada' and peace officers 'for every part of Canada' with 'all the powers, authority, protection and privileges that a peace officer has by law.' 5) The Court found that when there is a limitation on their duties it is clearly stated that the officer is acting in the lawful execution of his duty if his stopping of the Abrametz vehicle should be regarded as a 'random stop'. 6) The Crown referred the court to several cases dealing with the jurisdiction involving provincial and municipal jurisdiction as examples of the different issues and problems that arise in the cases of municipal and provincial police forces"
3_2002skqb54.txt,"The wife sought an order for equal distribution of matrimonial property. They married in 1988, each for a second time, and separated in 1997.

The wife argued the agreement was not applicable to the present situation where they have separated and was only in effect during the time of the marriage or upon their deaths. HELD: The wife was entitled to judgment for $54,000. 1)There was no conflict in the evidence as to the verbal agreement made at the time of the marriage nor as to their intention. This is an appropriate situation to apply s.40 of the Family Property Act. The fact they each executed a will to give effect to that intention and the husband paid practically all of the day-to-day expenses led to the conclusion their verbal agreement should be considered binding, notwithstanding their marriage ended by separation rather than death. 2)The condominium purchased by the husband was the 'family home' as provided for in s.2(1)(a). There was no extraordinary circumstance as provided in s.22(1), which would prevent equal division of the value of the family home. The Melville residence owned by the wife at the time of the marriage was exempt in accordance with their agreement.

They each completed new wills shortly after the marriage leaving all of their assets to the petitioner.

The petitioner's investments and assets increased significantly during the time the parties lived together. 6) There is no evidence that the parties' verbal agreement that they would divide their assets was binding. 7) The evidence in writing of their intentions was the respective wills executed shortly after their marriage. There is, however, no conflict in the evidence of the parties as to the verbal agreement they made at the marriage. Although it may be argued that the Melville home was at one time the 'family home' of the Parties, designate the Regina condominium to be the family homestead for most of the years, the parties resided therein for most years.

After the tenant vacated the home, the landlord, pursuant to Residential Tenancies Act s.47, sought $3,746.76 for rent loss, cleaning, damage to the premises and unpaid utilities. The Rentalsman's order required the tenant to pay $2,930.01. The tenant appealed on the grounds the Rentalsman erred in law, as the decision was patently unreasonable as unsupportable by the facts; there was a denial of natural justice and due process because there was insufficient notice of particulars of the cleaning claim to allow the tenant to prepare a full and proper defence. The tenant argued there was a denial of natural justice and the decision should be overturned because he was not aware he could ask for an adjournment to present further evidence. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. The tenant was not denied natural justice or due process. While the description of cleaning did not specifically state the number of hours or hourly rate, it was sufficient to alert the tenant that it was for hours of work as well as for painting. The Rentalsman's decision, made after reviewing pictures, repair bills and the statements of house cleaners, who indicated the hours worked and their hourly rate, was not patently unreasonable as being unsupportable by the evidence.","The tenant appealed the Rentalsman's decision.

3_2003skqb93.txt,"The company applied for an order granting court approval of a proposal made by its creditor pursuant to Part III of the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act. A former 28-year employee objected on the grounds pension plan members should be treated as a different class of creditor rather than under the unsecured creditor classification ascribed to them by the proposal; the indemnification of past directors under the terms of the proposal was inappropriately wide. He submitted the unfunded pension liabilities constitute trust funds pursuant to provincial pension legislation (the Pension Benefits Act s.43(3)) and as such the pension fund claimants are entitled to preferred or secured creditor status. HELD: The Proposal was accepted.  1)Provincially created statutory trusts such as the one created by the Pensions Benefits Act are not recognized in bankruptcy including Proposals submitted under the BIA. The Trustee and the company acted appropriately in identifying the nature and status of the pensioners' claims. Although it might have reflected the status of his claim against the employer outside the BIA, the specific objection did not constitute a valid ground of legal objection to the Proposal. 2)The Proposal met the statutory and judicial criteria for acceptance by the Court. The Court takes into account the interests of the debtor, general body of creditors and the public at large in maintaining the integrity of the bankruptcy legislation. Of the 15 employees in the same position, 12 voted in favour of the proposal, 2 failed to file proofs of their claims; 89 percent of all creditors voted in favour of acceptance.  3)Each party was to assume their own costs of the hearing.","The Trustee for W.R.T. Equipment applied for an order granting court approval of a proposal made by it to its creditor pursuant to Part III of the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act. The Trustee opposed the application on the ground that the terms of the indemnity set out in the Proposal were too widely cast and inappropriate. The applicant Company and Trustee accepted that the indemnification of past directors, officers and directors proposed by the terms was inappropriately wide. The trustee accepted that it was inappropriate for the proposal to have a reasonable possibility of being successfully completed in accordance with its terms. HELD: The proposed amended para. 9.1 of the W. R. T. Proposal was consistent with the provisions of s. 50(13) of the Act and was ordered accordingly. Taking into account all of the interests the Court concluded in the circumstances reviewed and for the reasons outlined in this judgment, that the proposal presented by the Trustee does meet the statutory and judicial criteria for acceptance by the Court. The amendment to para. 8.1 is consistent with ss.50(13). 1) The Court found that taking into account these interests the proposed amended proposal was reasonable and calculated to benefit the general body of creditors.

3_2004skca49.txt,"Fulltext of judgment follows: [1] The appellant wife appeals the decision of the chambers judge varying the amount of child support and reducing the amount of arrears. She contends that the chambers judge erred in varying the order for maintenance and reducing the amount of arrears in the absence of evidence that there was a change in the conditions, means and needs of the respondent or the children as contemplated by s. 17(4) of the Divorce Act.[FOOTNOTE 1][2] The respondent contends that the amount of child support should be reduced by reason of his reduced income caused by his unemployment or reduced employment over the last four years. The appellant argues that the respondent has failed to satisfactorily explain his unemployment. There is evidence that his change in income is due to his own voluntary action and, as a result, he has failed to establish the threshold 'change in circumstances' which could result in a variation of the order.

There is evidence from which this Court can impute income to the respondent in the amount of $27,000, and the child support shall be varied to $510.00 per month as of February 1, 2004 in accordance with the Child Support Guidelines.

3_2004skqb379.txt,"FIAT: The issues to be determined on this application are custody, child support and cancellation of the arrears of child support. HELD: 1) On the issue of custody, the mere passage of time, in this instance 9 years, would constitute a material change in circumstances relevant to custody. The child is now 15 years old. The parties are not candidates for joint custody and shared parenting. The child's view of the dysfunctional relationship between her parents compels this Court to preserve the status quo as being in the child's best interests. The petitioner will continue as the sole custodian.  2) The access was varied in January 2004. Nothing has changed to warrant a variation. 3) There was no evidence to support the respondent's statement that the child is living with him half the time. There was no evidence or explanation as to why he has failed to pay child support, which creates the present arrears. The evidence with respect to the respondent's finances was unsworn and out of date. In oral argument, the respondent asserted that he contributed to his daughter's care and that he is contributing to her education trust fund. If these expenditures were in fact made over and above his own cost of living, the Court would be compelled to accept the fact that he has financial resources available to him other that the $9,940 of social assistance which is disclosed in his tax return and financial statement. 4) The essence of the respondent's application for variation of the child support is based on his claim that his health has precluded him from working. The respondent's doctor was examined and, based on that medical evidence, the Court could not conclude that the respondent's generalized anxiety and depression disorder is beyond his control. The evidence was that the respondent could choose to help himself by eliminating alcohol and marijuana use. The respondent failed to meet the burden of proof by demonstrating that his depression and anxiety disorder was the consequence of factors beyond his control and thus preventing him from working and having an income with which to pay his child support obligations during the period under review. The application for variation of child support and cancellation of child support arrears is dismissed with costs.","FIAT: The respondent applied to vary the custody and access provisions of the May 2, 1995 consent judgment. The respondent argued that the 1995 judgment prescribed that the sole custodian of the child was the sole person who was in the custody of the petitioner. The petitioner had declared that she intended to relocate with the child from Saskatchewan to British Columbia and that she would like to spend more time with the respondent.

The Court drew an adverse inference against the accused by his attempt to induce a potential witness to fabricate an alibi by. The Court was convinced beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused's purpose in writing the letter was not to insure himself against the prospect of wrongful conviction, but to induce perjured evidence for his benefit in order to discredit the identification evidence adduced at the preliminary inquiry.

The underlying action claims damages from the applicant with respect to the construction of a hog barn. The applicant was the general contractor. Each of the respondents issued a comprehensive general liability policy to the applicant. The law is clear that the pleadings determine whether or not the respondents have a duty to defend. If the claim alleges a state of facts, which would fall within the coverage provided by the policy, the obligation of the insurer to defend is triggered. The Court reviewed the claim and concluded that the true nature of the claim was that the applicant failed in its contractual duty to construct and deliver a hog barn suitable for the purposes intended. HELD: The application was dismissed with costs.  1) It is a fundamental principle of insurance law that a comprehensive general liability policy is not intended to be a means for a contractor to cover the expenses to correct its own faulty or defective workmanship. They are not performance bonds. 2) The claims in negligence are inseparable from the claims in contract and do not exist but for the contractual relationship. 3) The insuring agreement provided for the payment of all sums the applicant might become legally obligated to pay as compensatory damages because of property damage caused by an occurrence, which was defined to mean an accident.

The mere fact that the plaintiff subcontracted with the general contractor and it was responsible for the construction of the Tullymet Nucleus Unit does not, for the purpose of this appeal, change the intentional nature of the acts. 4) There is no evidence that Genex is guilty of any crime. The only evidence that the defendants are guilty of a crime is that the defendant sub-contracts with the plaintiff to furnish all material, plans and labour necessary for the proper completion of the entire work. The defendant submits that it is guilty. 5) The defendant is found to have breached the terms of the agreement. The plaintiff is found guilty of breach of the contract. 6) The Defendant is found liable for the costs of the plaintiff's defence. 7) The plaintiff was found to be guilty of negligent misrepresentation. The Defendant was found guilty in all respects of the pleadings. 8) There was no evidence of any errors by the defendant in its preparation of the materials used to prepare the materials for the installation of the scaffolding. 9) The Plaintiff was found not guilty of all charges related to the failure of the roof. 10) The Court found that the Defendant was guilty of negligence and breached its obligations to the plaintiff. It was found liable to pay costs to the defendant."
4_2005nssc253.txt,"The plaintiff in a rear end motor vehicle accident applied for summary judgment and an interim payment. The defendant argued that there was an arguable issue to be tried in that even if one accepted the plaintiff's evidence, there was the issue of contributory negligence to be considered. The defendant also argued that he did not see any brake lights on the plaintiff's vehicle and thus there was an issue as to whether or not they were working. Application for summary judgment granted as to liability with damages to be assessed; application for interim payment dismissed. There was no 'air of reality' to the defence; to strike the plaintiff's vehicle from behind on these facts meant that the defendant was travelling too close or didn't have proper care or control of his vehicle. However, the affidavit evidence showed that there were several other factors affecting the plaintiff's health besides the injuries sustained in the motor vehicle accident; serious issues existed between the parties at to whether or not the plaintiff's injuries sustained in the motor vehicle accident resulted in any ongoing inability to work in any capacity; any amount of assessed damages which might be arrived at would largely depend upon credibility and the medical evidence at trial.","This was an application for summary judgment pursuant to Civil Procedure Rule 13.01 and an interim payment under Rule 31.01. The plaintiff is making a significant claim yet when one listens to defendant's counsel and reads the material attached to the defendant's affidavit, one finds there are significant other factors affecting the health of the plaintiff. Judgment is entered against the respondent as to liability for the accident itself and not causation. If the brake lights did not work then the defendant drove straight into the plaintiff's car. The traffic light turned red. The collision occurred. There was conflict in her evidence about her depression and other problems she was having with her health. In any event, there was no 'air of realty' to the defendants' argument that there had to be."
4_2006nssc88.txt,"The parties were married for thirteen years and had four children, who resided with the mother immediately following the divorce. The father paid one monthly sum ($6,000) comprised of both spousal and child support. Over a ten year period, all of the children had graduated from high school; two of the children had moved in with the father and he provided support directly to the other two children while they continued their education. After the first two children moved out of the mother's home, the parties orally agreed to reduce the child support payments. The parties were unable to negotiate a further reduction in the combined child and spousal support after the third child moved out of the mother's home. Since the parties' separation and divorce, the mother had not seriously pursued any educational retraining or furthered her education in her field of expertise; since the children had become independent, she occupied herself with volunteer work. The father now applied to terminate spousal support. The father shall continue to pay the sum of $3,000 per month as spousal support for one year; for the following year, the support will be reduced to $2,500 per month; in the following year, support shall be reduced to $2,000 per month, after which support will cease completely; the father shall continue his direct support of the children remaining dependant as they complete their current courses. Although the mother's effort in looking after four children and her absence from the workplace during the children's early years were significant factors, she had ignored her responsibility to move towards some sort of self sufficiency; given the number of children, the court extended the formula under the Spousal Support Guidelines beyond the maximum 13 year period; however, the mother must develop a reasonable strategy immediately to ensure that she either begins work in an area with better employment prospects or immediately attends courses to upgrade, refresh or enhance her ability to support herself.","HELD: The application to terminate spousal support was commenced on the 22nd day of September, 2005. The parties were married in November 1980 and began living separate and apart in 1993. They entered into an agreement in February 1996 that the biweekly payments would be reduced to $2,000. There was no financial contribution by the mother to the children in the father's care. The father provided financial support directly to the mother and the combined support increased to $52,000 in July 1996. The mother destroyed any cheques she received from Maintenance Enforcement. The respondent continued to pay full child and spousol support to the respondent, notwithstanding the fact that the children were leaving their mother's care and moving in with their father or being supported by their father. There has been no variation of this order by court order since the Corollary Relief Judgment."
4_2017skqb205.txt,"Civil Procedure – Queen’s Bench Rules, Rule 3-72, Rule 3-84Statutes – Interpretation – Enforcement of Money Judgments Act, Section 5, Section 8 The proposed plaintiff, Alternatifbank (Abank) applied pursuant to Queen’s Bench rules 3-72 and 3-84 to be added as a plaintiff to the action of the plaintiff, Sekerbank, against the defendants and to amend the statement of claim. ABank asserted a debt claim against the defendants. The defendants applied pursuant to s. 8 of The Enforcement of Money Judgments Act (EMJA) to terminate the preservation order, which prohibited any dealings with 850,000 shares, or alternatively they sought an order reducing the number of shares subject to the order and requiring the plaintiff to post $3 million as security pursuant to s. 5(7) of the EMJA and $40,000 security for costs. Regarding ABank’s application, it argued that its claim in debt against the defendant arose out of the same transaction based on the allegation that Arslan transferred the shares to a trust (the other defendant was the trustee) in June 2013, the time at which he stopped paying his debts in full and thus denied it the opportunity to collect its debt. ABank sought the same relief as Sekerbank: judgment against both defendants under The Fraudulent Preferences Act and The Fraudulent Conveyances Act. The defendants argued that the limitation period that applied to ABank’s claim had expired and the application should be denied. Regarding the defendants’ application, they argued that the plaintiff’s strategy in the Saskatchewan action was to await the outcome of the proceedings they had initiated in Turkey against the plaintiff. The Saskatchewan action was independent from the Turkish action, and the plaintiff’s approach was unacceptable in the circumstances of the preservation order made against them in 2014. The plaintiff had not prosecuted its actions against them without delay as required by s. 5(c) of the EMJA. The defendants asserted that the share prices increased since 2014 and were now worth $18 million more than the plaintiff’s claim. If the preservation was not terminated, they requested that the number of shares be reduced to 100,000. HELD: The proposed plaintiff’s application was granted. The defendants’ application to terminate the preservation order or to reduce the number of shares subject to the order was dismissed. The court ordered the plaintiff to post $1 million as security under the EMJA and an additional $40,000 as security for costs. The court found that although the limitation period had expired, it would add ABank as a plaintiff and amend the statement of claim pursuant to s. 20 of The Limitations Act, because to do so would not create a wholly new proceeding and the defendants had not provided evidence that they would suffer prejudice. The preservation order was not terminated after the court reviewed the history of the proceedings in both Saskatchewan and Turkey and found that the plaintiff had not failed to prosecute its action without delay. The court found that there was insufficient evidence to justify the reduction in the number of shares subject to the order.  The information of the value of the security fell short of demonstrating a sufficient change in circumstances, especially in light of the addition of ABank’s claim. The court found that the order should be modified under s. 5(7) of the EMJA to have the plaintiff provide security because there was evidence that the trust may have suffered and could suffer losses in the future as a result of the order. The order for security for costs was justified based on the considerations specified in Queen’s Bench rule 4-24.","The defendants applied to terminate the preservation order pursuant to s. 5 of The Enforcement of Money Judgments Act. In the alternative, they sought an order reducing the number of shares subject to the order and requiring the plaintiff to post $3,081,463.14 as security pursuant to ss. 5(7) of the EMJA and $40,000 security for costs. HELD: The application to add the plaintiff was denied. 1)Absent a final determination on the merits of the plaintiff's claims against the defendant, the plaintiff has failed to prosecute this action without delay. 2)The amendments sought would not create a wholly new proceeding."

The court awarded costs to the plaintiff fixed at the amount involved - the quantum of general damages. The parties were unable to reach an amount of settlement. In this matter, the defendant argued that the costs should be fixed at the amount actually recovered by the plaintiff. Awarding the plaintiff one-third of her taxed costs, that to reduce costs by the percentage of fault of the plaintiff and to reduce the amount involved would be a double reduction.","The plaintiff was found two-thirds and one-third responsible for the injuries suffered in an automobile accident. The defendant was found one-half responsible. The plaintiff was awarded $50,000 plus interest and costs plus a pre judgment interest rate of 3.5%. Counsel advised that they had been unable to agree on outstanding issues. The court reviewed the history of apportionment of costs in motor vehicle negligent cases and concluded that the practice was followed in this court, at least, where the findings of fault relate to the happening of the event causing the accident rather than to any aggravation of the injuries or failure to mitigate their effect. The Court concluded that inflation was built into the award and that a rate such as the discount rate of 2.5% per annum would not be appropriate."
5_2000skqb565.txt,"FIAT. The accused applied for an order pursuant to s.581(1) of the Criminal Code quashing count 1 on the grounds it offended the 'single transaction rule'; an order pursuant to ss.7 and 24(1) of the Charter and the common law doctrine of abuse of process that portions of the indictment as amended be quashed or stayed on the basis of the judgment in the trial of the former co-accused, Reginald Schafer; alternatively, an order staying the proceedings on the grounds of unreasonable delay in bringing the accused to trial. He argued the Crown would be in breach of an agreement in which he waived delay to proceed on the charges on which inconsistent findings could be made and would constitute bad faith. HELD: 1)The application to quash count 1 on the basis it charges more than one transaction was dismissed. The count particularizes in the alternative various ways in which the accused is alleged to have defrauded the investors of ICC by using funds of ICC to advance his or Schafer's interests. The case law cited by both parties clearly establishes that the word 'transaction' as used in s.581(1) is to be interpreted broadly and flexibly, and that a single transaction may, in this sense, include a number of acts or incidents occurring over a period of time. 2)Count 1 of the indictment was to be amended. The application to stay proceedings on the basis of findings made in the Schafer trial was allowed in relation to the particular charge in subpara.(b) of count 1 regarding use of ICC funds in the amount of $513,000 for Trirak along with subpara.(j) regarding alleged representations to ICC's investors that 30% of their investment would be invested in GICs. To allow the Crown to pursue these allegations would be an abuse of process. The Crown had indicated it would not proceed with subparagraphs (c) or (d). 2)There had not been unreasonable delay in light of the complexity of the charges, reasons for the delay, and the agreement by the applicant not to object to certain portions of delay. There was ongoing disclosure and there were various court appearances following the laying of charges.","FIAT: An application for an order pursuant to s. 581(1) of the Criminal Code quashing Count #1 of the indictment on the ground that it applies to more than one single transaction. The Crown alleges that Richard Leibel, who was originally charged jointly with Reginald Schafer and was convicted of defrauding the plaintiff corporation of money in excess of $1,000, contrary to ss. 380(1)(a) and (j)of the Code. Leibel alleges that he was the sole director and shareholder and president of ICC whereas the Crown alleges he was working 'behind the scenes'. HELD: The application to quash counts #1 and #2 is dismissed. The Court will consider an application to order the indictment separated by s.590 if the accused could show that it would be prejudicial to put the complex indictment to a jury. 1) The Court is not bound by the conclusions of Klebuc J. in the Schafer case. 2) It is important for the Court to examine the extent to which the conclusions in the indictment can be said to provide support for the argument, for, if on proper reading, the findings of the trial judge in Schafer do not exonerate the accused, (in the sense that the Crown was no longer alleging that the applicant together with his co-accused had charged unauthorized management fees), then the Court has power to order a single count be divided where it is satisfied that the ends of justice require it. 3) The applicant's application to have the indictment quashed or stayed on the basis of the judgment in the trial of the former coaccused is dismissed with costs."
5_2001canlii345.txt,"The accused was charged with operating an overweight vehicle on a weight restricted road contrary to s.38(1)(b) of the Highways and Transportation Act. No permit had been issued for the tractor trailer. The defence argued the document entitled 'order for road restriction on provincial highway #332 pursuant to s.35 of the Highway Traffic Act' was not proof of the Minister's order according to law; even if the document is proof, the order is a 'regulation' under the Interpretation Act and so the provisions of the Regulations Act applies; since those requirements have not been met, the Crown has not established an order had been made for the purposes of this case. HELD: It was not proven beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused violated s.38(1)(b). It was not established that the order was published for the purpose of this prosecution nor that the document filed in court is proof of the order itself.  1)It is well known that in a criminal case a provision that enables the Crown to expeditiously prove certain elements of an offence must be strictly satisfied. Since a violation of the HTA is prosecuted under s.4 of the Summary Offences Procedure Act, which in turn adopts the Criminal Code summary conviction procedure, the Crown must strictly comply with the provisions respecting proof.  2)It is mandatory for the Minister to give notice of the order and there was no evidence he exercised his discretion by determining the most advisable manner in which notice was to be given. The Minister failed to take appropriate steps to cause notice of the order to be given. The Department of Highways placed road signs warning and advising of weight restrictions on the highway and along grid roads accessing #332, but no notice was given to the general public. Notifying persons who reside or do business in the immediate area of the road is not sufficient to satisfy the requirement to publish. 3)Even if it could be said sufficient notice was given, it could not be concluded that the endorsement upon the order that the order 'conforms to the original' meets the statutory requirement that the copy must be a certified copy 'under the hand of an officer or person in whose custody the...public document is placed' (s.12 SEA) since it was not known if she had custody of the document or under the hand of any of the persons set out in s.7(c) of the SEA since her official capacity is not described. The order was not published in the Saskatchewan Gazette and so a copy of the order so published could not be produced (s.7(a) SEA). It was not proven that the copy of the order had been printed by the Queen's Printer (s.7(b) SEA).","The accused was charged with operating a motor vehicle that violated the Minister's weight order contrary to s38(1)(b) of the Highways and Transportation Act. The accused was stopped by a police officer on patrol in the northwesterly direction and he was about to turn left when he noticed a tractor trailer travelling in an easterly direction approaching the junction of highways #32 and 332. The officer stopped the vehicle and the accused was arrested. HELD: The Crown had not established that the accused had violated the provisions of the HTA. 1)Even if the document was proof of the order, the order was a regulation under the provisions under the Highway Traffic Act and so the Crown could not establish that an order had been made for the purpose of this case. 2)The Minister failed to take appropriate steps to cause notice of the Order to be given. Even if it could be said that the steps taken by the municipality were sufficient to satisfy the statutory requirement, the Minister could not be found to have set out the statutory requirements for the issuing of a notice. The Minister could only advise the Minister that she failed to do so. The municipality appears to have taken it upon itself to advise persons in the municipal division affected by the weight restriction and to advise other persons in that area that were in the business of hauling. Traffic signs were in place prior to the last one going up on February 23. There was no publication in any local newspaper or provincial daily. No notice was given to any other media."

The Society had indicated to the appellant that she was willing to be considered as a placement for the child if the plan to return the child to her mother did not progress as anticipated. In the end, the Court placed the child in the permanent care and custody of the Children’s Aid Society of Halifax. She found out about the order after the fact. She sued the Society, claiming that the Society had shut her out of the process and that the judge in the family division erred in not considering family placement with her before making the permanent custody order. HELD: The application was dismissed. The Court of Appeals Chambers judge has the authority to make the order sought. Even if he had jurisdiction to do so, the order would be an order as, in my opinion, an application to the Family division for leave to terminate the permanent Care order appears likely to be a more appropriate initial way for R.B. to proceed.

5_2006skca7.txt,"This is an appeal brought by the R.M. from a judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench determining that a mortgage held by the R.M. was subordinate to a mortgage held by the respondent Farm Credit Canada (FCC), even though the R.M. mortgage was registered before the mortgage of FCC. The R.M. had agreed with the mortgagor that its mortgage would be subordinate to that of FCC. The appeal raises the application of the priority provisions of The Land Titles Act, 2000 and in particular the application of s. 54 of the Act. HELD: The mortgage of the respondent has priority over the mortgage of the appellant. The appeal is dismissed with costs.  1) It is not necessary in this case to consider whether the priority provisions of the Land Titles Act are overridden by commercial postponement agreements in mortgages, or whether reliance by the competing security holder is necessary in order to displace the doctrine of privity of contract in relation to a covenant to postpone, for the court consider the matter to be governed by a consideration of the nature of the interest created by the R.M. mortgage in light of s. 54(3) of the Act. 2) Registration does not and cannot alter the nature of the legal interest granted by the instrument registered. In the present case the mortgage instrument states that it is pursuant to the prior Grant Agreement executed by the parties. This agreement, in turn, clearly provides that any security granted by Mainline to the R.M. is subject to the prior security interest of the respondent to the extent of $3,125,000. In effect, Mainline granted to the R.M. a mortgage of a limited interest, being Mainline's equity of redemption after any mortgage held by the respondent, to the extent of $3,125,000. The appellant admits that it was never intended, as between itself and Mainline, that it would obtain a security interest in priority to that of the respondent. Mainline granted a mortgage to the appellant subject to the prior interests, as defined, of the respondent and of CIBC. The appellant is therefore, seeking to increase the interest actually accorded to it by the debtor by relying on its prior registration and the priority provision of the Act.","This was an appeal from a judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench determining that a mortgage held by the R.M. was subordinate to that of the respondent, even though the mortgage was registered before the mortgage of FCC.

M. appealed the respondent's application for grant aid in the amount of $150,000.  2) The appellant admits that it was never intended, as between itself and Mainline, that it would obtain a security interest in priority to the contrary. It admits that the mortgage created in favour of Mainline was never conceived, as the title on which the interest was based was a mortgage of only limited interest.

5_2007skpc74.txt,"Decision, following a voir dire, on the admissibility of statements made by the accused to a police officer, beginning with: 'Excuse me, I was in a roll-over accident and I am intoxicated.' The officer, who observed symptoms of impairment, asked the accused how much he had had to drink and was told he had consumed about 15 beers. The officer placed the accused under arrest for impaired operation of a motor vehicle, and read him his Charter rights, the Police Warning and a Demand for Blood Sample. The officer then detained the accused by remaining with him while awaiting the Blood Kit to arrive and for a blood technician to take the blood. During this time, the officer interrogated the accused about the accident and the accused provided additional information. The Crown contended that if he was given the police warning then it would be clear to the accused that he did not have to continue to answer questions the officer's questions. The Defence argued that since the arrest and the blood demand were based upon self-incriminating evidence obtained by breach of the accused's s. 7 rights, the arrest was illegal and all evidence obtained thereafter should be excluded; or, at least, that the information obtained was illegally obtained and the police could not rely on that information to make the demand. The accused testified that he talked to the police officer only because he believed he had a legal obligation to do so, based on advice he had received from others that there was a legal obligation to report the accident promptly to the police. The Crown conceded that the accused did have a legal obligation to report the accident promptly, and that if the accused believed he was reporting the accident when he gave self-incriminating statements to the police officer as a result of that belief, those statements must be excluded according to law. HELD: All of the statements of the accused, including those made after the arrest, are excluded and will not form part of the Crown's case. The evidence obtained, and the statements, in particular, were self-incriminating and conscriptive. The officer was acting in good faith, not with serious intentional disregard of the accused's rights. He was not taking a statement under the Traffic Safety Act. He did not know that the accused was only saying things because he believed he had to under compulsion of statute. Even though the investigator did nothing that violated the accused's rights, they were nevertheless violated. Because the violation resulted in the making of statements that amounted to self-incriminating evidence, following the logic of the case law, it is necessary to exclude those statements. The accused did approach the police officer with the intention of reporting the accident as is required by the Traffic Safety Act. As such, and as the Crown correctly concedes, his initial statement, anything said by the accused while providing his personal information and the answer to any question while registering at the hospital are excluded from this trial. As the self-incriminating statements made under compulsion of statute have been excluded, it follows that any evidence that came about as a result of the officer following up on those excluded statements are also in breach of the accused's s. 7 rights.","The accused was charged with impaired operation and driving under the influence. The Crown appealed the voir dire decision following which it held that the accused was in a roll-over accident and that he was intoxicated. The defence argued that if the accused believed he was reporting the accident when he gave self-incriminating statements to the police officer as a result of this belief, then the law requires me to exclude those statements. HELD: The accused was acquitted. 1) The Crown conceded that the officer gave the accused a warning and that it would be clear to the accused that he did not have to continue to answer questions of the officer. 2) It is useful to divide the series of statements that were made into groups. Those before the arrest and those given after. The evidence received, the statements in particular were self- incriminating and conscriptive. If the Crown determined that the Crown had given the accused warning, it would make clear to him that he had not had to continue answering questions. 3) The defence contended that if he was given the police warning, then it would not be clear that he didn't have a reasonable expectation that he would continue to make the demand. 4) The accused testified that he understood his rights, his warning and his demand for blood. 5) The police were instructed to concentrate on the fact that he could recall his rights. 6) The evidence obtained was self-initiative and self-recriminating. The accused did not recall his right to make a demand. The arrest was illegal and the information obtained was illegally obtained. The police could not rely on that information to make that demand. 7) The officer abandoned his previous investigation. He accompanied the accused to the triage nurse and stayed with him while the accused checked in. During this process the officer observed symptoms of impairment and asked the accused how much he had to drink and was told he had consumed about 15 beer. The officer concluded that the evidence received was as the result of a breach of his section rights and that the statements were self incriminating. 8) The court concluded that there was nothing remotely analogous to what the accused had said to the officer following up on those excluded statements. 9) It was not necessary to consider the seriousness of the violation or the repute of the administration of justice. 10) The only conclusion that could be drawn from the evidence was that the arrest was a serious, intentional disregard of the accused's rights nor was he taking statement under the Traffic Safety Act.

The adjudicator also found that the defendant had not attorned to the jurisdiction of the Alberta court. The claimant appealed. Appeal dismissed; although the adjudicator's interpretation of sec. 15 of the Act and his finding that the defendant had not attorned to the jurisdiction of the Alberta court when there was no evidence before him on that issue constituted errors in law, the present claim was beyond the scope of the Small Claims Court Act, given that the adjudicator would first be called upon to settle a dispute regarding the original court's jurisdiction, the locus of the original contract and a factual dispute concerning attornment.","This is an appeal from the Small Claims Court's decision wherein he determined that he lacked jurisdiction to hear the action filed by the Claimants.

5_2016skqb384.txt,"Criminal Law – Motor Vehicle Offences – Driving with Blood Alcohol Exceeding .08 – Conviction – AppealConstitutional Law – Charter of Rights, Section 10(b) – Appeal The accused appealed her conviction under s. 253(1)(b) of the Criminal Code of driving with a blood alcohol content over .08 on the grounds that the trial judge erred in law finding that there was no breach of her s. 8 Charter rights or of a breach of her s. 10(b) Charter rights. The first ground pertained to the defence’s contention that the officer who stopped the accused and made the breath demand did not have sufficient evidence of impaired driving. The officer testified that he was patrolling for impaired drivers on the night in question and observed the accused make a very tight right-hand turn, entering the untraveled portion of the road where the snow was soft. He noticed that her eyes were glassy and she was slurring her speech. She had just lit a cigarette, which suspects often do to mask the smell of alcohol. When she did put the cigarette out, he smelled alcohol on her breath. He asked her to step out of the vehicle and noticed that she swayed while standing still. She walked with a wide stance to the police cruiser and had to lean against it to maintain her balance. When he first asked the appellant if she had had anything to drink, she said that she’d had three but later said that she’d had five. He arrested her and made the breath demand. The defence argued that the trial judge erred in failing to consider other evidence that other vehicles had made similar turns and that the appellant did not require any assistance in leaving her vehicle and walking to the police cruiser, among other things. With respect to the second ground, the appellant advised the officer that she wanted to speak to a specific lawyer after being arrested. At the detachment, the appellant located the lawyer’s number and the officer dialed it. A voice message was left on the lawyer’s telephone but no return call was received. The officer advised the appellant she could call another lawyer, and initially she responded that she did not want to but wished to provide a breath sample. The officer was about to read her a waiver of her right when the appellant indicated that she wanted to call another lawyer. The officer called the number but received an after-hours message. He asked the appellant if she wanted to try another lawyer and she declined, stating that she was satisfied with leaving a message. She then provided her first breath sample. The defence argued at trial that the officer failed to advise the appellant of the availability of Legal Aid and failed to provide the Prosper warning, thereby breaching s. 10(b) of the Charter.  HELD: The appeal was dismissed. The court found that the trial judge had not erred: 1) by finding there was no s. 8 breach. The judge had not made any findings of fact that were not supported by the evidence nor did he fail to consider relevant evidence when he found that the officer had sufficient evidence that objectively supported his belief that the appellant’s ability to drive was impaired; and 2) by finding that there had been no breach of s. 10(b). The appellant had failed to act diligently in pursuing her right to speak with a lawyer and provided a clear and unequivocal indication that she had abandoned her right to counsel when she said she was happy leaving a message.","The appellant appeals her conviction under s. 253(1)(b) of the Criminal Code for driving with a blood alcohol content over.08. The trial judge erred in law in finding there was no breach of s. 10(b) Charter rights. The appellant contends the failure of the officer to provide the appellant with a Prosper warning resulted in a breach of her s.10(b). HELD: The appeal is dismissed. 1)The trial judge did not make any findings of fact that were unsupported by the evidence nor did he fail to consider relevant evidence when he held that the officer had sufficient evidence that objectively supported the officer's belief that the appellant's ability to operate a motor vehicle was impaired. The evidence provided by the officer was sufficient to establish that there was a material error in the trial judge's assessment of credibility. 2)The appellant contends that the failure by the appellant to provide her with the Prosper warning in light of the fact that other cars had previously made a tight turn as evidenced by other tire tracks in the soft snow did not establish a violation of her right to counsel. 3)On the factual and legal grounds, the standard of review is correct. The appeal court must assess the reasonableness of the decision and must not substitute its own view of the evidence for that of the trial Judge. The standard of reviewing is correctness. 4)The appeal court erred by failing to consider the factors articulated by the police officer as forming the factual basis for making the breath demand were reliable and capable of supporting the officer’s belief that she could walk and enter police vehicle without assistance. 5)The evidence was found to support the appellant’ s.8 Charter rights and the trial court erased the evidence. The officer was not trained in the use of profanity in his field notes. 6)The respondent was not the only person who had reasonable and probable grounds to make a demand for a breath sample. The respondent was the only one who was given the opportunity to make the call. 7)The officer was only required to advise the detainee of his right to be given a reasonable opportunity to contact legal counsel and the police have an obligation to refrain from eliciting any incriminating evidence until the detainee has been given an opportunity to consult with legal counsel. 8) The respondent had four and half years’ experience at the time of the incident. 9) The appellant was not a party to the offence. 10)The court dismissed the appeal."
5_2017skqb167.txt,"Family Law – Custody and Access – VariationFamily Law – Custody and Access – Voices of the Children Report In 2012, after a trial, it was determined that the child should be parented on a shared basis with a one-week rotation between parents. An order was never issued and therefore, no judgment was taken out. The applicant now applied to have a formal judgment issued, and to vary the decision in favour of her having primary residence. Alternatively, she sought a Voices of the Child report. The applicant indicated that the child expressed a desire to live with her full-time. The parties’ affidavits conflicted as to their behaviour. The applicant indicated that the child told her he was required to continue skiing with the respondent even though he was having a seizure. She also indicated that the child told her that the respondent told his roommate he was going to stab the applicant and he called her crazy. HELD: The court found it appropriate to order a Voices of the Child report. It was determined that the variation application decision was dependent on the report. There were more issues at play than a bald statement by the applicant that the child requested to live with her full-time. The child was an appropriate age for the report, being over 12 years old. He was able to communicate effectively and the report would be meaningful to the court. The order was to be paid for through resources provided to the program. The parties were prohibited from discussing the report process with the child and they were ordered not to influence, coach, sway, or prompt the child towards particular views or statements for the purposes of the report. The application was adjourned sine die returnable not sooner than 14 days after the report was received by all parties. The judgment was directed to be issued.","The applicant sought a Voices of the Children report in order to ascertain the respondent's wishes and thereby gain clarity on his best interests. HELD: The application was to have a formal judgment issued and to vary the decision in favour of her having primary residence. In the absence of an order varying the shared parenting order, the applicant seeks a Voice of the Child report be prepared. The conflicting affidavit evidence makes it clear that Julie's views are not being reliably communicated to the court. An independent assessment of her wishes with respect to her mother's proposed move back to Assiniboia and there resumption of shared parenting arrangement will assist the court in determining a custody and access plan that is in the best interests of the respondent."
5_2018skqb209.txt,"Contract Law – Sale of Land – FormationReal Property – Sale of Land – Oral Contract The plaintiff brought an action against the defendant for specific performance and damages. The plaintiff claimed that the defendant agreed to sell him three quarters of land. The defendant’s position was that there was no agreement and if there was, it was not in writing as required by The Statute of Frauds. The plaintiff made this application for a resolution of the initial question of liability as to whether an agreement was created and if it was, then proof of damages would follow. The plaintiff argued that a contract was created and that it complied with the statute because he made his offer in writing, via an internet-based land auction program, and the acceptance was orally communicated by a telephone conversation. Therefore, all the requisite elements of a valid land sale were present. The defendant had used a website to list 17 quarters of land for sale, including six quarters of relevance to the action. The website was intended to connect sellers of farmland with interested buyers in a type of “non-binding auction” to permit sellers to gauge interest in their land, find the best possible price and avoid realtor’s commissions if a sale were completed. The listing showed three groups of the farmland for sale, described as 1) three adjoining quarters (the subject quarters); 2) two quarters (the adjacent quarters) and 3) one quarter (unsold quarter). In his online comments to the defendant during the auction, the plaintiff said that he wanted all five quarters (the subject and adjacent quarters). The plaintiff bid on each of the above parcels and had the highest bid on the subject quarters, but that in itself did not guarantee the purchase under the terms of the online auction program. He stopped bidding on the adjacent quarters because he thought they were becoming overpriced. After the auction, the plaintiff consulted with family members regarding whether to pursue negotiations with any of the bidders. They discussed the problems that would occur if the subject quarters were separated from the adjacent quarters because the two blocks were owned by different individuals. The defendant then telephoned the plaintiff and gave him two package options for the sale, both of which resolved the identified problem by including the purchase of the adjacent quarters. The package options were to purchase the subject and the adjacent quarters for $1,050,000 (which was 5 percent more than the $625,000 the plaintiff offered for the subject quarters and his last bid of $375,000 on the adjacent quarters) or the subject quarters and one of the adjacent quarters for $840,000. At the end of the conversation, the plaintiff testified that he wanted to be sure that regardless of his response to the package option offers, he would be able to buy the subject quarters for $625,000. The plaintiff did not have concerns about the purchase because he said that the defendant told him that “we had them”. He believed that this indicated the defendant’s willingness to accept his bid on the subject quarters and that if he accepted either of the two options, then either of the newly accepted offers would replace the agreement respecting the subject quarters. The defendant’s interpretation of the conversation was that he declined to accept the offer on the subject quarters until he heard back from the plaintiff respecting the package options and then he would decide whether or not he would sell the subject quarters. He either misheard or misunderstood the plaintiff’s question about the subject quarters and denied that he gave any assurance that he would sell them to him regardless of his response to the package offers. The plaintiff called the defendant shortly after the first conversation and advised that he would not accept either of the package option offers but would immediately bring the deposit for the purchase of the subject quarters. The defendant told him to “hold off”. The plaintiff interpreted that to mean that there was no urgency regarding the deposit rather than that no agreement existed respecting the subject quarters. The defendant testified that he said he was not prepared to accept the deposit at this time, which meant that he was not prepared to accept the plaintiff’s bid on the subject quarters. Three days later, the defendant emailed the plaintiff and said that he would not be accepting the bid. The issues were: 1) whether a contract was formed; 2) if so, did the Statute of Frauds apply.  HELD: The plaintiff’s action was dismissed. He had not established on a balance of probabilities that he and the defendant were parties to a valid and enforceable agreement of sale regarding the subject quarters. The court found with respect to each issue that: 1) there was no contract. In interpreting the words of the first telephone conversation and the context of the bidding process, using the standard of the reasonable bystander, there was no consensus ad idem between the parties. The second telephone conversation had done nothing to alter that finding. Both the plaintiff and the defendant reasonably believed different things; and 2) the Statute did not apply as there was no contract.",HELD: The Court held that it could not determine whether a contract was created between the respondent and the respondent respecting the sale of three quarters of land in Hazel Dell. The Court found that the respondent was the only person who could reasonably reasonably reasonably conclude that the offer was made in writing. The court also held that there was no evidence of a breach of the contract.

He refused, and after completing the trial, awarded custody to the natural mother and her common-law companion. The decision was appealed.

Her appeal was allowed in part, the court holding the judge erred in ruling inadmissible certain evidence about the value of scallop licences. The matter was remitted to Supreme Court for determination on evidence to be adduced by the parties of the value of the respondent's fishing operation. In preparation, the appellant applied to the Supreme Court for an order to inspect the respondent's bank records pursuant to s. 21(1) of the Evidence Act. The respondent argued he had limited involvement in the enterprise being discovered. The judge granted the order with limitations: the examination was to be limited to income received by the respondent and covering the period from the trial date forward. The appellant appealed, arguing the limitations disallowed full disclosure. In the interim, the respondent went into bankruptcy and argued the examination would be fully conducted by the trustee. Allowing the appeal, that a possible duplication was no reason to limit full disclosure.","This was an appeal from a Chambers decision granting an application under s.21(4) of the Nova Scotia Evidence Act ordering inspection of banking records to the appellant but imposing two limitations. The appellant contended that the examination ordered by the Chambers judge was nothing but a duplication of the detailed and searching examinations that will be made of his assets by the trustee in the bankruptcy proceedings. That may or may not be the case but for the purposes of securing full disclosure in this proceeding which is the one with which we are concerned, it is insufficient reason to limit full disclosure.

The fire alarm system was not functioning and, despite being aware of previous problems with the 25-year-old system, the defendant had never maintained or inspected it; the self-closing hallway fire doors were continually in an open position; the battery-operated fire alarm in the plaintiffs' apartment was not functioning; and the plaintiffs were unaware of whether their smoke detector was wired into the building or was their responsibility. The male plaintiff suffered serious fractures to both ankles and a fractured fibula. He underwent four surgeries, was non-weight bearing for three months and was unable to run or engage in various sports. Although he had returned to work as a production worker, his condition would continue to deteriorate due to post-traumatic arthritis, most likely resulting in a future ankle fusion. The female plaintiff suffered a pelvic ring injury with bilateral pelvic and sacral fractures, a fractured elbow and a broken rib. She underwent surgery on her pelvis, was unable to look after her own hygiene for five months and developed bursitis in the hip. She continued to experience pain in the tailbone with extensive sitting and in the elbow with extension of the arm, had a permanent loss of elbow extension and walked with a limp. The worsening of her pre-existing anxiety and depression led to the diagnosis of post-traumatic stress disorder.

When the plaintiffs first awoke, the fire had already worked its way up through the attic hatch to the roof, where the flames in the eaves were visible to the plaintiffs. Smoke and fire were able to flow freely through the adjacent stairwell as a result of the fire door being left open, and the failure of the smoke detectors and fire alarms allowed the smoke and fire to progress before being detected by the plaintiffs.

Unless the property qualifies as 'collateral' a person cannot possess it as a 'debtor' within the meaning of the priority section. 3)The case law in Saskatchewan has interpreted 'possession' to constitute more than mere physical possession. Sections 22 and 34(2) of the new Act are essentially unchanged except for the addition of the constructive possession. S.22(2) restricts the scope of constructive possession somewhat but it applies only to s.22 not to s.34. 4)A person is not in constructive possession of collateral within s.34(2)(a) unless that person is a 'debtor' as defined, unless the collateral is 'collateral' as defined and unless another person 'obtained physical possession of the colateral at the request of that debtor'. 5)The first term of each lease agreement contained an acknowledgement by Lake Air that the trailer was delivered by Associates at the date and location set out in the lease. Such a clause is inconsistent with Lake Air having actual or constructive possession at an earlier date. Lake Air did not have constructive possession prior to December 1997 through either Bell or Mid-Canada. Neither was in possession of the trailers at the request of Lake Air.  6)The protection the Act gives to purchase-money security holders should be interpreted broadly. To deny Associates priority over Humboldt would provide Humboldt with an unmerited windfall at the sole expense of Associates who gave full value for the purchase-money security interest it obtained from Lake Air.","Humboldt applied for an order declaring the priority of competing security interests held by Associates and Humboldts in two reefer trailers. The respondent argued that the security interests were acquired pursuant to its leases of the trailers to Lake Air in May 1996 on present and after acquired property as amended in January 1998 to specifically include the trailers. Associates denied that it had actual or constructive possession of the trailer and asserted that Lake Air had 'constructive possession' of them at an earlier date. HELD: The application was allowed and the respondent was ordered that its purchase-money security interests in the two trailers had priority to the respondent's security interests. The issue to be determined was what is meant by the term 'possession' in the act and when, in the circumstances of this case, Lake Air obtained possession orconstructive control of these trailers within the meaning of s. 34(2)(a). The respondent did not have constructive possession prior to December 22, 1997, through either GJ Bell or Mid-Canada.  1)The respondent was granted a security interest by Lake Air pursuant to a security agreement granted to it in May 1997. 2)It is obvious that the trailers were not in the physical possession of Lake Air until it agreed, on November 2, 1989, to accept the debt. The first term of each lease agreement contained an acknowledgement by the respondent that the respective trailers were delivered to it by Associates at the location and on the date set out in the lease. Such a clause was inconsistent with the submission that Lake had actual possession at an early date.  3)The application of Associates was allowed. It is ordered that the parties had prior verbal agreement."

He was seeking damages against the federal government for alleged abuses suffered while attending an Indian Residential School. The mother sought to attach the possible damage award for child support. HELD: The first $50,000 of any settlement proceeds, after payment of reasonable solicitor fees and disbursements, shall be paid into Court by his counsel. The Court agreed with the conclusion in Anderson that an order can be made with respect to damage awards even though, at the moment of the order, there is only a cause of action in existence and no precise amount of damages are known. There was no question that a cause of action or chose in action is property and thus the subject of an order under the Family Maintenance Act s.8. It is of no consequence that the order may be in another form such as money. To adopt any different analysis would be to unnecessarily limit the remedial application of s.8. Given the overarching purpose to ensure property is not wasted, thus impairing or defeating a claim under the FMA, it was logical orders can be made by the Court that are ancillary or a natural incident of the primary order preserving the property. The mother was awarded costs of the application set at $350.","The parties have three children aged four to eight years. Since the issuance of the order, the respondent has been unemployed by reason of health problems and arrears of child support are constantly accruing. HELD: 1)The respondent is restrained from disposing of any money that he has received or may receive in relation to the lawsuit without further order of the Court. The Court concluded in Anderson that it was not necessary to find predilection or intention on the part of the respondent to waste assets in order to issue an order under s. 8. The threshold to be met in such an application was simply that the disposition or wasting of the asset would impair or defeat claim under the Act. 2)In the event the respondent receives damages from the Government based on his claim of abuse suffered at the Indian Residential School, the first $50,000.00, after payment of reasonable solicitor fees and disbursements, shall be paid into Court so that the parties might speak to the distribution of same. 3)In Anderson, the Court concluded s.7 of the Family Maintenance Act only authorizes restraining orders against those against whom a claim may be made and therefore made no order vis-a-vis the respondent's counsel. It is not offensive to direct that the respondent’s counsel, at the time of such settlement, if there is a settlement, pay monies into Court. Such an order does not impact the rights of the petitioner but merely imposes a clerical task which is natural incident to the preservation of the property in debate. 4)The Court ordered that in the event of a settlement in his law suit against the Government, the petitioner shall have her costs of this application set at $350."

The requested relief cannot be granted unless the court has authority to order that a subdivision of land be effected outside the requirements of The Planning and Development Act. HELD: 1) Even if this was a proper case for the making of a vesting order, there is a further difficulty presented by the fact that the applicant school division is asking the court to order that a subdivision be effected, as a pre-condition to the vesting order. Whether under the former legislation or the present, the court is not free to subvert the statutory requirements in the exercise of its authority to make vesting orders. The court reviewed the relevant caselaw. 2) While the court is precluded from directing the Registrar to effect a subdivision that is prohibited by the legislation, a resolution of the matter could be achieved if, for example, after adjudicating on all the rights and obligations at issue, the Court was prepared to direct that the pre-conditions to subdivision approval be met by a party to the proceedings. Once the proposed subdivision meets the required standards and is approved, then a vesting order can be made in the appropriate circumstances under the provisions of s. 6.5 of The Land Titles Conversion Facilitation Regulations, or under The Improvements Under Mistake of Title Act.

The requested relief cannot be provided unless the Court has authority to order a subdivision of land outside the requirements of the Planning and Development Act, 1983. HELD: The appeal was allowed. 1) The respondent is a bona fide purchaser without notice of the Flads' interest and relying on the indefeasibility of his title. 2) When the error first came to light in 1995, the applicant, the School Division, was asking the Court to lapse the caveat. The application in question was tantamount to a judicially ordered partition of land to avoid the effect of legislation.

7_2005skqb372.txt,"The applicant is a doctor enrolled in the orthopaedic surgery residency training program at the University of Saskatchewan (University). He was suspended from the program since approximately March 2000. There have been a number of legal proceedings between the applicant and the University since then. An appeal committee of the University held that the applicant be allowed to resume his residency training on probationary terms. This decision has not been implemented. At issue is a College of Medicine policy governing students who are funded by third party organizations or governments. The applicant is such a student. His third party funding was depleted during the time he was suspended. The College of Medicine insists he must find a third party sponsor prior to being allowed to resume his program. The Lieutenant Governor requested that a judge of the Court of Queen's Bench perform her role as visitor in this matter. HELD: 1) The court found the College of Medicine has not been objectively reasonable in the exercise of its discretion to insist that the appeal committee decision will not be implemented until such time as the applicant obtains third party funding. The court found it did not properly or fairly apply the third party funding policy on the facts. 2) The applicant is entitled to relief. The appeal committee decision will be implemented by the College of Medicine if the following conditions are met. The applicant must enter into a written agreement with the College of Medicine whereby he agrees that the money he was paid while on suspension is prepayment for all of the services he will perform for the College of Medicine in the remainder of his residency, that he will not claim any salary or monetary benefits available to other medical residents pursuant to the PAIRS agreement, and he will indemnify the College of Medicine if it is required to make payments to him pursuant to the PAIRS agreement during the remainder of his residency program. Further, PAIRS will enter into an agreement with the College of Medicine waiving the financial terms of the PAIRS agreement with respect to the applicant for the duration of his residency. 3) The applicant will be responsible for paying tuition fees, administration fees, insurance fees and any other college fees payable by other medical residents but he will be granted a credit for the fees deducted by the College of Medicine during the time he was suspended.","At issue in this matter is a College of Medicine policy governing students who are funded by third party organizations or governments. Dr. Pearlman was a student at the time he was suspended from the program. For reasons which will be outlined hereafter, his third party funding was depleted during the period of his suspension. The College insisted he must find a third party sponsor prior to being allowed to resume his program. HELD: The matter was referred to the Court of Queen’s Bench for review. The court was to perform its role as visitor in the matter. 1) The College of Physicians has a policy regarding supernumerary residents. It is not possible for the College to insist on the applicant obtaining new third party financing before he will be permitted to resume the residency program. 2) It is difficult to accept the College of Medical's concern that creating an exception in this case would somehow affect the integrity of the policy. The fact that the applicant had not yet exhausted his appeals within the internal laws of the University, and specifically to the Council of Student Appeals and Academic Matters, suggests that the jurisdiction is more original than traditional supervisory or appellate jurisdiction. 3) The applicant was a resident funded by the College. His third party sponsorship was depleted. The college insisted he was the only student who had been allowed to continue training without a salary during the time that he had been suspended. 4) It was not clear whether the College had any say in the decision to place the applicant on probation. 5) The evidence of the appeal committee did not show that the College was in any way influenced by the appellant’ s views on the subject matter. It was clear that systemic forces were at work beyond the control of the appellant. The appellant was such a student that for reasons which were outlined hereafter the College would have funded his education through to its conclusion. It would be difficult for the Court to decide whether the appellant should be allowed to return to the program on a probationary basis. The Court of Appeal was to exercise its jurisdiction and powers of the Court. 6) The Court was to determine the extent to which the appellant could exercise his jurisdiction."
7_2006nspc61.txt,"A young person who suffered from considerable mental health issues and was in the permanent care of the Minister of Community Services applied to have the court exclude the public and the media from her court convened pre- sentencing conference. The purpose of the conference was to assemble various professionals from diverse fields to discuss the complex issues surrounding the young person and to provide recommendations to the court as to an appropriate sentence. Various of the professionals had expressed their concern as to their ability to participate in the conference if the media was present. Application for access by the media denied; order granted excluding the public and the media from the pre-sentencing conference; the benefits of an exclusion order outweigh the deleterious effect of restricting the public's right to freedom of expression and the freedom of the press. Although the court convened hearing is a public proceeding to which, prima facie, the open court principle applies, the attendance, cooperation and participation of the invitees to the conference (all professionals who were bound by laws, policies and agreements of confidentiality) was strictly voluntary and many, if not all, would be unable and unwilling to participate in a conference that was open to the public and the media. The administration of justice was furthered by the court obtaining the best possible information from those identified as best able to provide it so that recommendations flowing from the conference would lead to the best sentence for the youth. There were no alternative measures which would prevent or reduce the risk of non-participation by the professionals.","Counsel for the media, the Crown and the legal parent of the young person sought a ruling from the Court as to whether the public, including the public and media, will be permitted to attend a pre-sentencing conference scheduled to take place on December 11, 2006. The Crown, the youth person and the parent argue that the conference should not be open to the public. Counsel for the Chronicle Herald and the Daily News take the position that this is a public proceeding to which they should have access. HELD: The court found that the court had the discretion to exclude members of the public from the conference. The court also found that it had the discretionary power under s. 41 of the Youth Criminal Justice Act to convene a conference under the 'open court principle' to consider recommendations on an appropriate youth sentence. The Court found that this was a matter of public interest and great care must be exercised in deciding whether to use this discretion."

7_2007skqb28.txt,"The respondent was charged with impaired driving contrary to s. 253(a) of the Criminal Code and driving while over .08, contrary to s. 253(b) of the Code. The Crown appeals the acquittal on the charge under s. 253(b) of the Code. At trial the Crown argued that, prior to searching the vehicle and having close contact with the accused in the police car, the RCMP officer did not have a reasonable suspicion that he had alcohol in his body and therefore did not make a screening device demand immediately. On appeal the Crown submits that the trial judge accepted this and therefore there was no unlawful detention and the lapse of 17 minutes from the time he was placed in the back of the police vehicle until a demand was made. The Crown submits that the trial judge was in error in concluding that the 17 minute delay was not warranted or necessary and that there was no breach of the accused's right to be free of arbitrary detention within the meaning of s. 9 of the Charter. HELD: The appeal is dismissed. It appears that the officer may have been anxious to search the vehicle in anticipation that more than just a charge of impaired driving could be supported. Had he proceeded with a quick search of the vehicle and then proceeded with the demand in a short time period that may have been a reasonable violation of the accused's Charter rights. It is obvious from the evidence that in the course of searching the vehicle, the police officer returned to the police vehicle where the accused was detained and he had a further conversation with him, following which he returned to continue his search of the vehicle. In the circumstances, the delay of 17 minutes from when the police officer should have made the demand but did not and detained the accused in the locked police vehicle while he conducted a search of the accused's vehicle without arresting him, advising him of his rights and conducting a search of his vehicle is a violation of potentially three separate Charter rights. The evidence of the subsequent breathalyzer and certificate of analysis is conscriptive evidence obtained following the breach of the accused's Charter rights and the trial judge properly ruled that pursuant to s. 24(2) of the Charter the evidence should be excluded and the charge dismissed.","The accused was charged with impaired driving contrary to s. 253(a) and driving while over.08 contrary to S. 253. The Crown appealed the acquittal on the charge under s.253(b) of the Criminal Code. HELD: The Court held that the delay between the time the respondent was stopped and when the roadside screening demand was made took the demand outside of the 'forthwith' requirement of s. 254(2). The Court also held that because the accused was locked in the police vehicle and there was no undue delay, the delay of 17 minutes from when the police officer should have made the demand but did not and detained Shire in the locked police vehicle without arresting him, advising him of his rights and conducting a search of his vehicle is a violation of potentially three separate Charter rights. The Court found that because this was not a random vehicle stop, the accused's right to retain and instruct counsel was not infringed."
7_2015skqb216.txt,"Civil Procedure – ContemptCivil Procedure – Queen’s Bench Rule 11-16Municipal Law – Zoning Bylaw – Enforcement The applicant rural municipality was granted an order in May 2014 by a Queen’s Bench judge that directed the respondent to comply within 60 days with an order of the applicant’s development officer. That order had been made pursuant to s. 242 of The Planning and Development Act and required the respondent to comply with the zoning bylaw by desisting from operating an equipment storage yard on a parcel of land owned by him and to restore it to the condition it was in prior to his use of it. The respondent had purchased the land in 2009 and immediately began storing equipment and leaving junk cars and other materials on it. The applicant had tried to encourage the respondent’s voluntary cooperation with the bylaw but eventually issued the order. After the court granted the order, the respondent took no steps to comply with it and in August 2014, the applicant applied for an order declaring the respondent to be in contempt of court. The application was heard in September at which time the respondent submitted by affidavit that he had removed the old cars but believed that he was allowed to keep his equipment. He requested that he receive additional time. The respondent was given until December 2014 to comply with the order. At the hearing he deposed that he had spent a significant amount of time and money removing materials from the land and that he had found out from his counsel that his belief regarding the permitted use of the land was incorrect. Based on the appearance of the site, the applicant was not satisfied but agreed to adjourn the matter until May 2015 as nothing could be done during the winter. When the matter was reviewed in May, the respondent had removed more equipment but said that he was not able to move it all as he had no place to put the rest of it. The applicant requested that the court find the respondent in contempt and to impose appropriate penalties, authorize it to remove any remaining machinery and to add the costs of this removal and disposal to the taxes on the land and to make an order for solicitor-client costs in its favour. HELD: The respondent was found to be in contempt of court pursuant to Queen’s Bench rule 11-16(3) for his failure, without reasonable excuse, to comply with the terms of the May 2014 court order. The court authorized the applicant to remove and dispose of the equipment if the respondent had not done so within 30 days of the order issued. The court awarded solicitor-client costs to the applicant in the amount of $15,000 because of the respondent’s continued and unjustified failure to comply with the zoning bylaw. As the applicant might incur additional costs to remove the equipment, those costs would be added to the tax rolls of the property and become payable by the respondent if he had not purged his contempt within the allotted time.","HELD: The contempt application was granted. The court ordered the respondent to comply with the court order. The respondent took no significant steps to comply. The Court ordered that the respondent's equipment be removed from his property and that he should immediately dispose of it. The order was made pursuant to s. 242 of The Planning and Development Act, 2007, SS 2007, P-13.2 [Act]. The respondent was personally present at the commencement of the proceedings and took no substantial steps to ensure compliance. The evidence showed that the appellant had made considerable progress in removing the offending equipment and that his efforts to comply were only limited to rare and exceptional circumstances. The Chambers judge erred in limiting solicitor-client costs to circumstances where there was both scandalous, outrageous or reprehensible conduct."
7_2018skca42.txt,"Criminal Law – Murder – Second Degree Murder – Conviction – AppealEvidence – Unsavoury Witnesses – Vetrovec Warning – Charge to Jury The appellant had been found guilty of second degree murder following a trial before a judge and jury. He appealed on the ground that the trial judge had failed to give the jury a Vetrovec warning regarding the testimony of his former common law spouse (S.S.) and a witness who had been his friend (W.D.) who was the source of the gun used in the shooting of the victim. The appellant’s trial counsel had initially identified the need for the judge to issue the warning because W.D. had an interest in the outcome because there were outstanding charges against him and because there was the potential that S.S.would be charged too, she would also have an interest in the case as well. During the pre-charge conference with defence counsel and the Crown, the trial judge noted that in giving the warning to the jury he would also have to convey a summary of the Crown’s confirmatory evidence. The defence counsel then withdrew his application. The victim had been a friend of the appellant. According to S.S.’s testimony, the appellant and the victim had pre-arranged a meeting in an abandoned farmyard. The victim worked as an automated teller machine (ATM) technician and as part of his job, he travelled between ATMs carrying cash. S.S. did not see what happened between the two men but heard two gunshots and then saw the appellant and the victim point guns at each other. She saw the victim on his knees pleading with the appellant and offering money in exchange for his life. The appellant instructed her to collect the money and the victim’s cellphone and place them in his truck and while she was doing so, she heard another gunshot and saw the victim lying face down and the appellant standing over him holding a gun. As she and the appellant left the scene, the appellant gave her the victim’s gun. The appellant hid the other guns and the money at another farm site and then dumped the victim’s cellphone and ammunition in a farm field. Apart from the handguns, none of the other items were ever recovered. The witness remained in a relationship with the appellant for another four years following the crime until November 2013. She was contacted by the police in February 2013 and denied any knowledge of the incident. At trial, S.S. testified that she was afraid of the appellant and he had warned her that as an accomplice, she was as involved as he was. When the RCMP contacted her again in May 2014, she again denied any knowledge but then told the officer what she knew because she felt safer and would receive protection from the appellant. S.S. did not have a criminal record, nor was she charged with any offence arising from this incident. The appellant testified that during the meeting in the farmyard, the victim produced two handguns and they began to test fire the weapons. The victim suggested that they stage a fake robbery. The appellant would rough up his friend and then take the cash from his truck. The victim became quite aggressive after the appellant hit him too hard and began chasing him with one of his guns. S.S. then took one of the guns and shot the victim three times. She took $23,000 in cash from his truck because she had financial problems. The testimony of W.D. was that the appellant had acquired two handguns, a Glock and a .22 calibre handgun, from him, ostensibly on behalf of another friend. Several days later, the appellant returned both handguns and reported that after his friend began to shoot at him with the .22 calibre, he had returned fired and shot him three times. On the appellant’s insistence, the witness changed the barrel of the Glock handgun several months later. The police arrested W.D. and charged him with unspecified offences arising from the incident. In the appellant’s version, he testified that the victim brought the guns to the meeting and assumed that he acquired them from W.D. He therefore returned them to W.D. after the incident and requested that he change the barrel on the Glock to protect W.D. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. The court found that the trial judge had not erred by not giving the Vetrovec warning. It was not mandatory for him to do so regardless of the position of the defence counsel. The judge was aware of the need for such a warning in the circumstances and after consulting with the Crown and the defence, he exercised his discretion to decide that he would not instruct the jury. The judge was aware that the defence counsel withdrew his application as a tactical decision to avoid having the judge repeat the Crown’s confirmatory evidence to the jury. The judge’s exercise of his discretion was entitled to deference.","The defendant was found guilty of the second degree murder of his common law spouse and friend. The trial judge sought input from counsel as to whether Vetrovec warning should be given in relation to either witness. The Crown's expert testified that, even though the barrel on the Glock handgun was not the original factory barrel, other indicia from that gun enabled him to conclude that approximately $23,000 was missing and unaccounted for. The defendant appealed. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. 1)The trial judge did not give a warning in the circumstances requiring one to be given. The evidence was not conclusive. The court found that the trial judge had erred in law in failing to give a verbal warning to the complainant. 2)The evidence in this case was not corroborated by the evidence at the scene. The Court found that there was no evidence that the complainant had changed her mind about the possibility of a fatal bullet being fired from the handgun. 3)The Court found the trial court did not have jurisdiction to interfere with the appeal."
8_1990canlii2359.txt,"The appellant appealed his conviction for assaulting a police officer engaged in the execution of his duty. The police officer had responded to a call in connection with a disturbance during which the appellant assaulted a third person. Upon arriving at the scene the officer recognised the appellant as someone wanted by the police. The officer told the appellant that he was under arrest because of two outstanding warrants. The appellant assaulted the officer. The officer did not give evidence as to the grounds for his belief that the warrants met the s. 495(1)(c) Criminal Code requirement, i.e., that they were in a format set out in Part XXVIII and in force within the jurisdiction. In his charge to the jury the trial judge indicated that the arrest was for the assault against the third party and did not direct the jury to consider if the officer had reasonable grounds for believing that there were warrants outstanding. Allowing the appeal and ordering a new trial, that the evidence did not support the conclusion that the officer arrested the appellant for the assault on the third party and it was not made clear to the jury that they must make an essential determination if the officer had reasonable grounds as required in s. 495 of the Code, such that he was acting in the execution of his duty.","The appellant appealed his conviction following a trial in the Supreme Court before a jury on a charge that he did assault a Peace Officer engaged in the execution of his duties contrary to s. 270(2)(a) of the Criminal Code. HELD: Appeal allowed, conviction set aside and a new trial ordered. 1)There was a misdirection by the trial judge.  2)The appellant had raised a number of grounds, only one of which need to be dealt with. In the second place, it was not made clear to the jury that they must make the essential determination whether Constable MacKay had, in making the arrest, the reasonable grounds referred to in s. 495 of the Code. 3)The trial judge failed to establish that the officer was engaged in his duty at the time of the assault and that under the law he was authorized to make the arrest."
8_1997canlii9861.txt,"This was an appeal from a Supreme Court decision dismissing certiorari applications to quash three orders of the Labour Relations Board ordering the appellant to reinstate the respondents and pay them compensation for dismissing them due to their support of a union. The appellant alleged that the Board's order should be quashed because it failed to give reasons for its decision. Allowing the appeal and remitting the matter for rehearing, that there is an implied duty on a tribunal to provide written reasons whenever substantial issues are involved and the reasons for the tribunal's decision are not obvious from a review of the issues and the record. In this case, the order of the Board imposed significant financial liability on the appellant, and the issues were complex and the concerns of the parties were substantial. As a result, the Board acted in a patently unreasonable manner in giving its decision without providing reasons.","This was an appeal from a judgment in the Supreme Court dismissing certiorari applications to quash three orders of the Labour Relations Board (Nova Scotia) ordering Future Inns to reinstate the individual respondents, to pay them compensation, and refusing to reconsider the first two orders. Other respondents were Hotel Employees Restaurant Employees Union, Local 662, Hotel Employee Union, Trade Union and the Attorney General of Nova Scotia. The Union had been organizing employees of the respondent in connection with an application for certification pursuant to the Trade Union Act. The respondent was refusing to employ the complainants because they are members of trade union and have participated in the activities of the trade union. HELD: The appeal was allowed with costs; the order of the Chambers judge was set aside and the matter was remitted to the Board for a rehearing as per reasons for the reasons stated in the passage from deSmith. The court found that the Board is not bound by legislation to provide reasons for its decision and that in the absence of such a requirement reasons are not generally mandated. The privative clause in the Act precluded the court from weighing the evidence and coming to its own conclusion on this issue. As there was evidence upon which the Board could find that the respondent committed an unfair labour practice, the decision of the Board was not patently unreasonable."
8_1999canlii3182.txt,"This was an appeal to determine whether a Provincial Court judge is obliged to advise an accused of his right to a trial in either or both of the official languages of Canada, pursuant to s. 530 of the Code. Allowing the appeal and ordering a new trial, that s. 530(3) of the Code is mandatory.",The sole issue in this appeal is whether a Provincial Court Judge is obligated to advise an unrepresented accused of his right to trial in either of the official languages of Canada pursuant to s. 530(1) of the Criminal Code. The sole ground of appeal relates to the failure of the Provincial Court judge to advise the appellant of his rights to trial by French or English pursuant to Section 530(3). The appellant's mother tongue is French and the fact that the trial judge did not advise him of the right to be tried in his own language is not procedural error. The appellant has the ability to express himself in English. This ability is irrelevant because the choice of language is a fundamental right to support the legal right to fair trial but to assist the accused in gaining equal access to public service that is responsive to his linguistic and cultural identity. The trial judge had no discretion and was obligated to put the appellant to the unrepresented Appellant the right.

The mother was mentally competent and able to manage her own affairs at all times prior to her death; the Power of Attorney was granted solely for the mother's convenience as she was physically infirm. The daughter could only be called upon to account for her use of the Power of Attorney if it was used when the mother was incapacitated.","The Plaintiffs sought an accounting of their sister's dealings with their mother's financial affairs pursuant to a Power of Attorney. The Court found that the petitioner was mentally competent and completely able to manage her own financial affairs from 1992 until her death in 1999. The only evidence that suggested she was not mentally competent was that of the Plaintiff's mother, Brenda Anne Doherty. The Plaintiff was physically infirmed and unable to easily get back and forth to a bank. The petitioner would cash cheques for her mother or make cash withdrawals at her request and bring the money to her. The court found that approximately $50,000 was missing. The Plaintiffs were jointly and severely liable for payment of these costs which may be deducted from their respective entitlements in the estate."
8_2007skqb419.txt,"In January 1992, the parties agreed the petitioner would pay child support of $300 per month and that it would be without tax ramifications to either party. As of September 2007, the petitioner has arrears of about $2,900. He now applies to set his child support obligation and deal with the arrears. The petitioner claims he has been paying too much in child support under the Guidelines. HELD: 1) In terms of ongoing support, it is appropriate to determine the petitioner's income on the basis of the three year average of his employment income being $21,834 and add to that the $5,100 in rental income for a total of $26,934. The petitioner is actively engaged in farming. He pursues reasonable off farm income. In the absence of something further, the Court was not prepared to impute income. He shall pay child support of $221 per month.  2) In terms of the payor's ability to pay at the time the arrears accrued, the petitioner says he was paying in excess of his legal obligation. It is true that if one looked to his employment income the table amount would be approximately half of the $300 per month non-taxable that the petitioner agreed to pay back in 1992. However, one cannot ignore the fact that he agreed to pay it. He did nothing to seek to change this obligation in all of the intervening years. The petitioner's farming operation affords the petitioner an opportunity to manage his financial affairs. By reporting a farm loss each year, the petitioner in fact pays less tax on his employment income than he would otherwise pay. In the circumstances the Court was not prepared to rescind any of the arrears.","FIAT: The petitioner seeks an interim order setting his ongoing child support obligation as well as addressing the arrears. Arrears have accumulated and he seeks to expunge them. The petitioner supplements his farm income with working for part of the season at a local sporting store. He has a room mate to share expenses. The respondent notes that when the petitioner recently sought financing for a half ton truck he indicated his income was $5,100 per month. Counsel noted that through use of the optional inventory adjustment the petitioner is able to average out his farming income. HELD: The child support order of December 11, 1991 was registered in this Court January 27, 1992 pursuant to s. of The Reciprocal Enforcement of Maintenance Orders Act, 1983, S.S. 1983. Under that order the petitioner was to pay ongoing support of $300 per month to the respondent. The parties subsequently entered into an agreement of January 30, 1992 whereby the parties agreed the $300.00 per month would be without tax ramifications to either party. The court was cognizant of the fact that the petitioner's farming operation affords the petitioner an opportunity to manage his financial affairs. By reporting a farm loss each year the petitioner in fact pays less tax on his employment income than he would otherwise pay.

8_2008skqb481.txt,"FIAT: The applicant seeks an order setting aside a wage assessment certificate issued by the Director of the Labour Standards Branch (the Director) and filed with this Court. The applicant disputes liability for the amount set out in the wage assessment and claim that he inadvertently and innocently missed the time within which to file an appeal. The issues are whether this Court has jurisdiction to set aside the Director's certificate filed with the Court of Queen's Bench, if so what criteria ought to be applied in determining whether the Court should exercise its discretion and whether the applicant has satisfied the criteria. HELD: 1) Even though an appeal from a wage assessment to the appeals board and an appeal from an adjudicator to the Court of Queen's Bench both require 'appeals' within '21 days', an appeal to the Court of Queen's Bench is a true appeal while an 'appeal' to the appeals board is essentially a request for a de novo hearing. Consequently, this Court concludes that the consequences of missing the time limitation are not necessarily the same. 2) This Court does have jurisdiction to deal with an applicant's request, on a director appeal, because it is not a 'true appeal' that questions a decision made by an independent adjudicator after a hearing. Accordingly, the reasoning of this Court in Farmers of North America Inc. v. Langridge, 2004 SKQB 375, is not applicable. A finding that this Court is without jurisdiction to set aside a judgment, obtained without any independent adjudicative process, regardless of the basis upon which that judgment was obtained, is inequitable and at odds with existing practices and procedures. Section 62.4(4) of The Labour Standards Act states that a certificate filed pursuant to s. 62.4(3) has the same force and effect as if it were a judgment obtained in the Court of Queen's Bench for the recovery of a debt. This Court certainly would have jurisdiction to determine whether or not the applicant's application to open up a noting for default should be granted pursuant to Rule 114(3), Rule 271 and Rule 346. It follows that this Court is able to look behind the filing and examine the circumstances under which that judgment was entered. The Court of Queen's Bench is a superior Court charged with the administration of justice and enjoys inherent as well as statutory jurisdiction. This inherent jurisdiction cannot be removed by either level of government without constitutional amendment. 3) It is fair and equitable to apply, by analogy, the principles and resulting rules formulated relating to opening up a default judgment to the applicant's request to set aside the judgment registered in circumstances where he has failed to file an appeal disputing a wage assessment to the registrar of appeals.  4) The evidence is that the applicant is a businessman running a commercial enterprise in Foam Lake. It is expected that somebody in his position would have the savvy to read, review and understand the document, or at least seek assistance from someone who could help him. The applicant either failed or declined to read, or chose to ignore, the plain language of the documents served on him by registered mail. This amounts to wilful blindness at the very least. Numerous cases hold that wilful blindness is not sufficient reason to set aside a noting for default. In these circumstances the Court is not prepared to exercise its discretion in favour of setting aside the Director's certificate filed as a judgment of this Court.","FIAT: The applicant brings an application seeking an order setting aside a wage assessment certificate issued by the Director of the Labour Standards Branch and filed with this Court. The applicant disputes liability for the amount set out in the wage assessment and claims that he inadvertently and innocently missed the time within which to file an appeal. HELD: 1) Does this Court have jurisdiction to set aside a certificate filed with the Court of Queen's Bench? 2) If so, what criteria ought to be applied in determining whether the Court should exercise its discretion in favour of setting aside the certificate? 3) The applicant has not met the criteria necessary to trigger the exercise of the Court's discretion. The consequences for inaction parallel those of defendant who is noted for default as a result of his failure to file statement of defence within the prescribed time frame. 4) The Queen’s Bench Rules provide for the opening up of a noting for default. 5) There are at least two bases upon which it can be found that the Court is clothed with jurisdiction to exercise its discretionary and provide remedy in appropriate circumstances. 6) The principles and the rules that flow from them and which have developed in relation to the opening of noting are much different. There has been no independent evidentiary based finding. After an allegation is made, it becomes an enforceable judgment if the proper steps to dispute it are not taken within the specified period of time. However, there are circumstances where it is simply inequitable to hold a party to an arbitrary deadline, especially where there are compelling legitimate reasons not to do so and the other party has suffered no prejudice. The Court does have jurisdiction, on a director appeal, because it is not a 'true appeal' that questions a decision made by an independent adjudicator after a hearing."

8_2012skqb249.txt,"The accused was convicted of aggravated assault after stabbing another person several times in the mid-section. The Crown brought a dangerous offender application. The accused was 22 years old at the time of sentencing. His prior criminal record consisted of mostly youth convictions. The offender was a known member of an aboriginal gang. The evidence suggested he was somewhere in the middle of the gang hierarchy. The accused had professed some desire to leave the gang. He had written an article directed at other youth warning them of the pitfalls of gang affiliation. The article was published in a book distributed to at risk youth. The accused had looked into getting help to leave the gang, but admitted on the stand that he was not prepared to take steps to leave because he might need protection from the gang in the penitentiary. While incarcerated, he had gang drawings confiscated from him and he had been jumped by members of a rival gang while in custody. The accused had shown some initiative in taking anger management courses and had completed his GED while incarcerated. HELD: The offence was a serious personal injury offence within the meaning of s. 752 of the Criminal Code. The criminal record together with the evidence heard at the hearing establishes that when the accused has committed violent offences he has been under the influence of alcohol or drugs, under supervision by court orders in the community, has used a knife or had one in his possession and most of the offences were a result of the accused's affiliation with the Indian Posse gang. The Crown has established a pattern of repetitive behaviour within the meaning of s. 753(1)(a)(i). Dr. Holden assessed the accused and found him to be a high risk to re-offend violently. The Crown has also proven that the accused constitutes a threat to the life, safety, and physical or mental well-being of other persons as set out in s. 753(1)(a)(ii). The accused was declared a dangerous offender. However, the Court found that given the accused's youth, the fact that he had not had any of the intensive programming that is available in a federal institution and the fact that there was some chance the accused might leave the gang, a determinate sentence and long term supervision order would adequately protect the public. In imposing a determinate sentence, the Court also considered that the accused's acts of violence, with the exception of the predicate offence, had generally resulted in less than severe injuries to the victim and the accused had voluntarily taken some steps to address his issues while incarcerated. The accused was sentenced 6 years or 72 months in custody, less credit for remand, to be followed by a 9 year supervision order under s. 753.4(b).","The accused was found guilty of aggravated assault contrary to s. 268 of the Criminal Code and breach of an undertaking. The Crown applied to have the accused declared a dangerous offender. HELD: 1) The predicate offence was a serious personal injury offence within the meaning of s. 752 of the Code. The Court found that the accused had less active role and he did not smash windows or inflict any blows. He acted in threatening manner and held in his possession bear spray. 2) Sentence concurrent with a concurrent sentence of twenty-one months custody and supervision, twelve months secure custody followed by seven month supervision in the community.  3) The Court held that the offences committed were the predicate offences. The accused had a history of violent behaviour and had been convicted of assault. 4) The court found the accused to be dangerous and sentenced him to an indeterminate sentence. 5) The sentence was concurrent with the concurrent sentence. The predicate offences were serious personal injuries offences. 6) The offence was determined to be the predicate offence under s.752 of The Criminal Code. 7) The Crown must establish a pattern of repetitive behaviour by the offender. The offender must be found dangerous and he should be sentenced to imprisonment. The court concluded that the predicate offense was a'serious personal injury' offence."
8_2015skqb6.txt,"HELD: This was an extraordinary event for all of the accused and nothing in the evidence suggested that they required rehabilitation or that incarceration would assist in rehabilitation. The victim did not provide a victim impact statement, but the court concluded that the event would have been terrifying for him. The gravity of the offence was high given the maximum sentence of life imprisonment. The court found the following mitigating factors: 1) guilty pleas; 2) the event was not planned in advance, it was prompted by alcohol use; 3) the assault was serious but brief; 4) the accused were all employed and contributing members of society; 5) the accused all accepted responsibility for the offence; and 6) the accused all complied with strict release conditions for three years. The aggravating factors were: 1) s. 348.1 of the Criminal Code was applicable to all accused even though their level of participation differed; 2) they entered the victim’s residence by breaking a window; 3) the crime was intense; 3) two of three accused had weapons and used them on the victim; and 4) the victim had some lasting injuries from losing three to four teeth. The court was prepared to extend leniency to the accused; however, some period of incarceration was found necessary to meet the objectives of deterrence and denunciation. A.H. was sentenced to 10 months incarceration, J.M. to 11 months incarceration, and N.F. to 12 months less a day incarceration for the break and enter charge and one year consecutive incarceration on the s. 85(2) charge. All accused were given an 18-month probation period to follow their incarceration. Terms of the probation included counselling as required and no contact with the victim.","HELD: The Court found that the accused were guilty of breaking and entering and committing the offence of assault causing bodily harm. The Court ordered a four year sentence for each of the three accused, plus a fine of $250.00 for each offence. The court also ordered a DNA order, firearms prohibition and forfeiture order in relation to the imitation firearm. The accused were sentenced to 13 days in custody."
8_2016skqb154.txt,"HELD: The order was granted. Following the expiry of the current temporary order, the court found that the children were in need of protection pursuant to s. 11 of The Child and Family Services Act. As the father had taken no steps to deal with his anger, violence and alcohol issues, the children continued to be in need of protection as they were likely to suffer physical harm at his hands. Their psychological well-being required that they remain in protection to allow them to deal with the trauma they had suffered while they were in his care. Therefore, the court found that because the children were doing well in foster care and did not wish to be returned to their father and that the expert had advised against them having any further contact with him, it would make a permanent order rather than a long-term order.","HELD: The court found that the children were in need of protection pursuant to s. 11 of the Child and Family Services Act. The parents of the children, despite being more or less involved with the proceedings for some of the period, did not appear for the trial of the action. The court applied ss. 11(a)(1) and (b) of the Act to determine whether the children should remain in the Ministry's custody. The children were found resilient and, in the opinion of the child protection worker, the right child protection team was put in place and remained in place. The foster parents were located and the children remained in this consistent loving care throughout their time as wards of the Ministry."

Yellow Quill First Nation applied for intervenor status. The trial judge found, without giving reasons, that the project was a development as defined in the Environmental Assessment Act and the application for mandamus was adjourned sine die. HELD: The appeal was granted and the order set aside without costs. 1)The proposal was not a development as defined in s 2(d) of the EAA. The Department of Agriculture, the Department of the Environment and Resource Management were of the opinion that the KSS project was not a development as defined in the Act as it did not come within any of the criteria listed in s2(d). 2)The Environmental Assessment Branch was of the opinion that no significant impacts on the environment would occur or if they do, mitigation measures would be implemented to reduce or eliminate the potential for significant environmental impact.  3)It was not necessary to decide whether Yellow Quill or the respondents had standing to privately enforce a public right. 4)In light of the decision the following were not in issue: whether the respondent should have applied by way of judicial review in the nature of certiorari; the relationship between the Environmental Assessment and Agricultural Operations Act; and whether a proponent of an intensive livestock operation can be required to make an application under the Agricultural Operations Act and to carry out an environmental impact assessment under s9 of the EAA.","The respondents applied to the Court of Queen's Bench by notice of motion for a declaration that the intensive livestock operation being constructed by Kelvington Super Swine Inc.

The respondents also requested an order for mandamus compelling KSS to conduct an environmental assessment of the development as required by s. 9 of the Act. KSS applied for intervenor status. The chambers judge granted the application without costs. The court reviewed the affidavits filed on behalf of the respondents and found that the KSS project was not a development as defined in s2(d).

9_2006nssc379.txt,"The Minister sought numerous orders for production of medical and various other files (including the mother's complete medical files from her family physician, the Nova Scotia Hospital and another hospital, and her files from a woman's shelter and an addiction treatment and prevention service) in an ongoing child protection proceeding. The mother argued that the records sought were irrelevant and that if there was any relevance, they were privileged, were unnecessary to the fair disposition of the proceeding, and their production would not save costs and would be injurious to the public interest. The addiction prevention and treatment service, Nova Scotia Hospital and mental health clinic records and files are ordered to be produced; the medical records of the family physician, the hospital and the woman's shelter are not ordered to be produced as these files would contain some irrelevant information and the relevant information could be obtained by other means. In a child protection proceeding, documents may be relevant to prove a protection finding, to monitor compliance with existing orders, or to develop and evaluate a plan of care. Records held by individuals or organizations to whom an individual has been referred as a result of a child protection proceeding are not privileged as no confidentiality could be expected in those circumstances. Records held by individuals or organizations whose services were accessed independent of a court order or the Minister's involvement that would ordinarily attract privilege may be ordered to be produced in child protection proceedings. However, if the information contained in the records can be obtained by a means targeted specifically to produce the relevant information, then orders for production for all of the records will not be necessary to the fair disposition of the proceeding. Also, since such records contain irrelevant, as well as relevant material, such an order would violate the privacy protections found in the Charter and be injurious to the public interest.","HELD: The application was granted. The court found that the order of production was necessary to determine whether there were other circumstances in the respondent's life that would place her in need of protection. It found that although the respondent had consented to the grant of an order for the production of the documents, it was not sufficient to satisfy the court that the documents were not relevant to the proceeding. The order for production was not necessary because it was a formalistic classification of the nature of the proceedings. The Court found that there was a heightened concern for accuracy in fact finding when considering relevance in a child protection proceeding."

With respect to EK the Department seeks an order placing him with the Minister until his 16th birthday. This order was granted at trial. The parents do not oppose the applications with respect to JS and EK but the mother seeks the return of CS to her care.

This does not prevent JS from spending unsupervised time with his parents including overnight visits. CS is in need of protection and she shall remain in the custody of the Minister for a period of 3 months. During that time, the parents shall work with DCR to develop a case plan for CS's return. TK will have a mental health assessment as arranged for by DCR and will follow any recommendations of the mental health professional and participate in the Victim Intervention Program. KS will attend any session at Alternatives to Violence arranged for by DCR. 1) The Court was satisfied that the children were exposed to domestic violence or severe domestic disharmony. 2) Matters did not move quickly once the children were placed in the care of DCR. Instead of working with DCR to ensure a smooth reintegration of the children into their home, the parents vacated their apartment, moved to Alberta for a while, lived in a series of motels, camped at SK's apartment building and even lived in a tent. During that period of time, some of which encompassed the trial, the Court was not satisfied that there was an adult person who was willing and able to provide for the children's needs.

The court ordered the respondent to remain with the respondent until age 16 pursuant to s. 37(1)(b) of the Act and ordered that the respondent return to her care. 1) The respondent's conduct was not supported by the evidence. 2) There was insufficient evidence to support a finding of mental or emotional harm to the respondent. 3) The evidence did not support the respondent’s claim that he was hit three days out of seven. 4) The petitioner did not oppose the applications in respect of [J.S.] and [E.K.] but sought the return of [C.S.]. 5) The court found that there was no evidence of a breach of any of the provisions of s. 11(a)(i) and s. 33(2) of this Act. The evidence was that the parties had been in contact for several months prior to the apprehension and that the petitioner had not shown any signs of mental illness. 6) The children were placed in the care of the Department.

9_2008skca107.txt,"This appeal arises from a dispute between the appellant, Dr. Huerto and the respondent Government of Saskatchewan, over the payment for medical services provided by Dr. Huerto to his patients. Over a period of approximately 10 years, the Government withheld payment in relation to what eventually amounted to some 12,000 of the appellant's accounts. The Government indicated through the use of a billing code, that the accounts would not be paid until further information was provided. The appellant believed the use of the billing code was unlawful and chose not to provide additional information. He started an action in the Court of Queen's Bench to compel payment of his accounts. His claim was largely dismissed on the basis that the action was premature. The appellant appeals from the Queen's Bench ruling and the Government cross-appeal in relation to the limited aspect of the case in which Dr. Huerto enjoyed success. HELD: Appeal and Cross-appeal dismissed.  1) Section 17(1)(c) of The Saskatchewan Medical Care Insurance Act is to the effect that the intention and purpose of the Act is not to establish a medical care insurance plan under which 'the exercise of professional judgment by physicians is in any way diminished'. This broad statement of principle should not be read so aggressively as to mean the Government, as the payor in a publicly funded health care system, has no right to ask questions about the accounts presented for payment by physicians. The Government has not denied payment of the appellant's accounts. Nor has it received the requested information from the appellant. The actions (the Protocol) taken by the Government cannot be characterized as an amendment of the Payment Schedule. The Protocol is an administrative tool which sets out the situations in which the appellant will be asked for further information about the provision of specific services. This is fully in line with the terms of the Schedule. 2) Section 5(1) of the Regulations should not be read as meaning the Government is entitled to ask for additional information about a service if, and only if, the nature of the service is 'unusual'. Rather, it simply stipulates that additional remarks must be included in an account rendered with respect to an unusual service. This does not imply the government can request extra information only in relation to an unusual service. A physician's obligation to include certain material in an account and the Government's authority to ask for additional information are ultimately two quite different things. 3) The Court does not accept that the appellant's claims were barred by s. 16(1) of the Act. It would be perverse to read the Act as requiring that, in order for an account to be paid, every bit of information demanded by the Government through the use of a billing code, or otherwise, must be supplied before the expiration of the 6 month period established by the Regulations. An account submitted the day before the expiration of the 6 month deadline would be voided by the application of the billing code. An account submitted well in advance of the expiration of the 6 month period would also be effectively denied if a request for further information was not made until at or near the end of the six month time limit, with the result that there was insufficient time for a physician to respond before that limit was exceeded. These potential problems are especially troublesome because there is an element of subjectivity in the application of the Protocol and even the most diligent physician might not accurately anticipate when an account or accounts will attract a request for extra comment. 4) The Court cannot accept the Government's submission that the trial judge should have declined to deal with the appellant's claim because the appellant had not fully pursued possible appeals to the Medical assessment Board. The Legislature in s. 40(3) of the Act has expressly provided that the appeal procedure established pursuant to the Act does not prejudice a physician's right to pursue matters in the courts. It stands entirely at odds with the notion that the appeal procedures in the Act should be read as being comprehensive and exhaustive.","HELD: The appeal was dismissed and the cross-appeal dismissed. Both the appeal and the appeal must be dismissed. The principles of the Protocol and the Government's use of the AU code were not inconsistent with the standard procedure. The Protocol was designed to facilitate the payment of physician services and, in appropriate situations, to facilitate payment of accounts, not to deny or frustrate their payment. The standard procedure for assessing physician services in Saskatchewan is the Payment Schedule. The protocol is an individualized administrative process. It sets out the circumstances in which further information will be requested in relation to the provision of ECG and Holter monitor services. The evidence at trial indicated that standard tests were standard tests and not 'unusual' in and of themselves. By marking service 'AU', the Government was simply asking for more information. It was not denying payment."

Although he alleged that he would suffer unnecessary hardship if kept in custody because he would fall behind in his schoolwork, prior to being remanded the youth had been asked to leave his high school as a result of safety concerns in the school. Application for release pending appeal dismissed. The young person would not suffer unnecessary hardship as he was able to attend high school classes several times per week in the youth facility while he awaited his appeal and, even if his appeal was successful, he would only have served four months custody before it was heard. Given the circumstances of the aggravated assault and his record of violent offences and numerous breaches of court orders, the court was not persuaded that the youth's release would be in the public interest.","The accused pleaded guilty to aggravated assault contrary to s. 268(1) of the Criminal Code. He was sentenced to 365 days, comprised of 243 days custody followed by 122 days supervision in the community. Prior to being remanded, the accused was not attending school because he had been asked to leave the high school he had previously attended as a result of concern for his and other students' safety after threats had been made against him. HELD: The application for release pending appeal was dismissed. The accused was found not to have met the conditions set out in s. 679 of the Code. The Court was not persuaded that his appeal was sufficiently meritorious that, by the time his appeal is heard, he would likely already have served more than what is determined to be a fit sentence, and thereby suffer undue hardship if he is not released."

The Crown alleged three aggravating factors: 1) that the sexual assaults were numerous, 2) that the accused touched the victims directly on their skin and not just on their clothing and 3) that there was digital penetration by the accused on both victims. HELD: At a sentencing hearing, the Crown must prove aggravating factors beyond a reasonable doubt. The Court held that the two victims were sexually assaulted by the accused on numerous occasions over a period of a number of years. The Court was satisfied these sexual assaults were a common occurrence on every occasion that the accused was in the company of his granddaughters. The Court found that the accused touched the victims under their clothing on numerous occasions and that there were a couple of occasions that the accused digitally penetrated each victim. Finally, the Court concluded that the accused got bolder over time and took more liberties and chances with his victims.","The Crown sought a sentencing hearing pursuant to s. 724(3)(e) of the Criminal Code. The accused entered guilty pleas to two counts of sexual assault contrary to the provisions of the Sexual Offences Act.

The evidence of the victims was sufficiently credible to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that digital penetration occurred. The Court concluded that these sexual assaults were a common occurrence on every occasion the accused was in the company of the girls. The Crown concluded that the accused got bolder as time passed and took more liberties and chances. The court concluded that this was due to the passage of time, and the difficulties with recalling events of many years ago, do not accept the accused's denial that there was no digital penetration.

The order made on May 19, 1992 conclusively resolved the issue. This was an order 'otherwise' within the meaning of Civil Procedure Rule 41.10(3).

b_1996canlii5028.txt,"Guardian was the general liability insurer for Kellogg. Royal was the primary insurer as holder of Kellogg's blanket fleet coverage. Kellogg's employee was involved in a motor vehicle accident while on company business but was driving his wife's vehicle at the time of the accident. Royal denied coverage and refused to defend on the basis of an exclusionary provision regarding the use of substitute automobiles. It was held at trial that Royal was not obligated to participate. HELD: 1)The case law reveals some inconsistencies with respect to the relationship between the duty to defend and the coverage provided by the policy. Where the policy clearly does not provide coverage, the insurer had no duty to defend. Where a policy only provides coverage for some allegations the insurer is only obligated to defend those allegations which may trigger the obligation to indemnify. When a policy is ambiguous some courts have adopted Thames and have stated the mere possibility that the policy may provide coverage is sufficient to oblige the insurer to defend. 2)Section 209 provides no guidelines as to the scope of the inquiry the judge may engage in. The chamber judge did not define the scope of his inquiry and stated that the standard suggestion that Guardian must raise an arguable point was 'off target'. To determine whether an insurer has the obligation to defend a chamber judge must examine the coverage provided by the policy. The judge made no finding of ambiguity in the exclusionary provision. He simply determined the Honda was not covered by the Royal policy and did not decide the issue of indemnity. 3)The affidavit evidence indicated that the parties lived in the same premises thus that argument was without merit. CONCURRING JUDGMENT: The appeal was dismissed for different reasons.  1)There has been an acceptance of the general concept that the duty to defend is broader than the duty to indemnify. To order an insurer to defend a chamber judge need be less sure the policy provides coverage than would be the case for an actual determination of liability under the policy. 2)There was a factual element which could not be determined on this application such as whether a partially deflated tire constitutes a breakdown within the meaning of the policy and whether the automobile the employee was driving was owned by someone living in the same dwelling. 3)The question centered around the words used in clause 5 of the policy and who it referred to. There were inconsistencies in terminology. The policy should not be interpreted as though the restriction it contains on what automobile can be used as a temporary substitute should be ignored.","This appeal arises from an application for directions to determine whether Royal has an obligation to defend.

Although both were very good parents the parties had not demonstrated an ability to co-parent effectively as illustrated by their communication problems. The father's access initially went beyond the minimum required by the interim order. He failed to make support payments as ordered. The father was to pay child support of $449. Pursuant to s.7 of the Federal Child Support Guidelines he was to pay 54% of the net cost of child care expenses incurred as a result of the mother's employment and for health related expenses in excess of $100 of the insurance reimbursement upon production of receipts.  2)The automobile constituted matrimonial property and was valued at $200. 3)Either could speak to costs.","The primary issue was the appropriate parenting arrangement for Travis and Jonathan. HELD: The respondent was to provide primary residence. The petitioner was to have reasonable access to include alternating weekends from Friday evening until Sunday evening and in the event that the respondent was not working on the Friday prior to such weekend or the Monday following such weekend, access shall extend to include the extra day or days. The respondent shall have access on each Friday that is not attached to his access weekend except when such Friday is the petitioner's earned day off. The court accepted the characterization that the petitioner was more flexible than the respondent and prepared to promote maximum contact. The parties were to have joint custody of the children two weekends out of every three weekends. The only evidence tendered apart from what the petitioner might think it should be worth was an offer to purchase by Capital Pontiac in which they would allow a trade-in value of $3,500 and find that to be the value of the van. In the event the respondent has an EDO on Friday preceding his weekend with the children, his parenting time shall commence on the Thursday after work; (ii) One evening during the week which evening is to be agreed and fixed by the parties; (iii) Such additional time as the parties may agree upon. There shall be an equal sharing of holiday time."
b_1999skqb39.txt,HELD: The grandparents were granted access one Saturday every second month from 10:00 a.m. to 4:00 p.m. It would be in the best interests of the child to have some ongoing relationship with both his maternal and paternal grandparents. The father lived in Alberta and may not be able to exercise the degree of access he was seeking. The relationships were separate with unique characteristics.,"The paternal grandparents sought an order granting them access to their grandson R.D.G., born December 1995 pursuant to s. 6.1(1) of the Children's Law Act, 1997. The applicants, the paternal grandparents, seek an order granted them access. The applicant paternal grandparents seek access. They are responsible individuals who have genuine affection and concern for the child. As their son does not reside in Saskatchewan but rather in Alberta, am of the view that he may not be able to exercise the degree of access which he seeks or indeed has been granted by this court in fiat being released concurrently with this one. This fact warrants consideration by the court in terms of access to that child. HELD: 1st access period every two months would be appropriate under all of the circumstances. The respondent shall fix each access period two months in advance. 2) It would be in the best interests of the child to have some ongoing relationship with both his maternal grandparents, and his paternal grandparents."
b_2000skqb36.txt,"The accused, Cote, applied for remedy pursuant to s.24 of the Charter of Rights stating that he was denied the right to be tried on a fraud charge within a reasonable time. Twenty-two months passed between the laying of the charge and the trial date. Cote was not responsible for the delay and actively pursued a speedy trial. The delay was caused by the Crown's failure to provide timely disclosure. HELD: The charge was stayed. In applying the decision of the SCC in R. v. Morin, the court found that 22 months is an unreasonable and exceptional period of delay and is of sufficient length to warrant an inquiry. This case had no particular complexity above the norm for cases of this kind and did not require this delay. Cote did not directly or indirectly waive his s.11(b) right to be tried within a reasonable time. Cote was subject to substantial and sufficient prejudice by the delay. He suffered damage to his political career, embarrassment from media reports, unemployment, and economic hardship. The court balanced the individual's right to be tried within a reasonable time with society's interest in having the matter proceed to trial despite delay. Here the defence was not seeking to delay the trial and use the protective shield of s.11(b)as an offensive weapon.",The accused was committed to stand trial on one count of fraud. He now applies to this court for a remedy pursuant to s. 24 of the Charter of Rights and Freedoms. The application is based primarily on the accused's position that he has been denied the right to be tried on the fraud charge within a reasonable time. HELD: 1) The Court found that the accused had been unable to comply with the Crown's obligation to provide timely disclosure. 2) The length of delay in proceeding with the preliminary hearing fell to the Crown as does the one-month delay from the first appearance on May 12 to the third appearance on June when sufficient disclosure had been made to allow the accused to make an informed election. 3) The Crown failed to make timely disclosure to the accused. 4) There was no evidence of any particular complexity above and beyond the norm for cases of this kind. 5) The court found that there was no prejudicial prejudice against the accused as the prejudice was substantial and sufficient to tilt the balance in favour of requiring a judicial stay.
b_2000skqb420.txt,"FIAT. An application for summary judgment under Part Forty. In issue was whether a solicitor is bound by an undertaking to protect an expert witness for its professional fees. The defendant solicitor, who represented several farmers and farming companies in suits brought against Saskatchewan Crop Insurance Corporation on a contingency fee basis, confirmed in writing in 1993 that his office would undertake to protect the plaintiff consultants for their fees and disbursements and to pay interest at a rate of 12% per annum. The plaintiff was hired to provide technical evidence as to crop losses and damages the farmers claimed as a result of actions of SCIC. When all of the claims were dismissed at trial, the solicitor rejected the plaintiff's demand for payment arguing he had no obligation to pay as the farmers' actions had not resulted in the recovery of any monies. The plaintiff sued the solicitor in 1997 for professional fees of $37,604.33. The plaintiff objected to certain portions of the defendant's affidavit. HELD: The plaintiff was awarded $37,604.33 plus interest at 12% per annum as provided for in the undertaking, and costs of the action.  1)The plaintiff commenced its action under the general rules but amended its claim without objection to continue under the Simplified Procedure. 2)Portions of the defendant's affidavit were struck as being hearsay and opinion or related to matters immaterial to the proceeding.  3)The applicant's admissions at discovery did not confirm the interpretation of the undertaking set out in the statement of defence. It was obvious the plaintiff's officer recognized the farmers were intending to fund their costs from a settlement or judgment and that disbursements, including the costs of any expert's reports commissioned by them or the defendant, would be paid by his clients regardless of the outcome of the suits. 4)The only conclusion that could be drawn was that defendant guaranteed payment of the applicant's account regardless of the outcome of their mutual client's actions. A solicitor is presumed to know the cannons of the Law Society including c.XVI, comm.10 of the Code of Professional Conduct with respect to undertakings. The solicitor's undertaking in 1993 was absolutely clear. The addition of the word 'protect' put the question beyond doubt. His inquiry in 1997 made it clear the defendant recognized his responsibility and was hoping for some resolution of the applicant's account.","FIAT. The plaintiff was hired to provide technical evidence as to crop losses and damages the farmers claimed resulted from the actions of the Saskatchewan Crop Insurance Corporation (SCIC). The plaintiff's officer met with the farmers and the defendant to discuss the case, the evidence and the strategies to be followed. The hope was that the provincial agency might settle before trial. HELD: The court was struck with respect to the following portions of the affidavit: 1) The respondent guaranteed the payment of the applicant's account regardless of the outcome of their mutual client's actions. 2) The court had an opportunity to hear both parties in this action on evidence in chief and under cross examination. It was not an appropriate case under either the General Rules or Rule 488 (Simplified Procedure). 3) The portions of an affidavit are not evidence but hearsay and opinion. The addition of the word protect puts the question beyond doubt. The court is struck with regard to whether the solicitor is bound by an undertaking to protect an expert witness for its professional fees."
b_2000skqb572.txt,"The accused was charged with sexual assault under s.271 of the Criminal Code. Although the DNA evidence established he had sexual intercourse with the complainant, neither had any memory of it due to their self-induced states of intoxication. Defences raised were consent, an honest but mistaken belief that she gave her consent, and extreme drunkenness such that he was so intoxicated that he was not in a conscious state and was incapable of forming any intent to have sexual intercourse without consent. HELD: The accused was found guilty.  1)Although the defence of 'extreme intoxication' is successful in the rarest of cases, the accused established the Daviault 'extreme intoxication' on a balance of probabilities. He would have been acquitted had it not been for s.33.1 which does away with this defence in sexual assault cases.  2)The court was satisfied on a balance of probabilities that his extreme level of self-induced intoxication rendered him incapable of making a conscious decision to have sexual intercourse with the complainant with or without her consent. The court was satisfied that the complainant had not done anything to suggest that she would consent. The accused was incapable of considering the issue of consent and accordingly did not have a mistaken belief or reasonable grounds for such a belief. It was clear from the testimony of an 11 year old that the intercourse took place long after the complainant passed out. She was incapable of giving consent after that time. Her assertion of lack of consent was inherently unreliable due to her lack of any memory of events that occurred before, during and after the alleged assault and would have been more in the nature of an assumption than a fact, but was found to be consistent with all the other evidence. It was not relevant that she may have withdrawn consent. 3)There was no evidence to give his second defence (that he honestly believed he had her consent) an air of reality. His assertion that she must have consented or he would not have done it was speculative assumption, not evidence. 4)Section 33.1 provides that the act of becoming voluntarily intoxicated to the extent of being incapable of controlling one's behaviour constitutes criminal culpability sufficient to found criminal liability for offences committed against the bodily integrity of others. The public outcry and Parliamentary response to Daviault strongly indicate that s.33.1 is not only consistent with the objectives of the Charter but is justifiable and essential in a free and democratic society. Of four recent cases that held Criminal Code s.33.1 violates the Charter, two held it was saved by s.1 while two held it was not saved by s.1 of the Charter. 5)Section 33.1(1) provides the lack of general intent or voluntariness is not a defence to an assault charge described in ss.(3)if it resulted from self-induced intoxication or the accused departed markedly from the standard of reasonable care generally recognized in Canadian society. The three sub-conditions described in ss.(2) concerning marked departure constitute criminal culpability similar to recklessness. Criminal culpability is not dependent on wilful intention to cause harm but on the wilful intention to engage in conduct that incurs the risk of harm without caring whether or not harm ensues. 6)The strong dissent in Daviault indicated those who render themselves incapable of knowing what they are doing through voluntary consumption of alcohol or drugs possess a sufficiently blameworthy state of mind that their imprisonment does not offend the principle of fundamental justice which prohibits the imprisonment of the innocent. The court has broad discretion to differentiate in sentences imposed for offences that were deliberately committed and those that were committed involuntarily because of self-induced intoxication.","The accused was charged with sexual assault pursuant to s. 271 of the Criminal Code. Although the DNA evidence established that the accused had sexual intercourse with the complainant, neither the accused nor the complainant had any memory of the sexual intercourse that took place between them. HELD: The accused was found guilty. The Court of Appeal held that the defence of 'extreme drunkenness' was not saved by s. 1(1)(b) of the Code as it was not supported by the expert evidence tendered by the defence. The court found that the appellant had no honest but mistaken belief that the complainant consented to the sexual activity and that there was nothing to suggest that she would consent to the act. The evidence raised by the accused was that he was so intoxicated that he could not remember the events prior to his passing out. The accused's evidence was inconsistent with the testimony of the complainant and he never considered the issue of her consent or lack of it. In addition, the Court found that s. 33.1 now limits the availability of the extreme drunkenness defence."
b_2002skqb131.txt,"The Crown appealed the dismissal of charges of impaired driving and driving with a blood alcohol level exceeding .08. The trial judge held the circumstances supported a special plea of autrefois acquit and that the manner of proceeding by the Crown was an abuse of process at common law. Alberta did not withdraw or abandon the charges and suspended his driving privileges for 3 months. Upon request, SGI also suspended his Saskatchewan driving privileges. At issue was whether the Alberta court lost jurisdiction; if so, whether that gave rise to a plea of autrefois acquit in Saskatchewan; apart from any loss of jurisdiction did the police procedure amount to an abuse of process at common law. HELD: The Informations were stayed. The trial judge erred in finding a plea of autrefois acquit was applicable but was correct in concluding Alberta lost jurisdiction. 1)The Information remained dismissed for want of prosecution. Jurisdiction over the respondent was lost when the information was not available in the Alberta Provincial Court, the appearance notice was not confirmed and the matter could not be dealt with (R. v. McGinnis). The Alberta court could have regained jurisdiction by issuing a summons or warrant within 3 months of February 6, 2001. A summons was not issued until August. The information was by then deemed to have been dismissed for want of prosecution pursuant to s.485(3). 'Deemed' in s.485(3) does not mean 'presumed until otherwise proven'. It means that the information is dismissed without any action by the court. Once dismissed the proceeding could only be recommenced with consent of the Attorney General or leave of the court, neither of which were obtained. 2)With respect to jurisdiction in Saskatchewan, s.476(b) grants concurrent jurisdiction to any province in which the offence may have been committed or committed within 500 metres of any province in order to prevent a charge from failing because of uncertainty as to location. The section was not intended to permit simultaneous prosecutions in two provinces or in a second province in the event of a failure in the first. 3)The respondent's appearance in a Saskatchewan courtroom as a result of a summons did not revive jurisdiction in Alberta. The Alberta proceeding was deemed to have been dismissed for want of prosecution on May 6, 2001. The charges have not been disposed of within the meaning of s.730(3). There was no finding in respect of which an appeal can be taken. The special plea of autrefois acquit is not available in these circumstances. 4)The prosecutorial conduct of the police in proceeding simultaneously in two provinces amounted to an abuse of process. The respondent was obliged to defend identical charges arising out of the same incident in two provinces for almost a year at substantial cost and stress. The police acted with arbitrary purpose and without regard for the principles of fundamental justice. The lack of malice or improper motive does not preclude a finding of abuse of process.","This summary conviction appeal by the Crown was brought when the trial judge dismissed charges of impaired driving and driving with a blood alcohol level exceeding.08 percent. The trial judge held that the circumstances supported a special plea of autrefois acquit. The Alberta proceeding was deemed to have been dismissed for want of prosecution. HELD: 1)The trial judge erred in finding that the court had lost jurisdiction as he specifically found that if there was loss of jurisdiction it was over the offence, but in dismissing the Information he relied on the provisions of s. 485(2) of the Criminal Code which relate to loss of jurisdictional over the accused and not the offence. The special plea was not applicable in this case. 2)The court was unable to agree that appearance by the respondent in a Saskatchewan court as a result of a summons issued before May 7, 2001 revived jurisdiction over the respondent. 3)The Court was not satisfied that the special plea had been substituted by autrefis acquit in this instance. The Court was correct in concluding that the Alberta Provincial Court had lost its jurisdiction over him. 4)The Crown appealed. The court was not aware of the Alberta information being sworn in Alberta or in any other province. The evidence before the court was clear that the Justice had issued a summons within three months of the loss in Alberta and the subsequent appearance in Alberta. 5)Any reference by the judge to loss in the province was unintentional. Any reference to loss is unintentional. 6)If jurisdiction was lost in Alberta the charges in Alberta were already deemed to be dismissed. The Special plea was based solely on the deemed dismissal. The Crown was correct to conclude the Alberta province had lost control over the appellant."

The journalists had no prior opportunity to hear its contents because Jones entered a guilty plea. The application was not opposed. The applicant sought an order for mandamus or a declaration. HELD: The presumption is in favour of public access to court records and the burden to contrary proof lies with the person who would deny access. This right is tempered by other factors (see R. v. SJS). Requiring the journalists to attend at the offices of the Attorney General and playing the CD ROM and making their own notes balances the interests of innocent parties whose conversations were recorded.","FIAT. The Saskatoon StarPhoenix applied for access to a CD-ROM entered in evidence at a sentencing hearing in the matter of R. v. Glen Ivor Jones. The StarPhoenix's journalists had no prior opportunity to hear the contents of the CD in their sentencing submissions because Mr. Jones entered a guilty plea. Now, the paper's journalists wish to view that evidence. The applicant applies for mandamus, or a declaration. HELD: The court of Queen's Bench is the appropriate court to obtain such relief. 1) The applicant is entitled to make a copy of the CDs at its expense. 2) Both counsel agree that this exhibit is now under the control of the Attorney General and it is its appropriate respondent in this proceeding. 3) The court must be concerned that no harm befalls innocent parties. This CD- ROM will invariably hold conversations made by innocent parties and is available for the public to view. 4) There is a presumption in favour of public access to judicial records, and the burden to the contrary proof lies upon the person who would deny the exercise of the right. This right is tempered somewhat by other factors. As stated in RJR v. SJ.S., [2000] S.J.A. at para. 8: The right of access to the judicial records has never been considered absolute. The governing principle is that there is a fundamental presumption in favor of the public access but that access must be supervised by the Court to ensure the integrity of the exhibit is preserved and that no abuse or harm occurs to innocent parties or to those who are involved in such a crime. The Attorney General does not oppose the application. It merely seeks the court order to release the CD to the applicant."
b_2004skqb105.txt,"FIAT: The defendant applied for security for costs in the amount of $50,000. HELD: The plaintiff was required to supply security for costs in the amount of $18,000. 1) The defendant proved facts, which demonstrated the existence of several of the criteria listed in Rule 538 of the Queen's Bench Rules of Court. The plaintiff failed to establish any of the situations listed in Rule 539.  2) The presence of a counterclaim does not necessarily or automatically prohibit the granting of an order for security for costs. Rather, it is a factor to be considered. In this case, the counterclaim was not a wholly distinct claim. It arises in respect of the same matter and transaction as the claim proper. 3) The defendant commenced the builders' lien action, long before filing a defence and counterclaim within this action. Had the counterclaim not been filed, an order for security for costs as requested would have been appropriate. It is somewhat artificial to now deny that relief because of the counterclaim, which has the effect of facilitating a disposition of all matters within one proceeding. 4) The plaintiff applied ex parte under s. 56(1) of The Builders' Lien Act to have the defendant's lien vacated. The application was granted, but the plaintiff was required to post security for costs in the amount of $50,000. The Builders' Lien Act does not impede the jurisdiction of this Court to deal with the application of the defendant.","FIAT. The defendant applied for an order requiring the plaintiff to provide security for costs in the amount of $50,000.

In carrying out that contract the plaintiff engaged the defendant as a sub-contractor to construct a directionally drilled crossing under the South Saskatchewan River. The defendants embarked upon the project but after time ceased the work and the plaintiff abandoned the project. HELD: The plaintiff was ordered to pay $18,000 for fees and disbursements. The amount of security posted was $18k. The court found that the presence of the counterclaim did not impede the plaintiff's ability to defend against the claim.

Even if the respondent's conduct constituted a breach of the clause of the contract prohibiting him from soliciting the customers of the appellant, the appellant failed to prove any loss attributable to the breach. The appellant's loss consisted of its inability to continue to obtain Mato products and sell them to its customers at a profit. This loss stemmed from the termination of its distributorship agreement with Mato, not from anything the respondent did. As the trial judge found, the termination of the distributorship was unconnected to the respondent.","Fulltext of judgment follows: [1] It is not necessary for us to call upon counsel for the respondent, for each of us is of the view that, even if his conduct constituted a breach of the clause prohibiting him from soliciting the customers of the appellant, Belterra failed to prove any loss attributable to the breach. Assuming it did (which is to put the case for the appellant at its highest), Belte has not satisfied us that it suffered any loss.

b_2007skqb388.txt,"The accused was found not guilty of having care or control of a motor vehicle while his blood alcohol content was over .08. The certificate of analysis was excluded as a result of the trial judge's decision that the accused's s. 8 Charter Rights had been violated. The trial judge found that the officer did not have reasonable and probable grounds to make the breathalyzer demand. HELD: The trial judge erred in determining that in the totality of the circumstances it was not objectively reasonable for the officer to have relied on the accuracy of the ASD test. A new trial is ordered.  1) There is no fixed rule or formula that an officer must follow when determining whether or not to wait 15 minutes prior to administering a road side test. In this case, the trial judge appears to have concluded that the officer who administered the ASD would not have relied on the results, or should not have so relied, if her partner had informed her of the empty beer can with fresh suds in it that he found at the scene. Implicit in this finding is the conclusion that the existence of the beer can would make a difference to the officer's assessment of whether she should wait 15 minutes for any mouth alcohol to dissipate before she could rely on ASD test results. 2) The trial judge made the same error that was dealt with by the Ontario Court of Appeal in R. v. Einarson. 3) The accused told the officer that he had been drinking in the car 'earlier'. Even if the officer had been told of her partner's discovery of an empty beer can at the scene, it would not constitute 'credible evidence' that the accused consumed alcohol within that 15 minute time frame. Whether or not the accused had consumed beer within 15 minutes of taking the test on the ASD is pure speculation.",HELD: The appeal was allowed and the acquittal set aside. The trial judge erred in determining that in the totality of the circumstances it was not objectively reasonable for the officer to have relied on the accuracy of the ASD test.

The tenant received notice of the hearing late on Friday when the hearing was set for Tuesday morning. She immediately requested an adjournment as she was unable to attend personally. The tenant also submits that the notice failed to disclose a significant aspect of the complaint, namely the conduct of her boyfriend. HELD: Appeal allowed and the matter returned to the Director to schedule a new hearing with at least 7 days clear notice to be given of the date. The decision to grant an adjournment is inherently discretionary and should be made with a view to what is necessary to ensure justice is done between the parties. This should include consideration of the complexity of the issues, the tenant's personal circumstances affecting her ability to attend in person on short notice and any prejudice to the landlord if the request is granted. There is no evidence that any of this was considered by the Hearing Officer. Three days (including a weekend) is not sufficient time to make arrangements and prepare for any hearing. It is clear that the tenant took the matter seriously and spent considerable time preparing written responses to the landlord's claim as she knew it to be. On the issue of sufficiency of the Notice, the Court found that while the Notice outlined many issues, it failed to disclose issues relating to her boyfriend. Since these issues were only discussed at the hearing the tenant was unable to attend she was not able to advise in person or in writing that her boyfriend was now incarcerated and the issue resolved. The Hearing Officer, in accepting evidence from the landlord about the boyfriend when neither the Hearing notice nor the landlord's complaint contained notice of it, breached the rule of natural justice and due process.

HELD: The appeal is allowed. 1)The Hearing Officer, in accepting this 'boyfriend related evidence' when neither the Hearing Notice nor the landlord's complaint contained notice of it, breached the rules of natural justice and due process. The decision should be taken with a view to what is necessary to ensure that justice is done between the parties. The discretion must be exercised judicially by the application of proper legal principles.  2)The hearing officer, by accepting this evidence, breached both rules of procedural fairness and due-process.  3)The decision of whether or not an adjournment should be granted is inherently discretionary.

When he died, the former husband had not changed his will, which left the residue of his estate to his former wife. The Chambers judge held that the separation agreement had not revoked the will and the former wife was entitled to the testamentary gift. The mother of the deceased appealed. Appeal dismissed; although the Chambers judge's reasoning was flawed, the appellant had failed to produce any legal authority that a contractual promise to renounce, given for consideration before the death of a former spouse, binds a person to renounce a testamentary gift after his death. Even if the former spouse were so bound, there did not appear to be any privity of contract which would allow the appellant, who was not a party to the separation agreement, to enforce it.","The chambers judge found that the appellant failed to produce any legal authority that a contractual promise to renounce, given for consideration before the death of a former spouse, binds a person to be the sole beneficiary under the will. The mother of the deceased appeals. Appeal dismissed. The Chambers judge relied on Billing, supra and Eccleston, supra for the purposes of the corollary relief judgment. The chambers judge held that the separation agreement did not revoke the will nor did it affect the appellant's entitlement to the gift under the Will. The issue before the chambers judge was whether the respondent can contractually obligate herself to renout a testamentary gift after her death. HELD: Appeal dismissed with costs per reasons for judgment of Oland, J.A.; the appellant did not provide any Canadian and English authority in which a renunciation or renunciation with a latent effect of a certain type of contract is not allowed. The respondent's mother appealed. The court noted that the Chambers judge's reasoning was flawed. It was not clear from the wording of the statement that the respondent consented to the respondent designating whomsoever she wishes to be beneficiary of any life insurance policy on his life even though she may now be designated (by operation of law or previous action of the Husband) as an irrevocable beneficiary. The evidence did not support the respondent's claim. The Court noted that there was nothing on which a verbal promise to be renounced could be binding."
b_2011nsca39.txt,"The police responded to a call from a woman identified as the defendant's girlfriend's mother to the effect that her daughter was being abused. Initially unable to locate the residence, they spoke to the girlfriend on the phone, who advised them that she was fine and did not require the police. They nevertheless continued to the residence, where they heard a scream from inside. Knowing that the defendant was a suspected drug dealer and potentially violent, they demanded entry into the home. The daughter opened the door and told them everything was fine, there had been no assault and she had simply wanted a ride home. From where they entered, the officers could see a person lying down in the bedroom. They approached the man, searched him for officer safety and then conducted a warrantless search to locate any other occupants. During the search, certain items were noted that caused them to obtain a search warrant, following which drugs were found. The defendant's argument that the search was illegal was unsuccessful as the court found that, in these particular circumstances, the police had a responsibility to enter the home without a warrant, do a pat down search of the accused and search for other occupants. Once drugs were seen in plain view, they proceeded to obtain a search warrant. Judicial notice was taken of the fact that complainants in domestic situations often recant due to threats of coercion by their partners. The defendant appealed. Appeal allowed; conviction set aside; although a violation of the defendant's Charter rights had occurred, the record was insufficient for this court to engage in a s. 24(2) analysis. Although it was reasonable, in the circumstances, for the police to search for the girl, go to the defendant's home and not simply leave once she told them she was fine, the trial judge erred in failing to consider alternatives short of police entry (such as conferring with the girl after they had her step outside and close the door) and the search of the home, without a warrant. Police authority to investigate such a call includes locating the alleged victim and determining if their assistance is required, but, without more, does not extend to the entry or search of the premises.","The appellant was found guilty of several drug offences. The police entered the appellant's home and searched the premises. The appellant's mother called the police. She said that her daughter was being abused and that she wanted her to come pick her up. When the police arrived at the residence, they could see inside a bedroom where the appellant was lying on the bed. The complainant cooperated during the search and said that she was fine and that the police had a warrant to enter the home. The trial judge found that the warrantless entry and search of the home was justified. The evidence found as result of the searches should have been excluded pursuant to s. 24(2) of the Charter. HELD: Leave to appeal was granted, the appeal allowed, and the conviction set aside. In the circumstances, although the call was not a 911 call, it was reasonable for the police to search for the alleged victim or from the appellant, to go to her home, and not to simply leave once the daughter told them at the door that she had been fine. However, the trial judge erred in principle by failing to consider alternatives short of police entry into the home and the search without a warrant.

The child was not performing well in her program with no explanation for her poor performance. HELD The burden is on the petitioner to prove the adult child's ongoing economic dependence. Although the child is a child within the meaning of the Divorce Act during the time she was attending classes, her expenses are excessive.

HELD: The chamber's judge was in error in striking out portions of the statement of defence and counter-claim. The error consists of a failure to address the merits of the application. The Court of Appeal opted to deal with the merits of the application themselves, rather than remitting the matter back to Queen's Bench. While the allegation of fraud might have been pleaded more explicitly, the pleading is nevertheless sufficient to answer the requirements of QB Rule 173. The appellants should have been given an opportunity to amend their pleadings. The appeal was allowed and the application to strike was dismissed without prejudice to respondent's right to seek further particulars.",Fulltext of judgment follows: [1] We have concluded that the chamber judge struck major portions of the statement of defence and counterclaim of Carry the Kettle First Nation was made in error. The error consists of a failure to address the merits of the application brought by the respondent to strike the impugned portions of these pleadings. HELD: Appeal allowed. The chambers judge's order striking major portions was in error and the error consisted of a failed to address both the merits and the application to strike.

The hearing officer determined that the landlord's claim for non-payment of rent had been established and that an order for possession as warranted. The hearing officer directed that the order of possession would be deferred if the tenant paid the rent that was owing and future rent. The tenants argued that the hearing officer erred in not considering that the premises were infested with bed bugs and the tenants had been forced to incur personal expense to remedy the problem. They sought to adduce new evidence by affidavit on this point at the appeal. HELD: The Court declined to admit the affidavit evidence about bed bugs. However, the matter was remitted to the hearing officer for rehearing because the reasons provided by the hearing officer were deficient. The Court held that it was impossible to tell whether the hearing officer considered the tenants' evidence at the hearing, made findings of fact in that regard or whether equitable jurisdiction should be invoked in this situation. The reasons are inadequate to allow a meaningful review of the decision.","The tenants appeal the decision of a hearing officer under s. 72 of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006. They contend the hearing officer, who rendered her decision on May 31, 2012, committed several errors of law and seek to have the matter remitted back for re-hearing. HELD: The appeal is allowed. The decision of the hearing officers is set aside and the matter is remitted to the hearing office for a re-examination. The reasons for the appeal are inadequate to allow for meaningful review of the decision and for this reason the matter must be remitted. The simple fact tenant's application is not formally before a hearing hearing officer at the same time as landlord's does not bar hearing officer from either considering the facts put forth by the tenant (provided they relate to the landlord's dispute) nor to give effect to the tenant's facts and arguments in rendering decision and formulating an appropriate order. The tenants do not dispute that rent is owing, they contend an infestation of bed bugs in the residential premises has made it uninhabitable and forced them to incur personal expense to address this problem. The tenant's claim for non-payment of rent has been established and in fashioning an appropriate remedy the hearing hearing hearing the tenant failed to take into account the alleged bed bug infestation, associated problems and expenses incurred. The Court found the reasons inadequate to permit for meaningful analysis of the appeal and for that reason the issue must be returned to the Hearing officer for rehearing on a new hearing."
b_2013skqb265.txt,"The appellant landlord appealed a decision of the Residential Tenancies hearing officer. The tenancy in question had commenced in April 2012. On September 18, the tenant had given six weeks' notice of her intention to terminate the tenancy. The term of the lease stated that it was for a term of 12 months (April 2012 to March 2013) and continuing thereafter from month to month until one of the parties gave one month's notice. The appellant did not try to rent the premises following receipt of the notice because he had decided to furnish the unit prior to re-renting. He spent $15,000 doing so and advertised the unit in mid-January, increasing the rent by $400 and obtained a new tenant as at February 1. Although it is not stated what relief the landlord sought from the Office of Residential Tenancies, the hearing officer stated in the decision that the lease was a month-to-month tenancy. The appellant argued that the hearing officer made errors in law in that he 1) misinterpreted s. 19(1)(g)(iii) of the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 in making that finding, as the lease was for a fixed term; and 2) misinterpreted s. 8(2) of the Act in finding that the landlord's efforts at mitigation were not reasonable within the meaning of the section and the landlord was legally disentitled by s. 8(1) of the Act. HELD: The Court held that the hearing officer had erred in law in finding that the lease was for a month-to-month tenancy. The one-month-notice provision only applied if the tenancy was extended beyond the fixed term. The appeal was allowed on this issue. The Court found that the decision of the landlord to furnish the premises was a business decision, and the result of this decision could not be attributed to the tenant. The Court dismissed the appellant's claim for loss.","The appellant landlord appeals a decision of the Residential Tenancies hearing officer on two questions of law. The hearing officer misinterpreted ss. 19(1)(g)(iii) of the Act in finding the tenancy agreement was not a fixed term agreement and that the landlord is legally disentitled to compensation pursuant to s. 8(1) of The Residential Tenancy Act. HELD: 1) The appellant landlord appealed a decision made by the hearing officer in finding that a month-to-month tenancy would follow the primary fixed term negated a fixed one. The one-month notice provision referred to in the term of the lease was applicable only if the tenancy was extended to a month to month tenancy following the end of the fixed term.  2) The Hearing Officer erred in law in holding that the fact a month was followed by a monthly tenancy negated the primary term. The 1 month notice provision is applicable only in the context of the respondent's early notice of termination of the tenancy. The respondent vacated the unit on or about October 30, 2012. The monthly rental was $21. The appellant did not advertise the unit for rent until the middle of January 2013 and obtained a new tenant effective February 1, 2013 at $2500 per month."
b_2013skqb395.txt,HELD: The Court found the accused guilty of 10 counts and 7 counts were dismissed.,"The accused was charged with 14 counts of indecent assault and three counts of gross indecency against 14 individuals, all of whom were boys who attended the residential school between January 1, 1959 and December 31, 1967. The residential school was located at Beauval in the Province of Saskatchewan. The accused was considered the golden-haired boy of the priests and nuns and was very popular with the boys at the school. He developed the intermural hockey, competitive fastball and softball teams, and the Warriors, which was the regional champion hockey team through most of the years. The court was required to take into account the potential distraction of the trier of fact from its proper focus on the facts charged, and to allow the evidence of all 14 complainants to apply to all 17 charges. The issue in this case is not identification but the actus reus of the offence. The point is not that the degree of similarity in such case must be higher or lower than in an identification case. It is rather that the trial judge should evaluate the degree and extent of the similarity of the alleged acts and decide whether the objective improbability of coincidence has been established. The relative importance of the issue in the particular trial may also have bearing on the weighing up of factors for and against admissibility. The issues in question are not identification, but the acts which occurred in their childhood often become embellished and distorted and blamed for many of our personal shortcomings or personal failures later in life. The degree of similarities between the similar facts and the offences alleged is far too high. The Court reserved its decision respecting the application and undertook to render decision on this issue at the time of its final judgment."
b_2013skqb407.txt,"HELD: The Court held that the cause of the damage was high humidity in the building caused by water leaking into it from the roof. The failure of the tenant to maintain the floor caused approximately 25 percent of the damage to the floor. The estimated span for the flooring was 20 years. As the lease was in good standing at present and would expire in 2018, the age of the floor at that time would be 17 years. The Court awarded to the landlord the amount of $836, which was 25 percent of 3/20 of the damages claimed. The business loss claimed by the tenant was $4,800. Thus the net setoff owing by the landlord to the tenant was $4,800 less $836. The defendant tenant was awarded costs of the three-day trial of $2,500.","The landlord claims damages for negligence by failing to clean, wax and polish the vinyl tile floor in the building, thereby permitting moisture to penetrate between and underneath the tiles resulting in losses to the tenant's restaurant. The tenant also claims economic interference, alleging the landlord interfered with the sale of its restaurant. HELD: The tenant is awarded judgment against the landlord in the amount of $6,464. The damage to the floor is $22,281 and the tenant is contributorily negligent to the extent of 25% of the damage. Leaking of water through the ceiling onto the floor did necessitate closure of the restaurant but the tenant has given Notice of Intention to Renew the Lease to the landlord. Although the evidence shows that excessive moisture and high humidity within the building undermined the subfloor, causing instability and resulting in lifting and cracking of the vinyl floor tiles, the evidence does not show that a part, but only a small part, of the moisture entering into the basement was due to the negligence of the tenant in failing to properly maintain the floor. The evidence does show that negligence was not the sole cause of the problems with the flooring but was caused by structural defects for which the landlord is responsible. The tenants claim damages for economic interference as the tenant may set off the judgment against base monthly rent of $7,700 as specified in clause 8(b) of the lease."

The mother and father both suffered from addictions and had stopped living together by the time the child was born. The father had multiple criminal convictions, including drinking and driving offences and weapons offences. The mother’s relationship with her parents, family support worker and child protection worker during the course of the child’s life had been marked by volatility, argumentative behaviour and threats, one of which resulted in criminal harassment charges. The child was the subject of a protection order, which imposed conditions upon his parents. Neither meaningfully complied with the conditions set out in the protection order. Both parents testified at trial that their present circumstances were not suitable to raise a child. Each expressed intention to take steps necessary to provide a home for the child. Each parent asserted that a temporary order was appropriate. | HELD: The child was placed in the custody of his grandparents on an indefinite basis, which, while not temporary, was not as potentially immutable as a permanent order. That the child was in need of protection was not seriously challenged by either his mother or father. The prospect for change at the time of trial was limited to statements of good intentions. On their own, such statements were insufficient. There were opportunities for the parents to demonstrate a reasonable prospect for change.

The accused, a status Indian with Aboriginal and Treaty 10 rights, was fishing for food. He had used a net in the restricted area and had caught eight suckers, two walleye and one northern pike. The Bay was very close to the residence of the accused on the Canoe Lake First Nation and was his preferred area to fish. The remainder of Canoe Lake was subject to restrictions governing all fishing but open to unlimited Treaty sustenance fishing all year round. The accused admitted to the actus reus of the offence. Under the Constitutional Questions Act, 2012 the accused gave notice that he would argue that s. 7(2)(b) of the regulations was invalid because it restricted his Treaty and Aboriginal right to fish food in the restricted area as defined by the Regulations; infringed his Treaty and Aboriginal right to fish for food as protected by s. 35(1) of the Constitution Act, 1982; and infringed his Treaty and Aboriginal right to fish for food as protected by s. 25 of the Charter of Rights. The agreed Statement of Facts confirmed the accused’s Aboriginal Treaty status and right to sustenance fishing. The Crown’s major witness was an expert in fish biology and he testified that the restricted area had been closed to protect it for walleye spawning. He stated that the closed area could not be opened for sustenance fishing. The conservation effort had been supported by the Canoe Lake Band Council./n HELD: The accused was found guilty. The court found that the accused had failed to show a breach of his Treaty fishing right that would raise a defence or a Charter remedy to the charge against him: 1) the challenged regulations were within the implied common law limitations on Aboriginal fishing rights; 2) alternatively, the regulations fell within the provisions that permitted such regulations in Treaty 10; 3) alternatively, if they were not within the implied limitations of the right, the evidence had not established a prima facie infringement of the right; 4) alternatively, if there was a breach, it met the justification principles set out in Sparrow and Pierone.","The accused was charged with fishing for or for sustenance in violation of s. 7(2)(b) of the Saskatchewan Fishery Regulations, 1995, made pursuant to The Fisheries Act, 1995.

He put forth as defence his Treaty rights to fish in any water and at any time he so wished. HELD: The accused was found guilty of the actus reus and the charge was stayed. The Court found that the accused was guilty of breaching his Treaty right to sustenance fishing. The court also found that there was no evidence that the respondent had breached his treaty right to fish. The issue was whether the respondent was bound by s.7(2(b)(b)(c)(d)) of the Fisheries Regulations. It was not clear that the Crown had asked the Court to lift the ban.

The Gladue report was considered and the background of the accused was assessed as an enormous mitigating factor. The court found that this was not an appropriate case to make an order pursuant to s. 743.6 of the Code both because of the multiple Gladue factors and because it had addressed the principles of denunciation and deterrence in the global sentence.","HELD: The Court found that a global sentence of 10 years was appropriate for the manslaughter conviction and his guilty plea to possession of a firearm while prohibited from doing so. The Court reviewed the case law as provided by the Crown and defence and found that the factors relevant to the sentence were: 1) the respondent had a lengthy criminal record, had 55 convictions, 17 of which were for violent offences; 2) there were numerous Gladue factors that the Court considered. The respondent was 54 years old at the time of the offence and had 54 previous convictions.

She also held that one cannot ignore the phrase 'pursuant to Article 28 or 26', read it out of existence nor re-write it and that if the words were given their ordinary meaning the interpretation was patently unreasonable. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. 1)The trial judge did not err in concluding the majority decision of the Board of Arbitration was patently unreasonable. Its decision rested upon an interpretation of the collective bargaining agreement that the words of the agreement could not reasonably bear. 2)No material error was found in her analysis in finding that the decision was fundamentally flawed or in her analysis of the phrase 'pursuant to Article 28'. Nor in her identification or application of the governing standard of review. DISSENT: The appeal would have been allowed. 1)There was no dispute that the central issue, the reviewability of the board's interpretation, requires an application of the test prescribed by Shalansky. The Chambers judge did not follow that approach. Once it is accepted that there are two reasonable constructions, the suggestion of a reviewable error of law in consensual arbitration disappears. The decision can only be set aside if it involves an interpretation the words of the agreement could not reasonably bear. The patently unreasonable test is a very strict test. 2)The judge was wrong to use the Melford decision to support her conclusion that the Pool interpretation was the only one which the words of the collective agreement could reasonably bear. 3)Once the ordinary meaning of the words 'pursuant to' must be set aside by reason of their context in Article 16, the decision by an adjudicator to choose either 'for the purposes of' or 'subject to' is motivated more by the result desired rather than by fine legal principles of interpretation. Such policy decisions are better left to arbitrators in the field than to judges.",The Chambers judge found no material error in the Chambers judge's analysis of the majority's approach to the interpretation of the provisions in question. She was of the view that the majority had brushed aside basic grammatical conventions; had proceeded upon a bad principle of construction obviously weighted in favour of the grievance; had disregarded the ordinary meaning of some words; and had violated the terms of the agreement precluding alteration of its provisions including alterations wrought by changing the meaning of any of the words in the course of interpreting its provisions. The resulting interpretation was not necessarily unreasonable.
c_1998canlii13623.txt,"FIAT. The parties were married in 1973 and separated in 1992. The husband petitioned for divorce and corollary relief in 1992. The wife counter-petitioned in 1993 claiming a 'lump sum and periodic spousal support'. An interspousal contract entered into 1993 provided for periodic monthly spousal support of $350. Both acknowledged that they were aware of the nature and effect of the agreement and each had independent legal advice before signing. The husband paid periodic spousal support until December 1995. The applicant sought to vary the 1993 order on the grounds there had been a change in circumstances in that her annual income was currently less than half of what it had been at the time the order was made and her economic hardship could be traced to the breakdown of her marriage primarily because his job had required them to move from place to place during the marriage. HELD: The application was dismissed. 1)The agreement was intended to be final. While the applicant's income had dropped she had not established that she could not be self-sufficient. The terms of the agreement which limited the payment of spousal support to December 1995 appeared to be applicable. The applicant had previously brought a similar variation application even though she earned in excess of $25,000 in 1995. 2)There was no suggestion that the agreement was unfairly negotiated or that she was subjected to undue influence or pressure in any way prior to signing and she had been advised by counsel.  3)Costs sought by the respondent were refused.","FIAT.

c_2000skqb232.txt,"FIAT. The husband seeks to vary the spousal support provisions of the parties' 1975 separation agreement. This agreement held that the sum of $550 (adjusted for inflation) is to be paid to the wife until she dies or remarries, whichever comes first. The applicant paid this amount (except for a unilateral deduction in 1995) for over 25 years. The basis of his application is that he is now retired and earning less income. In addition, the respondent now earns part-time income that she did not have at the time of the agreement. At the time of the agreement, the wife raised the couple's five children and received child support from the applicant. HELD: The application is dismissed with costs to the respondent. The SCC has held that in order for a Court to vary support provisions in a valid settlement, separation agreement or consent order, a material or radical change in circumstances causally connected to the marriage needs to be established. Retirement of one of the parties was reasonably foreseeable at the time they entered into the agreement. It was also foreseeable that retirement income is most often less than employment income. This is not the kind of radical unforeseen change in circumstance required to vary the support. The preamble of the parties' agreement states that they intended it to be a complete and final settlement. The applicant has always earned considerable income and continues to have a better standard of living than the respondent. The respondent's modest income does not provide grounds to vary the agreement as she still has a much lower standard of living that the applicant, even after receiving the spousal support.","FIAT: The divorced husband applies to vary the spousal support provisions contained in a separation agreement between he and the respondent. The agreement clearly expresses the intention of the parties when they made it, namely, that there shall be a complete, final and effective settlement of their respective rights. The retirement of the applicant and the reduction of his income as a consequence is or was reasonably foreseeable at the time the agreement was entered into. The fact it has now occurred is not that kind of radical unforseen change in circumstance required to be established upon the authorities to support the variation application.

c_2002nssc30.txt,"The borrower in a mortgage foreclosure action counterclaimed against the lender and joined the insurer of the mortgage and experts he had retained for advice in the development on the basis of negligent misrepresentation. During discovery of the borrower's former solicitor it was revealed that the solicitor may have given the borrower a warning that the financing arranged was inadequate. No privilege was claimed during the discovery process. The defendant brought an application for production of the solicitor's files and a copy of the borrower's employer and bank records intended to show his familiarity with business and financial affairs. Application allowed in part; solicitor's files with respect to terms of solicitor's retainer and non-legal advice or services are to be produced; employer's and banker's records not to be produced. The claim of negligent misrepresentation raised the question of reliance; evidence of knowledge would go to the borrower's state of mind and the solicitor's warning, if timely, would be relevant. The conduct of the borrower's present counsel in making no objection at the discovery amounted to waiver. There were no special circumstances existing with respect to the employer's and bank's records; the applicant made no effort to obtain the records until too late and the documents would have little, if any, relevance.",HELD: The court found that the plaintiff had waived its right to a solicitor-client privilege by making voluntary disclosure or consented to disclosure of documents sought by the defendants.

The Young Person was unrepresented and had no prior notice of the application. The Provincial Director had not yet considered conditions of supervision in the community. HELD: The young person was released pending a full hearing. The court found that the trial judge had not properly considered the factors that led him to conclude that the young person had a serious risk of re-offending. The Court found that there was a marked departure from previous experience under the Young Offenders Act. The new Act provides for a period of time when the hearing cannot be heard prior to the expiry of the child portion of the sentence and must be considered when answering the question, “Are there compelling reasons for keeping the youth in custody?”. The young Person had achieved some success while in custody. However, the Court found there was some awkwardness in the legislation because the conditions for supervision in custody and the supervision sentence are determined by the provincial director.

The solicitors brought a motion for non-suit pursuant to Queen's Bench Rule 278A. HELD: The motion for a non-suit was granted. The claim was dismissed. Although given an opportunity, the plaintiff failed to call expert evidence respecting the elements of negligence including the duty of care, standard of care, breach of the duty of care or causation.

The plaintiff elected trial by judge and jury and to be self-represented. The trial began April 21, 2003. HELD: 1) The plaintiff presented no evidence upon the fundamental legal issues to assist the jury in their prospective deliberations and ultimate verdict. 2) The court found that the standard of care imposed upon lawyers undertaking the task of representing a client in her circumstances was not one which the jury could decide without the aid of expert evidence. 3) The Court found that an expert to provide opinion evidence to the jury either with respect to the standard established by the evidence itself or with regard to the application and alleged breach of that duty of care by the defendants was not an issue which the trial judge could decide on. The Court concluded that the test for non-suit in negligence cases is not a matter of convenience or choice for the plaintiff. It is a test which a jury acting judicially could make. The test for negligence in professional negligence is not 'any evidence' but'sufficient evidence'.

In the context of the certiorari application, the company president successfully argued that the Commission's return should contain the fruits of the investigation so far and that he should be entitled to examine one of the investigators for discovery. The Commission appealed, arguing that the underlying judicial review application was improper and premature and thus, the procedural orders should not have been made. Appeal allowed; the underlying judicial review application is stayed; the stay may be lifted by a judge of the Supreme Court on application with notice; the Order of the chambers judge on the procedural matters arising in that application is set aside. The underlying judicial review application was premature because the Commission should have had the opportunity to consider and address the company president's complaints.

HELD: The appeal is allowed, the conviction is quashed and a verdict of acquittal is entered.  1) The court reviewed in detail the steps the appellant had in place. 2) The court was of the view that the trial judge erred in applying an unreasonably high standard for this defence. The trial judge applied a standard of due diligence that required the appellant to be able to prove that there were no other possible precautions or action that could have been taken to prevent the company's cashiers from selling cigarettes. This standard exceeds the requirements of a reasonable person. By applying a higher standard of due diligence, the trial judge erred in law.

c_2008skca28.txt,"The appellant agreed to buy a two-story condominium unit from the respondent developer. The building permit had not been obtained, nor had condominium titles been raised at the time the sale agreement was entered into. In the course of construction the respondent opted not to proceed with the two-story unit, revising it to a single story unit which was offered to the appellant. The appellant did not accept the offer, and registered a miscellaneous interest against the title to the entire parcel of land. The appellant sues for specific performance of the agreement and in the alternative, damages. The developer succeeded in obtaining a court order discharging the miscellaneous interest. The Court's jurisdiction to hear the appeal is found in s. 111 of The Land Titles Act, 2000. The issue is whether the appellant possessed an interest in land so as to support the registration of a miscellaneous interest. HELD: Appeal dismissed.  1) Before a condominium plan as defined in The Condominium Property Act, 1993 comes into being, there is nothing in the Act which directly or inferentially entertains the prospect that a purchase of a 'proposed unit' can constitute an interest in land, or a registrable interest for the purposes of s. 50 of The Land Titles Act, 2000. 2) The Act expressly prohibits the registration of any charge against the common property. The appellant is not entitled to rest his claim to a registrable interest in the surface parcel on the basis of a notional claim to rights in 'common property'. Common property, by definition, does not come into existence until the condominium plan comes into effect. 3) For the purposes of s. 50 of The Land Titles Act, 2000, the appellant had no basis in law, or under The Condominium Property Act, 1993 for asserting an interest against the surface parcel owned by the respondent.","The appellant agreed to purchase a two-storey condominium unit (Units and 6) from the respondent developer.

The respondent later sold the project to third party purchasers for $300,000. HELD: The appeal was dismissed with costs. The Chambers judge did not err in the result as the appellant at no time possessed a registrable interest in the surface parcel. It is unnecessary to address the issue whether specific performance was available. The agreement for the sale of the unit was frustrated by supervening events. There is nothing in the Chambers judge's order or her reasons that either expressly, or by necessary implication, disposes of that question. The issue of frustration was not before the Court in any event. For the purposes of s. 50 of The Land Titles Act, 2000, the appellant had no basis in law, or under the Condominium Property Act, 1993, for asserting an interest against the surface property."
c_2009skpc31.txt,"The accused, Chisum Log Homes and its sole director Gary Varga, are charged with operating a processing facility without a licence contrary to s. 18.1(1) of The Forest Resources Management Act. The accused corporation assembles log home packages. The packages are sold to customers across Canada. The accused corporation buys wood from area operators such as L&amp;M to be used in its packages. L&amp;M through its contractor P&amp;E, harvest wood from the forest and sell the wood to pulp mills, saw mills and other customers such as the accused. These area operators and their contractors have Forest Management Agreements and Forest Product Processing Facility Licences. In August and September 2007, the area operator L&amp;M delivered logs to the accused. The accused took additional steps to prepare the logs for inclusion in their log home packages which they sold. The accused does not have a Forest Product Processing Facility Licence. The issue in this case is whether the Crown has shown that the accused requires such a licence. HELD: 1) The definition of 'manufacture' in the Act is extremely broad as it says, 'means any step taken'. Given this definition is not difficult to find based on the evidence presented that the steps taken by the contractor in cutting the logs is more than simply harvesting as it is defined in the legislation. See R. v. Provincial Forest Products, 2000 SKQB 371. 2) The Court is satisfied that the accused corporation, Chisum, took steps to manufacture the forest product for the log home market. Steps such as debarking were steps taken in the manufacture of a forest product for market.  3) Given the wide definition it is the Court's view that many facilities, including a retail lumberyard, could be captured within the definition. Given the stated purpose of the Act, it is appropriate that the requirement for a Processing Facility Licence be restricted so that it does not apply to every entity that manufactures a forest product. 4) The processes Chisum is involved in encompass the substantial conversion of the forest product into logs to be used in the log home industry. The process is not insignificant, nor is it a process which is removed from the sustainable use of forest lands and the need to maintain and enhance the health of forest lands. The Court concludes that Chisum was required to have a Processing Facility Licence. 5) Pursuant to s. 81 of the Act, Gary Varga, as President of Chisum, is also guilty of violating s. 18.1 of the Act.","The defendant, Chisum Log Homes and Lumber Ltd., was charged with operating a processing facility without a licence contrary to s. 18.1(1) of The Forest Resources Management Act. The defendant did not have a Forest Product Processing Facility Licence. HELD: The defendant was required to have a Processing Facility License. The issue was whether the Crown has shown that Chisums requires such a licence. The court found that the process utilized by the defendant was more than simply harvesting as it was defined in the legislation. The process detailed in P-1 encompassed the substantial conversion of the forest product into logs to be used in the log home industry. The logs delivered to the defendant were cut as logs used for log homes and were not true tree length. The processing facility was not a retail lumber yard but rather a logging facility.

c_2009skqb433.txt,"The Ministry seeks an order under s. 37(2) which is a permanent committal and is a precursor to the boys Michael and David being placed for adoption. Art and Laura, the maternal grandparents oppose the application and want the boys returned to their care. The mother, Melody, supported her parent's application for custody. HELD: The boys are in need of protection and there is an order placing the boys in the permanent care of the Minister. As long as the boys are in foster care, the Ministry will make arrangements for the boys to have regular access to their mother and to Art and Laura.  1) There is no doubt but that Art and Laura love and wish the best for the boys. However, there are real concerns about Art and Laura' familial context. There is the fact that Art and Laura's own children were apprehended in 1989 and committed to the Minister. It is pertinent to note Art and Laura are estranged from four of their six children.  Two of Art's children claim he sexually assaulted them. When Melody testified she said her first preference was that the boys be placed with Mary Stevens, their foster parent, but did acknowledge that the boys would be in good hands with Art and Laura. 2) While the Court accepts that the Stevens home is a positive and nurturing one, there is no question it is not an ideal physical place for 9 people. With organization, routine and discipline however, it can function at a satisfactory level. Further, if an order is made under s. 37(2), the boys have the opportunity to be adopted. The Court cannot lightly preclude that possibility.","HELD: The Court found that the boys were placed for adoption pursuant to s. 37(2) of the Child and Family Services Act. The Ministry sought an order under s.37(2)(a) which is a permanent committal and is a precursor to the boys being placed for adoptions. The Court ordered the boys to stay with the Stevens home. The Family Services worker responsible for the Ministry of Social Services (MSS) concerns for the boys was a permanent custodian. The children had special needs of some sort, even high needs. The mother of the boys, who had been sexually assaulted by her step-sister, indicated that she supported her parents' application for custody. HELD: 1) The Court determined that the children should be apprehended from Art and Laura and that a long-term order placing the child in the custody of the Minister until the age of 18. The court found that there was no evidence that the accused posed a risk to the children. It was also concluded that the Court had a moral and legal duty to ensure that foster homes had the necessary physical requirements to properly care for the children placed in such a home. This was a somewhat unorthodox household, insofar as the accused regularly walked around naked, as did the mother, and there were no touching surfaces. The physical plant of the foster home must present some challenges. However, the Court concluded the children were doing well at school and were improving from where they were at under the mother's care. 2) The court ordered the removal of the children from Art's care and ordered the placement of them with the Minister. The Children and Family Service worker responsible to the Family Services (FS) referred to them by the pseudonyms and to other players simply by initials. 3) The Family Service Worker responsible for MSS referred to the files that dealt with the boys as being of the 'best interests' standard. The best interests standard was necessarily an individualistic approach as explained in A.C. v. Manitoba (Director Child andFamily Services), 2009 SCC 30 (CanLII). The Court concluded that it had a duty to look firstly at the Criminal Code convictions and the parenting of children for a short period of time. Although the Court was of the view that an adoption plan was unlikely due to reasons such as the age and other circumstances, it may make a long term order placing them in the child's custody until age 18."
c_2009skqb514.txt,"FIAT: The respondent mother filed a motion asking for an order quantifying child support arrears which she claims are due and owing pursuant to the order of Gunn, J. in September, 2008. She also asks that the Court determine the ongoing child support amount to be paid by the petitioner father. The Court questioned whether this application was more in the nature of a variation of the Gunn, J. order. It is clear that there has been a change since September 2008 with respect to the residency of one of the children.HELD: 1) The father's unusual 2008 taxation year has led to the parties taking very different positions as to how the father's income should be calculated. The father argues that it would be appropriate to average the father's income for 2006 to 2008. The mother argues that his income is the sum set out on line 150 of his tax return. She argues that his total income is the sum of $302,196 for the 2008 year. The father's argument is that the severance he received in 2008 should not be included in his income. It is well established that severance pay represents an acceleration of income that would have been paid over a period of months. It is also well established that income for the basis of calculating child support should be determined on the basis of severance pay plus whatever other earnings the payor may have. The severance is included as part of the father's income. 2) The capital gain which shows on the father's 2008 income tax return shall not be included in his 2008 income. The father agreed as part of the distribution of family income to assume responsibility for the capital gain on the real estate he was receiving as part of the family property division. The gain does not reflect income actually received by the father and there will be no 'year to year' capital gains. See Andersen v. Andersen (1997), 32 R.F.L. (4th) 177. 3) The father's income for 2008 is $270,300.  4) If the parties were to proceed in accordance with their own agreement and consent order, the father would be forced to pay on his inflated 2008 income. However, the mother would then be forced to pay back to the father the overpayment. As of May 2009 the father's income is the sum of $160,000. 5) The mother shall have her costs of $600.","The mother has filed a motion requesting an order quantifying child support arrears which she says are due and owing pursuant to the Gunn J. order. HELD: 1) The respondent father is to pay the child support of $19,721.97.  2) The father spent his severance funds on legal fees and to set up his new home in Alberta. The severance is included as part of the father's income.  3) With respect to the capital gain shown on the father’s 2008 income tax return, I have determined that the Capital gain is a non-reoccurring amount which should not be included in the fathers 2008 Income Tax Return. It is well established that income for the basis of calculating child support should be determined on the basis the severance package pay plus whatever other earnings the payor may have."
c_2011skpc61.txt,"The accused was subject to a hearing to determine whether he was fit to stand trial on charges under the Criminal Code. The accused was grossly lacking in mental abilities, had limited and basic comprehension, had the mental capacity of a young child and these facts were not likely to change anytime soon. The accused had extreme difficulty paying attention to the court proceedings and appeared incapable of doing so. He played with toys in the prisoner's box, paced around and pestered the deputy sheriff sitting with him for much of the proceeding.HELD: The accused was incapable of paying attention to the court proceeding or participating in a meaningful way because of his mental disability. The accused said that his lawyer was the judge, could not answer when asked what the judge's role was and he had limited insight into why he was in Court. The accused met the portion of the limited cognitive capacity test which requires an understanding of the nature of the proceedings and their possible consequences and the accused is capable of communicating his version of the events surrounding the allegations, but there is no possibility he could participate in a meaningful way in the trial. According to R. v. Jobb, the limited cognitive capacity test does not require that an accused be able to make rational decisions beneficial to himself, the Court's inquiry is limited to whether an accused can recount to their counsel the necessary facts of the offence to present a defence. The accused in this case was found fit to stand trial because he had a memory of what happened during the alleged offence despite having virtually no ability to participate in the proceeding.","The accused was found unfit to stand trial for various offences. The Court of Appeal held that the accused had a limited cognitive capacity and that he was unable to participate in the trial in a meaningful way. The court found that the test for fitness to stand was 'limited cognitive capacity'. The Court found that, under quiet and controlled circumstances in a prisoner's dock, the accused was able to maintain sufficient focus to answer satisfactorily their questions. The accused was also found to have a major problem with his ability to communicate with counsel. The test for 'limited' capacity was'simply not fit to stand' and the Court of Appeals concluded that the Court would not find the accused fit to participate. The only conclusion the Court could draw from the evidence was that the court would not be able to make a determination on the basis of the evidence. The conclusion the court could not make was that, given the accused's previous record of mental health problems, he might not be fit for the trial."

The plaintiff discovered that one of the defendants had shares being held at the defendants' solicitor's office and instructions were given to the sheriff to seize and sell the shares. The sheriff attended to seize the shares but the defendants' lawyer objected. At issue was whether the legal office could refuse to hand over the shares to the sheriff pursuant to a solicitor's lien and whether the shares were exempt from seizure pursuant to the Saskatchewan Farm Security Act. HELD: The law firm was ordered to produce and deliver to the sheriff the shares of the defendant in the third corporation; costs were fixed at $750. 1) The right of the law office to refuse to produce and deliver the shares to the sheriff had not been made out and court process was thwarted. There was no evidence to determine the amount owing from the defendant or the third corporation for legal work; a valid solicitor's lien was not demonstrated. 2) There is a difference between the seizure and sale of shares in a company and the seizure and sale of a piece of farmland and the argument that the Executions Act or the Saskatchewan Farm Security Act restricts the seizure fails.,"FIAT. The court sought an order from the Saskatchewan Court of Appeal requiring the legal office of Eggum, Abrametz and Eggum to produce to the sheriff of Prince Albert, the shares owned by Jensen pursuant to the June 5, 2001 writ of execution. HELD: The court held a solicitor's lien against the shares of Jensen held in Jen-Sim Cattle Co. Ltd., for indebtedness to the plaintiff and for which he held his said share certificate as security. It ordered the solicitor to produce the shares within seven days of service of the order compelling production of the shares. It also ordered the law firm to produce and deliver to the court the shares to be held by the sheriff pursuant to a solicitor’s lien. Given the totality of what is before the court, the general rule that a solicitor may have lien on a deed for his costs, yet if his client is bound to produce it for the benefit of a third person, so also must the solicitor. There is no such restriction in the Executions Act nor in the Saskatchewan Farm Security Act. The right is only as between his client and him."
c_2011skqb478.txt,"The accused was found guilty of possession of cocaine for the purpose of trafficking and possession of marijuana for the purpose of trafficking contrary to s. 5(3)(a) the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act, and having in his possession cash (almost $30,000) knowing it was obtained through the commission of an offence contrary to s. 354 and 355(a) of the Criminal Code. At issue was the accused's sentence. The Crown sought a global sentence of 5 years plus a forfeiture order of items seized, a fine in lieu of forfeiture for all cash used for legal fees, a mandatory weapons prohibition and sought bodily substances for DNA analysis. As the accused had been denied bail and had pre- trial detention of 15 months and 24 days, the defence sought one and one-half times credit for time served on remand.HELD: The accused had 9 prior drug convictions since 1999, two for trafficking in 2000 for which he received a 12 month sentence of incarceration and, in 2007, one trafficking and conspiracy to traffic which resulted in his receiving a 5 year penitentiary sentence. As the accused had been a compliant prisoner on remand, the Court granted him credit for 1.5 days for each day spent on remand for a total of 23 months and 21 days credit. The Court imposed a sentence of 30 months imprisonment, and ordered a DNA sample as well as a fine in lieu of forfeiture in the sum of $16,326 (being the sum transferred to the accused's legal counsel to pay his legal fees) to be paid within 60 days and, in default of payment, a term of imprisonment of 6 months consecutive to the term of imprisonment otherwise imposed.","The accused was found guilty of three counts contained in an Amended Indictment dated December 12, 2011. The accused had been in custody since he was arrested and was charged with trafficking. The offences occurred when he was in possession of cocaine and marijuana for the purposes of trafficking. He was also convicted of possession of marijuana. HELD: 1) The Court found that the accused was a compliant prisoner, had no disciplinary issues or problems while on remand and qualified for a reduction in his sentence for good behaviour. The Court also gave the accused credit of one and one-half days for each day he spent in custody. 2) The court found that it would not be appropriate to impose an overall sentence less than two years in the circumstances of this case or this offender. 3) The accused's deposition that he was a 'professional drug dealer' and that he would have qualified, had he been in the regular prison population, for a one-third reduction in the sentence for the current offences."

The plaintiffs terminated the contract believing the defendant's workmanship was poor and that he caused some damage to their home and created a mess. The plaintiffs sued the defendant alleging damages. The defendant counterclaimed the cost of the work completed but for which he was not paid and compensation for the lost use of his tools. HELD: The Court granted judgment for damages in the amount of $3,822 for necessary repairs and $100 for cleaning expenses and granted the counter-claim in the amount of $580 for unpaid work performed by the defendant and then applied setoff. The Court allowed the cost of issuing the claim and for reasonable cost of service.","The plaintiffs claim their damages are $5,975.95 but acknowledge they owe the defendant for the removal of a bedroom wall.

He states he performed a portion of the work but was not allowed to finish the job or clean up. The plaintiffs are entitled to judgment against the defendant in the amount of $3,342.00 for the necessary repairs and $100 for cleaning. 3) The plaintiffs claim the defendant's costs incidental to the Court action, including the cost of issuing the claim, service, postage, photographs, witness fees, mileage and parking to attend Court. The court declines to allow the counterclaim. 4) In the circumstances, the defendant was found to have caused some damage to the plaintiffs' home and created a mess for the plaintiffs to clean. 5) The defendant is awarded judgment for $5.975 for the plaintiff's unpaid work. The plaintiff's claim is reduced by 10% or $294.00. 6) The court finds the defendant to be guilty of breach of contract and negligence in that the plaintiff was not properly compensated for the work done. The defendant's conduct constituted breach of the contract and negligent. The doctrine of betterment precludes the plaintiffs from being fully compensated for new countertops of greater value than the one which depreciated over time as the obligation for which was on the defendant. The Court will assess a nominal discount of 10% of the cost to the plaintiff."
c_2012skqb372.txt,"The plaintiff purchased insurance from the defendant. In 2000, the plaintiff's farm was damaged by a fire. He commenced an action against Wawanesa Insurance Company in 2001. In 2006, the plaintiff commenced an action against the defendant, alleging that the defendant was in breach of contract or negligent for failing to obtain full replacement value insurance coverage for the plaintiff. The defendant filed his defence in April 2007. Mediation took place in September 2010 and examinations for discovery were held in May 2011. At that time, the defendant asked the plaintiff to disclose the amount recovered in the Wawanesa lawsuit and the plaintiff refused. The defendant brought this application for relief that: 1) The plaintiff's action be dismissed for want of prosecution; or 2) The plaintiff be required to disclose the amount recovered in the other lawsuit. The defendant argued that the delays between the issuance of the statement of claim to the examination for discovery and then the delay between the time of mediation to May 2012 when the plaintiff's counsel filed the reply to undertakings were both inordinate.HELD: The Court applied the test established in International Capitol Corp. v. Robinson Twigg &amp; Ketilson to determine whether or not a matter should be struck for want of prosecution. The Court found that the first delay was inordinate but because the plaintiff and defendant both acknowledged that the action against the defendant would only proceed depending on the outcome of the claim against Wawanesa, the delay was excusable. The Court found that the second delay was excessive, but was not sufficient to strike the claim on that basis. Applying the factors provided in Capitol, the Court found:1. Stage of litigation: It did not occur at an early stage of the litigation as the matter could well go to pre-trial conference. 2. Impact of delay: The delay was not causing any problems for the defendant. 3. The context in which the delay occurred: the delay in question was actually only one year during which the plaintiff's counsel did not respond in a timely fashion to undertakings. 4. Reasons offered for delay: Counsel was busy and it had to determine which undertaking could or could not be answered. 5. The role of counsel in causing the delay: The Court held that the delay caused by the plaintiff's counsel should not be a reason to deprive the plaintiff of his claim for actions beyond his control. The Court denied the application to strike the plaintiff's claim but ordered that the plaintiff disclose the amount obtained in the Wawanesa action on the basis that this case fell into the exception to the policy which protects settlement communications. Here, the communications sought by the defendant were relevant and necessary to avoid double recovery.","FIAT: The applicant brings an application for relief in the alternative. HELD: The Court of Appeal has set out the principles for determining whether or not matter should be struck for want of prosecution in the case of International Capital Corp. v. Robinson Twigg Ketilson. The court found that the delay from May 2000 to May 2012 was a delay of 1 year and solely on the head of counsel for the plaintiff for not responding in a timely fashion to the undertakings. As examinations for discovery are completed this matter is at a point where it could lead the court on its own to strike. The amount of settlement amounts arrived at in the minutes of settlement be disclosed. The Court found the delay was inordinate but excusable. The plaintiff's action could form the basis of a disclosure order in this case should the trial judge ultimately determine that the communications sought here were relevant and necessary to avoid double recovery. The delay was inexcusable. The defendant has made its case and ordered those specific amounts for each structure for which Wawanesa settled its claim to be disclosed to the court. The stage of litigation is at which it could well go to pre-trial conference. The public policy behind settlement privilege is compelling one. It is so compelling that even threats arising in the context of settlement negotiations may not justify an exception. As the defendant is retired from active business, this delay is not causing him any professional embarrassment or damage to reputation. This is not matter that is in the public's eye and therefore very few people would even know that it is currently in existence. The context in which the delay occurred is inordinate. The length of the delay is simply be the one-year period that it took the plaintiff's counsel to respond to the undertaking. While one year is an excessive period of time it is not such as to lead me to the position that this claim should be strike on that basis. The Stage of litigation"
c_2013skqb155.txt,"The Crown appealed a decision of the Provincial Court dismissing an application for a recognizance pursuant to s. 810.2 of the Criminal Code. The judge held that the usual rules of evidence pertaining to criminal trials apply to a s. 810.2 hearing and that records kept by the Correctional Services of Canada (CSC) were inadmissible as business records under s. 30 of the Canada Evidence Act. The respondent had been convicted in 2009 of robbery with violence, assault causing bodily harm, assault and three counts of violating bail. He was sentenced to three years' imprisonment. In May 2010, the CSC referred the respondent's case to the National Parole Board (NPB) with a recommendation that he be detained until warrant expiry, in accordance with s. 129(2) of the Corrections and Conditional Release Act (CCRA). The recommendation was based upon the character of the respondent's offences and where there are reasonable grounds to believe that the offender is likely to commit another offence causing death or serious harm if released on parole. The NPB ordered that the respondent be detained in custody until the expiry of the sentence. Reviewed annually under the CCRA, the CSC prepared another assessment in 2011 and the respondent was not released from custody until March 2012. At that point, a 'warrant expiry package' was prepared by a parole officer, comprised of CSC records relating to the respondent, including a criminal profile report, the assessment for decision reports and copies of the NPB's reasons for ordering detention. These records were sent to the RCMP in Saskatchewan. The officer concerned then swore the information under s. 810.2, stating that he believed that there were reasonable grounds to believe that the respondent would commit a serious personal offence as defined by s. 752 of the Code. The application for a hearing was commenced in August 2012. The parole officer and the RCMP officer were called to testify and the Crown applied to have the documents in the package admitted into evidence, and the respondent opposed the application. The judge refused to allow the admission of the report, the assessment and the NPB reasons for ordering detention based upon R. v. Fontaine and R. v. Toulejour. Based on the business rules exception, the judge held that the criminal report profile was inadmissible because it was a copy and not accompanied by supporting affidavits as required by s. 30(3) of the CEA. HELD: The Court held that the application was allowed. The Supreme Court had confirmed that s. 810 hearings are not criminal trials and that the rules of evidence in criminal trials do not apply. Hearsay evidence is admissible and the judge is to determine whether or not sufficient weight can be given to the hearsay evidence to establish reasonable and probable grounds required for the individual to swear the information to justify the fear of harm to others by the respondent. The Court held that all of the CSC records submitted as part of the package were admissible under the CEA. The Court directed that the matter be returned for a new hearing of the original application.",This is an appeal from the decision of the Provincial Court dismissing an application for a recognizance pursuant to s. 810.2 of the Criminal Code. The issue is whether the usual rules of evidence apply to a criminal trial. HELD: The appeal is dismissed. The court found that the usual rule of evidence pertaining to criminal trials did apply and that hearsay evidence was inadmissible. The Court held that the Crown did not call the authors of the reports nor did defence seek to cross-examine them. The Crown did call the respondents to identify the contents of the warrant expiry package as CSC records and to testify about some of those documents. The respondent was not released from custody until the sentence expired in March 2012. 1) The Court found that s. 723 hearings are not criminal trials. It held that records kept by the Correctional Service of Canada (CSC) were admissible as business records under s. 30 of the Canada Evidence Act. 2) There was no evidence that the respondent actually feared personal injury or that there were reasonable grounds for the fear of harm to others by the informant. The evidence was found to be credible and trustworthy. 3) The court held that s810 hearings were not criminal trial proceedings. The standard of proof for the trier of fact was correctness on a question of law and the standard of review was correctness.

A report by Back-Track Investigations and Special Services Ltd. (Back-Track) supports the Plaintiff's belief that damage occurred to their back yard lawn was caused by run-off and/or leaching of a substance from the alley. However, the onus is not on the Plaintiff to prove his claim on a balance of probabilities and this involves proving that Statchuk was responsible for killing their lawn. For the reasons stated, the Plaintiff has not done so. HELD: The Plaintiff's claim is dismissed. The onus on the Defendant to prove its claim is on the plaintiff to prove that the defendant was responsible. This involves proving the defendant is responsible for the damage.

d_1991canlii2552.txt,"The appellant, which was a wholly owned subsidiary of a major international company, induced the respondent to enter a franchise agreement by making representations as to the viability of the venture. The appellant sought to recover its losses from the respondent and relied on an exclusionary clause. Allowing the appeal in part, that (1) the agreement was unconscionable, having regard to the unequal bargaining power of the parties, the fact that the agreement was prepared by the appellant, and the fact that the appellant induced the respondent with its promotional brochure and its verbal representations as to the venture's viability to enter the franchise agreement; (2) the appellant cannot rely on an exclusionary clause given its unconscionable conduct; and (3) the appellant's claim for the value of the inventory together with pre-judgment interest was payable by the respondent. In a dissenting opinion, it was held that neither the appellant's conduct nor the franchise agreement was unconscionable; rather the respondent was an experienced businessman and the representations as to the venture's viability were mere projections, which he should have realized were unreliable.","The appellant was a wholly owned subsidiary of Imperial Oil involved in the distribution and sale of automotive parts and related products. Prior to 1985 that activity, exclusively wholesale, was achieved through a nation wide network of outlets leased from the appellant and operated by agents on commission basis. Those agents were not required to make personal investment nor were they financially responsible for the inventory. The appellant became concerned respecting its position in the market place. For example, the total revenue from sales for the Atlas agency at Yarmouth had declined from $700,000 in the early 1980's to $450,000 during 1983-85. The trial judge found that the projections of the Guarantor were accurate and that they did not display Ritchie's gloomy forecast. The Guarantor was adjudged to recover judgment against the respondent for $206,344."

Allowing the appeal, setting aside the sentence and imposing a sentence of two years in a federal institution, followed by one year probation, with an order prohibiting possession of firearms following release. Although there were some mitigating factors, they were not such as to call for a suspended sentence considering the serious nature of the offence and its prevalence.","The respondent pled guilty to a charge of stealing a sum of money from a convenience store clerk contrary to s. 344 of the Criminal Code. He was sentenced to two years in a federal institution to be followed by probation for 1 year on the terms and conditions set out in the probation order. A probation order was imposed. The Crown now sought leave to appeal and if that be granted, appeals from that sentence. The respondent pled to a robbery charge at a Lower Sackville convenience store at about a time when he was celebrating his 21st birthday. He started off on alcohol and ended up on cocaine. He craved more of the drug. He only obtained $23.00 for his efforts and only succeeded in obtaining $14.00 when he lost his way and sought directions from two men in a parked vehicle. The robbery took place at a nearby gas station. He had grade 11 education, was unemployed and had an admitted drug problem. He informed the trial judge that he wanted help for his addiction problem. The trial judge suspended sentence for three years. The sentence was set aside and in its place a two year federal institution followed probation for one year on terms and condition as set out. A prohibition order under s. 100(1) of the Code should have been imposed.

Decisions on child and spousal maintenance, including costs of access and counselling had been reserved. HELD: 1)The respondent was to pay interim maintenance of $388 per month for the child residing with the mother and $350 per month for interim spousal maintenance. Under the guidelines he would be required to pay $1,165 per month for three children at an income level of $38,000. No abatement was made in view of the petitioner's modest income. 2)The respondent was to assume costs of twice monthly access by the petitioner and counselling costs. 3)The petitioner was to keep the respondent informed of her employment status and revenue. 4)Interim custody and access was to be reviewed July 4/97 if the parties had not settled the matter.","FIAT. The court reserved its decision on the questions of child and spousal maintenance. The petitioner's 1996 income included the following: Employment, Unemployment Insurance benefits, Town councillor's indemnity and $16,197. The respondent's brother had access to additional funds. The shareholders' loan was reduced from $6,400 to $2,549 in 1996. That clearly was to the respondent's benefit ($3,851). In addition, the company advanced the sum of $16.50 to the petitioner's brother and his wife. Given the petitioner was in receipt of unemployment insurance benefits, $1,600 was paid to her by the respondent in 1996 for income splitting purposes.

To justify interference with a will a court must find a failure to provide proper maintenance and support and a moral claim to entitlement. The court must consider the magnitude of the estate, the circumstances of the claimant, the strength of his or her moral claim to a share in the estate, and the situation of others having claims upon the testator.

d_1999skqb276.txt,"FIAT. The plaintiff applied for summary judgment in his claim for dismissal without just cause. The plaintiff was initially hired as body shop foreman but additionally acquired the title of assistant manager. When the body shop manager became ill that work load also fell to the plaintiff. It was during this period that the performance of the plaintiff, described by the defendant as serious misconduct, resulted in his termination. There was no issue of a lack of mitigation as the plaintiff accepted a job with another autobody shop but at a much lower rate of pay. The action was brought pursuant to the simplified procedure outlined in Part 40 of the Rules of Court. HELD: Damages were to be calculated by the parties for the 7 month notice period based on his income and value of benefits over the previous year, less the 6 weeks pay received, and less wages and benefits received from his new employment. Jurisdiction was reserved to hear further evidence should the parties not reach agreement. 1)By using the words 'shall grant judgment unless', Rule 488 requires the presiding judge to grant judgment except in the circumstances outlined in s.488(a)and(b). The test is not whether there is contradictory evidence in the affidavits but whether despite the contradictory evidence the issue(s) can be decided in the absence of cross-examination and it would be otherwise unjust to do so. If the court can assume the defendant's evidence is true and still grant summary judgment there is no genuine need for a trial. 2)As noted in numerous decisions, whether an employer is justified in summarily dismissing an employee is ultimately a question of fact. The plaintiff was not terminated because of poor job performance in performing his contractual duties as foreman and manager but because of his alleged poor performance in doing the job normally assigned to two persons. The employer has the right to expect that employees will not disparage their immediate supervisors or other employees in the course of their employment and certainly not to clients or customers of the employer. The type of conduct here would not justify dismissal the first time it came to the employer's attention if the employee had been guilty of such conduct while performing only his own job function. 'Griping' is not uncommon in the workplace. The case law seems uniform that one or more warnings to an employee must be given before it can be said such activity 'fractures the employment relationship'. The category of misconduct can be said to change from poor attitude to disobedience or insubordination where dismissal results after one or more warnings. 3)The plaintiff was entitled to 7 months notice to reflect the fact that junior management positions are fewer in number and the considerable wage difference between management and non- management positions.  4)The plaintiff was entitled to taxable costs.","FIAT. The plaintiff applies for summary judgment in his claim for dismissal without just cause brought pursuant to the simplified procedure outlined in Part Forty of the Rules of Court. The defendant opposes the application and requests summary trial. HELD: The plaintiff is entitled to enter judgment for the damages which flow from this dismissal without having just cause as set out hereafter. 1) In the case of a person in the plaintiff's position, who occupied a junior managerial position in a very specific industry, the notice period should reflect that management positions are fewer in number than non-management positions, that there is a considerable wage difference between a management position and a non-manager one. 2) Taking all factors into account, the plaintiff was awarded an appropriate notice period of seven months. Taking all of the factors into consideration, the Court concluded that this was an appropriate time to consider. 3) In this case the alleged misconduct of the plaintiff would have justified him being warned to not continue such conduct, but it falls far short of conduct justifying cause for termination. The employer has the right to expect that employees will not disparage their immediate supervisors or other employees in the course of their employment, and certainly not to clients or customers of the employer. However, griping is not exactly unusual in a work place, and the type of conduct alleged against the defendant would not justify dismissal the first time it came to the employer's attention, if he had been guilty of such conduct while performing only his own job function. Taking the all of these factors together, the court concluded that the notice should reflect the management positions were fewer than a non management position, and that there was a substantial wage difference. The Court awarded the plaintiff $55,000 in damages."
d_2000canlii19583.txt,"The accused was charged with assault causing bodily harm contrary to s.267(b) of the Criminal Code. HELD: The accused was found guilty.  1)The case law from other jurisdictions was reviewed. Given the law as it presently stands in Saskatchewan the Crown does not have an obligation to prove that bodily harm caused by the assault was objectively foreseeable and that the assault would subject the victim to the risk of bodily harm. The Court of Appeal expressly stated that R. v. Nurse was incorrectly decided and prefers the approach in R. v. Brooks which held the elements of assault causing bodily harm consist of the mens rea to commit the assault and the intentional application of force which results in bodily harm. 2)The victim would not have suffered bodily harm if the accused had not assaulted him. The assault was more than an insignificant or trivial cause of the bodily harm. While the bodily harm resulted directly from third parties falling on top of the accused and the victim, the third parties involvement was due entirely and as a direct result of the actions of the accused. It was clearly the accused who initiated the pile up. The accused placed the victim in a dangerous position, similar to that in the Samuelson and Brooks decisions. A very short period of time elapsed between the assault and bodily harm.","The accused was charged with assault causing bodily harm contrary to s. 267(b) of the Criminal Code. The Crown called his son, Cory, the 15-year-old mascot for the Raider Hockey Club, Timothy Sabo, another fan, and another fan as witnesses.

It was clearly the accused who initiated the pile-up from which the bodily harm resulted. 2) The second question was asked in the affirmative. While the assault resulted directly from the effect of third parties falling on top of the accused and Mr. Brown, the accused placed the victim in a dangerous position, similar to the accused in the Samuelson and Brooks decisions. 3) The third question was correctly answered.

On balance the respondents would suffer greater harm if the injunction were granted as the respondent Nylen makes his living marketing and selling potassium sulphate.","The applicant sought injunctive relief pursuant to s. 65 of The Queen’s Bench Act and s. 68 of Queen”s Bench Rule No. 387(a) prohibiting and restraining the respondent from producing any potassium sulphate and prohibiting the defendants from selling, marketing or otherwise disposing of any potassium sulfate during the life of the injunty order. HELD: 1) The applicant sought an interlocutory injunction prohibiting the respondent and the defendants, pursuant to which an order was made pursuant to the Queen“s Bench Rules and s65 of Queen(s) Bench Rule. 2) The respondent was found to have a proprietary interest in the scientific principles of ion exchange and crystallization. 3) The evidence established by the affidavit was that the respondent had purchased the assets of the plaintiff from the defendant and that the defendant had acquired the assets from the plaintiff. 4) The defendant was found not to have any contractual or other relationship with the plaintiff prior to the commencement of the action. 5) The plaintiff was found liable for costs of this application. 6) The court found that the plaintiff had not breached any of the agreements between the parties. 7) The Court found that there was no evidence that the defendants had breached the agreements. The Court ordered costs of the application. 8) In addition to the above, the court found there was insufficient evidence to establish whether the defendant was a party to the action and therefore the Court ordered further damages."
d_2001nssc85.txt,"The applicant was aware that allegations of abuse had been made against him in an alternative dispute resolution process undertaken by the Province with respect to his former employment. He applied under the Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy Act for certain information concerning these allegations. The FOIPOP Privacy Coordinator denied access and the applicant appealed. Appeal allowed; in all cases where the claimants had signed release forms the applicant is to be supplied with information as to the number and nature of allegations made against him and the names of the complainants; the specific dates and times of all allegations made against him; the evidence collected in relation to the investigations undertaken as a result of the allegations; the number and dollar amount of payouts made for actions attributable only to the applicant; and information as to whether any of the allegations leveled were dismissed or unproven. The appeal should proceed as an appeal de novo. The applicant was not seeking information from R.C.M.P. files and the release of information which the police had passed on to the Department of Justice would not harm law enforcement as the information was compiled by the Province for its own purposes. The complainants had been required to execute releases whereby the information supplied could be used for various specified purposes, all of which potentially involved public disclosure or disclosure to the applicant. Law enforcement protection was lost when a release was obtained from the complainants and the information was passed to the Province. There was no unreasonable invasion of the claimants' privacy. The applicant was entitled to know what he had been accused of and should have the right to correct the record.","This was an appeal pursuant to the provisions of the Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy Act. The appellant had made an application for information pursuant to s. 40 of the Act pursuant to which the appellant was denied access to information requested. HELD: The appeal is taken from a decision of the Department of Justice, dated October 16, 1998, whereby the appellant is denied access. 1) Throughout the course of the ADR process there was much publicity and media attention. The allegations attracted much attention and the fact that many past and present employees of the institutions had been accused as perpetrators of abuse was public knowledge. 2) The respondent was given certain 'can say' statements by the respondent regarding all of the accusations made against him. 3) The appellant was given a 13-page letter outlining his background, some of his work and employment history and set forth the reasons for his request for information. 4) The evidence obtained was not conclusive evidence of the abuse. The respondent's statements were not corroborated by the evidence obtained. 5) There was no evidence that the respondent had been sexually assaulted. 6) There were no allegations of institutional abuse. 7) The extent of the respondent's involvement in the investigation of the allegations was not ascertained. The evidence was not corroborative. 8) The court found that the appellant's evidence was unreliable. 9) It was not clear that there was a conflict between the obligation undertaken pursuant to instructions of the former Chief Justice of New Brunswick and those of the Justice Minister. 10) The Court found that although the respondent was not a party to the investigation, he was a witness to some of the alleged abuse. It was also not clear whether there was any evidence that he had been involved in any of the acts. The court concluded that there had been a conflict of interest between the undertakings of confidentiality originally extended by the Justice Department and those extended to the respondent."

The Provincial Court trial judge did not accept the accused's testimony that his blood-alcohol concentration was between .068 and .081 at the time of driving. On appeal the Queen's Bench judge set aside the conviction and ordered an acquittal. HELD: The appeal was allowed. The Queen's Bench judgment was set aside and the Provincial Court trial judgment was restored. While the appellate judge stated the correct standard of review, he did not in fact apply it and made inaccurate assessments of the evidence and conclusion of the trial judge.","The accused was convicted by a Provincial Court judge of having care and control of a motor vehicle while impaired contrary to s.253(a) of the Criminal Code. The Provincial Court Judge acquitted him of the charge. On appeal, the Court of Queen's Bench judge set aside the conviction and ordered an acquittal. HELD: The Court of Appeal held that the trial judge erred in concluding that the appellant was impaired and becoming more so during the time at the police station. The Court also held that accepting the breathalyzer demand at 8:31 p.m. was unreasonable. The Crown appealed. The Appeal Court judge while stating the correct standard of review did not apply to the accused. The appellate court judge did not in fact apply it. The appellant's assertions that his ability to concentrate and his judgment were unaffected were incorrect. The trial judge's acceptance of the expert evidence that the blood alcohol was rapidly rising and was in the range of.68 to.81 at the time of the accident was accepted among the indications of impairment of the respondent. The conviction cannot stand."
d_2006nsca24.txt,"In the context of a divorce proceeding, the husband filed an interlocutory application for, inter alia, the termination of spousal support, and the sale of the matrimonial home. The Chambers judge ordered that the matrimonial home be sold and the assets equally divided between the spouses. The wife appealed. Appeal allowed; certain provisions of the Order struck or temporarily lifted to permit the parties a reasonable opportunity to make timely alternative arrangements to resolve the matters in issue consensually, short of selling the matrimonial home; the court's intervention was necessary to prevent a patent injustice. There was no mention of any division of matrimonial assets in the notice filed by the husband and in the unique circumstances of this case, it was unrealistic and unfair to address the issue of selling the house without at the same time taking into account its value and the parties' individual contributions to that value.","Cross applications were filed by the appellant seeking orders to terminate spousal support, to sell the matrimonial home and to return to him certain personal belongings. Both parties testified and were subject to cross-examination. In an oral decision at the conclusion of the hearing, the Chambers judge ordered the sale of the home and ordered that the equity in the home be divided equally between the parties after the payment of legal fees and real estate commission. The appellant appealed. Appeal allowed; case remitted to the Supreme Court for a rehearing on an expedited basis. There was no evidence to warrant proceeding with the applications in the manner suggested by counsel. The court found no reason why the matter could not be heard again by Justice Scanlan should his schedule permit it. Findings of credibility were entirely within his province and did not require any comment from this Court, should he choose to take up the case again."
d_2006nssc73.txt,"Custodial arrangements for the parties two youngest children (aged 15 and 13), who currently lived with the father the majority of the time, were at issue. The marriage had been traditional, with the wife being the primary caretaker of the children. Both children were heavily involved in sporting activities and the father felt that since he was retired, he would be better able to ensure their attendance at various games and practices. The mother, who had recently commenced employment as a social worker, felt that the current interim arrangement was difficult for the children in that they would forget their school books at the other parent's residence and were sometimes left alone for extended periods at the father's residence. Children placed in the custody and primary care of the mother; until the separation, the mother had been the primary caretaker of the children and she appeared to have a stronger emotional bond with them; the father had been physically, emotionally and verbally abusive to the wife throughout the marriage and seemed incapable of putting the children's needs above his own; and the mother was much more likely than the father to encourage the children to have contact with the other parent. Although the father was retired and might have more time to spend with the children, this did not outweigh all of the other factors.",HELD: The Court found that it would be in the best interests of the parties to be in custody and that the issue of custody would be heard by the Court first with the financial issues deferred to later date. The respondent was 65 years of age and retired. He drove a taxi from time to time. The parties lived in a three bedroom apartment in Lower Sackville approximately ten minutes walk from the children's school. The petitioner was employed with the federal government and the Department of Fisheries and Oceans. She earned a bachelor's degree in education and worked part-time as a social worker. She was also an accomplished academic. The court found that the petitioner had a preference for living with her husband and that she was more likely to work with him when she was not attending university.
d_2007skpc27.txt,"The accused is charged with assault contrary to s. 266 of the Criminal Code. The Crown applies to admit into evidence oral statements made by the complainant to her neighbor and to the police for consideration of the truth of their contents. HELD: The statements made by the complainant are found to be reliable and are therefore admissible.  1) Hearsay statement may be admitted on a principled basis, the governing principles are reliability and necessity. A number of cases have held that necessity is met when a witness recants or in some other fashion effectively holds hostage evidence that cannot be obtained from another source. 2) There is no other way to obtain the complainant's evidence. Whether her alcohol consumption that night erased her recollection of events or whether she is a hostile witness is immaterial at this stage. Either way she effectively holds hostage that evidence and the court need not determine the reason for the purpose of this application. The test of necessity has been met.  3) With regard to reliability, the question becomes whether there are sufficient indicia of reliability in a particular case to substitute the lack of oath, lack of cross-examination and absence of video taping. Where the hearsay statement was made in circumstances which provide some guarantees of trustworthiness, the test for reliability will be met. The following circumstances are evidence of trustworthiness: the complainant arrived unexpectedly at her neighbor's apartment, she was upset and crying, she asked that police be called, she spontaneously described the assault, she repeated a consistent version to the police, she had fresh red marks which corresponded with her description of the assault and the accused verified aspects of her complaint with comments he made.",The accused was charged with assault contrary to s. 266 of the Criminal Code. The Crown applied to have oral statements admitted into evidence for consideration of the truth of their contents. Evidence was then called on voir dire. HELD: The Court found that the test of necessity was met. The accused was found not guilty. The Court held that the tests for admissibility of hearsay evidence were determined on a principled basis. 1)The accused's evidence was important to the Crown's case and there was no other means of obtaining that evidence. Whether her alcohol consumption that night erased her recollection of events or whether she was a hostile witness was immaterial at this stage. 2)The Court found the test for reliability was met when the accused recanted on an earlier statement. The fact that the complainant was available at trial does not preclude the prior statement from being 'necessary'. 3)The test for necessity had been met.  4)The court found that it was not only in situations where statements are recorded on video and taken under oath that there might be sufficient indicia of reliability.
d_2007skqb324.txt,"This is an application by the accused for an order that evidence obtained by way of a telephone interception be ruled inadmissible because it is irrelevant. Alternatively, the accused seeks exclusion of the intercepted communication on the basis that it was conducted in violation of s. 8 of the Charter and ought to be excluded under s. 24(2). The accused is charged with abuse of a position of trust contrary to s. 153(1)(a) of the Code. HELD: The evidence is admissible. The accused's application is dismissed. 1) After examining the transcript of the conversation, it is immediately evident that the contents of the communication are relevant. The complainant and the accused are discussing the intimate details of their relationship. The conversation is logically probative to the charge. 2) The learned provincial court judge did in fact have sufficient evidence before him to issue the telephone intercept authorization. The complainant was prepared to initiate a telephone call to the accused and engage him in a conversation which would likely cause the accused to make admissions or statements which could be confirmatory of her allegations. 3) The authorization clearly permits the police to intercept private communications in relation to an offence under s. 271(1) of the Code. That investigation was live and bona fide at the time that the authorization was obtained. The law in this country is that evidence of other crimes revealed during the course of a lawful intercept process does not render the evidence obtained inadmissible in relation to an offence not named in the authorization. The focus is on whether the interception was lawfully obtained and executed, not on what is discovered. Here the police obtained a valid authorization to intercept private communications in relation to an offence under s. 271(1) of the Code. During the investigation of that charge, they obtained evidence which is relevant to an offence under s. 153(1)(a) of the Code. The fact that the offence of s. 153(1)(a) is not named in the authorization nor included as an offence for which an authorization to intercept private communications could be obtained, does not affect the admissibility of the evidence. Therefore, there is no Charter breach. 4) Even if the evidence was obtained in violation of s. 8 of the Charter, such evidence is considered non-conscriptive evidence. Where the evidence is non-conscriptive, the court ought to go on to do a balancing as to whether or not the evidence ought to be excluded pursuant to s. 24(2) of the Charter. The factors to be considered are trial fairness, seriousness of the breach and the effect of exclusion. In this case if there is a breach, it was not serious and was inadvertent, the result of unmindful draftsmanship. There is no evidence of bad faith. There is no evidence of manipulation. The seriousness of the breach, if there was one, was minimal, and to admit the evidence would not bring the administration of justice into disrepute.","The accused applied for an order that evidence obtained by way of a telephone interception be ruled inadmissible because it is irrelevant. The accused argued that the evidence was non-conscriptive and that it was the result of unmindful draftsmanship. HELD: The evidence was inadmissible because it did not violate the accused's s. 8 Charter rights. 1)There was no Charter breach and the evidence is in fact admissible and ought not to be excluded. 2)The accused's application was dismissed. 3)The evidence was relevant and admissible in that it does not breach the accused s.8 rights. 4)The Crown did not show that there was a breach of s.16 of the Charter. The Crown argued that because the police believed they were pursuing an offence under s. 271(1) and in the course of that lawful intercept process, obtained evidence relevant to another offence. 5)The Court held that the Crown had reasonable and probable grounds to believe that the accused had committed offences. 6)The respondent's evidence was not conscriptive. The respondent's application to exclude the evidence because it was inadvertent did not raise a Charter breach. 7)The court held that if there was no breach it was not serious and was not inadvertent. 8)The appellant argued that there should be a presumption that the police intended to have the complainant initiate communication with the accused regarding their alleged sexual activity in anticipation of eliciting responses from the accused that would provide evidence concerning the alleged offences. The Court held the respondent had sufficient evidence to issue the telephone intercept authorization. The court also held that although the respondent did not know the police were intercepting private communications, he was prepared to initiate a telephone call to the accused and engage him in conversation which would likely cause the accused to make admissions or statements which could be confirmatory of her allegations. The appellant's argument that such a disclosure would not bring the administration of justice into disrepute was not supported by the evidence. The trial judge did not have sufficient evidence before him to grant the telephone interception authorization.  8)In this case the evidence of the conversation was not admissible because there was nothing material about the conversation. 9)There is no evidence of bad faith. 10)The trial fairness, seriousness of the breach and effect of exclusion were all factors considered. The failure to disclose the evidence to the trial judge was irrelevant."

The biological child applied to have his stepmother removed as a personal representative of the estate. Application dismissed; the removal of the personal representative would only be in the best interests of those persons interested in the estate if the intended lawsuit was feasible, which it was not.

The intestate is employed by Marine Atlantic Inc. for approximately thirty-one years. During that period he contributed to a pension plan valued at two hundred eighty-three thousand two hundred thirty-seven dollars ($283,237.00). It is the applicant's position that the Respondent was not spouse within the meaning of the legislation and plan, and is not entitled to the survivor benefits. HELD: The application was dismissed. The court found that the removal of Joan as personal representative was not in the 'best interests of those persons interested in the estate' and would only be so if the intended lawsuit with Marine Atlantic were feasible.

d_2012skqb237.txt,"The appellant was convicted of driving over .08 contrary to s. 253(b) of the Criminal Code. The appellant's memorandum of law and oral argument only addressed whether the police officer had reasonable and probable ground to arrest and demand his breath sample and asserted a violation of his rights pursuant to s. 8 and 9 Charter of Rights. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. The trial judge tested the officer's credibility and the judge's conclusion was supported by facts. The officer's belief was based on the observation that the appellant was driving with a flat tire, with windshield wipers operating on a clear night, as well as slurred speech and bloodshot eyes. The officer had reasonable and probable grounds to demand a sample of the appellant's breath.","HELD: The appeal was dismissed. The trial judge erred in holding that the appellant did, having consumed alcohol in such a quantity that the concentration thereof in his blood exceeded 80 milligrams of alcohol in 100 milliliters of blood, operate a motor vehicle contrary to s. 255(1) and s. 253(b) of the Criminal Code. The appellant's memorandum of law and oral argument dealt only with the contention that the police officer did not have reasonable and probable grounds to arrest him and to demand that he provide a sample of his breath, thereby infringing his right under ss. and of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms, Part of the Constitution Act, 1982, being Schedule to the Canada Act 1982. Even excluding the slurred speech and bloodshot eyes, the remaining indicia which the officer observed provided ample evidence to support her belief the appellant was operating his motor vehicle while his ability to do so was impaired. The appeal court found that the trial judge was in a position to test the credibility of the officer. The evidence was not clear that the officer had observed the bloodshot eye of the appellant after making the formal arrest as argued by the appellant. HELD: Appeal dismissed. 1)The trial judge's factual findings are entitled to deference, the trial Judge's ultimate ruling is subject to review for correctness. 2)The appellant's belief was based on the observation of the police that she was driving with a flat tire and with the vehicle's windshield wipers operating although it was a clear night, as well as all the other indicia of impairment referenced above. The court found the officer's reasonable grounds to demand a sample were not breached. 3)The court considered the totality of the evidence and found the appellant had reasonable, probable grounds."
d_2013skca10.txt,"The appellant plead guilty to two counts of sexual assault, was declared a dangerous offender and sentenced to an indeterminate sentence. The appellant appealed the sentence arguing that the sentencing judge failed to give adequate consideration to the assessment of two expert witnesses who testified that they thought the appellant should be found a long-term offender. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. The sentencing judge was not bound to accept the assessment of the experts. Both experts testified that the appellant's risk to reoffend sexually was moderate to high and was extremely high if he did not receive treatment. Both experts based their opinions, in part, on the idea that the appellant had been a model inmate. Both experts believed the appellant's self report about his behaviour in custody, despite having reached the conclusion that he was a pathological liar. Both experts appeared to take the accused at face value when he said he was motivated to change. In fact, the evidence from correctional officials suggested that the appellant was prone to violent, aggressive and irrational behaviour in custody. He had shown on numerous occasions that he would not follow the rules in the institution and had been involved in several attempts to smuggle drugs into the jail, including picking up a package in the washroom of the court house during his dangerous offender hearing and convincing his lawyer to bring his baby into the jail with drugs in his diaper. The accused had committed two sexual assaults within months of being released from a previous sexual assault sentence. The trial judge was correct to emphasize protection of the public and was entitled to discount the opinion of the experts because it was based on incorrect assumptions. In supporting the sentencing judge's opinion that the accused would not take treatment because he refused to accept responsibility for his offences, the Court of Appeal noted that the accused had stated in his Notice of Appeal that he was serving a life sentence for two sexual assaults that he did not commit and the fact that he sent a letter to the Court saying that he had been falsely accused and did not sexually assault anyone. In addition, the Court considered fresh evidence that the appellant had refused to transfer to another institution in order to participate in high-intensity sex offender treatment pending his appeal.","After the defendant pled guilty to two counts of sexual assault, the Court of Appeal declared him a long-term offender and sentenced him to an indeterminate sentence. He appealed. HELD: Appeal dismissed. 1)The defendant was found not to be a dangerous offender because he never had the chance to participate in sexual offender treatment programming. The evidence established that the defendant vacillated between three positions involving the sexual offences. The defendant was not a violent person and had no memory of any of the assaults. The court found that the assessment of the two expert witnesses who both recommended that he be declared a long term offender was correct. 2)The Defendant was found to have a reasonable risk of re-offending as a result of the offences committed within the past five years. The Court of Appeals held that the Defendant had not shown a reasonable willingness to take responsibility for the offences and had not engaged in meaningful or meaningful acts of violence. 3)The evidence established a pattern of behaviour consistent with the defendant's previous criminal record. The Defendant had been in custody for two years and had been convicted of two sexual assaults. He was sentenced to time served on one charge and on the other to term of imprisonment of 2 years less day. The Appeal Court held that there was no reasonable possibility of eventual control of risk in the community."
d_2013skca21.txt,"The appellant appealed the Queen's Bench decision that denied him damages for defamation (see: 2010 SKQB 249). The trial judge held that the defence of qualified privilege protected the Union and its representatives (the defendants in the action) when the latter republished a grievance defaming the appellant by falsely accusing him of having participated in the harassment of an employee. The trial judge fixed a provisional award of $25,000. The appellant's grounds of appeal were that the trial judge erred in finding that the defence applied and by assessing damages at $25,000. The respondents cross-appealed on the ground that the trial judge had erred in denying them costs. HELD: The Court held that the trial judge had erred in finding that the defence of qualified privilege applied. Although she correctly identified the law, she had not correctly applied it because she had not given sufficient effect to 1) the wording of the defamatory expressions; 2) the circumstances in which they were published and, in particular, the chronology of events and the separate instances of publication; 3) the persons to whom the words were published; and 4) whether what was published on each occasion was germane and reasonably appropriate to the specific occasion. In general, the Court noted that the respondents could have fulfilled their duty to notify its membership of the grievance filed by the member who alleged the harassment and made its effort to find witnesses to support the member's grievance by sending out a general notice. It did not need to name the appellant and make the allegations it did to achieve its goal. The respondent overreached, thereby placing the statement that the appellant had participated in the harassment of the employee outside the ambit of the defence of qualified privilege. The Court awarded general damages in the amount of $100,000. It held that the trial judge's assessment of damages was erroneous and founded upon mistaken principles of law. The Court was not bound by the range of damages mentioned by the Supreme Court in the Church of Scientology decision but only to apply the principles established in it to the context of this case. The provisional award of $25,000 for general damages was erroneous because the respondents published the documents by mailing them and placing them on the Union's website, over the strong objections of the employer. The respondents left the documents on the website for 6 months after the employer demanded that they be removed. The respondents had never offered an apology and appeared not to have recognized the harm that had been caused to the appellant. An award of aggravated damages was subsumed in the general award and the Court agreed with the trial judge that punitive damages were not warranted because the respondent had not been motivated by malice. The respondent's cross-appeal was dismissed without costs. However, their position was clearly correct in the circumstances: it was not appropriate for the trial judge to decline to order costs in their favour on the basis of 'mixed results', because in defamation cases, the results are invariably mixed.","The trial judge held that the principle of qualified privilege protected the union and its representatives when the latter republished a grievance defaming a member of management by falsely accusing him of having participated in the harassment of an employee. He fixed a provisional award of damages of $25,000. HELD: Appeal allowed. Cross-appeal dismissed. 1) The trial judge erred by finding the defamatory statements are protected by qualified privilege. 2) The evidence demonstrated that the Union rarely operated in the manner in which it did in this case. 3) The plaintiff's second grievance, while it remained within the confines of its original intended purpose (i.e. the originating document in grievance procedure mandated by The Trade Union Act), would be in my view protected by absolute privilege. However, the impugned words in that document ceased to enjoy that protection once the document was published in such a broad way and for the purposes stated above."
d_2013skqb394.txt,"HELD: The Court held that the replacement of former Queen’s Bench rule 212 requiring the production of documents “relating” to any matter in question and rule 222 permitting examination for discovery “touching” the matter in issue in the action by new rules 5-6, 5-18 and 5-25, which use the phrase: “relevant to any matter in issue”, showed the intention that the broad relevance test was no longer applicable. The test under the new Rules was whether the matter qualifies as being material to the action based upon the matter as pled and whether the evidence tends to prove or disprove the matter in issue. This inquiry must be balanced against the notion of proportionality set out in the foundational rules. The Court dismissed the application, excepting the requested order under 3) wherein the defendant would fulfill its undertaking to have certain employees provide responses. With respect to the rest of the relief requested under 1), which involved the undertaking that the defendant would search its records regarding the loading of railcars, the Court held that the as matter was not an issue in the action, based upon a review of the claim as pled. Having regard to proportionality under the new rules, the defendant should not be required to answer the question in light of the effort and expense required versus the possible benefits. The Court held that the plaintiffs were not entitled to ask the defendants to review a binder containing hundreds of pages of invoices assembled by the plaintiff regarding its expenditures incurred as a result of the derailment in order for it to advise the plaintiff which invoices the defendant believed were not related to it. It was the plaintiff’s burden to prove its damages and the defendant was not required to assist the plaintiff to do so. The plaintiff’s requested undertaking for the defendant to provide any background documents and information that went into the preparation of sketch of the railcar in question by the defendant’s adjuster was also denied. The adjuster’s file was subject to litigation privilege and unless it was tendered as evidence at trial, there was no implied waiver of that privilege. Regarding the plaintiff’s request in 2), the Court agreed with the defendants that that plaintiff’s request that the defendant answer questions now, rather than after it had completed questioning of the plaintiff, was premature. The defendant had not yet taken a position on the cause of the derailment and they would advise the plaintiff when they had developed one. Rule 5-31 makes it an ongoing obligation to correct answers and there was no evidence in this application that the rules had not been complied with. The Court awarded costs in the amount of $1,500 to the defendants due to the complexity of the application, requiring the submission of briefs of law and the amount of time taken to argue them matters in Chambers.","FIAT: The plaintiff asks the court to order the defendants to answer certain questions and provide answers now, based upon their present knowledge, to questions that the plaintiff says are best left to be answered on completion of their discovery of the plaintiff when they will have better information. HELD: 1) The court found that when the plaintiff moved from the words of touching and relating to any matter in issue, it intended to move away from the broad relevance test that existed under the former Queen's Bench Rules. 2) It is clear that the insurance adjuster's file would be subject to a litigation privilege. 3) The plaintiff is not obliged to assist plaintiffs to do so. 4) The defendant is not required to assist the plaintiff. 5) The amount of invoices and other documents requested by the plaintiff is approximately $1,500. 6) The claim for damages is not within the proper scope of questioning."
d_2014skpc145.txt,"The Court allowed the application in part. It struck the portion of the claim with respect to damages from debris falling from the defendants’ tree. Even if proven, the damages were part of urban life. The plaintiff claimed for injunctive relief ordering the trees to be removed. The Court had no jurisdiction to grant this relief. The amended claim could proceed limited to the claim for damages from any overhanging trees into the plaintiff’s property and whether the trees invaded the plaintiff’s air space.",The plaintiff brought an amended claim for damages from overhanging trees from the defendant's property onto the plaintiff's property. The defendant argued that the trees were part of the natural characteristic of Moose Jaw and that their particular neighbourhood was generally in favour of them. The plaintiff claimed damages for root damage from the tree to his pool. The defendants counter-claimed for root damages from the trees to his property. HELD: The plaintiff's claim was struck. The Court held that an injunction ordering the trees be removed was not beyond the authority of the Court. The plaintiffs had no jurisdiction to grant this remedy. The court also held that the plaintiff had no authority to strike the portion of the claim that was allowed to proceed on the basis it was frivolous and vexatious.
e_1991canlii4217.txt,"The plaintiff appealed the defendant's decision to grant a partial tax refund only under the Health Services Tax Act. The plaintiff had sought a full refund of tax paid on refrigeration equipment at a pickled herring plant (whose product was to be supplied on contract overseas) on the ground the equipment was used in the 'manufacture or production of goods for sale.' The contract stipulated that most of the processing occur at controlled cold temperatures. The defendant apportioned tax based on the time the equipment was used in the actual 'transformation or conversion' of the product. For the plaintiff, that (1) the tax exemption did not depend on the extent to which the equipment was used in the manufacturing process; and (2) since the contract required most of the process to occur under refrigeration, the use of a cold room was part of the 'manufacture or production' of the product.","This was an appeal pursuant to s. 19 of the Health Services Tax Act. The Act has since been significantly amended. The appellant contended that the Minister and the Provincial Tax Commissioner were incorrect in not allowing the exemption for the refrigeration equipment in full. HELD: The appeal was allowed and the assessment for health services tax was upheld. 1)In order to be eligible for exemption from health services taxes pursuant to clause 10(1)(h)(i) of the Act, machinery and equipment must be used in the actual transformation or conversion of the product actually being produced for sale. Machinery or equipment used prior or subsequent to that actual transformation is not eligible for tax. The function described by the Appellant of refrigeration was not part of the pickled herring process. The use of a cold room in the process performed a function that was part of its manufacture or production. 2)The appellant was awarded its costs."

The Husband claimed that the value of the crop harvested was less than the farm expenses and resisted any change in the previous interim orders made. HELD: Application dismissed.

e_1996canlii5466.txt,"This was an appeal from a trial court decision questioning whether the trial judge erred in determining that the appellant's rights under s.7 and s.8 of the Charter had not been violated. When man involved in an accident checked himself into hospital, the attending physician informed the RCMP of the accident and an RCMP officer came to the hospital. As the appellant had indicated to the physician that he had been drinking, the RCMP constable read demand for blood sample, which the attending physician attempted to obtain. The appellant refused and asked to speak to his lawyer. Unable to contact lawyer, the appellant refused to supply blood sample and was charged with refusal under s. 254(2) of the Criminal Code. The trial judge had held that as the physician attempted to obtain sample for medical purposes, he was not acting in the capacity of agent of the state, and his actions were not subject to the Charter. Dismissing the appeal, that while there may have been some issues of breach of confidentiality, the physician's actions were not analogous to search and seizure within s.8 of the Charter. The trial judge did not err in determining that the appellant's rights were not violated under either s.7 or s.8 of the Charter.","This was an appeal of a decision wherein the appellant was convicted of an offence contrary to s. 254(5) of the Criminal Code.

The Crown applied to have a witness, who was an unindicted co-conspirator and separately charged with drug offences arising out of the same investigation, declared adverse pursuant to s9 of the Canada Evidence Act. She had contradicted her prior video taped statement made shortly after her arrest and had demonstrated hostile attitude towards the Crown. The defence took the position that she was now telling the truth; that the statement was improperly obtained in breach of the confession rules of voluntariness and the statement did not meet the requirements set out in R. v. K.G.B. HELD: The witness' prior statement may be introduced in evidence for the substantive truth of its contents. It will be for the jury to decide what, if any, portions of such statement they wish to accept. 1)A prior inconsistent statement cannot be introduced in evidence for its substantive content, unless the requirement of necessity, and a threshold of reliability arrived at on a balance of probabilities are established. When, as here, a witness recants, the requirement of necessity is established. The real issue is whether the prior statement meets the test for reliability. When, as here, there is only one demonstrably false piece of testimony in the statement, which does not implicate anyone but rather attempts to exonerate someone, the Court was not prepared to say ipso facto the statement is unreliable. 2)The independent evidence sufficiently corroborated her statement in enough different particulars that, but for the demonstrably false portion, it met the threshold of reliability.","FIAT.

e_1998canlii13359.txt,"The accused, employed as doorman and relief bartender at the time of the altercation, was charged with assault causing bodily harm in which the complainant sustained significant injuries to his head and face. Three crown witnesses and five defence witnesses testified as to the altercation in the bar. HELD: The accused was found guilty. 1)The self-defence argument was not accepted. Neither s.34 or s.37 of the Criminal Code justified the assault. 2)The testimony of the Crown witnesses was accepted. The complainant was no threat to the accused in his inebriated state and the accused took advantage of the situation to administer a beating to him. The injuries were not consistent with the scenario described by the accused and the witnesses.","The accused was employed by Uncle Charlie's as a doorman and relief bartender. During the course of the evening there were two minor incidents and exchanges between Baikie, his associates, and the accused, neither of which progressed beyond the verbal stage. The accused punched the complainant over the shoulder and knocked him down. The complainant then punched the accused on the back of the head and face. He was not drinking on the occasion. The Crown witnesses testified that the accused was in a 'inebriated state' and took advantage of the situation to administer a 'beating to' to the accused. The defence argued that Baikeie did indeed attempt to 'get at' the accused whilst being restrained by the accused and that he may have thrown punch at the accused or attempted to do so, but his efforts were quite ineffectual. In his state, he was no threat to the complainant and that the co-accused in fact took advantage to the situation and administered several blows to Baikey, either at the complainant's head or his face. HELD: The accused was found guilty. 1)The facts were as stated by the Crown witnesses, with the qualification that the Crown witness did not attempt to get the accused's attention or to get involved in a fight. He may have seen the accused make a motion or gesture which he interpreted as an invitation to become involved with him, but he did not initiate the action. 2)The accused's behaviour was consistent with the defence's argument that he was trying to prevent harm from arising out of the altercation. He did not throw a punch but said that he struck the complainant first. He said that the complainant struck him first. The evidence was consistent that the defendant threw a punch and that there was no evidence that he did so. 3)The evidence was not used to set out the charge of assault or to prevent the accused from committing self-defence. The Court accepted the accused guilty of both charges."
e_1998canlii13558.txt,"The bankrupt applied to annul his bankruptcy on the grounds that he received misinformation or had a misunderstanding concerning the effect of an assignment on the status of potential builders' lien claimants and because his assets had been undervalued. He also asserted that the bankruptcy proceedings were of no value to him as builders' lien claimants have status akin to secured creditors and could pursue the bankrupt personally for any deficiency that may arise if the home is sold and the proceeds distributed among the claimants. The trustee maintained the bankrupt was repeatedly advised or cautioned that bankruptcy may not affect the majority of his creditors. Subsequent appraisals placed the value of his unfinished home at $150,000 rather than $40,000. The bankrupt was now eligible to obtain mortgage financing but first had to get out of bankruptcy. The bankrupt had attempted an orderly payment of debts prior to bankruptcy and had considered proposal post-bankruptcy. HELD: The application for an order annulling the assignment was dismissed. 1)The bankrupt met the definition of an insolvent person at the date of the assignment. It would be dangerous to set a precedent which would allow such an application because of post-bankruptcy circumstances. An improved financial situation and the ability to pay debts in full should not be used as criteria to launch section181 application. 2)The bankrupt had not filed monthly financial statements nor made payments as agreed to cover the costs of the administration of the estate. The onus will be on the bankrupt to comply with the requirements of the trustee to qualify for an automatic discharge on November 15/98 or an early discharge as provided for in s168.1(2).","The bankrupt applied to annul his bankruptcy. Section 181 of the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act reads as ""(1) Where in the opinion of the court, receiving order ought not to have been filed, the court may by order annul the bankruptcy."" The bankrupt submitted that he received misinformation or had a misunderstanding concerning the effect of an assignment on the status of potential builders' lien claimants and secondly the undervaluation of his assets. HELD: The application was dismissed. 1) An order annulling his assignment was not a dangerous precedent. 2) An annulment of the assignment would result in the creditors being paid in full, much more expeditiously than it would otherwise take. Certain builders' liens claimants have already commenced an action. 3) The bankrupt had been far from a model bankrupt. He has yet to file monthlyfinancial statements and has not made payments as agreed to cover the costs of the administration of the estate. 4) The application by the bankrupt for an order to annull his assignment is dismissed. 5) The bankruptcy proceedings have been of no value to him. The majority of creditors, who are secured, would also benefit from the bankrupt's request being granted. If, as the bankrupt states, an annulement of the Assignment would allow him to obtain financing it would likely result in certain builders' claimants having already commenced action."

The plaintiff sought rectification of the contract to change the wording of the contract to milk quota sales from fluid milk quota sales. Finding for the plaintiff and granting rectification, that the parties clearly intended to have the contract cover all milk quota sales. The proceeds from all sales are to be divided between the parties.","The plaintiffs sought rectification of the agreement terms in regard to the sharing by all three of them in the proceeds from any sales of milk quota by Lorne Putnam's company. The agreement only refers to Fluid Milk Quota. The plaintiff argued that the terms of the original agreement were so vague as to not include the word 'fluid' in the meaning of the word. The court found that the agreement only referred to the Fluid milk Quota and therefore, it was obligated to only share proceeds from the sale of Fluid and not all quota sold."
e_1999skqb151.txt,"The farm implement dealer and the defendant entered a standard form Finance Lease Agreement which provided for an 'advance payment' and semi-annual installments with the final 'termination value' payment to be paid at the defendant's option if he elected to purchase the sprayer. The central issue was whether the Agreement was a lease and liquidated damages should be awarded in accordance with clause two, or a conditional sales security agreement whereby the dealer was restricted to repossession and sale by s.46(2) of the Saskatchewan Farm Security Act. HELD: The plaintiff's claim was dismissed with costs on Column 3. 1)The Agreement was a conditional sales contract whereby title was reserved until the defendant elected to make the final payment. The transaction falls within the ambit of the Saskatchewan Farm Security Act and the dealer's right to recover the unpaid purchase price is restricted to repossession and sale. Although the dealer framed the Agreement as a lease the Agreement itself used notions of retail financing and secured party. Nomenclature such as principal, past due interest, conditional sales contract, purchase of equipment, and retail sales contract were used. The construction and interpretation of the nature of the Agreement is a question of law. The Agreement had many attributes of ownership and collectively showed that the defendant acquired a substantial interest in the sprayer. He had possession and unrestricted right to use the sprayer with high base hours. The total payments were equivalent to the total payments under sales contract. The defendant had the option to acquire title by making the final payment. He bore the risk of loss and obligation for maintenance and insurance. 2)The court could not determine whether the option price would be substantially less, equal or more than the June 2002 fair market value of the sprayer. 3)If the Agreement is lease the defendant's consent to give up possession was conditional upon his release from further liability. Case Credit cannot foreclose the entitlement to 40 days notice and take possession of the sprayer by relying upon conditional unwritten consent. To validate early repossession would defeat the intention of the legislation to protect creditors. Case could take possession only in accordance with Part IV of the SFSA. 4)If the Agreement is lease and covered by the SFSA, the defendant would be released from all liability under s.55. It would be unjust to make any further order in a summary trial without the benefit of discoveries or pre-trial conference and without evidence of the fair market value at the time of seizure. 5)If the Agreement is lease and not covered by the SFSA, it would be held that the dealer was not barred by implied acceptance of the condition the defendant be released from further liability because of the exclusionary clause. Judgment would have been granted for $42,089 with costs on Column 3.","HELD: The issue was whether the Agreement was a lease or a security agreement and whether liquidated damages should be awarded in accordance with clause two of the Saskatchewan Farm Security Act. The central issue is whether the agreement is a lease, a conditional sales agreement and that Case Credit's right is restricted to repossession and sale by s. 46(2) of the Act.  1) The evidence was clear that the parties treated the trade-in as the advance payment even though the value of the trade in did not equal the amount of the advance. 2) The Agreement has many of the attributes of ownership and collectively show that Mr. Poirier acquired a substantial interest in the sprayer. The primary incidents of ownership are use of the sprayers for all of its useful life with the obligation to pay the capital cost plus the cost of investment, acquisition of substantial interest, loss or gain from unusual depreciation or appreciation of the value. The Agreement is a conditional sale contract whereby title was reserved until the defendant elected to pay. 3) The issues were whether the terms of the Agreement were lease, conditional sales contract, purchase of equipment, realize on security and retail sales contract. 4) The issue of the early repossession was a question of law. The agreement had many of its attributes and collectively showed that the consent by Mr. Poirier to give up possession was conditional upon his release from further liability. The construction and interpretation of the nature of the agreement was a 'question of law'. The Agreement was not a lease but the Agreement had many attributes. The value of trade in does not equal what the difference is. 5) The agreement has many aspects of ownership.

In essence, the Agreement isa conditional sales deal whereby title is reserved until Mr.'s elected to paying the final payment. The main incidents of owning the sprayery for all its useful lives with the implied acceptance of a condition that he be released from a further liability, because of exclusionary clause eight of The Saskatchewan Farm security Act. 6) The Court must be able to ascertain the probable value of a sprayer at the end of five years (June 2002) to be paid at the plaintiff's option if he elects to purchase the Sprayer.  7) Liquidated damages were awarded in the event that the Agreement falls within the ambit of the s. 55 of The Act."

Two children were born of the relationship; the parties owned home as well as other assets. They separated in 1995.

She also sought a declaration that the Charter is infringed by the definition of spouse in s. 2(g) of the Act, because it does not include or recognize her common law relationship. The Chambers judge dismissed the application. He found that marital status is not an analogous ground upon which to base claim of discrimination under s. 15(1) of the Charter; or, in the alternative, that s. 2(g) does not constitute discrimination under s. 15(1) of the Charter; or, in the further alternative, that if s. 2(g) is discriminatory, it is saved by s. of the Charter. Allowing the appeal, that marital status is an analogous ground, and that s. 2(g) is discriminatory under s. 15 of the Charter because it denies a person in a common law relationship benefits which are granted to a similar person in a marriage relationship. The Crown did not discharge its onus of proving that the discrimination is demonstrably justified in a free and democratic society. The court rejected the appellant's submission that common law should be read in to the Act, and instead declared s. 2(g) to be unconstitutional and of no force and effect.

e_2005skqb263.txt,"Accused is charged with second degree murder in the death of his estranged wife. The Crown sought to admit into evidence a number of statements that were made by the deceased to several crown witnesses concerning two previous incidents she had with the accused in the weeks prior to her death. In the first incident, the accused is alleged to have choked the victim after he confronted her about where she had been. In the second incident the accused confronted the victim and beat and choked her and then sexually assaulted and threatened to kill her. The Crown seeks to admit this similar fact evidence and several hearsay statements to prove the issues of motive, intent and modus operandi. HELD: The statements by the deceased are not admissible. The prejudicial nature of the similar fact evidence has not been overcome by its probative value. It is well established law that similar acts and other discreditable conduct evidence is presumptively inadmissible and that similar fact evidence is the exception to this. To determine its admissibility, three things need examination, 1) the probative weight of the evidence, 2) the assessment of the prejudice and 3) the weighing of the probative value versus prejudicial value. In examining the probative weight of the evidence, factors to be considered include the issues in question, the presence or absence of collusion, similarities and dissimilarities between the facts charged and the similar fact evidence and the strength of the evidence that the events occurred. The two previous incidents are extremely prejudicial in nature leading to potential moral prejudice. That is, reprehensible nature of the assaults could lead the jury to rely on the prohibited inference that the accused is the type of person who could have committed the crime. There is also a great risk of reasoning prejudice. That is, admitting the similar fact evidence may distract the jury from their proper focus which is the second degree murder charge. There is a possibility that the jury will equate the intention to harm with the mens rea required for a murder conviction. With respect to the hearsay evidence, the Court held that statements made by the deceased to her friends, family and colleagues concerning the threats and assaults will not be admitted. The test of necessity is clearly met by the fact that the person making the statements in now deceased and not able to testify. However, the Court was concerned about the reliability of the statements since there is nothing that would serve as convincing indicia of reliability adequate to offset the absence of an oath.","HELD: The Court held that the evidence was admissible as similar fact evidence and that the prejudicial nature of the evidence had not been overcome by its probative value. The Court also held that there was a risk of reasoning prejudice by admitting the evidence as it may distract members of the jury from their proper focus which is the second degree murder charge.

The Crown argued the sentence was made on the basis that the trial judge did not comply with these important provisions. The court noted that the respondent had not requested an exemption pursuant to s 737(5). The Crown also appealed. HELD: 1)The sentence varied. The respondent was fined $30 and placed on probation for a period of 1 year. 2)The sentencing judge had failed to meet the explicit requirements of ss 737(3) and (6) of Code. The victim surcharges are made mandatory subject only to an application under s. 727 relating to undue hardship.

The within action is dismissed in full. 1) The essential nature of the debate between the plaintiff and the Union relates to the interpretation of the indemnity clause in the Union bylaws. This is precisely the type of internal dispute that is not within the exclusive realm of the Labour Relations Board.

He has incurred no legal fees, other than disbursements, but he nonetheless asserts that he is entitled to $50,000. The figure of $50,000 is proffered by the plaintiff as an appropriate sum as he expects the defendant has spent at least that much defending all four actions. 3) It is plain and obvious that the plaintiff's claim is grounded on an interpretation of the indemnity clause that is so illogical and inconsistent with its plain wording that it cannot succeed.

The Union resists the claim asserting various defences, the primary being that the plaintiff misconstrues and misinterprets the by-law and, more to the point, the Court should decline to become involved in the dispute because the Union is a voluntary association.

e_2009nssc318.txt,"The mother applied for retroactive support (table amounts and s. 7 expenses) for two adult children. The father resisted the application in relation to the oldest son on the basis that he was no longer a dependant child when it was filed. The evidence showed the son finished university before the application was filed. His graduation took place after, at which time he was already working full time and living with his girlfriend. He lived with his mother for few months because of relationship problems, but later moved back in with the girlfriend. He also received some assistance from his parents when he took time off work to retrain. The father felt the mother's application in relation to the younger son should be limited because of her unreasonable delay in making it. He argued retroactivity should be limited to three years from the date he received the application (months after it was filed). The mother argued formal notice was given when her lawyer sent a letter requesting additional support several years earlier. She asked the court for support retroactive to three years before that date, or longer (based on what she alleged was blameworthy conduct on the father's part). The evidence showed the mother was slow in responding to the father's request for particulars. Despite threatening legal action several times, it took her years to file the application. The wife's application for retroactive support in relation to the oldest son dismissed. He was no longer a child of the marriage when it was filed. He became independent when his schooling finished and he started working and living with his girlfriend. While his parents provided assistance during his relationship troubles and retraining, they did so voluntarily and not out of any legal obligation. Support for the younger son to be reassessed retroactive to three years from the date the application was filed (as opposed to received). The mother unreasonably delayed her claim by allowing it to languish for years. While normally the letter from her lawyer would be said to constitute effective notice, the notice here was voided by the mother's failure to prosecute the matter. The father did not engage in blameworthy conduct: he made efforts to respond to and settle the mother's claims; he paid a significant level of support; and he reasonably believed he was meeting his obligations. Here, the need for certainty for a payor parent weighs in favour of the father.","HELD: The court held that it did not have jurisdiction to grant any relief respecting the older child because he was not, at the time of the application, a child of the marriage. It ordered retroactive support for the younger child and ordered a recalculation of the period for which retroactive child support if any will be calculated. The court also ordered a readjustment of the claim for section 7 expenses pertaining to the parties' older child. The parties' corollary relief judgment provided for shared parenting arrangement and equal sharing of all special and extraordinary expenses for the parties'. The court found that the respondent's claim was not valid and ordered the recalculation to be three years prior to July 2004. The respondent argued that the court had jurisdiction under s. 2(1) of the Divorce Act to hold parents responsible for children over sixteen during their period of dependency. HELD: 1) The Court held that the Court had jurisdiction to consider the application of Ms. Niles for retroactive variation of child support and a read-justment for section 8 expenses. 2) It was clear from the various authorities cited by the court that courts recognize jurisdiction under the issue of Child Support where fairness to children dictates it, but should also be mindful that fairness to payor parents often demands. 3) The court did not find jurisdiction to deal with the claim of the respondent with respect to retroactive and s. 7 expenses for her older child, nor did it find jurisdiction for the respondent to decide that his/her child's right to an appropriate amount of support can be acquitted. 4) The respondent took issue with the costs claimed by the respondent.

The issues on appeal all relate to the determination of the fair value of the building and, more particularly, to the market adjustment factor used in that determination. The grounds take issue one way or another with the inclusion of the sales of the Southland and Victoria Square Malls in the array of sales from which the MAF was derived, or alternatively, with the adjustment of the sale price of these properties. HELD: Appeal dismissed. The appeal in relation to the treatment of the sale of the Victoria Square Mall fails, as does the appeal concerning the sale of the Southland Mall. The Court notes that other companies, owning or operating similar malls, also took issue with their 2003 and 2004 assessments. They, too, appealed to the Board of Revision and then to the Assessment Appeals Committee. They too were granted leave to appeal to this Court on the same grounds as the appellant in this case. Counsel for the companies agreed to treat this appeal as representative of the other appeals and to be bound by the result of this appeal. These other appeals are also dismissed.","This appeal concerns the assessment for municipal tax purposes of a building located in the City of Regina and used commercially as an enclosed shopping mall, known as the Normanview Mall. The company was dissatisfied with the City Assessor's determination of fair value and appealed the assessment to the local Board of Revision, then to the Assessment Appeals Committee. The Committee did not reach this conclusion on the basis of the sale verification information to the exclusion of other relevant information. For the reasons that follow, the Committee does not agree with it. To begin with, the committee did not misapprehend the importance, generally, of the sales verification process and the information it yields. The importance lies in the fact municipal assessors are highly dependent on this information in the performance of their assessment duties and are called upon to make number of decisions largely on a basis of fact that emerges through this process, process provided for by sections 171 and 172 of The Cities Act. The committee erred in failing to give effect to the fact that the city assessor did not 'determine the sale price' of the interest in the Normanville Mall, rather than the realistic rate of 12.75%. Had they used the latter, the value would have amounted to $12,900,000, not $19,000. HELD: Appeal dismissed. 1) The Committee failed to properly apply the s.172(5) of The City Assessment Manual. 2) It misapplied the importance of this information and the Information it yielded. To the extent the Committee erred, it misinterpreted the importance and generally, the sale of the Southland Mall qualified for inclusion in the determination of an appropriate MAF. The Court did not find any material error on the part of the Committee regarding the sale. 3) It was not open to either the Board or the Committee to have regard for the sales of each of the malls in the collection of sales from which the MAF was derived or, alternatively, it did not consider the information provided in the verification form. 4) It did not misconstrue the importance generally, generally the sale verification process and its information it yielded in deciding that the sale did not require adjustment pursuant to s.173(1) of the Cities Act or the Assessment Management Agency. It was in reliance on the Committee's decision in the 2004 assessment that the assessment of the Northland Mall came to rest on the determination that the sales were 'arm's length' sales. 5) It is in reliance upon the Committee’s decision in determining that"
e_2010skqb108.txt,"The plaintiffs have applied for certification of proposed multi-jurisdictional class action involving Paxil, prescription drug approved in Canada for the treatment of depression, anxiety, panic disorder and other conditions. The plaintiffs claim that Paxil is ineffective and harmful to persons under 18 years of age. The defendant applies for leave to cross-examine the representative plaintiff on his affidavit pursuant to Rule 317 of The Queen's Bench Rules. HELD: The decisions reviewed by the Court all support the view that leave to cross-examine under Rule 317 is granted more readily in proposed class actions than it is in other civil proceedings. None support the proposition that proposed representative plaintiff is immune from cross-examination in respect of his or her individual claim. Cross-examination of proposed representative plaintiff may explore matters pertaining to his or her individual claim in the context of issue that must be determined by the court pursuant to s. and s. 6.1 of The Class Actions Act. A cross-examination of the plaintiff in this case may assist the court in applying the criterion set out in s. 6 and s. 6.1 of The Class Actions Act. The application for leave to cross-examine is granted.","HELD: The court granted leave to cross-examine the plaintiff on his affidavit. The application was granted on the basis that the court had relatively wide discretion in relation to the requirement in ss. 6 and 6.1 of the Class Actions Act that a cross-examination be permitted in order to determine whether a claim for reimbursement under Rule 317(1) is an exceptional discretionary remedy that should not be granted routinely in any action, including a proposed class action. The court recognized that the common issues being advanced for certification were not by the individuals under 18 who took Paxil, but by the corporate health care plans, health care insurers and provincial health departments referred to in paragraph 12 of the statement of claim."
e_2010skqb464.txt,"The defendant contracted with the plaintiff for supply and installation of materials. The defendant was not satisfied with the plaintiff's work, hired a third party to fix the plaintiff's work and refused to pay the plaintiff. The plaintiff sued for payment of the outstanding account HELD: The plaintiff's claim is dismissed. The Court found enough evidence to conclude that the central purpose of the contract for installation was not achieved and that there was a breach of the implied condition that it would be performed in a workmanlike standard. As the plaintiff's workmanship constitutes a breach of contract, the defendant's damages are set off against the claim.","HELD: The action was set down for summary trial with no examinations for discovery or pre-trial conference. The defendant, the plaintiff, contracted with the plaintiff for the supply and installation of eavestroughing, facia, soffit and facia together with two downspouts, capping of three garage doors and capping the wooden trim all to be installed on a new garage building located on the defendant's land. The plaintiff brought a claim for lien under The Builders' Lien Act. The court found that the central purpose of the contract for installation was not achieved and that, therefore, there had been a breach of the implied condition of the Contract. The cost of repair was slightly less than the cost quoted by the defendant for the job performed by the plaintiff. However, there was enough evidence of significant problems for the court to conclude the central reason for the contract to be not achieved was the implied requirement that it would be performed in a workmanlike standard. The amount required to fix the installation work of Mr. Lawson was the sum of $2,800. The Court ordered that the plaintiff's claim be dismissed and that the amount of the lien be remitted to the defendant."
e_2012skca69.txt,"The applicant applied for judicial interim release under s. 20(b) of the Extradition Act and s. 679 of the Criminal Code. Romania sought extradition of the applicant so that he might serve a 3 year prison sentence imposed as a result of a conviction in Romania for criminally negligent homicide with respect to a motor vehicle collision where the accused, while impaired, hit a pedestrian and killed him. The applicant offered surety from the Romania community in Saskatchewan who did not appear to have known the accused for long and offered to put up his car as bond. The applicant had common law spouse in Saskatchewan but owned no real property. HELD: Although the Crown conceded that the applicant had met the relatively low threshold of showing that his application for leave to appeal his extradition order was not frivolous, the Court of Appeal declined to release the applicant. The Court of Appeal held that there is an elevated risk of flight in light of the fact that the applicant has exhausted all appeals in Romania and is facing a 3 year prison sentence. Canada's international obligations in extradition proceedings require the Court to look more severely at the risk of non-appearance than it would if the application was made solely under s. 679 in respect of criminal proceeding in Canada. The sureties offered by the applicant were not sufficient to ensure his attendance at Court. The application for judicial interim release was dismissed.","The applicant applies for judicial interim release pursuant to s. 20(b) of the Extradition Act and s. 679 of the Criminal Code.  Romania seeks the respondent's extradition from Canada so that he might serve a three-year prison sentence imposed as a result of his conviction, in that country, for criminally negligent homicide (an offence equivalent to that of manslaughter in Canada). Romania argues that the respondent has met this low threshold. HELD: The application is dismissed.  1) The respondent has not met the low threshold of non-appearance that must be considered in an extradition proceeding. The respondent's status as a Convention refugee affords an arguable basis for submitting to the Minister that he should not be surrendered to Romania.  2) Romania's submissions as to the deficiencies in the nature and extent of the sureties proffered by the respondent are compelling and the risk of non reappearance is such that it cannot be sufficiently mitigated by release conditions which, on the materials before the Court, he might be able to meet.  3) The petitioner has not established that he will surrender himself into custody were to release him. He is not a convention refugee. He has been gainfully employed and his ties to the community are not great. The petitioner's failure to abide by the terms of his community-based sentence, the nature of the sentence to which he is now subject in Romania, the exhaustion of his appeal rights in Romania and his desire not to be returned to Romania are important considerations in this case.  4) The court found that the elevated risk of flight in light of the committal order, the respondent’s failure to comply by a community- based sentence and his failure to make a claim for refugee protection pursuant to the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, and his exhaustion of appeal rights are not factors in this application.  5) The Court found that it would be non-sensical for the respondent to flee prior to the decision on surrender as this would, obviously, not stand in his favour with respect to that pending decision.  6) The fact that he is a Convention Refugee does not mean that the onus on him under s. 515 is insurmountable. It is sufficient that the petitioner has a long-term relationship and his common law spouse has agreed to act as his surety. Romania's submission as to his relationship with the community and his willingness to contribute to his employer and his Mercedes Benz C230 vehicle illustrate his inability to comply with court orders in general"
e_2017skqb265.txt,"The accused was found guilty of three counts of dangerous driving causing death, contrary to s. 249(4) of the Criminal Code, and one count of dangerous driving causing bodily harm, contrary to s. 249(3) of the Code. During his employment as professional truck driver, the accused had driven into construction zone on highway and hit another vehicle that had been stopped. The three teenage occupants of the vehicle were killed and flag person was severely injured as result of the collision. The accused was sure that he had not been asleep at the time of the accident but felt that he had not been paying attention. He had not noticed any of the signs posted at 100-metre intervals after the start of the construction zone 1.6 km south of the accident. The accused was 41 years of age. He had obtained his A-1 driver’s licence in 2009 and had clean driving abstract. He was married and had three children. He had recently been diagnosed with mild sleep apnea. He expressed remorse to the victim’s families and suffered from post-traumatic stress disorder.| HELD: The accused was sentenced to three years in imprisonment on the first count and three years concurrent for the second and third counts, and one year concurrent to the other counts on the fourth count. He was prohibited from operating a motor vehicle for five years and from possessing a firearm for 10 years after his release from imprisonment. The aggravating factors in the case were that the accused’s inattentiveness caused the death of three people and severely injured another person. The impact of the children’s deaths was devastating on their families. The accused was a professional driver and capable of exercising more skill and vigilance, especially when he was operating a semi-trailer truck in a construction zone. The mitigating factors were that the accused pled guilty and expressed profound remorse. He had not been drinking and had a clear driving record. The accused was at low risk to re-offend.","The accused was convicted of operating a motor vehicle in a manner dangerous to the public and thereby caused the death of three young flag people. The accused had been driving a semi-trailer when the collision occurred. He had been in the construction zone at normal highway speeds and did not reduce his speed. The three teenage boys were killed when their vehicle was struck in the rear by the semi-truck driven by the accused. HELD: The Court found that the accused was guilty of both offences. The Court ordered a sentence of 6 years to 7 years in federal institution.  The Court also imposed a 10 year driving prohibition pursuant to s. 718 to 718.2 of the Criminal Code. The Criminal Code provides that a sentence must be just and fair and be consistent with previous judicial decisions in this jurisdiction, if at all possible. The offence was committed in a construction zone. The defendant's unlawful conduct must be denounced.  1) The Court was satisfied that the aggravating and mitigating factors in this case were appropriate but did not take any position with regard to the length of driving prohibition. 2) The defendant was found guilty of unlawful conduct. The court found that his unlawful conduct was aggravating. 3) There was no evidence that the defendant had ever driven on a highway before May 3, 2015 and had driven through construction zone 2.6 kilometres into the night. The driver had been convicted of dangerous driving in a previous offence. The offences were found to be related to the defendant's inattention for whatever reason as he drove his huge heavy truck through the construction area. 4) The accused was found to have been in possession of a handgun. 5) The court ordered the defendant to pay $800 in victim impact statements.  6) It ordered the offender to pay the victim impact statement amounting to $1,000.00.  7) It was ordered that the Court consider all of the purposes and principles of sentencing as contained in ss. 717 to 717.2.  8) The offences dealt with the driving of the accused in relation to his education, employment and finances. 9) The offence is a serious and life-threatening offence.  10) It is an extremely high risk of mental and emotional harm to the accused and his family.  11) There is no suggestion whatsoever that alcohol and/or drugs were involved in the collision. The fundamental principle of sentence being proportionate to the gravity of the offence, as well as the degree of responsibility of the offender, must also be considered"
