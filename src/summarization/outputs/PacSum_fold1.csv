JUDGMENT B.G.
MORGAN, J INTRODUCTION[1] Nechapanuk Child and Family Services Inc. (the agency) initially applied for a long term order under s. 37(3) of The Child and Family Services Act (the Act) but has amended its application to now apply for an order that the current foster parents be declared as persons having a sufficient interest in all three children under s. 23 of the Act, and an order under s. 37(1)(b) of the Act granting them custody.
Should the amended application be granted?
[2] Pursuant to s. 31 of the Act, an Agreed Statement of Allegations and Admissions was filed at the protection hearing.
That latter statement may not always be true, but it certainly indicates the father’s present view.
A subsequent affidavit of Ms. Melita McKay, a family worker involved with these families, confirms that each of N.N., K.N.","This was an appeal from a judgment refusing to gram certiorari and other relief following findings by the respondent disciplinary panel that the appellant was guilty of professional misconduct.

No. 02430 IN THE SUPREME COURT OF NOVA SCOTIA APPEAL DIVISION Freeman, Hart, JJ.A., and Nunn J. BETWEEN: DONALD FRANK RIPLEY and PAUL POMMIER, GEORGE DUNN and RENE JARRY and THE INVESTMENT DEALERS ASSOCIATION OF CANADA respondents W. Dale Dunlop and W. Ray Wortman for appellant A. David MacAdam, Q.C., Robert L. Barnes, M.M. Fox and Alan J. Stern, Q.C., for respondents Appeal Heard: September 26, 1991 Judgment Delivered: November 18, 1991 THE COURT: Appeal dismissed from judgment of Madam Justice Roscoe refusing certiorari or other relief on review of decision of disciplinary tribunal of Investment Dealers Association per reasons for judgment of Freeman, J.A.; concurred in by Hart, J.A., and Nunn, J. FREEMAN, J.A.: This is an appeal from refusal of certiorari and other relief by Madam Justice E.A. Roscoe following findings by a disciplinary panel that the appellant had broken rules by which the investment dealers\' profession regulates itself. The appellant is Donald F. Ripley, who at material times was the regional manager, vice‑president and director of McLeod Young Weir, investment dealers. He was found guilty of four of six charges at lengthy discipline hearing conducted by panel of the Eastern Business Conduct Committee of the Investment Dealers Association of Canada. He was suspended for two years, fined $50,000 and ordered to pay costs of $65,000. The charges involved disclosure of information about the blind trust of federal cabinet minister; taking part and permitting employees to take part in ""side deals""‑‑trades in securities not approved by his head office; failing to ensure proper records were kept of the side deals; and failing to properly supervise an employee who was involved in side deals. Two other charges, numbered (i) and (iii), were dismissed on grounds that they fell within the responsibilities of the branch manager. He was found guilty on the following charges: That the respondent, at the City of Halifax in the Province of Nova Scotia, being Director and Officer of member of the Investment Dealers Association of Canada: (ii) from time to time during the period from June 12 to June 22, 1987, inclusive, disclosed and participated in the disclosure by others of information relating to the accounts of former client of the Member in manner unbecoming director and officer and did thereby commit an offence contrary to By‑Law 7.5©) (iv) during the period from October 1981 to July 1986, inclusive, from time to time participated in, and permitted certain officers, registered representatives and non‑trading employees in the office for which he was responsible to participate in, for remuneration, trading in securities issued by: Crockett McConnell Inc., IAS (1983) Limited Partnership, IAS (1984) Limited Partnership, KB Electronics Limited, Nova Scotia Hospitality (1986) Limited Partnership, Nova Scotia Hospitality (1985) Limited Partnership, One Oak Street Limited Partnership, Scotia Liquicoal Limited Research and Development, Tenwolde Brothers Company Limited, M.U.R.B. Skyline Apartments and Waterfront Place Limited Partnership, ostensibly on behalf of and in the name of the Member in manner unbecoming director and officer of the Member, and did thereby commit an offence contrary to By‑law 7.5©); (v) during the period from October, 1981 to July 1986, inclusive, the Respondent permitted certain officers, registered representatives and non‑training employees in the office for which he was responsible, to effect trades from time to time in the securities referred to in paragraph (iv) hereof without recording such transactions on the books of the member or sending to the purchasers confirmations in respect of, or monthly statements disclosing, such trades in accordance with Regulation 200, and did thereby commit an offence contrary to By‑Law 7.5(c); [and] (vi) during the period from October, 1981 to July 1986 inclusive, the respondent failed to ensure that Mr. Eric C. Hicks, registered representative of the member, was not engaged in gainful occupation other than his employment with the member without: (a) being specifically permitted to do so by the authorities administering the securities legislation of the Province of Nova Scotia; (b) the Member acknowledging its responsibility in writing to the Association for supervision of Mr. Hicks; and (c) the annual approval of the Atlantic District Council of the Association with respect to such occupation, contrary to By‑Law 18.4, and did thereby commit an offence contrary to By‑Law 7.5(c). He was found not guilty of the following: (i) during the period from the 25th day of November, 1985, to February 17, 1987, inclusive, failed to ensure that an account for client, being trust in favour of the Honourable Stewart McInnes, was opened and supervised in accordance with Regulation 1300.2, and did thereby commit an offence contrary to By‑Law 7.5 (c); [and] (iii) during the period from the 25th day of November, 1985, to February 17, 1987, inclusive, permitted trades to be effected by registered representative in the branch office for which the Respondent was responsible in discretionary account for the Honourable Stewart McInnes, without the authorization of the client being accepted by the member or approved in accordance with Regulation 1300.15 (in effect prior to September, 1986 or Regulation 1300.4 in effect thereafter) and did thereby commit an offence contrary to By‑law 7.5 (c). In his vigorous counter attack Mr. Ripley has denied the involvement alleged in the first charge and asserted that he is not the officer who should be held responsible on the remaining three. Much of his argument has been directed at the process by which he was found guilty. Respecting charge (ii), the panel made the following findings of credibility: We accept the evidence of Heather MacDonnell, Susan Kilbride and Lee Harwood, where such evidence is in conflict with Donald Ripley's evidence concerning Mr. Ripley's direct role in releasing information on the account of Stewart Maclnnes in May and June of 1987. We further accept the evidence of Frank and Kathy Nichols and Cynthia Hallett where their testimony conflicts with that of Mr. Ripley. That finding is well within the duty and jurisdiction of disciplinary board. It is devastating to Mr. Ripley's defence to charge (ii). Ms. MacDonnell, Ms. Kilbride and Mr. Harwood told of preparing and sending documents relating to the McInnes account to Sheila Copps, Liberal Member of Parliament, under Mr. Ripley's direction and with his active involvement. Mr. Harwood described numerous telephone conversations he had had with Ms. Copps at Mr. Ripley's request, reporting on their contents to Mr. Ripley. He passed documents to the press on Mr. Ripley's instructions. When the McInnes account became the centre of storm in the media, it was Mr. Harwood who informed the MacLeod Young Weir head office of what had been going on. Mr. Nichols was the MacLeod Young weir manager at Kentville, Nova Scotia. He and Mrs. Nichols and Cynthia Hallett testified to conversations with Mr. Ripley in which he predicted the media coverage of the McInnes account. In addition, Mr. and Mrs. Nichols told of Mr. Ripley leaving back‑dated letter with Mr. Nichols for him to produce as evidence in Mr. Ripley's favour. Back‑dated memoranda casting favorable light on Mr. Ripley's activities featured prominently in the hearings; they had not been received by their addressees but turned up in files, sometimes files which had been previously searched. Many of the memoranda authored by Mr. Ripley were harshly critical of Ross Montgomery, former employee of MacLeod Young Weir and the investment executive in charge of the McInnes account. The McInnes account was transferred from McLeod Young Weir to Mr. Montgomery's new firm when he left. Much testimony, as well, suggested that Mr. Ripley's obsessive hostility to Mr. Montgomery motivated him to disclose information which he hoped would be damaging to Mr. Montgomery. Once the panel made its finding as to credibility, virtually precluding any further defence on the merits, the only substantial defence option left to Mr. Ripley on charge (ii) was to impugn the disciplinary process. His basic defence on the three remaining charges involving side deals was not outright denial but attempts to downplay and justify them and spread the responsibility. The securities issues central to the charges were marketed principally by the Halifax office of MacLeod Young Weir with some involvement by other offices in the region under Mr. Ripley's supervision. They had passed statutory requirements, but Mr. Ripley was not authorized to approve them as securities to be offered to the public by McLeod Young Weir. That approval required head office scrutiny in which whey were subjected to ""due diligence"" procedure and otherwise examined to ensure they represented investments which could be offered to the public backed by the name of reputable brokerage house. They were nevertheless advertised by the Halifax office in the MacLeod Young Weir name, and some of the Halifax investment executives actively sold them. In describing the seriousness of this kind of activity the panel stated: "". Once firm decides to endorse specific investment the dealer is essentially putting his reputation on the line. An investment dealer has the followng objectives in mind when it analyzes proposed financing: (i) to evaluate the financial and business risks of the investment; (ii) to ensure that the proposed pricing is fair and compensates for the degree of risk involved; (iii) to determine the suitable type of investor for the proposed financing: and (iv) finally, to undertake ""due diligence"" process, which essentially is an investigation to ensure that the offering documents provide ""full, true and plain"" disclosure of all the pertinent facts necessary to the potential investor to make proper evaluation of the merits and suitability of the proposed investment. Via his involvement in these dealings and via his awareness of the involvement of many other employees of McLeod Young Weir Limited in similar dealings, which he often encouraged, Mr. Ripley was effectively conducting business within business for his personal profit. Consequently, he was defrauding his employer. Mr. Ripley may have been providing grave disservice to clients of McLeod Young Weir Limited by promoting securities that had not been properly vetted by personnel of McLeod Young Weir Limited who were trained and experienced The clients believed that the securities had been examined and approved by McLeod Young Weir Limited, based on their financial and business merit and their suitability as investments."" The appellant has objected to the last sentence on grounds that investors were not called and there was no evidence of what they believed. Obviously, the panel was stating what investors were entitled to believe rather than making literal finding as to what they actually believed. The panel made the findings of fact, for which there was ample evidence, necessary to support its finding that Mr. Ripley was guilty on charge (iv) of conduct unbecoming senior officer of an investment house. In finding Mr. Ripley guilty on charge (v), failing to keep proper records of the transactions in question, the panel stated: ""It is the panel's opinion that all financial transactions executed for client must be recorded on the books of the Member. Regulation 200 is very clear in this respect. It appears, however, that these security transactions were not recorded on McLeod Young Weir Limited books or client statements in order to deliberately conceal the transactions from head office. Therefore, it was consistent not to have any telltale signs of these wrongdoings recorded in the firm's books or the client accounts."" On charge (vi) the panel noted that supervising salesmen was primarily the function of the branch manager, but in view of the fact that Donald Ripley was the undisputed ""Boss"" of the Atlantic region, that he had strong personality and that he had hands-on style of management, it is inconceiveable to us that he could not have corrected decisively and quickly situations of non-compliance, such as Eric Hicks' involvemment with outside deals, had he intended to do so. The Investment Dealers Association (IDA), as explained at some length in the appellant's factum, is an unincorporated association which oversees the investment and brokerage business in Canada, serving as the professional organization of, and regulating, member brokerage houses and their employees. It is not specifically empowered under any statute, although its existence is recognized in some securities legislation. It has its own constitution, by-laws and regulations to which its members bind themselves by contract to comply. The IDA establishes requirements for capitalization, procedures for purchase, sale and registration of securities for clients, audit procedures and other matters that govern the internal and external operations of national and local investment firms. The IDA also sets standards of qualifications for, and for the discipline of, persons engaged in the industry. Its authority does not extend to regulating the actual issuance of securities: that is vested in provincial securities commissions and the various stock exchanges sold. The sale of securities is regulated by statute in all Provinces. It is the persons and the firms who sell the securities that are regulated by the IDA. The nature of associations such as the IDA was considered by the Supreme Court of Canada in the case of Orchard v. Tunney (1957), 1957 CanLII 57 (SCC), D.L.R. (2d) 273: ""In the absence of incorporation or other form of legal recognition of group of persons as having legal capacity in varying degrees to act as separate entity and in the corporate or other name to acquire rights, incur liabilities, to sue and be sued, the group is classified as volunteer association. There are many varieties of this class ranging from business partnerships, labour unions, professional, fraternal and religious societies to social clubs. ."" (page 278) Principles governing the relationship among the various members of voluntary organizations such as the IDA were considered in Stephen v. Stewart, [1944] D.L.R. (305) where MacDonald, C.J.B.C. said in the British Columbia Court of Appeal: ""A volunteer organization, having no legal entity, has its most familiar form as members club. Decisions on such clubs show that the relation of members to each other is purely contractual, the contract being found in the constitutional rules which they adopt."" (page 311) It was acknowledged that the appellant had agreed to bind himself to the by‑laws, rules and regulations of the IDA and made himself responsible for knowing their contents. IDA approval is required at various career stages beginning with securities salesman, or registered representative, and Mr. Ripley had in fact signed similar undertakings several times occasioned by his promotions. After he was found guilty of violations Mr. Ripley sought relief in the nature of certiorari, attacking the constitution and jurisdiction of the board and claiming it had failed to observe the rules of natural justice. In addition to an order quashing the panel's decision he sought an order in the nature of prohibition restraining further proceedings against him, declaration that the panel had no jurisdiction over him, declaration that the panel's decision was void for patent unreasonableness, denial of natural justice, excessive jurisdiction and reviewable error in law and further, declaration that the IDA proceeded against the appellant in bad faith. When his application was dismissed by Madam Justice Roscoe he alleged nine errors of law in his notice of appeal. Apparently these were incorporated into the following points in issue, which were the issues set out in the appellant's factum: 19. Were there any jurisdictional errors made that would deprive the Investment Dealers Association of the right to hold hearing with respect to Donald Frank Ripley? (i) Constitution of the Eastern Business Conduct Comittee Panel; (ii) Inapplicability of some of the charges; 20. Was there legal bias in the proceedings conducted against the appellant? 21. Were the rules of natural justice adhered to with respect to the appellant in the following areas: (i) The investigative process; (ii) Pre‑hearing disclosure and fairness; (iii) Rulings and decisions made during the course of the hearing; (iv) The decision; (v) Matters applicable to the penalty; 22. What remedies does the appellant have available to him?(i) Declaratory relief; (ii) The Charter of Rights Before considering appellant's complaints against the IDA and the panel, it may be useful to consider the available remedies to which they are directed. The appellant dealt with declaratory relief in his factum as follows: ""Before Madam Justice Roscoe an argument was put forward that she had the power to issue prerogative writ including certiorari. The appellant now concedes that relief of this nature is not available. However, at the very minimum this honourable court possesses the power to provide declaratory relief. This power is not only inherent, but contained expressly in the civil procedure rules. The appellant is asking for the reasons of excess of jurisdiction, bias and breach of the rules of natural justice that the decision of the panel be declared null and void."" This is essentially correct statement of the law. Madam Justice Roscoe found that certiorari for error of law on the face of the record was not available because the Business Conduct Committee panel was non-statutory tribunal, but that it was open to her to review the panel's proceedings for want of jurisdiction or breach of natural justice. She relied on Chyz v. Appraisal Institute of Canada (1985), 44 Sask R.165 in which the Saskatehewan Court of Appeal was considering the finding of the trial judge that ""certiorari and prohibition, generally speaking, will not lie against private body which derives its jurisdiction from the consent of its members banded together in voluntary organization."" After comprehensive review of the case law Tallis, J.A. found that ""domestic tribunals (are) subject to the principles of natural justice and procedural fairness."" Remedies included declaratory or injunctive relief. As quoted in Administrative Law and Practice, Second Edition, Reid David, at 367, Laskin, J. stated in Association of Radio and T.V. Employees v. C.B.C., 1973 CanLII 182 (SCC), [1975] S.C.R. 118 at p. 137 that ""The effect of what was said [in the influential case of Port Arthur Shipbuilding Co. v. Arthurs, [1969] S.C.R. 85] is to deny homage to technicallty, and to make it clear that where the proceedings to review decision of board of arbitration are by way of motion to quash or to set aside the award, dispensing with the issue of writ of certiorari, it matters not whether the board is or is not statutory tribunal in any strict sense."" In R. v. Board of Arbitration, Ex parte Cumberland Railway Co. (1968), 67 D.L.R. (2d) McKinnon J.A., then of this court found an arbitration board to be private board set up by the parties themselves. It was not statutory body, and certiorari did not lie. He nevertheless found there had been legal misconduct on the part of the chairman and set aside the award. While prerogative writs do not lie against the panel as domestic tribunal, its proceedings are reviewable for want of jurisdiction or breaches of natural justice, which would include bias, as Madam Justice Roscoe found. The remedy, as in Saskatchewan, would be declaratory or injunctive relief. In asserting a right to relief under the Charter the appellant did not contend that sections 7 and 11 of the Charter create any new rights not already available as rules of natural justice, but rather seeks the remedies available under s. 24(1) of the Charter. He reviewed Retail, Wholesale and Department Store Union, Local 580 v. Dolphin Delivery Limited, 1986 CanLII (SCC), [1986] S.C.R. 573, which established that the Charter regulates the relations between government and private persons, but does not regulate the relations between private persons and private persons. The appellant argues that the IDA is involved in public activity and engaged in government action pursuant to the Securities Act, in which the IDA is recognized, and cannot therefore be considered private person. Madam Justice Roscoe considered the appellant's right to Charter relief and concluded: ""The respondent submits that recognition of the IDA in the Securities Act does not transform it into government actor to which the Charter applies, and relies on Harrison v. The University British Columbia,1988 CanLII 183 (BC CA), [1988] W.W.R. 688 (B.C.C.A.) and McKinney v. University of Guelph (1987), 1987 CanLII 179 (ON CA), 63 O.R. (2d) (O.C.A.) where the 'government control' and 'government function' tests were developed. Neither of those tests would, in my view, extend the operation of the Charter to the activities of the I.D.A. The respondent also refers to several cases where the applicability of the Charter to self‑governing bodies was discussed, including the Chyz and Peg‑Win cases, supra. agree with the respondent's submission that the courts have consistently applied the Charter to statutorily mandated professional associations, but not to voluntary private associations even when they are statutorily recognized. As indicated, when dealing with the question as to whether certiorari would lie, find there is no government control or government function being exercised by the IDA, and since its powers are derived from contract, the Charter is not applicable to its actions."" On the appeal the appellant relied heavily on Roger R. Wigglesworth v. Her Majesty the Queen (1988), 1987 CanLII 41 (SCC), 45 D.L.R. (4th) 235 (S.C.C.), in which Madame Justice Wilson developed the ""true penal consequences"" test which would make Charter relief available when ""a fine by its magnitude would appear to be imposed for the purpose of redressing the wrong done to society at large rather than to the maintenance of internal discipline within the limited sphere of activity."" The IDA by‑laws give it the power to impose fines up to $100,000. While that amount is substantial, it must be borne in mind that the IDA's purpose is to regulate profession in which breaches of rules relating to the sale of securities can result in gains of great magnitude. Without that power to fine the IDA would be hampered in imposing discipline upon its members. It may be inferred that members of the securities industry contract to regulate themselves because it is to their advantage to do so. An obvious benefit is the avoidance of the need for government regulation in field where the need for protection of the public might otherwise attract it. party to such contract cannot have it both ways; if he enjoys benefits from contract which excludes government intervention from his profession, he cannot claim Charter protection when he is accused of breaching the conditions of his contract. There was no error of law on Madam Justice Roscoe\'s part in finding that the Charter has no application in the present case. Therefore the appellant will succeed on this appeal if, and only if, the record shows Madam Justice Roscoe committed reversible error in failing to determine that the disciplinary panel exceeded its jurisdiction or breached the rules of natural justice, which include bias. The appellants points will be considered in sequence. CONSTITUTION OF THE PANEL By-law 11.23 of the IDA requires that panel of the Eastern Business Conduct Committee have at least three members at least one of whom resides outside the district. Members residing in the district were ,canvassed and for variety of reasons none could serve. All of the members of the panel hearing the charges against Mr. Ripley came from Quebec or Ontario. The appellant now submits that ""the lack of Atlantic District representation on the panel made the composition of that panel ultra vires and thus it lacked jurisdiction to hear the charge against him."" He asserts that ""the reason why local representation is important, other than being judged by one's peers, is to ensure that local standards and practices are understood by the panel."" By‑law 11.23 contemplates but does not require representation from within the district of the person charged. Whatever may be the meri‑t of the appellant's argument, it is not sufficient to deprive the panel of jurisdiction. Nor can support be found for his contention that the IDA acted in bad faith in determining the membership of the panel. It was established consistently with its by‑laws, by which Mr. Ripley had agreed to be bound. Many representatives from this district who declined to serve did so to avoid the appearance of interest or bias‑‑which is the contrary of bad faith. Madam Justice Roscoe found it had been open to Mr. Ripley to call evidence‑‑and would agree with her that the burden was on him‑‑of local standards and procedures. No such evidence was called. would dismiss the appellant's first point relating to the constitution of the panel. INAPPLICABILITY OF SOME OF THE CHARGES do not agree with the appellant's allegations that the IDA acted unreasonably and in bad faith in charging him with infractions in charges (i) and (iii) that were ""clearly not his responsibility."" It was open to the IDA to lay the charges, and Mr. Ripley can hardly complain when the panel found him not guilty. The appellant contends that charges (iv), (v) and (vi) did not disclose specific wrongdoing. These charged him with three specific breaches of by‑law (c) which establishes disciplinary jurisdiction for engaging in any business conduct or practice 'which is unbecoming to partner, director or officer or which is detrimental to the public interest. As senior official of MacLeod Young Weir with many years of experience in the securities business the appellant was as aware as any member of the panel of what would constitute unbecoming conduct. The evidence, including the memoranda Mr. Ripley authored, makes it clear he fully appreciated the concept. If he did not, he had bound himself contractually to find out. In Morton v. Registered Nurses Association (1989), 92 N.S.R. (2d) 154 Nathanson, J. reviewed the case law and stated: ""Implicit in the concept of profession is the existence of standards which are benchmarks for the practice of the professional. The standards may be written or unwritten."" In dismissing the appellant's arguments on this point would agree with Madam Justice Roscoe: ""Even if the Board's findings were wrong, since this is not an appeal, and since the interpretation and application of the regulation and the by‑law was within their jurisdiction, the court should not interfere with their decision. Certainly their interpretation could not be considered to be patently unreasonable, under the circumstances."" LEGAL BIAS The appellant's submission is that "". the ability of the IDA to act and be seen to act impartially in investigating, prosecuting and adjudicating the complaints against the Appellant was coloured by the statements and representations of IDA officials and their close association with McLeod."" He relies on ""the Marshall Crowe case"", Committee for Justice and Liberty v. National Energy Board (1976), 1976 CanLII (SCC), N.R. 115 (S.C.C.) in which Mr. Justice de Grandpré said: ""The apprehension of bias must be reasonable one held by reasonable and right minded persons, applying themselves to the question and obtaining thereon the required information. In the words of the Court of Appeal that test is what would an informed person viewing this matter realistically and practically and having thought the matter through, conclude? The appellant raises number of matters which he alleges give rise to reasonable apprehension of bias: (a) statements made by officials who investigated on behalf of IDA suggesting they considered Mr. Ripley guilty before the hearing, coupled with the fact that they did not interview Sheila Copps who did not believe Mr. Ripley was the source of her information. (b) an uncompleted settlement agreement between IDA and Mr. Ripley in which he accepted responsibility for failure of supervision resulting in the McInnes trust leak, but no direct knowledge of leaked information; it was withdrawn by both sides before receiving required approval by two members of the disciplinary committee after further information became available following an internal investigation by McLeod Young Weir. (c) an alleged ""close association"" between McLeod and the IDA; McLeod was offered, and declined, the right to cross‑examine during the hearing, which the appellant argued would have faced him with two prosecutors, one able to cross examine. He contends: ""the IDA appeared to act as an advocate of McLeod and, as such, its prosecution is tainted with the appearance of impartiality."" The appellant relied primarily on Re McGavin Toastmaster Ltd. and Powlowski (1973), 1973 CanLII 1330 (MB CA), 37 DLR (3d) 100 and McBain v. Canada Human Rights Commission (1985), 1985 CanLII 3160 (FCA), 62 N.R. 117 (F.C.A.). In McGavin The Manitoba Human Rights Commission investigated company accused of discrimination against two employees. It wrote the employer stating that after ""a full review of these cases"" the Commission had resolved that certain undertakings by the company, including reinstatement and payment of back wages, be given in settlement. When the company objected, the commission held board of inquiry, which confirmed the previous conclusions, and reported to the Attorney General, who issued an order demanding the same compliance the Commission had. The appeal court upheld certiorari order because the applicant company ""was exposed to an inquiry which fell below the standards of objective impartiality and adherence to natural justice which the law demands and to which they are entitled. justice demanded consummate care on their part in the procedures to be followed in disposing of the complaints."" In McBain complaint of sexual harrassment in the workplace was investigated by an investigator appointed by the Human Rights Commission who reported back that the complaint was ""substantiated."" The Commission appointed human rights tribunal and acted as prosecutor of the complaint before the tribunal. The tribunal also found the complaint ""substantiated."" The Commmission ordered McBain to pay compensation. He appealed. The Federal Court of appeal found there was reasonable apprehension of bias in the commission appointing the tribunal to judge cause in which the commission was prosecutor. ""Substantiated"" meant the same in both the section of the statute providing for the investigator and the section and related to the Tribunal. The court applied the ""consummate care"" test from McGavin and found it had not been met. Neither had the Crowe test been met. McBain must be considered closely, because of obvious similarities to the present case: the IDA played role equivalent to that of Human Rights Commission in McBain, causing an investigation, appointing the tribunal and providing the prosecutor. Any professional organization which conducts its own disciplinary hearings must follow similar pattern. The distinguishing feature in the ratio of McBain is that under the relevant statute the tribunal was hearing evidence on question already determined by the investigator: that the complaint was ""substantiated."" In arriving at the same finding the tribunal could not avoid the appearance of rubber‑stamping the conclusion of the investigator, giving rise to an apprehension of bias. In the circumstances of that case the Federal Court of Appeal did add, in obiter, that ""It is my opinion that even if the statute only required the Commission to decide whether there was sufficient evidence to warrant the appointment of tribunal, reasonable evidence of bias would still exist."" However in distinguishing Re Caccamo and Minister of Manpower and Immigration (1977), 1977 CanLII 1724 (FCA), 16 N.R. 405; 75 DLR (3d) 720 the court stated: ""In Caccamo there was no suggestion that the Department had taken the firm position in advance of the inquiry that the allegations against the appellant had been substantiated. The press release simply stated the position that the Department was going to take at the special inquiry. That is quite different situation from the one at bar where the commission, after deciding that the complaint has been substantiated, chooses the part‑time judges who will hear the complaint, and at that hearing takes the position that its earlier decision was correct. Such scheme represents after‑the‑fact justification for decision already made by it and before judges of its own choosing."" The appellant argues that the so‑called settlement agreement fixed the IDA with belief in his guilt. Even if that argument is accepted, that belief was limited to the infraction described in the agreement. The subject matter of the agreement was that of the first charge, of which Mr. Ripley was found not guilty by the panel. That argument is without merit. The investigators were officials of the IDA employed to police the profession. Their conclusion was that hearing was warranted on the charges, not that Mr. Ripley was guilty of them. The persons they interviewed and the conclusions they reached privately bear only remotely on the ability of the panel authorized by the IDA to conduct an impartial hearing. There is little in the evidence to suggest complicity between IDA and McLeod. The appellant says the prospect of bias was inherent in the panel's invitation to McLeod to appear, present evidence and cross‑examine witnesses. The respondent points out that the panel was obliged to do so under IDA by‑laws 7.6 and 18.6. McLeod declined to take an active part in the proceedings. The appellant's activities necessarily involved McLeod as the IDA member who employed him, and McLeod was itself charged by the IDA in connection with the same matters. Madam Justice Roscoe considered the McGavin and McBain cases and appeared to accept the respondent's argument that they are distinguishable from the present case because the adjudicators are ""clearly distinct and independent from the investigators."" She stated: ""It should be noted that, by virtue of the I.D.A. by‑laws, the panel that acted as adjudicators was comprised of members of the Eastern Business Conduct Committee, standing committee of the Association. The actual members of that committee, who formed the panel, were chosen by the chairman of the committee. Neither Mr. Clarke, as the investigating officer, nor Mr. Kniewasser, as President (of the IDA), were members of the Eastern Business Conduct Commitee, nor did they have any input into the selection of the Committee, nor were they involved in any of its deliberations. The arguments being made by the applicant, if accepted would, at the most, establish bias on behalf of the investigators, and in the absence of any evidence relating to the three members of the disciplinary panel, who were the decision makers, the fact that all concerned were connected with the IDA, is not sufficient to raise reasonable apprehension of bias."" The panel had its own counsel, independent from the counsel engaged by the IDA to prosecute the charges. am satisfied that the process, from inquiry through to the determination of the panel, was handled by the IDA with ""consummate care"" to preserve ""standards of objective impartiality and adherence to natural justice which the law demands and to which (the appellant was) entitled."" (See McGavin) am satisfied, as well, that the Crowe test was met: ""an informed person‑‑viewing this matter realistically and practically and having thought the matter through""‑‑would conclude there was no reason for apprehending bias. POINT THREE‑‑INVESTIGATIVE PROCESS The appellant has placed much emphasis on the inclusion of charges (i) and (iii), of which the appellant was found not guilty. ""For example,"" he argues, ""the decision to lay charges which were totally inapplicable to the appellant can lead not only to loss of jurisdiction, but can also be categorized as an example of bad faith."" It is difficult to conclude that the first charge was ""totally inapplicable"" when the appellant had already admitted his culpability in the settlement agreement. POINT THREE‑‑PRE—HEARING DISCLOSURE AND FAIRNESS The appellant has complained consistently that certain notes and documents he left at McLeod Young Weir were not made available to him, and he has brought separate legal action against McLeod respecting them. Madam Justice Roscoe found that ""there is no evidence in this case which indicates that the tribunal or its counsel or counsel for the IDA had any information that was not provided to Mr. Ripley. Given that the IDA did everything in its power to obtain information for Mr. Ripley and given that there was no other evidence that, in fact, any other notes even existed, am unable to find that there has been denial of natural justice or an excess of jurisdiction in relation to this complaint."" She made no error of law in so finding. POINT THREE‑‑RULINGS AND DECISIONS Ross Montgomery The IDA refused to call Ross Montgomery, alleged target of Mr. Ripley's hostility, on grounds that he was unreliable and lacking in credibility. The respondent argues that his evidence in any event was only relevant to the dismissed charges, (i) and (iii). The panel had him called as its own witness, making him subject to cross‑examination by both sides. That strikes me as fair solution. Madam Justice Roscoe found it was within the jurisdiction of the panel to do so; there was no evidence of bad faith. The July 21 Meeting The appellant, representatives of McLeod and their counsel met on July 21, 1988, and agreed discussions should remain confidential. reference was made to the Supreme Court of Ontario to determine if disclosure was required. The IDA took the position that both McLeod and the appellant were bound by their undertakings to make full disclosure to the association. McLeod agreed; the appellant did not. The panel ruled that witnesses must answer questions put to them respecting the meeting. Mr. Ripley continued to object to details of the meeting being disclosed. Lacking the power to compel testimony, the panel considered its options in the words of its chairman, Paul Pommier: ""The panel maintains its position that it wants to hear the witnesses of the July 21st meeting particularly Mr. Grasmuck and Mr. Taylor who have already testified. Now should Mr. Ripley, through his counsel, maintain his position the panel to date has looked at different alternatives, will continue to look at different alternatives. Presently they would appear to be the following: we could suspend the present hearings and await for the outcome of the decision by the Supreme Court of Ontario, which may settle the matter for us. Now if that decision ‑‑if we did suspend and that decision did not settle the matter for us, we would look at few other alternatives. One would be to continue the present hearings and view very harshly the refusal to waive confidentiality. Or, decide to conclude the meeting and consider immediate suspension and make recommendations to the IDA as to possible other suspensions. We will now go on with the present hearings."" It is submitted by the appellant that the chairman's remarks are threats amounting to bad faith by the panel. ""Its decision to require disclosure of the substance of the meeting was patently unreasonable and denial of natural justice."" The panel was under duty to consider relevant evidence and it had the right to consider its alternatives if evidence it considered potentially relevant was denied to it. Rulings as to the duty of witnesses to answer questions were entirely within the panel's jurisdiction; weighing alternatives in those circumstances was not bad faith. Interference with Cross‑Examination Witnesses who requested that they have their own counsel at the hearing were permitted to do so. The appellant complains, particularly with respect to Lee Harwood, that his testimony or cross‑examination was ""repeatedly interrupted by objections from his counsel. The inability to develop line of cross‑examination without fear of objection resulted in severe restriction on the right to cross‑examination."" The respondent counted eight objections by Mr. Harwood's counsel, many to ensure he had been shown documents on which he was being questioned, or that he be permitted to complete his answers. There were no questions he was held exempt from answering. This complaint is included among those Madam Justice Roscoe described as having ""little or no merit."" Cancellation of the Penalty Hearing After the appellant was found guilty on four charges date was set for hearing as to penalty. The appellant did not attend and his counsel produced medical excuses. Counsel for the IDA objected to an adjournment. The panel cancelled the hearing and set date for written submissions. am aware of nothing in the by‑laws, nor in the rules of natural justice, to require oral submissions on penalty rather than written ones. The appellant declined to make written submission. That was his choice; it did not invalidate the process. DECISION‑‑No Evidence The appellant's basis for arguing that the panel lost jurisdiction by deciding matter without evidence is based on the panel's observation that ""the clients believed that the securities had been examined and approved by McLeod Young Weir "". have dealt with this above. It is without merit. Failure to Consider Relevant Matters This point relates to evidence as to how the McLeod head office responded to certain payments sent from the Halifax office related to side deals. Head office knowledge of the side deals had little relevance to Mr. Ripley's guilt or innocence. Whether some officials in Toronto knew what was going on or not, Mr. Ripley was found to have countenanced dealings in securities knowing they had not gone through the approval process. Unreasonable and Contradictory Findings The examples offered of unreasonable and contradictory findings are unconvincing and lack substance; most relate to credibility. Even giving the argument its full weight, in the absence of any evidence of bias or bad faith the panel's findings were within its jurisdiction and within the bounds of the rules of natural justice. PENALTY The penalty of $50,000 fine and $65,000 costs coupled with two-year suspension is obviously an onerous one for Mr. Ripley, who is 56 years old and claims to have exhausted his personal financial resources on his defence. It is however well within the jurisidiction provided by the IDA by-laws, to the observance of which Mr. Ripley had bound himself. Considering the responsibilities of the position which he abused, and the opportunity for personal gain flowing from the dealings in unauthorized securities, the penalty is not unreasonable nor contrary to the dictates of natural justice. CONCLUSION In denying the application for certiorari and prohibition Madam Justice Roscoe held ""I find that the Investment Dealers Association of Canada had jurisdiction over Mr. Ripley to conduct disciplinary hearings. I find that the panel was properly consitituted in accordance with the by‑laws of the IDA, that it acted within its jurisdiction, that there is no evidence of bad faith on the part of the panel members and that it complied with the rules of natural justice. The appellant has not shown she erred in law. would dismiss the appeal. Freeman, J.A. Concurred in: Hart, J.A. Nunn, J. 1990 S.H.

IN THE QUEEN’S BENCH (FAMILY LAW DIVISION) JUDICIAL CENTRE OF REGINA BETWEEN: CHRISTINE JAMES and RYAN MATTHEW ROSS (ROLLHEISER) RESPONDENT Jeffrey P. Reimer for the petitioner Donald G. Findlay for the respondent JUDGMENT DAWSON J. November 19, 2003 [1] At issue on this application is the interim custody of Keanna Marie James (Ross), child of the petitioner Christine James and the respondent Ryan Ross (Rollheiser) and, child support. INTERIM CUSTODY BACKGROUND FACTS [2] By way of background, the parties began to cohabit in May of 1998. In May of 1999, Keanna was born. Although there is conflicting affidavit evidence with regard to the date the parties ceased to cohabit, it is somewhere in the period between October of 1999 and April of 2000. Since the time the parties ceased to cohabit, Keanna has resided with the petitioner. The respondent has had access. [3] The respondent states in his affidavit dated October 3, 2003, that the parties had an arrangement in May and June of 2000, where the parties would “switch Keanna back and forth every second day,” and that after that the respondent had access to Keanna every weekend until November 2002 when, the respondent alleges, the petitioner ended access. The respondent says that in February 2003, the respondent was “allowed to have Keanna every second weekend, except for period of two weeks in March.” [4] The petitioner denies in her reply affidavit dated October 8, 2002, that the parties had any arrangement switching Keanna every second day or every weekend. She states that the parties had an arrangement from the outset whereby the respondent would see Keanna every second weekend and that is what happened. The petitioner asserts that the every second weekend access was interrupted over the years “by couple of violent episodes instigated by Ryan.” Counsel for the petitioner argued in chambers that the respondent made no attempts at gaining custody until he was served with the application of the petitioner. [5] have also reviewed the various affidavits of some of the family members and relatives of the parties. Although they are of no assistance in assisting me in determining the specific time periods wherein the respondent purported to have access to the child, they are nevertheless all consistent in establishing one thing; that the respondent did, in fact, have plenty of access to the child at various times from 1999 to 2003. [6] The petitioner herself, in her affidavit dated September 2, 2003, admits that since the parties ceased to cohabit, the respondent has “exercised access with their daughter on fairly regular basis.” As well, in her subsequent affidavit dated October 8, 2003, the petitioner confirms various access arrangements that the parties had, save for those she explicitly disputes. [7] The surplus of the various affidavits of the parties to the applications consist of accusations and constant strife about past access arrangements. The affidavits of the parties and their family members and relatives satisfy me that both parties are loving parents to their child. will also say that the mutual love and acceptance demonstrated by the families and relatives of each party, along with the overall concern for the best interests of the child, is self-evident and commendable. INTERIM CUSTODY LAW AND ANALYSIS [8] The purpose of an interim custody order is to give person the right and duty to care for child until permanent order or another interim order is made. On an interim application, the focus differs from that of permanent custody hearing. Rather than focussing on the long-term best interests of the child, court focusses on the short-term needs of the child. As a result, interim orders usually reinforce the status quo in an attempt to reflect on the best interests of the child. [9] Sections and of The Children’s Law Act, 1997, S.S. 1997, c. C-8.2 prescribe the relevant considerations in determining interim custody: 6(1) Notwithstanding sections to 5, on the application of parent or other person having, in the opinion of the court, sufficient interest, the court may, by order: (a) grant custody of or access to child to one or more persons; (b) determine any aspect of the incidents of the right to custody or access; and (c) make any additional order that the court considers necessary and proper in the circumstances. (2) Where the court grants custody of child to parent pursuant to subsection (1), the court, where in its opinion it would be in the best interests of the child to do so, may by order, authorize the parent to appoint person: (a) to have custody of the child on the parent’s death; (b) to be the guardian of the property of the child on the parent’s death; or (c) to have both of the duties mentioned in clauses (a) and (b). (3) On an application and prior to making an order pursuant to subsection (1), the court may make or vary an interim order on any terms and conditions it considers appropriate. ... In making, varying or rescinding an order for custody of child, the court shall: (a) have regard only for the best interests of the child and for that purpose shall take into account: (i) the quality of the relationship that the child has with the person who is seeking custody and any other person who may have close connection with the child; (ii) the personality, character and emotional needs of the child; (iii) the physical, psychological, social and economic needs of the child; (iv) the capacity of the person who is seeking custody to act as legal custodian of the child; (v) the home environment proposed to be provided for the child; (vi) the plans that the person who is seeking custody has for the future of the child; and (vii) the wishes of the child, to the extent the court considers appropriate, having regard to the age and maturity of the child; (b) not take into consideration the past conduct of any person unless the conduct is relevant to the ability of that person to act as parent of child; and (c) make no presumption and draw no inference as between parents that one parent should be preferred over the other on the basis of the person’s status as father or mother. [10] In considering an interim application the following questions might be posed, as noted by James G. McLeod in his book, Child Custody, Law Practice, 3d ed. (Toronto: Thomson Canada Limited, 1992, looseleaf, updated 2003): (a) Where and with whom is the child residing at the time of the interim hearing? (b) Where and with whom had the child been residing in the immediate past? (c) If there has been change in the child’s residence or primary caregiver in the recent past, why was the change made and who participated in the decision? (d) Are the child’s current living arrangements suitable for the child, taking into consideration the short-term needs of the child and the temporary nature of the order? (e) Is the current caregiver suitable role model and able to meet the child’s needs? (f) Are there any problems with the child’s current parenting or living arrangements? (g) Is there any reason to change the child’s current parenting or living arrangements? [11] Here I must take into account the current status quo, namely, that the child has and does reside with the petitioner, with access and visitation arrangements to the respondent. Keanna is doing well and has loving, stable relationship with her mother. The petitioner has provided suitable care and has met Keanna’s needs. Notwithstanding the instances of suspended access, the arrangements for access appear to have worked relatively well and appear to be in Keanna’s best interests. There is plenty of affidavit evidence to support this: (a) The petitioner admits that “in general, Ryan loves Keanna” and has exercised access to her on fairly regular basis; (b) Both parties have been willing to make arrangements in the past; (c) Efforts have been made by the respondent at contact with the child. (d) Efforts have been made by the respondent to make the child feel comfortable, happy while at his home; (e) Efforts have been made by the family members and relatives of both families to provide living environment for the child; and (f) Evidence that the child expresses content and joy with the respondent and his family (including new sister). [12] The respondent wishes to change the status quo on an interim basis to have Keanna reside with him every second week. The respondent has stated in an affidavit that he maintains odd work hours and suggests that if he had equal time with his daughter, his present wife would care for Keanna rather than having Keanna go to daycare as she presently does. This would be significant change in the status quo and one that is not yet established to be in Keanna’s best interests. [13] Based on the evidence before me, I make an order for interim custody to the petitioner with access to the respondent. The order is consistent with previous decisions of this Court. See for example Green v. Anderson, [1996] S.J. No. 752 (QL) (Q.B.), Kwok v. MacDonald, [1997] S.J. No. 478 (QL) (Q.B.), Hudson v. Hudson, 2000 SKQB 192 (CanLII); (2000), 192 Sask. R. 274 (Q.B.), Yurchak v. Yurchak, 2000 SKQB 213 (CanLII); (2000), 192 Sask. R. 312 (Q.B.), Prettyshield-Nicholls v. Maloughney, 2002 SKQB 299 (CanLII); [2002] S.J. No. 440 (QL) (Q.B.), and G.J.S. v. L.J.M., 2002 SKQB 417 (CanLII); [2002] S.J. No. 610 (QL) (Q.B.). [14] Both parents were ordered to complete the Parenting After Separation course. Both parties must file certificate of completion once the course is completed. [15] The parties raised in their material the issue of each other’s lack of cooperation and communication. While am not in position, at this stage, to decide whether or not the accusations of each party are substantiated, can say, with relative certainty, that there is an unhealthy degree of constant bickering. Keanna is likely affected to varying degrees by the discord between the parties. would go on to comment that it is evident that as long as the parties work on establishing better communication, the child will benefit from contact with both parents, with minimal disruption. [16] Accordingly, there will be the following order: (a) The petitioner shall have interim custody of Keanna Ross (James); (b) The respondent shall have reasonable access including every second weekend, reasonable telephone access and reasonable access during holiday periods. INTERIM CHILD SUPPORT [17] The respondent, on October 15, 2003, was ordered to file year to date income information. That has now been filed. find the respondent’s income for the purposes of interim child support to be $23,175.00. The respondent shall pay interim child support in the amount of $193.00 per month commencing on December 1, 2003 and a like amount on the first day of each month thereafter until further order. [18] find the petitioner’s income for the purposes of interim child support to be $4,921.96 (the average of her 2000 and 2001 income). [19] find the child care costs to be $125.00 per month. The respondent shall pay his proportionate share of childcare costs (being 82.5%) in the amount of $103.00 per month commencing with $206.00 payable forthwith for October and November, 2003 and like amount on the first day of each month thereafter until further order.

MacGillivray Law Office Inc. et al 2001NSSC164] BETWEEN: TOWN OF NEW GLASGOW and MACGILLIVRAY LAW OFFICE INCORPORATED, MACGILLICUDDY’S RESTAURANT INC. and JAMIE FRANK MACGILLIVRAY Respondents DECISION HEARD BEFORE: The Honourable Justice John M. Davison PLACE HEARD: New Glasgow, Nova Scotia DATES HEARD: September 27, 2001 DECISION DATE: September 27, 2001 (Orally) WRITTEN RELEASE: November 15, 2001 COUNSEL: David F. Wallace, Q.C. for the Applicant Jamie MacGillivray for the Respondents DAVISON, J.: (Orally) [1] The Town of New Glasgow (the Town) makes application pursuant to s.266 of the Municipal Government Act, 1998 S.N.S. c.18 directing the removal of a ground sign erected at 152 Provost Street in New Glasgow. It is alleged that the erection of the sign violates the Town of New Glasgow’s Municipal Planning Strategy and Land Use By-law. Section 266(3) of the Municipal Government Act provides: (3) The Supreme Court may hear and determine the matter at any time and, in addition to any other remedy or relief, may make an order (a) restraining the continuance or repetition of an offence in respect of the same property; (b) directing the removal or destruction of any structure or part of structure that contravenes any order, regulation, municipal planning strategy, land-use by-law, development agreement or statement in force in accordance with this Part and authorizing the municipality or the Director, where an order is not complied with, to enter upon the land and premises with necessary workers and equipment and to remove and destroy the structure, or part of it, at the expense of the owner; (c) as to the recovery of the expense of removal and destruction and for the enforcement of this Part, order, regulation, land-use by-law or development agreement and for costs as is deemed proper, and an order may be interlocutory, interim or final. [2] The respondents’ position is that the by-laws are a violation of the rights of the respondents under s. 2(b) of the Charter of Rights and Freedoms and the violation is reasonably and demonstrably justifiable within the meaning of s. 1 of the Charter. The application was supported by two affidavits of Gary Rankin who is the Chief Administrative Officer of the Town of New Glasgow. The affiant states that in the records of the Town, MacGillivray Law Office Inc. is the owner of 152 Provost Street, New Glasgow, Nova Scotia and that the alleged offending sign was erected in November 2000 and it advertises the law office business of MacGillivray Law Office Inc. and the restaurant business of MacGillicuddy’s Restaurant Inc. One of the respondents is Jamie Frank MacGillivray who is acting as the counsel for the corporate respondents. [3] The affidavit indicates that Mr. MacGillivray was advised that development permit was required to permit the erection of the sign, and that would not be granted under the Land Use By-law since the sign was third party sign in that it was situate on property and advertising businesses situate on other properties. The second affidavit of Mr. Rankin would indicate that Mr. MacGillivray advised that he would not remove the sign and that he was further advised that the sign offended the Town’s Land Use By-law in that it was erected without development permit. The sign also exceeded an area that was permitted by the downtown core zone and the sign was third party sign which was not permitted in the downtown core zone. [4] The subsequent affidavit of Mr. Rankin would indicate that he has made search of the Registry of Deeds and has been advised that there have been conveyances of land and that the relevant land is now owned by MacGillivray Properties Ltd., company incorporated on December 5, 2000. [5] The properties are located within the downtown core (C-1) zone pursuant to the Town of New Glasgow’s Municipal Planning Strategy and Land Use By-law. The sign consists of two faces and the maximum area for such sign under the by-laws is 50 square feet. The sign exceeds that area. [6] There is no dispute that the respondents admit that the ground sign offends the by-laws in that it was erected without development permit, it has two sign faces which exceed in area that is permitted in the downtown core zone, and it is third party sign which is not permitted in the downtown core zone. In view of these admissions and in view of not wishing to infringe on the time of counsel, will not take the time to repeat the wording of the by-laws. [7] The issues are whether or not the provisions of the by-laws offend s. 2(b) of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms, and if they do infringe on the respondents’ freedom of expression, are the limits imposed demonstrably justified pursuant to s. of the Charter. [8] It is clear from Irwin Toy Ltd. v. Quebec A.G., 1989 CanLII 87 (SCC), [1989] 1 S.C.R. 927 that advertising is a form of expression and falls within the scope of s. 2(b) of the Charter. [9] refer to Nichol (Township) v. McCarthy Signs Co., 1997 CanLII 1680 (ON CA), [1997] 33 O.R.(3d) 771 which is decision of the Ontario Court of Appeal and which has facts and issues similar to the proceeding before me. In that case the by-laws prohibited the erection of sign without permit and stipulated that sign had to relate to the property on which it was located. In that case the respondent Town conceded that the by-law limited freedom of expression, but the Court of Appeal determined the by-law constituted reasonable limit on freedom of expression under s. of the Charter. [10] The objective of the by-law in that case is similar to the objective in the proceeding before me. It was to reduce the proliferation of billboard advertisement and to prohibit distraction to motorists. [11] Under the heading, “signs”, in the New Glasgow Planning Strategy, it is said that signs can have significant impact upon the esthetic character of the Town. In some circumstances, signage can be distracting and poses safety concerns to both pedestrians and vehicular operators. In an attempt to maintain an esthetically pleasing environment and minimize adverse impacts on adjacent properties and reduce safety concern, some degree of control over signage will be undertaken by the Town. There is also reference in the Land Use By-law under paragraph 3.6.1 which is headed “Purpose”. The reference reads: The purpose of the following sign regulations is to: (a) support commercial use as ability to attract solid customer base; and (b) maintain the character of the Town by minimizing the adverse impacts of signs on adjacent properties and the street scape; [12] As stated, the objectives of the by-laws in the McCarthy Sign case are similar to the objectives of the by-laws in this proceeding, and are found to be pressing and substantial. The opinion of the court was the limiting measures of the by-law were rationally connected to the objective. It was determined that the means used by the township to achieve its goal through the by-law was reasonable and proportionate to the infringement of the appellant’s right of freedom of expression. [13] Reference is also made to the R. v. Pinehouse Plaza Pharmacy Ltd. (1991), 1991 CanLII 7949 (SK CA), 62 C.C.C. (3d) 321, and in that case the Saskatchewan Court of Appeal stated: There can be no doubt of the need for such policy in an urban industrial society. Regulation of land use to ensure the health, welfare and general well‑being of the inhabitants is of primary importance. [14] In my view there is no question that in municipality it is desirable to regulate the erection of signs both from the point of view of the safety of motorists and pedestrians and from the point of view of maintaining the attractiveness of community. The by-laws in this case, I find, are both pressing and substantial. [15] The issue turns to whether the limiting measures of the by-law are rationally connected to the objective, and agree with the comments of the solicitor for the applicant Town, as contained in his written brief, that the limiting measures of the by-law are rationally connected to the objective. The by-law serves to restrict overly large advertisements by regulating the size of signs and to reduce the proliferation of signs by prohibiting those not relating to the property on which they are located or to business or activity lawfully conducted thereon. Further, the restrictions on the size of the signs are not arbitrary. Most importantly, there is an overall development plan in place which organizes the Town into different zones, with varying restrictions on signs, depending on the zone. [16] find that the restrictions on the freedom of expression rights are rational as they are based on preserving and facilitating the Town’s planning goals. [17] I find that the by-laws also have minimal impairment on the rights of the respondents. It does not completely prohibit signs and permits a large range of signs with certain restrictions upon size in specific areas in accordance with its objectives. The restrictions regulate how and where the signs can be placed and does not prevent advertising, but only limits it. [18] When we look at the Charter, s. reads: The Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms guarantees the rights and freedoms set out in it, subject only to such reasonable limits prescribed by law as can be demonstrably justified in free and democratic society. [19] The onus of proving that limit on right or freedom guaranteed by the Charter is reasonable and demonstrably justified in free and democratic society, rests upon the party seeking to uphold the limitation. In that respect, refer to R. v. Big Drug Mart Limited, 1985 CanLII 69 (SCC), [1985] S.C.R. 295. [17] To establish limit on Charter right as reasonable and demonstrably justified in free and democratic society, two separate criteria must be met. First, the objective of the measure responsible for limiting the Charter right or freedom must be of sufficient importance to warrant overriding constitutionally protected right or freedom, and second, the means chosen to achieve the objective must be reasonable and demonstrably justified when considered under form of proportionality test which requires the Court to balance the interests of society and those of the individuals and groups whose rights have been violated. See R. v. Oakes, 1986 CanLII 46 (SCC), [1986] S.C.R. 103. [20] The primary objectives of the by-law are to develop and maintain a distinct aesthetic character of the downtown core zone, minimize adverse impacts on adjacent properties and reduce safety concerns such as distractions that affect both pedestrian and vehicular traffic. [21] agree with counsel for the Town that unrestricted advertising signs would quickly present problems to the Town. [22] find that these objectives are matter of pressing and substanial concern. They ensure the orderly development of commercial land use by prohibiting overly large billboard type signs and by reducing the proliferation of signs with the requirement that the signs relate to the property on which they are located. [23] In R. v. Pinehouse Plaza Pharmacy Ltd. (supra) the Saskatchewan Court of Appeal said: ... Sign restrictions facilitate the preservation of the primary/ ancillary use distinctions. They are an important means of carrying out city planning objectives and preserving zone use. Sign restrictions for ancillary uses can be regarded as an integral part of the pressing and substantial objective of orderly city development through urban planning ... The Court also said: ... There can be no doubt of the need for such policy in an urban industrial society. Regulation of land use to ensure the health, welfare and general well‑being of the inhabitants is of primary importance. [24] single judge of the British Columbia Supreme Court in Prince George (City) v. A.F.N. Holdings Ltd. (1986), B.C.J. No. 2729 stated: It is obvious that in municipality it is desirable, if not necessary, to regulate the erection of signs on private property. The alternative is potential chaos and visually unappealing community. [25] One must look at the proportionality test with reference to the comments of Dickson C.J.C. in R. v. Oakes, 1986 CanLII 46 (SCC), [1986] S.C.R. 103 where he said at p. 138: Some limits on rights and freedoms protected by the Charter will be more serious than others in terms of the nature of the right or freedom violated, the extent of the violation, and the degree to which the measures which impose the limit trench upon the integral principles of free and democratic society. [26] His comments were referred to in R. v. Edwards Books and Art et al., 1986 CanLII 12 (SCC), [1986] S.C.R. 713, LaForest J. stated at p. 794: 176 Let me first underline what is mentioned in the Chief Justice's judgment, that in describing the criteria comprising the proportionality requirement, the Court has been careful to avoid rigid and inflexible standards. That seems to me to be essential. Given that the objective is of pressing and substantial concern, the Legislature must be allowed adequate scope to achieve that objective. It must be remembered that the business of government is practical one. The Constitution must be applied on realistic basis having regard to the nature of the particular area sought to be regulated and not on an abstract theoretical plane. In interpreting the Constitution, courts must be sensitive to what Frankfurter J. in McGowan, supra, at p. 524 calls ""the practical living facts"" to which legislature must respond. That is especially so in field of so many competing pressures as the one here in question. ...having accepted the importance of the legislative objective, one must in the present context recognize that if the legislative goal is to be achieved, it will inevitably be achieved to the detriment of some. Moreover, attempts to protect the rights of one group will also inevitably impose burdens on the rights of other groups. There is no perfect scenario in which the rights of all can be equally protected. 178 In seeking to achieve goal that is demonstrably justified in free and democratic society, therefore, legislature must be given reasonable room to manoeuvre to meet these conflicting pressures. Of course, what is reasonable will vary with the context. Regard must be had to the nature of the interest infringed and to the legislative scheme sought to be implemented. [27] The operation of the flexible standard of review can be seen in R. v. Jones, 1986 CanLII 32 (SCC), [1986] S.C.R. 284 where it was found that compulsory certification of school curriculum violated s. 2(a) of the Charter which sets out everyone has the freedom of religion, but the court held the denial was reasonable and described the infringement of certification as “minimal intrusion”. The court stated at p. 299: To permit anyone to ignore (the requirement for certification) on the basis of religious conviction would create an unwarranted burden on the operation of legitimate legislative scheme to assure reasonable standard of education. [28] The limiting measures of the by-law are rationally connected to the objective and it effectively addresses unrestricted use of available space in a way that maximizes the effective use of signs. Any restrictions on the defendant’s freedom of expression are rational as they are based on preserving and facilitating the Town’s planning goals and they are of benefit to the other citizens of the community. [29] The seriousness of Charter violation is determined by the extent and degree to which limiting measure entrenches upon integral principles of free and democratic society. See R. v. Oakes, supra. One looks at the degree or extent the violation offends the basic purpose of the Charter and one looks at the extent or degree to which the violation offends the purpose of the Charter right infringed. [30] The general purpose of the Charter has been described in many ways. It has been said to regulate the relationship between an individual and government and to restrain government action and to protect the individual (Retail, Wholesale and Department Store Union, Local 580 [R.W.D.S.U.] v. Dolphin Delivery Ltd., 1986 CanLII (SCC), [1986] S.C.R. 573). It has been said the purpose is “to protect individuals from unjustified state intrusion upon their privacy” (Hunter v. Southam, [1984] S.C.R. (pg. #). [31] In this proceeding any restriction on the respondents’ freedom of expression are rational and is based on preserving and facilitating the planning goals of the Town. [32] The by-law regulates the relations various citizens of the Town have with each other and has little connection with the relationship between individuals and government. [33] agree with counsel for the Town that the by-law uses means which least affects the defendants freedom of expression while still achieving its objectives and which objectives are benefit for the community. It is not complete prohibition of signs. It lists signs which are permitted in all zones and for which no permit is required. The by-law permits broad range of signs and merely places certain restrictions on specific zones in accordance with the objectives. Primarily restrictions regulate how and where signs can be displaced and those limitations do not prevent advertising in the downtown core zone. [34] There has to be applied the proportionality test which involves an analysis of the means chosen to achieve legislative objective in light of the benefit to society and the adverse impact upon the respondents in this application. [35] refer to Canadian Mobile Sign Association v. Burlington (City), 1997 CanLII 4453 (ON CA), [1997] O.J. No. 2870, decision of the Ontario Court of Appeal which found that sign restrictions which were similar to those in this proceeding were proportionate to their objectives. This case involved challenge to municipal by-law regulating the use of portable signs. The court found that the means chosen by the City to achieve its stated objective in dealing with the problems created by the signs were proportionate to the objectives since the right of the appellant in that proceeding was only minimally impaired and the by-law did not operate to completely prohibit such signs. [36] In Nichol (Township) v. McCarthy Signs Co. (supra) the Ontario Court of Appeal found that the limits on the rights and freedoms guaranteed by section 2(b) were demonstrably justified pursuant to s. of the Charter. In that case, it was found that the objective of the by-law was pressing and substantial and its effect had the purpose of reducing proliferation of advertisements adjacent to highway, and they found that the limiting measures to the by-law was rationally connected to the objective. They also found that the means used by the Town to achieve its goal were reasonable and proportionate to any infringement to the right of freedom of expression and that there was proportionality between the effects of the measures which limit the right and the objective of the by-law. The commercial interest of the land owner in advertising was protected, and the limitation did not prevent all expression, but only required that such expression relate to particular location in order to advance the legitimate object of protecting the scenic characteristics of the community. [37] find that there was proportionality between the effects of the measures limiting the respondents’ freedom of expression and the objective of the by-law. It really only required that any limitation did not prevent all expression, but only that relating to location in order to advance the objective of protecting the community. [38] am of the opinion that limits on the rights and freedoms guaranteed by s. 2(b) of the Charter are demonstrably justified pursuant to s. of the Charter. [39] The application is allowed and an order will issue pursuant to s. 266(3) of the Municipal Government Act directing the respondents to remove the ground sign. If not removed within 15 days, the Town can enter upon the land and remove the sign at the expense of the respondents. [40] Costs will be awarded at $1,500 against all respondents.",2_2001nssc164.txt,"The applicant applied for an order directing the removal of a ground sign which violated its' Municipal Planning Strategy and Land Use By-laws.
The respondents argued that the applicant's by-law violated their rights under s. 2(b) of the Charter.
Application allowed; respondents directed to remove the ground sign; if the sign is not removed within fifteen days, the Town can enter upon the land and remove the sign at the expense of the respondents.
Although advertising is a form of expression and falls within the scope of sec. 2(b) of the Charter, the purposes of the by-laws (maintaining a distinct aesthetic character of the downtown, minimizing adverse impacts on adjacent properties and reducing safety concerns) were both pressing and substantial and the limiting measures were rationally connected to the objectives.
The by-laws had a minimal impairment on the rights of the respondents, as advertising was not prohibited but only limited."

A.D. 1998 No. 003884 J.C. M.J. IN THE QUEEN’S BENCH (FAMILY LAW DIVISION) JUDICIAL CENTRE OF MOOSE JAW BETWEEN: JANICE LEE (OVERS) PETERSEN and GARY JOSEPH OVERS RESPONDENT T.G. Graf, Q.C. for the petitioner D.M. Chow for the respondent FIAT MATHESON J. February 20, 2004 [1] When the judgment, dated December 14, 1999, was amended to provide that the primary residence of the child, Cassie, should be with her father, the question of the payment of maintenance by the mother was adjourned pending fulfilment of the requirement that the mother, Janice Petersen, produce all information relating to her ability to pay maintenance, and for her examination by the respondent to determine her income. [2] The examination has been completed, and by agreement of counsel the questions to be resolved are whether Janice Petersen has produced all relevant financial information, and whether a trial should be directed as to the amount of maintenance payable by her. FINANCIAL INFORMATION [3] When the foregoing order was made on June 4, 2003, Janice Petersen was engaged in farming enterprise with her father, who owned, or leased all of the farmlands and equipment involved in the enterprise. Janice Petersen testified that the arrangement entailed her working on the farm with her father. She would be charged 20 percent of the expenses and would receive 20 percent of the profits. [4] Janice Petersen has produced her income tax returns, prepared by her accountant. But counsel for Mr. Overs has complained that “Mrs. Petersen has no farm/cattle income or expense banking accounts of her own, she has no permit book and offers nothing to substantiate her annual income from the farming and cattle operation with her father other than her annual tax returns”. Counsel for Mr. Overs has asserted that Janice Petersen should be required to produce her father’s farming accounts. [5] It is difficult to comprehend exactly what an examination of Janice Petersen’s father’s books of account would reveal which would assist Mr. Overs in establishing that Janice Petersen has earned more income than the amount revealed in her income tax returns. Although counsel for the respondent has stated that Janice Petersen “and her family members continue to shelter financial information relevant to these proceedings”, there is not shred of evidence to support that statement. [6] It has also been submitted that the financial records of the trucking corporation, owned by Janice Petersen’s husband, should be disclosed. The reason therefor is that “counsel for Mr. Overs cannot effectively determine the amount of income that should be attributed to Mrs. Petersen from the numbered corporation”. [7] Although it has been asserted that Janice Petersen “performs significant duties for the numbered corporation but draws no income from it”, Janice Petersen testified that she devoted but one hour per month performing such duties. When one considers that the corporation owns but one truck, operated by Mr. Petersen, from which all of the income of the corporation is derived, the suggestion that income from the corporation should be imputed to Janice Petersen is nothing less then ludicrous. [8] The fact that Mr. Petersen’s income is deposited into joint account with Janice Petersen is no different than occurs in many households. Because spouses maintain joint bank account, into which the breadwinner deposits his or her earnings, does not justify imputing portion of that income to the homemaker spouse. [9] Counsel for Mr. Overs also seeks financial information relating to Mr. Petersen’s ranching operations, where the Petersens resided. Janice Petersen looked after the ranch while Mr. Petersen was operating the truck. It has been submitted that income should be imputed to Janice Petersen from the ranching operation. Whether that submission has any more merit than the other assertions by counsel for Mr. Overs need not be canvassed, because Mr. Petersen could not, because of the recession in the cattle business, continue his trucking operation from the ranch; the Petersens have moved their residence to Lloydminster. Janice Petersen is therefore not at the present time looking after the ranch nor engaged in farming with her father. [10] Neither Janice Petersen’s father, nor Mr. Petersen, are parties to these proceedings. To require them to produce their financial records, in the absence of even the slightest evidence such production would disclose anything which would in any manner assist in determining the amount of child maintenance payable by Janice Petersen, would be totally unjust. TRIAL OF THE ISSUE [11] Counsel for Mr. Overs has stated “the only way to obtain the full and complete picture of the petitioner’s income and entitlement to income on an annual basis is to hear from witnesses at viva voce hearing”. [12] On the basis of the material presently available, the only benefit which would be derived from ordering trial of the issue as to the amount of child maintenance to be paid would be to enhance counsels’ fees. The parties can ill afford such expense, and they would be poorly advised to pursue such course. [13] Both applications are dismissed, with costs to Janice Petersen in the amount of $500.00. [14] The application for calculation of the amount of child maintenance is returned to the Chamber list for March 8, 2004.",2_2004skqb62.txt,"FIAT: The issue to be resolved was whether the petitioner had produced all relevant financial information in order for the Court to determine the amount of maintenance to be paid by her.

In coming to this conclusion we note that the trial judge chose to accept the testimony of the father's witness who testified as to relationships within the family over that of Tracy Fick's expert witness who testified as to the effect of abuse on children. He also found the mother's interpretation of events not to be credible. While we might not have arrived at the result for the reasons given by the trial judge, the conclusions reached and the disposition are supported by the evidence.

We delayed this judgment because of our concern that the child should be allowed to complete his year in school without having to transfer to different school in another city. Our overriding concern throughout has been to ensure that the interests of the child are protected as much as possible throughout the appeal process. Although the previous disruptions in the child's schooling were not caused by any action of the father, in our opinion further dislocation in the child's living arrangements and schooling would have been detrimental to the child.

BACKGROUND[2] Mr. Dubelt was convicted on April 4, 2006 of common assault.
At his trial he was assisted by Richard Klassen.
Mr. Dubelt paid Klassen $2,500 for his assistance on the assault charge.
Following his conviction Mr. Dubelt utilized the assistance of Klassen in preparing a notice of appeal in which the grounds are related to factual issues.

The Appellant says that due to the ineffective assistance of his trial counsel, there was a miscarriage of justice that compromised the reliability of the trial’s result or caused procedural unfairness to the Appellant.
2.
Such further or other grounds as the Appellant may advise or as may appear from the transcript of the sentencing proceedings.

Warrants.
[2] Three Informations in Support, each essentially identical, have been sworn by an RCMP officer.
The applications before the Court are for DNA Warrants to obtain blood samples from the male, the female and the child.
[3] The Informations depose that the Crown has obtained a “DNA sample” from the person who says she is the mother (herein “the natural mother”) of the 19-year-old female.
I assume, although it is not stated in the Informations, that the “DNA sample” is or was derived from a blood sample of the natural mother.
There is no other bodily substance in the possession or control of the Crown which relates to the alleged incest.
That problem is whether the facts as alleged fall within and meet the requirements of s. 487.05(1) of the Code.","This was an application by the plaintiff vendors for a declaration that an objection to title raised by the defendant purchasers was without merit.

Bentley and Helen Pauline Bentley, both of Halifax, aforesaid, deceased, and JANET MAIE MILLAR AND SYLVIA MURIEL HUGHSON, in their own right and RONALD EARL BRIGGS, OF Halifax, County of Halifax, Province of Nova Scotia, and LINDA MARIE McNEIL, of Halifax aforesaid Defendants This is an application under the Vendors and Purchasers Act, c. 324, R.S.N.S., 1967 (the Act) on behalf of the vendors/plaintiffs (v/plaintiffs) for a declaration that an objection to title raised by the purchasers/defendants (p/defendants) is without merit. This matter first came before me as contested chambers application. Mr. Chandler, who represents the v/plaintiffs, at that time, agreed to obtain additional affidavit evidence in the hope of satisfying the p/defendants that the v/plaintiffs have good title to the property. Additional affidavit evidence has been adduced, but the v/plaintiffs still maintain their objection to title. Counsel agreed that in deciding the application, could consider all the additional material provided. After having heard counsel further on December 20, 1990, granted the application with written reasons for so doing to follow. The cause of the vendor's concern The property in question is residential lot with purported 40' frontage on the north side of Kaye Street in the City of Halifax. Kaye Street is part of built up residential area in the north end of Halifax known as the Hydrostone area, large part of which was destroyed in 1917 by the Halifax Explosion. Alex Bond, prior to 1913 by two separate deeds, one containing 80' of frontage and the other 60', acquired total of 140' of frontage on the northside of Kaye Street in Halifax. As the issue before me deals with missing lot frontage, for the purposes of this application will refer only to the frontage of the various lots conveyed. The 140' frontage acquired by Bond was bounded on the west by property of the Memorial United Church or its predecessors in title and on the east by one Trider or his predecessors in title. The p/vendors title search at the Registry of Deeds located conveyances of lots out of Bond or his heirs containing total of only 120' of frontage on Kaye Street. The remaining unaccounted for 20' creates the problem now before the court. The lot in question is described as having frontage on Kaye Street of 40', there is no dispute with the apparent adjoining property owners as to the boundaries of the land in question and the lot, in fact, has approximately 40' of frontage on the ground. The concern of Ms. Meisner on behalf of the p/defendants is that the Bond heirs, according to the recorded conveyances, retain ownership of the remaining 20' of frontage. From her search of the records at the Registry of Deeds she is not able to pinpoint the location of the 20' of missing frontage and fears that it could be up to one half of the frontage of the lot in question. Property history In 1913 Bond conveyed lot having 40' of frontage to Fred Killam. That lot which was apparently vacant at the time, was situate to the east of the lot in question. The lands to the west of the lot conveyed to Killam contained the Bond residence. The Killam residence was built on the 40' lot. Leota Bentley, daughter of Fred Killam, who lived in this property, states in statutory declaration that this lot which the Killams occupied was, in fact, wider than the 40 feet called for in the deed. Alex Bond was killed in the Halifax Explosion and at the same time both the Bond and Killam residences were destroyed. The Killam residence was immediately rebuilt. The Bond residence, however, was not rebuilt leaving vacant lot between the Killam residence lot and the United Church lot. In 1920, Bond's daughters, Bertha Wournell and Ethel Hockin, conveyed 25' of frontage to the United Church being the western portion of the vacant Bond lot, which apparently contained remnants of the foundation of the Bond residence which was destroyed by the Halifax Explosion. In 1931, Wournell and Hockin conveyed another 40' of frontage to Fred Killam. In 1937, Wournell and Hockin conveyed 15' of frontage to Fred Killam's widow, Rosina. This lot was described as adjoining the eastern boundary of the United Church property. The frontage of the lots described in the four conveyances out of Bond and his heirs totals 120', 95 of which were conveyed to the Killams. There are no further recorded conveyances out of Bond or his heirs. In 1941 Rosina Killam conveyed 16' of frontage to the United Church. property plan introduced as evidence dated June 26, 1940, and purportedly prepared by Provincial Land Surveyor by the name of Knight, shows the Killam property as having frontage of 116', 16' of which borders on the United Church property to the west. The 16' strip is designated on the plan as lot ""to be conveyed to the United Church"". Although the plan shows the remaining Killam property as having 100' frontage there are recorded conveyances to the Killams totalling only 95'. After Mrs. Killam's conveyance to the United Church of 16' only 79' of frontage remained recorded in the name of the Killams. Thus the missing frontage may actually be 21'. Objections to Title The objections to title put forward by Ms. Meisner on behalf of the purchasers are: 1. That the Bond heirs may have an interest in the lands in question, and, if not, 2. That the Crown may claim an interest in the lands under the Escheats Act R.S.N.S., 1989, c. 151. Mr. Chandler's answer is that the Killams and their successors have established good possessory title to the lot in question. Legislation Section (formerly Section 3) of the Act, under the terms of which this application is brought, provides: ""A vendor or purchaser of any interest in land or his representative may, at any time and from time to time, apply in summary way to judge or local judge of the Trial Division of the Supreme Court in respect of any requisition or objection or any claim for compensation, or any other question arising out of or connected with the contract and the judge or local judge may make such order upon the application as appears just, and refer any question to referee or other officer for inquiry and report."" Is this proper application under the Vendors and Purchasers Act? Ms. Meisner on behalf of the p/defendants argues that this is not proper application under the Vendors and Purchasers Act and submits that title to the lot must be perfected by an application under the Quieting of Titles Act. She states that this court has expressed conflicting views as to whether possessory title may properly be determined under the Vendors and Purchasers Act. She says that, although Parsons v. Smith (1971), N.S.R. (2d) 561 (S.C.T.D.) and Stevens v. MacKenzie (1979), 41 N.S.R. (2d) 91 (S.C.T.D.) indicate that the issue of possessory title may be properly be dealt with under the Act, the later case of Keohane v. McNaulty (1989), 1989 CanLII 1493 (NS SC), 92 N.S.R. (2d) 261 (S.C.T.D.) seems to indicate otherwise. do not agree that Keohane changes the view of the law expressed in Parsons and Stevens. Davison, J. in Keohane, in an application under the Vendors and Purchasers Act, dealt with the issue of possessory title and, in fact, resolved that issue on the same basis as did Hart, J. in Parsons v. Smith, supra, and Glube, J. (as she then was) in Stevens v. MacKenzie, supra. It is para. 11 of Keohane that gives Ms. Meisner the difficulty she expressed. It provides in part: ""The Vendors and Purchasers Act is intended to provide summary ruling as to whether an objection to title is valid and thereby remove confusion that may be created by the filing of frivolous objections to title. Applications should be confined to this narrow focus. There are other statutes available for declarations of title statutes which have built‑in protection for providing notice to interested persons and to permit the intervention of those persons. Foremost among those statutes of course, is the Quieting Titles Act."" In my view, Davison, J. was giving very good advice by suggesting that party with highly doubtful title to property rather than risking an unsuccessful application under the Vendors and Purchasers Act should go directly to more recent legislation designed to cure title, such as the Quieting Titles Act. While it is true that applications under the Vendors and Purchasers Act can determine only if an objection to title is valid, it is also true that an applicant under the Act who is able, on balance of probabilities, to prove good possessory title is entitled to the relief sought, in this case, finding that the objections to title are invalid. The wisdom of the advice of Davison, J. is shown in the final outcome of all three cases referred to by Ms. Meisner in which the applicants all failed to prove possessory title. The Law In all of those same three cases the standard used in proving good possessory title is that set out in the following para at p. 297 of Armour on Titles, (3rd ed.): ""The declarations or affidavits to prove possession should not be confined to general statements that the trespasser has been 'in possession' or 'occupation'. There ought to be evidence of the actual facts which are relied upon as constituting the possession or occupation under the Statute. Thus the person in possession should show whether the land has been fenced and whether that is what is relied upon; whether it has been resided on, and if so, whether continuously or at intervals; whether it has been cultivated, and how whether by continuous occupation or by taking crops off and leaving the land vacant between visits. In all cases the purchaser should be put in possession of the actual facts, so that he may exercise his judgment upon their effect, instead of stating the effect, leaving him in ignorance of the facts upon which the vendor relies."" Objection #1 The Evidence of Possession George Bentley acquired the lot in question in 1957 from Killam heirs. The lot was vacant until he built his residence on it in 1961. Ms. Meisner does not dispute that there has been open, notorious and continuous possession by the vendors and their title predecessors since that time. Her concern, is that the time period between 1961 and the present does not establish the 40 year period of such possession required by the Limitation of Actions Act (c.258 R.S.N.S. 1989) in order to defeat another claim of ownership. Several statutory declarations containing allegations of possession during the time in question were submitted by Mr. Chandler. Leota Bentley, sister‑in‑law to George Bentley and daughter of Fred and Rosina Killam, in two separate statutory declarations deposed to acts of possession of the lands in question. She states that she is now 78 years of age and lived in the Killam home with her parents on the lot adjacent to the east of the lot in question continuously from 1913 until her marriage in 1936. She says she lived in Dartmouth from 1936 until 1950, but during that time ""frequently"" and ""regularly"" visited the Killam homestead being the lot in question and the adjacent residence lot. She says she lived outside the Province from 1950 until 1965, but returned every summer and stayed with her mother at the homestead property. She says that her father, Fred Killam, mother Rosina, brother‑in‑law George Bentley, and his wife Pauline, all of the owners of the property, which included the lot in question during the time in question, are now deceased. She says Fred Killam died in 1936. In her first declaration Mrs. Bentley deposes in para 11: ""11. THAT since at least 1931 until 1957 when the property on Kaye Street was conveyed to George A. Bentley, my father and mother and my mother after my father's death owned and continuously occupied openly, visibly and notoriously the entire lands designated R. Killam on Kaye Street shown on the plan attached as Schedule ""B"" extending northward to the mid point of the block outlined in red thereon, and my father and my mother after my father's death maintained home, garden, lawn and outbuildings thereon as well as fence on the mutual boundary with the Church and, subsequent to 1957, George A. Bentley and Helen Pauline Bentley owned and occupied the lands designated R. Killam on Kaye Street on the plan attached as Schedule ""B"" and in particular the subdivided portion designated Lot on the plan attached as Schedule ""A"" until the time of George Bentley's death in 1987 and by Pauline Bentley until the time of her death in 1990."" In her second declaration she deposes in para's 11 through 14: ""11. THAT during his lifetime my father owned and operated Nova Scotia Nursery and during the lifetime of my father and mother, they owned the properties designated R. Killam and M.A. Wickwire on the Plan of R. Killam Property, Knight, P.L.S., dated 1940, copy of which is attached hereto as Schedule ""C"". 12. THAT there was driveway to the west of our house (as referred to in paragraphs and herein), west of the driveway was lawn, and west and north of the lawn were the arbors and rose shrubery as refered (sic) to in Paragraph 13 herein, and further west of that was approximately fifteen (15) or sixteen (16) feet of ""under‑utilized"" lands and which under‑utilized lands were conveyed by my mother to the Church in 1941, by the Deed referred to in paragraph herein and which sixteen feet (16') area is shown on Schedule ""C"" as the lands ""To be conveyed to U. M. Church"". To the west of this fifteen feet (15') piece of land was the Church property, as refered (sic) to in paragraph herein. 13. THAT prior to 1931, my father planted large number of rose bushes and other shrubs on the lands west of our home in the area which is designated Lot on the plan attached as Schedule ""A"". The rose bushes and other shrubs remained until my brother‑in‑law George Bentley acquired the property. Although there were no buildings per se on that particular area, my father built many arbours and wooden walkways in the area which is designated as Lot on the plan attached as Schedule ""A"", and built swing and frame on that portion of property. He also constructed walkway in the rear of the Lot area going up to the Church property (my father was one of the Trustees of the Church). Father also planted raspberry bushes along the rear of the entire property. My family and friends very much enjoyed and openly used this area and have numerous photographs of the area as described herein. 14. THAT my father, nurseryman, very much maintained this area on regular and frequent basis and after his death, my mother continued to do so although probably in less professional way than my father."" The plan to which she refers as Schedule ""B"" to her first declaration, and as Schedule ""C"" to her second declaration is designated ""Plan of R. Killam property"". It is signed by one Knight (whose initials are unintelligible) P.L.S. and is dated June 26, 1940. It shows the R. Killam property as having 100' frontage on the north side of Kaye Street and being bounded on the west by 16' frontage strip designated to be conveyed to the United Memorial Church which is bounded on its west by the United Church property. The Knight plan shows the Killam lot bounded on the east by lot designated ""C. Trider"" which extends eastwardly 80' to the intersection of Albert and Kaye Streets. The western half of that lot is now owned by Morris Moore who also provided statutory declaration. In the declaration he states that he has resided on his Kaye Street property since 1941 and has always believed that his property was bounded on the west by the Killam/Bentley property. In paragraphs and of his statutory declaration he deposes: ""3. THAT for as long as have resided on Kaye Street, George A. Bentley and Helen Pauline Bentley and their predecessors in title owned and occupied all the lands and premises westward from the point hereinbefore mentioned to the eastern boundary of lands of United Memorial Church defined by chain link fence running northwardly from Kaye Street to the southern boundary of Young Street, which distance along Kaye Street am informed by review of the plans attached hereto as Schedules ""A"" and ""B"" is 100 feet. 5. THAT the lands designated R. Killam on the plan attached as Schedule ""B"" and G. Bentley on the plan attached as Schedule ""A"" were occupied continuously, visibly, openly and nortoriously by George Bentley and Helen Pauline Bentley and in particular Lot as shown on the plan attached as Schedule ""A"" upon which George Bentley built his own home and know of no claim adverse to the ownership of George Bentley and his predecessor in title for the 49 years and upwards that have lived at 5321 Kaye Street."" Also in evidence is the statutory declaration of William Orr. In it he states that he is 78 years old, and has been involved with the United Memorial Church in various capacities since 1920, including as church elder which he still is. He states further that in his memory the land between the church property and the Killam residence was used as driveway, lawn and gardens until George Bentley built his house around 1960. Mr. Orr states that he knows of no dispute concerning the location of the boundary line between the Church and Killam properties. Janet Millar, daughter of George Bentley, declares by affidavit that in 1957 her father bought from the Killam heirs lot which includes the lot in question. She says that she resided in the house on the lot adjoining the lot in question (referred to as the Killam house) until she moved into the new residence George Bentley built on the lot in question in 1961. Ms. Millar, who states she was born in 1946, provides in para's and of statutory declaration: ""3. THAT when was about or years of age had occasion to visit the property on the north side of Kaye Street when it was owned by Rosina Killam. My Aunt Leota and Uncle Ken Bentley had come home to Nova Scotia for holiday visit and had spent week or so in the valley visiting our family and they asked me to go with them and their daughter, Barbara, to spend week with Aunt Leota's mother, Rosina Killam, in Halifax. We stayed in the building shown on the plan attached hereto designated as four unit apartment building and now known as 5329 Kaye Street. 4. THAT remember that the lands to the west of the Killam house extended in gradual upward slope to the base of hill. The hill rose sharply to plateau and recall that the hill was mowed at that time and in the years subsequent was mowed from time to time by church officials. The base of the hill was the western limit of the Killam property and in later years was the western boundary line adjacent to which my father built house in 1961. can remember that the land between the Killam house and the base of the hill consisted of type of garden with many shrubs and spaces of law interspersed with patches of garden in and around through which pathways ran and upon which we as children used to run. It is my recollection that the gardens were tended enough to know that there was someone who cared and it was my understanding that the gardens belonged to Rosina Killam, who was at that stage an elderly woman."" Assessment records from the Nova Scotia Archives of the lands between the Church and Trider (later Moore) properties were produced in evidence. One assessment card covers the period from 1920 to 1947. On the card the titles ""Estate of Alex Bond"" and ""Kaye"" appear in the spaces respectively designated ""owner"" and ""street"". In the space designated ""street no."" the word ""lot"" rather than civic number is inserted which indicated that the land was vacant. For the year 1920‑21 the land assessment is shown as ""1200"". It fluctuates over the years reducing to ""400"" by 1947. Reductions in assessment coincide with the transfers of land from the Bonds to the United Church in 1920 and to Fred Killam in 1931. For 1947 and subsequent years the assessment is transferred to new card in the name of Rosina Killam. The former card in the name of the Estate of Alex Bond contains the notations ""to Rosina Killam July 25/38"" and ""16' to Church Sept. 3/41"". Since the last conveyance out of the Bond heirs was to Rosina Killam by deed recorded July 25/38 and the 16' frontage was conveyed to the Church by Rosina Killam by deed recorded Sept. 3/41 this suggests that the practise in the assessment office on property transfers may have been, at least in some cases, not to transfer the property assessment to card in the new owner's name. This practise is further suggested by the assessment card for #29 Kaye Street in the name of Fred Killam. It contains the notation ""transferred to Rose M. Killam by will"" and although Fred Killam died in 1936, the assessment was not transferred to new card in the name of Rosina M. Killam until 1947, the same year the assessment from the card in the name of the Estate of Alex Bond was transferred to new card in the name of Rosina M. Killam. The assessment records indicate that all of the property on the north side of Kaye Street between the Morris Moore property and the Church property, subsequent to 1946, was assessed to Rosina Killam and later to George Bentley. Findings re Objection No evidence was adduced to contradict the allegations made in the several statutory declarations submitted by Mr. Chandler and none of the declarants were cross‑examined on the evidence contained in the declarations. In deciding that the v/plaintiffs have established good possessory title to the lot in question, find the following elements of proof of possession have been established from the evidence: 1. The lot has been assessed for municipal tax purposes in the name of Rosina Killam and her successors in title since at least 1946. The lot and the adjacent Killam house lot were occupied by Fred and Rosina Killam openly and continuously from at least 1931 until the property was sold to George Bentley in 1957. During that time period the lot in question was used as garden, lawn and driveway and fence designated the mutual boundary between the Killam and United Church lands. Fred Killam, prior to 1931, had planted rose bushes and other shrubs and constructed swing and fence on the lot in question and had constructed and used walkway on the lot to the adjoining church property. This evidence is set out in the statutory declarations of Leota Bentley and is supported by the evidence set out in the declarations of Janet Millar, William Orr and Morris Moore. 2. There is no evidence of any claims by others against the lot in question. 3. The plan of property dated 1940 showing lands including the lot in question, indicates that the lands were surveyed by Provincial Land Surveyor in 1940 and that the lot in question was then owned by Rosina Killam. That plan, the later plan dated 1961, the assessment records referred to, and the evidence contained in the statutory declarations are all consistent with occupation and ownership by Rosina Killam and her successors in title. Conclusion Objection I am satisfied on the basis of the evidence submitted that the vendors and their predecessors in title, namely, the Killams and the Bentleys, by open, notorious and continuous possession since at least 1946, a period in excess of 44 years, have established a good and marketable possessory title to the lot in question. state ""since at least 1946"" because that is the year in which the assessment for the lands was transferred to new card in the name of Rosina Killam. However, the evidence also indicates that such possession has been exercised since at least 1938 when the 15' strip was transferred from the Bond daughters to Rosina Killam and suspect since as far back as 1931 when the 40' lot was conveyed to Fred Killam from the Bond daughters. Objection Ms. Meisner submits that even if find that possessory title has been established by the required proof of possession for more than 40 years this would not, under the Limitation of Actions Act, defeat claim by the Crown under the Escheats Act R.S.N.S. 1989, c. 151 against whom such possession must be proved for period of at least 60 years. Section 2(b) of the Escheats Act provides: ""The Governor in Council may direct the Attorney General to take proceedings to revest in the Crown ..... (b) any or all lands of persons dying intestate and leaving no heirs or persons entitled to the said lands under the laws of the Province."" Therefore, before such claim would threaten title to property the Provincial Cabinet, with the Lieutenant Governor's consent, must direct the Attorney General to take revesting proceedings. Even if this came to pass it would be difficult, if not impossible, to determine the exact location of the 20 or 21 missing feet to which the Crown must lay claim in order to defeat the present possessory ownership. No one to date has been able to pinpoint the location of the missing 20' or 21' of frontage. One of the two original lots conveyed to Alex Bond contained 60' of frontage on Kaye Street. The first conveyance to Fred Killam in 1913 described lot having 40' frontage on Kaye Street, although, as stated by Leota Bentley, that lot was in fact much wider than 40'. Indeed, the intention may have been to convey all of the frontage of 60' described in the original lot rather than 40' as described in that first conveyance. Although mere speculation, suspect that the mystery of the missing frontage bears on that Killam residence lot, rather than on the lot in question. Conclusion Objective In any event the possibility of such a claim by the Crown, as Mr. Chandler suggests, is so remote as to be frivolous and as such is, therefore, not a valid objection to title. Having found that neither objection to title is valid, the application is granted, but without costs. J.

A.D. 1991 J.C.Y. IN THE COURT OF QUEEN'S BENCH JUDICIAL CENTRE OF YORKTON BETWEEN: JEANETTE MAY HESHKA and TERRANCE MICHAEL HESHKA RESPONDENT Jeanette May Heshka appearing on her own behalf K. W. Wasylyshen for the defendant JUDGMENT GEATROS J. May 16, 1994 The issues raised in this action is custody andaccess, child and spousal support, and division of thematrimonial property. The petitioner, Jeanette, the wife, is 43 years of age; the respondent, Terrance, the husband, 44 years. They were married in May 1983 and separated in March, 1991. There are two children of the marriage, Mark, born September 19, 1983, and Michelle, born February 11, 1987. Jeanette issued her petition in May 1991. Thehusband counter-petitioned in January 1992. On February 24, 1992, Osborn J. granted interim maintenance as follows: Spousal support$ 400.00 Child support for Mark$ 400.00 for Michelle$ 800.00 $1,600.00 An application by Terrance to reduce the interim support was denied by Matheson, J. on May 11, 1993. It is apt to proceed first with division of the matrimonial property. The result may have an effect on the other issues. The assets and the values placed thereon by the parties are as follows: Assets Valued by Terrance Valued by Jeanette 1. NE 13-29-4-W2 2. SE 13-29-4-W2 3. SE 12-29-4-W2 5. Farm machinery 6. Grain on hand 7. Cash on hand 8. His teachers' superannuation 9. Sask. Wheat Pool equity 10. Yorkton Co-op Investors portfolio (joint 4,186.34 The NE 13-29-4-W2 is the home quarter. It was purchased in 1985 for $75,000.00. There is $5,400.00 owing on that quarter section. One appraisal is by Four Seasons Realty. The other by Cliff Durnford Appraisal. prefer the valuation of the ""accredited appraiser"" over that of the ""realtor"". Including the grain bins, fix the value of the NE 13-29-4-W2 for distribution purposes at $42,375.00 (by Jeanette's appraiser) less $5,400.00 due or $36,975.00. There are no ""improvements"" to take into account as regards the other two quarter sections. There is $25,000.00 owing against the SE 13-29-4-W2. In his ""summary"" prepared for trial Terrance values the quarter section at $34,500.00, and Jeanette in her brief at $47,680.00 on the basis of ""eight times the assessment"". This land was purchased in 1989 for $55,000.00. The valuation of the appraiser and the realtor approximates that submitted by Terrance. The value for the purposes of distribution find to be $34,500.00 less $25,000.00 or $9,500.00. The SE 12-29-4-W2 was purchased by Terrance from his brother Eugene for $55,000.00 in 1982. According to the agreement for sale, $30,000.00 was to be paid before May, 1983, the date of the marriage. Jeanette contends that only $20,000.00 had been paid so that Terrance should be given an exemption of $20,000.00, not $30,000.00. Upon the evidence, on balance, would allow an exemption of $30,000.00 given that Terrance was able to acquire title so it can be presumed it is likely the purchase price was paid according to the tenor of the agreement for sale. Jeanette places the value of the SE 12-29-4-W2 at $52,720.00, again based on ""eight times the assessment"", but her appraiser's value is lower. accept Terrance's value of $36,750.00. There is fourth quarter section of land, the NW 6- 29-3-W2, acquired by Terrance prior to marriage and accordingly Jeanette is not seeking division of that land. Lorne Korpatniski has been auctioneer for 23 years and farmer since 1980. He says the machinery ""is in extremely poor condition ... it was sitting all over the yard"". His view is that there is no room for further depreciation. He itemized and valued each piece of machinery. In my view, his total value of $13,150.00 is well placed. accept that value over the one submitted by Jeanette. The evidence reveals the present value of Terrance's pension benefit accrued during his marriage to be $7,774.00. One half of that amount or $3,887.00 may be transferred to prescribed R.R.S.P. for Mrs. Heshka. The manager of the superannuation program for the Saskatchewan Teachers' Superannuation Commission in her letter in evidence says, ""when the court renders an award and payment is made to Mrs. Heshka by the Teachers' Superannuation Plan, she will have no further claim or entitlement to any pension or benefit pursuant to the Plan"". There is agreement on the value of the remaining assets. The parties concede there is to be equal division. There are three items Terrance says he held prior to marriage to which he claims an ""exemption"". would allow $1,345.00 related to Plan 24, Canora Credit Union by reason of Jeanette's consent, but not the other two. There is no basis for an exemption related to the Canora Credit Union chequing account, and find well founded Jeanette's contention that the fuel that was prepaid would have been used by the time of the marriage. The parties have divided the furniture and personal effects and it was agreed at the trial that Jeanette is allowed to have ""my cabin belongings"". It is ordered that Jeanette shall be entitled to take possession of them on Saturday, May 28th or Sunday, May 29th, next. In summary, Terrance's assets comprise: NE 13-29-4-W2 $36,975.00 SE 13-29-4-W2 $9,500.00 SE 12-29-4-W2 ($36,750.00 less exemption of $30,000.00) $6,750.00 Farm machinery $13,150.00 Cabin $6,000.00 Grain on hand $15,708.56 Cash on hand $4,913.68 Wheat pool equity $2,276.88 Yorkton Co-op equity $475.21 Investors portfolio (joint account) $2,832.66* Investors portfolio (Terrance only) $4,186.34 Total $102,768.33 Less agreed exemption $1,345.00 Total to be divided $101,423.33 Amount payable to Jeanette $50,711.66 *To be placed in Terrance's name solely. The ""amount payable"" does not include Jeanette's share of Terrance's pension benefit in the amount of $3,887.00. My ruling is that the Saskatchewan Teachers' Superannuation Commission shall transfer such sum to an R.R.S.P. as may be prescribed by Jeanette. In this regard, see the Commission's letter to ""Mr. Terry Heshka"" dated April 20, 1994 (exhibit D-7). It is hereby ordered that Jeanette Heshka has fromthis date a beneficial interest created by this order,sufficient to support the registration of a caveat, in thefollowing lands to the extent of $50,711.66:NE 13-29-4-W2nd,SE 13-29-4-W2nd, andSE 12-29-4-W2nd. It is further ordered that Terrance Heshka shall not transfer, mortgage, lease or otherwise encumber the said lands except in accordance with an order of the court. If the sum of $50,711.66, together with interest atthe judgment rate hereby ordered to accrue in the meantime, isnot paid by Terrance by September 1st next, Jeanette may applyto the court for a sale of the lands to facilitate payment ofthe amount then outstanding. Terrance is not seeking custody of the children, but requires firm guidelines as to access. Upon hearing theparties I am of the view that a kind of specified accessshould be put in place. There was discussion at the trial as to how it should be determined. The farm home is 22 miles from Jeanette's residence. Terrance shall be entitled to access every second weekend from Friday, p.m., to Sunday, p.m., beginning Friday, May 27th next. Should Terrance choose not to exercise his access rights during any weekend he must communicate with Jeanette to that effect no later than the prior Wednesday. Jeanette agrees, as do, that the children should be able to visit with their father during the week from time to time. It is not possible to specify the times when these separate visits shall take place. Suffice it to say that they are to be part of the reasonable access to which Terrance is entitled. Such visits must necessarily be kept in balance and require the goodwill and co-operation of Jeanette and Terrance so as not to conflict with the children's school requirements or activities that may have already been arranged for them. The children will spend either the first or second week of each of the months of July and August with their father. He is to inform Jeanette by June 1st each year what week during those months he has selected for the access period. Terrance shall have access during Ukrainian Christmas and Ukrainian Easter each year, from 10 noon Christmas eve to p.m. the day after Christmas, and from 12 noon of Good Friday to p.m. Easter day. Spousal support and child maintenance shall be inthe same terms as in the interim order. There is no basis upon which it can be varied downwards as Terrance contends. Michelle's multiple physical handicaps mitigates against change in the amount that is being paid for her. The evidence does not allow for lessening of the monthly payment of $400.00 for Mark. There is no doubt that the cost of maintaining children increases as they grow older. Concerning Jeanette, there are really no grounds upon which spousal support can be reduced below $400.00 monthly. Medication for her diabetes alone costs her up to $200.00 every month. She does not seek an increase in spousal support. Only that it remain the same as at the present time. Given the employment and farming income of Terrance during 1993 revealed in his 1993 income tax return, am not persuaded that he will not be able to continue making the support payments. In the result,Terrance will pay to Jeanette for her support the sum of$400.00 per month and, as well, the sum of $800.00 and $400.00per month for the maintenance of Michelle and Mark,respectively, for a total sum of $1,600.00, commencing thefirst of June, 1994. An award for retroactive support and maintenance sought by Jeanette must be rejected. There is no basis for an award predating the order of Osborn, J. make no order as to costs on the petition and counter-petition.",7_1994canlii4892.txt,"The wife petitioned and the husband counter-petitioned for a division of matrimonial property, custody, access and spousal and child support.

Rayner for the Crown DISPOSITION: Appeal Heard: March 12, 1996 Appeal Allowed: March 12, 1996 (orally) Reasons: March 14, 1996 On Appeal From: QBCA 18 of 1995, J.C. of Saskatoon Appeal File: 6793 Reasons by: The Honourable Madam Justice Gerwing In concurrence: The Honourable Chief Justice Bayda and The Honourable Mr. Justice Cameron GERWING J.A. The appellant was acquitted after trial in the Provincial Court of communicating with another person for the purpose of engaging in prostitution, contrary to s. 213(1)(c) of the Code. However, on appeal to the Court of Queen’s Bench, a new trial was ordered, and it is from that judgment that this appeal arises. There is no need, in view of our disposition, to conduct an extensive review of the facts. police officer, on duty as an undercover person, had conversation with the accused which formed the basis for the charge. The Queen’s Bench judge, in reviewing the decision of the Provincial Court judge in acquitting, interpreted her oral reasons to include a requirement as an element of the actus reus for an offence under s. 213 that there be a specific conversation with respect to payment of money for specified sexual services. The Queen’s Bench judge concluded that this was an error in law and cited as a correct test a comment in R. v. Schmidt (1987), 1986 CanLII 3096 (SK QB), 53 Sask. R. 75 at pp. 77-78: Applying these principles to the present case, it is my view that the facts before the learned Chief Judge constituted evidence from which properly instructed jury could reasonably infer that the respondent was communicating with female person for the purpose of engaging in an act of sexual intercourse and for which he intended to pay. In summary, the evidence is that the respondent approached woman unknown to him in an area where prostitutes were plying their trade, invited her into his automobile, inquired if she was interested in sex and wanted to know if she was police officer. The fact that the conversation did not reach the point where the matter of payment was discussed would not preclude jury from reasonably concluding that an act of prostitution involving the payment of money for sexual favours was contemplated. It was strongly urged by the Crown, and conceded by counsel for the defence, that this is the correct test. That is, if indeed the Provincial Court judge had found that under s. 213 the actus reus must include a specific conversation specifying the sexual services and the money to be paid for them, she was incorrect. We agree with this. However, as we have repeatedly said in the exercise of our appellate capacity both with respect to judgments and jury charges, the entire reasons must be read to understand the true ratio. Here the Queen’s Bench judge in his appellate capacity focussed on one sentence where the trial judge said: ... think the evidence ... has to be relatively specific on the issue of money for specific sexual services. However on a reading of the entire oral judgment, we are of the view she was, in effect, saying that the evidence failed to convince her beyond a reasonable doubt that the offence had taken place. The fact that she was not adding the need for specific conversation is buttressed by the submission of counsel for the appellant that immediately before giving oral judgment she had refused motion for nonsuit. Were she to have been of the view that such an element was necessary it is probable she would have granted the nonsuit. Thus, while noting that the statement of law by the judge of the Court of Queen’s Bench in his appellate capacity was correct, we are the view that the appropriate disposition is to set aside his judgment and restore the decision of the Provincial Court acquitting the appellant of the offence.",8_1996canlii4963.txt,"The appellant was acquitted of communicating with another person for the purpose of prostitution.

CLARKE, C.J.N.S.: The appellant applies for leave to appeal and, if granted, appeals from the sentences imposed on June 26, 1990 after he pled guilty to two offences. The first relates to the theft of a computer and modem exceeding $ 1,000.00 in value, contrary to s. 334 (a) of the Criminal Code. For this offence he was sentenced to 18 months. The second is the commission of mischief by damaging the motor vehicle into which he broke, and from which he stole the computer and modem. This is in violation of s. 430 (4) (a) of the Criminal Code. He was sentenced to 12 months to be served concurrently with the first offence on the theft charge. The appellant bases his appeal on the ground that the sentence is unfair. He contends that it is too long. have studied the record of the proceedings and considered the submissions that have been made by both the appellant and Crown counsel. agree with the trial judge that the deliberate acts of the appellant constitute serious offences from which the public must be protected. The trial judge was right when he said that general deterrence must be matter of primary concern. The appellant cannot be described as youthful first offender. He was twenty‑eight years old when these offences were committed. His record of criminal convictions begins in 1980. Since then he has been convicted 19 times, without counting those instances when there have been multiple charges. The majority are theft and property related offences.

The trial judge had found the respondent, who had taken a sleeping pill and was drunk at the time of the assault, did not have the intent to commit the assault.
Allowing the appeal,
that voluntary intoxication cannot be considered as raising a reasonable doubt as to intent in a general intent offence unless the degree of intoxication is so extreme that the accused did not even possess the minimal intent to perform the actus reus because his state was akin to automatism or insanity.
The Court noted that no medical evidence as to the affect of the sleeping pill with the alcohol was adduced, nor was there any evidence concerning the strength of the pill or the amount of alcohol consumed and concluded that the evidence supported the conclusion that the respondent appreciated the circumstances of the assault, even though he could not remember it afterward.
The Court set aside the acquittal and entered a verdict of guilty pursuant to s. 686(4)(b)(ii) of the Criminal Code as it had concluded that the respondent 'should have been found guilty but for the error in law'.","[3, 0, 2, 4, 6, 1, 5]",358,"S.C.C.

HALLETT, J.A. This is an appeal from the acquittal of the respondent on a charge of assaulting his wife. The evidence indicates the respondent had come to visit his estranged wife on August 18, 1990. He complained of being tired and suffering from insomnia. She gave him sleeping pill at about 1:00 p.m. and told him that he should not consume alcohol. The respondent left but returned about 4:00 p.m. and at that time was in possession of quart of whiskey. He left shortly thereafter taking the whiskey with him. At approximately 2:00 a.m. the following morning he returned. His estranged wife had been asleep on the couch without any clothes on. She testified that the respondent was intoxicated. He got angry with her when she asked him what he was doing and he started to leave. She tried to prevent him from leaving as she did not want him to drive motor vehicle in an intoxicated condition. She pursued him into the hall. She testified that he hit her and butted out cigarette on her hand. He then lifted her up in an extremely crude manner and pushed her against the wall. Asked what then happened she testified: ""he wanted me to go put something on in case someone come up the hallway and so we both went upstairs and put something on and we sat sat on the couch and he went on my bed and passed out...."" In giving his decision acquitting the accused the learned trial judge stated: ""The charge, as say, is on the face of it serious one. The behaviour of the accused at the time in question was, as described by Mrs. Saulnier, completely irrational and entirely out of character. She had earlier in the day administered sleeping pill to the accused and cautioned him against drinking. He nonetheless did drink. He doesn't know how much, he doesn't remember anything of the incidents which transpired from the time he went out that evening to have some drinks at bar at the Grand Hotel until the next morning when he woke up in his wife's apartment. It strikes me that the behaviour is all the more bizarre since the parties were reunited in their matrimonial relationship not long after this incident. There obviously is an affection displayed between them today in the court room. can't imagine what would prompt the behaviour of the accused to behave in the fashion he did towards his wife who is obviously attractive and who he obviously has some substantial regard for. Counsel for the accused argues that there is defence of automatism which would apply in these circumstances, the accused not understanding or appreciating what he was doing, that he suffered from delusions, that he apparently thought his wife was sack of potatoes or something, at the time. I'm not satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that he had the intent to assault his wife, or even to strike her."" should note that the argument made at trial by counsel for the respondent that the respondent thought his wife was sack of potatoes or something at the time he was lifting her and pushing her against the wall was not supported by the evidence. The respondent testified that after he left his estanged wife's place that afternoon he received call to go back to work; he then went out drinking with some friends at the Grand Hotel. He has no recollection of anything that took place after that; his next recollection was getting phone call the following day to go to work. The Crown appeals on the following ground: ""THAT the learned trial Judge erred in law in instructing himself on the defence of non‑insane automatism in the absence of an evidentiary foundation."" The Crown asserts that there was no evidentiary basis for the trial judge's finding that he had reasonable doubt that the respondent had the intent to assault his wife. Therefore, one must ask whether the evidence of the respondent's state of intoxication supports finding of lack of intent to commit the assault on his wife. The leading case in Canada respecting the defence of drunkenness in relation to general intent offences, of which common assault is one, has been the decision of the Supreme Court of Canada in Leary v. The Queen (1977), 1977 CanLII (SCC), 33 C.C.C. (2d) 473, 74 D.L.R. (3d) 103, [1978] S.C.R. 29, 37 C.R.N.S. 60, [1977] W.W.R. 628, 13 N.R. 592. The decision has generally been interpreted as meaning that the defence of drunkenness has no application in general intent offence. In Bernard v. The Queen (1988), 1988 CanLII 22 (SCC), 45 C.C.C. (3d) the majority of the Supreme Court of Canada did not accept the appellant's invitation in that case to overrule the Leary decision. McIntyre J. with Beetz J. concurring re‑affirmed the distinction between general and specific intent offences and confirmed the Leary decision that the defence of intoxication has no application in offences of general intent. However, Wilson J., with L'Heureux‑Dube J. concurring, agreed that the Leary decision should not be overruled but felt that the Leary decision, properly understood, did not prevent an accused from relying on evidence of voluntary intoxication to negative the minimal intent required for general intent offences. Justice Wilson concluded that the Crown must prove an accused applied force intentionally in the case of an assault charge but to warrant acquittal based on intoxication the evidence of intoxication must be such that it shows an accused to have an absence of awareness akin to state of insanity or automatism. Therefore, in her opinion, it is only in cases of extreme drunkenness that evidence of intoxication is capable of raising reasonable doubt on the issue of intent in general intent offence. The other three members of the court, Dickson C.J.C., Lamer, J. and La Forest J. were of the opinion that the rule in Leary that defence of voluntary drunkenness has no application to general intent offences should be overruled. In R. v. Quin, 1988 CanLII 21 (SCC), 44 C.C.C. (3d) 570 which was handed down on the same date as the Bernard decision, the same panel of judges reached similar results in connection with whether or not the defence of drunkenness ought to have been available to the accused who in the Quin case broke and entered dwelling house and committed an assault causing bodily harm. It too was case of self‑induced intoxication. In the course of concluding that the defence of drunkenness was not available Wilson J. stated at p. 575: Although, as the Chief Justice notes, there was considerable evidence from both the appellant himself and from an expert witness that the appellant was ""very drunk and acting very much out of character"", there was no evidence of such extreme intoxication as to negate an aware state of mind as in the case of insanity or automatism. Accordingly, the rule in Leary v. The Queen (1977), 1977 CanLII (SCC), 33 C.C.C. (2d) 473, 74 D.L.R. (3d) 103, [1978] S.C.R. 29 (S.C.C.), should, in my view, have been applied by the trial judge. One can draw the following conclusions from the Bernard decision. The Leary decision has not been overruled. The distinction between specific and general intent offences has been preserved. In general intent offence the Crown need only prove beyond reasonable doubt that the accused had the intent to perform the actus reus of the offence. This intent can be inferred from the acts of the accused; it is minimal intent that he consciously did the act that constitutes the offence. agree with the conclusion reached by Madam Justice Wilson in the Bernard case where, after reviewing the comments made by Fauteux J. and Ritchie J. in R. v. George (1960), 1960 CanLII 45 (SCC), 128 C.C.C. 289, [1960] S.C.R. 871, 34 C.R. (S.C.C.) and the comments of Pigeon J. in the Leary decision respecting the intent required to be proven in offences of general intent, she stated at p. 41: ""I believe that the Leary rule is perfectly consistent with an onus resting on the Crown to prove the minimal intent which should accompany the doing of the prohibited act in general intent offences. view it as preferable to preserve the Leary rule in its more flexible form as Pigeon J. applied it, i.e., so as to allow evidence of intoxication to go to the trier of fact in general intent offences only if it is evidence of extreme intoxication involving an absence of awareness akin to state of insanity or automatism. Only in such case is the evidence capable of raising reasonable doubt as to the existence of the minimal intent required for the offence. would not overrule Leary, as the Chief Justice would, and allow evidence of intoxication to go to the trier of fact in every case regardless of its possible relevance to the issue of the existence of the minimal intent required for the offence."" For the policy reasons enunciated by McIntyre J. in the Leary case and the view of Wilson J. which I have quoted, I am of the opinion that voluntary intoxication of a person cannot be considered as raising a reasonable doubt as to his intent in connection with a general intent offence unless the degree of intoxication is so extreme that the accused did not even possess the minimal intent to perform the actus reus of the offence because his state of awareness was akin to automatism or insanity. This minimal intent requires that an accused perform conscious as opposed to accidental or unconscious acts. There will rarely be case in which the evidence will support finding that self‑induced intoxication caused an accused to be in so‑called state of automatism that would lead to finding of reasonable doubt as to the intent required to prove general intent offence. should note that the constitutionality of the common law rule that drunkenness is not defence to general intent offence was not raised by Notice of Contention on this appeal. In R. v. Penno, (1991) 1990 CanLII 88 (SCC), 115 N.R. 249 Lamer C.J.C. directed his mind to the effect of the majority decisions in the Bernard case. He stated at paragraph 75: ""I conclude, therefore, that only minority [McIntyre J. with Beetz concurring] in Bernard expressed conclusive opinion as to the constitutionality of the rule denying defence of intoxication for all general intent offences. In cases where the intoxication would succeed in raising reasonable doubt as to an element of general intent offence, the question is, in my opinion, still open for this court to decide."" In same same case Wilson J. commented at paragraph 33: ""In R. v. Bernard, 1988 CanLII 22 (SCC), [1988] S.C.R. 833; 90 N.R. 321, this court held that denying the defence of intoxication in the case of an offence of general intent does not violate the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms at least insofar as cases not involving 'substituted' mens rea are concerned. Accordingly, if Chief Justice Lamer's reasons in this case are not confined to ""substituted"" mens rea cases, which they do not appear to be, it would appear that he is reopening the issue in Bernard. While this is, of course, perfectly open to him to do, tend to the view that Bernard was correctly decided. remain of the view that intoxication falling short of insanity or automatism is not defence to crimes of general intent. The defence of intoxication is, of course, available in the case of crimes of specific intent."" At this time the two majority opinions in the Bernard case remain the law of Canada. Interpreting them in manner most favourable to the respondent, the majority opinions at least stand for the proposition that voluntary drunkenness is not generally defence to general intent offence but could be defence if the intoxication has induced state of automatism or insanity. In the Penno case Justice Wilson expressed the rationale for this rule at paragraph 36: ""Intoxication has traditionally been viewed as relevant to mens rea. Certainly this was so in Bernard where, as already mentioned, it was held that the defence of intoxication was available only in relation to crimes of specific intent and not to crimes of general intent. The rationale in support of this finding was that intoxication could affect person's ability to foresee the consequences of an act, which is requirement for crimes of specific intent, but that, generally speaking, intoxication could not deprive person of the ability to know that he or she was committing the act, which is the minimal requirement for crimes of general intent."" The learned trial judge found that he was not satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the respondent had the intention to assault his estranged wife. As previously noted, the Crown asserts that the learned trial judge erred in law in instructing himself on the defence of non‑insane automatism in the absence of an evidentiary foundation for the defence. The evidence of the respondent's wife leads to the inference that the respondent had driven his car to her residence. Her evidence proves that he was extremely intoxicated and did not seem ""like himself"". There was no evidence as to the strength of the sleeping pill that he had taken. There was no evidence as to the amount of alcohol he drank on the day in question. The respondent simply has no recollection. There is no medical evidence as to the affect the sleeping pill and his drinking would have had on him. It would have added credibility to the defence theory that the respondent acted as if his wife was sack of potatoes if there was evidence that the respondent customarily used sacks of potatoes as punching bags and ashtrays but there was no such evidence to explain why he hit his wife and butted out cigarette on her hand. Likewise, there was no evidence that he customarily spoke to sacks of potatoes or was concerned about them not being properly clo thed. There is no evidence to support finding that his state of intoxication was anything but self‑induced. The courts, in number of cases, have commented that as general rule it is difficult to prove automatism in the absence of medical evidence. In Hill v. Baxter, [1958] All E.R. 193 (Q.E.D.) the court stated at p. 197: ""I do not doubt that there are genuine cases of automatism and the like, but do not see how the layman can safely attempt without the help of some medical or scientific evidence to distinguish the genuine from the fraudulent."" Similarly, in Bratty v. Attorney General for Northern Ireland [1963], A.C. 386 (H.L.) the court stated: ""The evidence of the man himself will rarely be sufficient unless it is supported by medical evidence which points to the cause of the mental incapacity. It is not sufficient for man to say ""I had black‑out"": for ""black‑out"" as Stable J. said in Cooper v. McKenna, ex parte Cooper is one ""of the first refuges of guilty conscience and popular excuse."" The inability to remember events at later time, while perhaps some indication of automatism, does not in itself provide basis for finding of automatism. R.v. Clarke (1973), 1973 CanLII 1495 (NS SC), 16 C.C.C. (2d) 310 (N.S.S.C.A.D.); In R. v. Myers (1979), 31 N.S.R. (2d) 444 (S.C.A.D.) this court commented at paragraph 25 on the quality of evidence required where automatism is raised: ""Evidence that the appellant was an automaton in fact was not merely insufficient; it was non‑existent. No direct medical or other evidence was given which showed that the appellant was in fact concussed. None of those who talked to him at the time of the accident, including the ambulance attendants, and none of the doctors or others who examined him the next morning, gave any evidence as to the nature of his injuries, or as to his response to questions, including the breathalyzer demand, from which the conclusion could be drawn that the appellant in fact was concussed and did not then know what he was doing. All Dr. Stevenson could say was that an accident such as described ""could"" cause concussion and false appearance of understanding and consciousness. No foundation of fact was laid from which an expert could infer that this man was probably an automaton when he refused the demand. See Bleta v. The Queen, 1964 CanLII 14 (SCC), [1964] S.C.R. 561, as to the vital necessity of proper factual foundation for medical opinions as to automatism."" Apart from the fact that there was no medical evidence to support finding that the respondent's state of awareness was akin to that of automatism, the evidence of his wife shows that the respondent had the presence of mind to recognize that she was naked and to suggest to her that she get clothes on in case somebody came by. In short, the evidence cannot support finding that the respondent was so extremely intoxicated that he should not be presumed to have intended the consequences of his act of assaulting his wife as would be the case if his state of awareness was akin to that of state of insanity or automatism. In fact, the wife\'s evidence indicates the respondent had an appreciation of the circumstances of the assault at the time, although he cannot remember. The ""sack of potatoes defence"" is not supported by any evidence. am of the opinion that the trial judge did not properly direct himself as to the type of evidence necessary to conclude, as result of the respondent's degree of intoxication, that there was reasonable doubt that the respondent had the minimal intent required for the general intent offence of common assault. It is necessary to consider how to dispose of this appeal. Section 686(4) of the Criminal Code, 1985, provides: (4) Where an appeal is from an acquittal the court of appeal may (a) dismiss the appeal; or (b) allow the appeal, set aside the verdict and (i) order new trial, or (ii) except where the verdict is that of court composed of judge and jury, enter verdict of guilty with respect to the offence of which, in its opinion, the accused should have been found guilty but for the error in law, and pass sentence that is warranted in law, or remit the matter to the trial court and direct the trial court to impose sentence that is warranted in law. The Crown requests the following relief: The Appellant respectfully submits the appeal be allowed, the verdict of acquittal set aside, and verdict of guilty entered, and sentence warranted in law passed, or the matter of sentence remitted to the trial court with the direction sentence warranted in law be passed; or in the alternative, that the appeal be allowed, the verdict of acquittal set aside, and new trial ordered. In order to exercise jurisdiction to enter conviction court of appeal must be satisfied all findings of fact necessary to support finding of guilt were made either explicitly or implicitly by the trial judge. This common law rule must be strictly applied. R. v. Cassidy (1989), 1989 CanLII 25 (SCC), 50 C.C.C. (3d) 193, 61 D.L.R. (4th) 480, [1989] S.C.R. 245. It is clear from reviewing the reasons given by the trial judge he found that the respondent did assault his wife. He stated: ""The Court is conscious of the seriousness of spousal assault. There was clearly an assault here."" He then went on to describe the assault. However, the learned trial judge stated in the last paragraph of his decision that ""he didn't strike her"". Considering his previous finding that there had been an assault and considering the context in which the remark was made assume the learned trial judge meant that the respondent did not intentionally or consciously strike her. For the reasons which have already stated the evidence did not support such finding. There is presumption person intends the natural consequences of his/her acts. Having found there was, in fact, an assault and as the evidence of intoxication was totally insufficient to raise reasonable doubt as to the minimal intent required to prove general intent offence the learned trial judge by implication found the respondent' had the requisite intent for the offence of common assault when he concluded there, in fact, was an assault. Therefore, I am of the opinion the respondent ""should have been found guilty but for the error in law"" which I have identified. I would set aside the acquittal and enter a verdict of guilty pursuant to the powers vested in this Court by Section 686(4)(b)(ii) of the Criminal Code. Both counsel requested that if guilty verdict were entered the matter should be remitted to the trial judge for sentence so that pre‑sentence report could be prepared. would make such an order directing the trial judge to impose sentence that is warranted in law.

The trial judge had found the respondent, who had taken a sleeping pill and was drunk at the time of the assault, did not have the intent to commit the assault.
Allowing the appeal,
that voluntary intoxication cannot be considered as raising a reasonable doubt as to intent in a general intent offence unless the degree of intoxication is so extreme that the accused did not even possess the minimal intent to perform the actus reus because his state was akin to automatism or insanity.
The Court noted that no medical evidence as to the affect of the sleeping pill with the alcohol was adduced, nor was there any evidence concerning the strength of the pill or the amount of alcohol consumed and concluded that the evidence supported the conclusion that the respondent appreciated the circumstances of the assault, even though he could not remember it afterward.
The Court set aside the acquittal and entered a verdict of guilty pursuant to s. 686(4)(b)(ii) of the Criminal Code as it had concluded that the respondent 'should have been found guilty but for the error in law'."

(Orally):[1] The origin of this action was a mortgage foreclosure commenced by Canada Life Mortgage Services (""Canada Life"") against Leeside Estates Ltd. and Byung K. Lee.
According to the pleadings the defendants (and I will refer to them collectively throughout this decision as ""Lee"", whether in their capacity as defendants or as plaintiffs by counterclaim) planned to construct an apartment complex at Kentville, Nova Scotia.

Lee denied (in his personal capacity) that he is a mortgagor and denied liability as a guarantor and in addition, has accused Canada Life of acting in such a manner as to cause the failure of the project.
[3] Lee's counterclaim against Canada Life and CMHC is for breach of contract, breach of fiduciary duty to Lee, or for negligence.
Lee's claim against the other defendants by counterclaim includes negligent misrepresentation, breach of fiduciary duty, breach of contract, negligence.

[1] This is a summary conviction appeal by both accused from a decision of a Summary Conviction Appeal Court Judge ordering a new trial on seven counts against the appellants under ss. 239(1)(a) and (d) of the Income Tax Act. The charges against both pertain to willfully evading the payment of taxes and the unlawfully making of a false or deceptive statement in the return of income. [2] The respondent, Crown, had appealed to the Summary Conviction Appeal Court after the trial judge had acquitted the appellants herein. [3] The appeal judge found the trial judge had come to the conclusion he had reasonable doubt the appellants had deceitfully or falsely made statement in completing the tax returns and reasonable doubt they had willfully evaded the payment of taxes, and that such doubt was rooted at least in part in belief the appellants could legally have avoided the payment of tax. Essentially the appeal judge decided the trial judge erred in failing to determine if the payments involved were income and in focussing only on the criminal intent of the accused. The appeal judge ruled he could not say the trial judge’s conclusion would have been the same if he had first determined, as he ought to have, the payments received by the appellants were in fact income and then ordered new trial. [4] In our view the appeal judge misinterpreted the decision of the trial judge. The trial judge proceeded on the worst case scenario, that is that all payments received by the appellants constituted income and then he considered the issue of criminal intent. Thus in our opinion the trial judge properly considered the issue of income before dealing with mens rea. [5] The Crown argues before us the accounting records upon which the claim for deductions were made were, in fact, false thus obviating the liability for tax. The Crown contends the courts below erred in failing to recognize the falsity of the claims. The Crown did not raise this issue in its grounds of appeal to either the Summary Conviction Appeal Court or this Court. The Crown, however, made it clear the issue was fully before the courts below. [6] The Crown is asking this Court to overturn findings of fact made by the trial judge by arguing the returns were false and therefore the basis for such findings was erroneous. In fact, neither the trial judge nor the appeal judge were prepared to make such finding. The trial judge, in response to the Crown’s argument the retruns were false and the records and record keeping were part of an elaborate scheme of deception to avoid taxes, stated “It is also consistent with simple sloppiness.” The appeal judge stated, “In my opinion, there is some question as to whether either accused willfully evaded the payment of income tax, or whether there was any intent to make statement knowing it to be false or deceptive. The bookkeeping was haphazard and sloppy. [7] Both parties agreed the test is set out in R. v. Redpath Industries Ltd. et al. (1984), 84 D.T.C. 6349 at p. 6351: criminal court is not the forum to determine income taxability and to make determinations as to rights to tax assessment or absence of rights of assessment involved. In tax evasion charge, it must appear prima facie from the evidence that the taxability is clear-cut, obvious, indisputable, unquestionable from lack of reporting, before entering the examination of the other facts of the charge, e.g. whether the undisputable taxability, based on income gained, proven and undeclared, leads to conclusion beyond reasonable doubt that it was wilfully omitted by taxpayer in his tax returns. [8] The evidence of taxability was not clear-cut, obvious or indisputable. [9] On the material before us there is no basis prepared to overturn the findings of fact made by the trial judge. See R. v. Andres, 1979 CanLII 2238 (SK CA), [1982] W.W.R. 249. [10] The appeal is therefore allowed and the acquittals ordered by the trial judge are restored.

Counsel: William M. Leahey, for the plaintiffs Joel E. Fichaud, Q.C., for the defendantsBy the Court:[1] Counsel have been unable to agree on costs in this proceeding where, after a four day trial, the plaintiffs were successful in recovering the base amount claimed but did not succeed in their claims for aggravated and punitive damages.
[2] Mr. Leahey, counsel for the plaintiffs, submitted that costs should be substantially increased above the usual party and party costs because, as he contended, the defendant ought to have admitted liability at the outset rather than forcing the plaintiffs to trial.
Mr. Leahey proposes that the court fix costs in the amount of $15,000.00 plus disbursements.
[3] On behalf of the defendant, Mr. Fichaud contended that the defendant was justified in contesting the plaintiff's claim as it did and that it did not unduly prolong the proceeding.","The accused was charged with possession of marijuana for the purposes of trafficking contrary to s. 5(2) of the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act and four other charges related to her attempts to evade arrest.
At the onset of her trial, the accused took the position that her s. 8, s. 9 and s. 10 Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms were infringed and that all the evidence obtained after the stop should be excluded.
HELD: The accused's Charter rights were not breached.
1) The strong odour of raw cannabis marijuana emanating from the interior of the accused's vehicle in itself amounted to reasonable grounds not only for lawful detention but also for arrest.
2) The officer was not in breach of the accused's Charter rights by asking her where she had been and how long she had been there.
3) On the arrest or detention of the accused, she was promptly informed of the reasons therefore and she was informed of her right to retain and instruct counsel without delay.","[0, 2, 5, 1, 4, 6, 3]",836,"J. 2003 SKQB 459 Q.B.C.N.J.

Forsyth for the accused JUDGMENT HRABINSKY J. October 31, 2003 [1] The Crown proceeded against the accused on the following five counts in the indictment:1. On or about the 24th day of February, A.D. 2002, at or near Kindersley District, in the Province of Saskatchewan, did unlawfully have in her possession a controlled substance, to wit, cannabis marihuana in an amount exceeding three kilograms, for the purpose of trafficking, contrary to Section 5(2) of the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act. 2. On or about the 24th day of February, A.D. 2002, at or near Kindersley District, in the Province of Saskatchewan, did in committing an assault on Constable Darcy Wilson use weapon to wit Buick car bearing Saskatchewan Licence Plate 640 CGC, contrary to Section 267(a) of the Criminal Code. 3. On or about the 24th day of February, A.D. 2002, at or near Kindersley District, in the Province of Saskatchewan, operating motor vehicle on highway to wit, Highway and Highway 21 in manner dangerous to the public contrary to Section 249(1)(a) of the Criminal Code. 4. On or about the 24th day of February, A.D. 2002, at or near Kindersley District, in the Province of Saskatchewan, while operating motor vehicle being pursued by police, did in order to evade the peace officer fail without lawful excuse to stop her vehicle as soon as was reasonable in the circumstances contrary to Section 249.1(1) of the Criminal Code. 5. On or about the 24th day of February, A.D. 2002, at or near Kindersley District, in the Province of Saskatchewan, did being at large on her undertaking entered in before Justice and being bound to comply with condition thereof, to wit, keep the peace and be of good behaviour did fail without lawful excuse to comply with that condition contrary to Section 145(3) of the Criminal Code. [2] At the outset of the trial counsel for the accused took the position that the accused’s rights pursuant to ss. 8, 9 and 10 of Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms were infringed and that all evidence obtained after the initial stop should be excluded pursuant to s. 24(2) of the Charter. These sections read as follows: 8. Everyone has the right to be secure against unreasonable search or seizure. 9. Everyone has the right not to be arbitrarily detained or imprisoned. 10. Everyone has the right on arrest or detention (a) to be informed promptly of the reasons therefor; (b) to retain and instruct counsel without delay and to be informed of that right; and (1) Anyone whose rights or freedoms, as guaranteed by this Charter, have been infringed or denied may apply to court of competent jurisdiction to obtain such remedy as the court considers appropriate and just in the circumstances. (2) Where, in proceedings under subsection (1), court concludes that evidence was obtained in manner that infringed or denied any rights or freedoms guaranteed by this Charter, the evidence shall be excluded if it is established that, having regard to all the circumstances, the admission of it in the proceedings would bring the administration of justice into disrepute. [3] The trial commenced by way of voire dire. [4] Constable Darcy Wilson graduated as an Royal Canadian Mounted Police officer on July 10, 2000. He had taken four-hour course on narcotics which included the smell of burning cannabis marihuana and the smell of raw cannabis. According to him there is drug problem in the Kindersley area where he was stationed and accordingly he had handled some 20 to 30 possession cases and some 10 to 15 trafficking cases. [5] At approximately 4:30 a.m. on February 24, 2002, near Kindersley, Saskatchewan, Constable Wilson stopped the accused’s vehicle because it had cracked rear tail light on the passenger side. The cracked tail light emitted white light approximately two inches by two inches square. No issue is taken with Constable Wilson’s authority to stop the accused’s vehicle since such stop is authorized pursuant to s. 40(8) of The Highway Traffic Act, 1996, S.S. 1996, c. H-3.2.

[6] After Constable Wilson pulled the accused’s vehicle over to the shoulder of the highway he exited his patrol car and approached the accused’s vehicle. The driver’s window on the accused’s vehicle was down or at least partially down and Constable Wilson noticed that the rear of this vehicle was cluttered with blankets and there was red bag which extended about three-quarters of the way up the back seat of the vehicle. Duct tape sealed the lip of the bag and Constable Wilson stated that duct tape is commonly used to seal bags with contraband and narcotics. The cluttered interior of the vehicle gave Constable Wilson some cause for concern that there could possibly be hidden weapon. On cross-examination he acknowledged that the red bag which was actually dog food bag with duct tape could have had dog food in it. [7] When Constable Wilson stopped the accused on the highway she immediately confronted him with the question, “Why are you stopping me?” Constable Wilson said he advised her about the cracked tail light and asked her where she was coming from and where she was going. Constable Wilson said that she was extremely nervous and agitated. [8] Constable Wilson testified that he approached the accused’s vehicle and requested her driver’s licence and vehicle registration. As the accused reached for her purse and put it on her lap to retrieve these documents, Constable Wilson shone his flashlight into the car and into the accused’s purse. At this time the interior light of the accused’s vehicle was illuminated as she was searching for these documents. Constable Wilson testified that as she was reaching into her purse he observed some pill bottles, Zigzag rolling papers and what appeared to be green leafy substance which was loose on the bottom of her purse. He also observed some cash. Constable Wilson could smell very strong odour of raw cannabis coming from the interior of the vehicle and as the accused provided her driver’s licence he noticed dark green stain on it which he said looked like cannabis resin. At this point in time Constable Wilson said he formed the opinion that there was cannabis marihuana in the vehicle and he advised the accused that he could smell cannabis marihuana in the vehicle and that it appeared that there was hash oil on her driver’s licence. She denied this and stated, “If give it to you, will you let me go?” [9] Constable Wilson said that at this point in time the accused was hysterical and he advised her that she was under arrest for possession of marihuana. As he did so, she grabbed the driver’s licence and Constable Wilson reached into her car to prevent her from driving away. In his words, he “wanted to maintain control”. The accused put the car into drive and pulled away. As the car moved forward the door handle brushed Constable Wilson’s side. He said that this was very minor and that red mark appeared few days later. Constable Wilson did not notice any other person or persons in the vehicle. Constable Wilson observed that the licence plate on the accused’s vehicle was 640 CGC. [10] The accused sped east on highway no. going toward Kindersley, Saskatchewan. Constable Wilson was in hot pursuit travelling up to 190 kilometres per hour in an effort to catch up to the accused’s vehicle. After catching up to her vehicle the speed was approximately 170 kilometres per hour. Constable Jason Michael Pshyk, member of the RCMP, followed Constable Wilson in the pursuit of the accused. [11] Constable Jennifer Barnes, another member of the RCMP then stationed at Kindersley, Saskatchewan, blocked the intersection of highways no. and 21 by putting her vehicle diagonally across that intersection which is the first major intersection in that area. [12] All three RCMP vehicles had activated all of the emergency equipment on their vehicles. [13] As the accused approached Kindersley where there is 70 kilometre per hour speed zone, she applied her brakes and turned south on highway no. 21. As she turned south she accelerated and Constable Wilson observed that she reached speeds of 160 kilometres per hour and at this point he noticed some movement in the back seat of the accused’s vehicle. As Constable Wilson pursued the accused’s vehicle he said that large red bag was thrown from the accused’s vehicle and this bag struck the right corner of his vehicle. The accused continued at speed of approximately 150 kilometres per hour for about five kilometres and gradually slowed to 140 kilometres per hour then to 120 kilometres per hour. Approximately 13 kilometres south of Kindersley the accused pulled her vehicle over to the side and Constable Wilson pulled his vehicle up beside her vehicle on the driving lane. Constable Wilson testified that the accused had her hand out of the window and was screaming hysterically. Constable Wilson exited his vehicle as did Constable Pshyk. Both officers had drawn their firearms. [14] Constable Wilson handcuffed the accused and advised her that she was under arrest for dangerous driving, assaulting police officer, possession of cannabis marihuana and flight. The arrest was made at 5:06 a.m. Constable Wilson testified that he read the police warning to the accused and gave her her Charter rights to counsel. According to him, as he did so, the accused stated, “I’m not fucking listening to you. Do fucking what you fucking want.” Constable Wilson asked her if she wished to contact counsel and she replied, “Yes”. Constable Wilson stated that he again read her the police warning from his Charter card and she replied, “I’m fucking scared of you guys.” [15] Constable Barnes conducted pat search on the accused. [16] When the accused was arrested Constable Wilson noticed that there was small girl approximately 10 years of age, wearing only panties, covered with blanket in the back seat of the accused’s vehicle. She was screaming and crying. [17] On the way back to the RCMP detachment the accused was in the back seat of the patrol vehicle. She was screaming and her little girl was crying. While they were travelling northbound toward Kindersley they came across Constable Barnes approximately one kilometre south of the railway track and observed that she was retrieving the red bag that had been tossed out of the accused’s vehicle. [18] The evidence establishes that the weight of marihuana seized was 3.0575 kilograms which at the gram level would be valued at $45,862.50. At the one-eighth ounce level, it would be valued at $34,942.80. At the one-quarter ounce level, it would be valued at $34,942.86. At the one ounce level, it would be valued at $27,300.00. At the one-quarter pound level, it would be valued at $24,570.00, and at the pound level it would be valued at $18,844.00. [19] Detective Constable Vincent Ashmeade, drug investigator with the Saskatoon Integrated Drug Unit, expressed the opinion that the marihuana seized in this investigation was for the purpose of trafficking and not for personal usage. According to him the user usually buys his/her supply in small amounts such as grams, one-eighth ounce lots or one-quarter ounce lots and then rolls joints as required. The marihuana seized in this investigation could not be consumed by an individual before it deteriorated to worthless value. user would not transport large quantities of marihuana around in his/her vehicle. Users would carry their daily supply of marihuana on their person and keep the remaining marihuana in safe location. [20] In this case the accused was in possession of 2,446-day supply or 6.7-year supply. Since the shelf life of cannabis marihuana is six months, under ideal conditions this amount far exceeds what could normally be considered “personal usage”. [21] They arrived back at the detachment office at 6:01 a.m. and at 6:05 a.m. Constable Wilson asked the accused if she wished to contact lawyer. Her response was, “No, just fucking shoot me. am dead already. They’re going to kill me.” [22] Constable Wilson searched the accused’s purse and found one gram of cannabis marihuana, Zigzag rolling papers, $250 Canadian in cash, piece of paper with some writing on it. [23] Social Services was contacted. [24] The accused told Constable Wilson that her common law husband lived in Melfort and so he contacted him for her. [25] Defence counsel admits that the contents of the ziplock bags and the dog food bag is cannabis marihuana with total weight of 3.0575 kilograms. Constable Wilson testified that the most common packaging for cannabis marihuana is to place the cannabis marihuana in ziplock bag and then to place that bag in another ziplock bag and then those two bags with the cannabis marihuana are normally put in vacuum bag. These had not been put in vacuum bag. [26] In the trunk of the accused’s vehicle, Constable Wilson found receipt for recent purchase of dog food. [27] During the initial stop of the accused’s vehicle and after Constable Wilson found the spot on the driver’s licence which he believed to be hash oil, he asked the accused how long she had been in B.C. and noted that she had no luggage. [28] On cross-examination Constable Wilson was asked whether he noticed the smell of cannabis marihuana after the conversation with respect to the luggage and how long the accused was in British Columbia. He answered, “No” “Incorrect”. He was then referred to question 310 on p. 72 of the transcript of the preliminary inquiry and he replied that that answer was incorrect. [29] On cross-examination, Constable Wilson admitted that when the accused drove off she did not manoeuvre her vehicle in such manner as to hit him. He also acknowledged that there was nothing to indicate that she was not in control of the vehicle. [30] The continuity of all exhibits was admitted by defence counsel. [31] Constable Jason Pshyk, an RCMP officer, testified that on February 24, 2002, at approximately 4:35 a.m. he was on the north side of highway no. 7, approximately 10 kilometres west of Kindersley. Constable Wilson was next to him. After he, Constable Pshyk had pulled over vehicle and when he was through with that vehicle he then parked behind Constable Wilson’s vehicle at the place where Constable Wilson had pulled over the accused’s vehicle. Constable Pshyk said that Constable Wilson was on the driver’s side of the accused’s vehicle and he noted that the accused was quite emotional and was crying. He also noticed smaller child in the back seat covered with blanket. He shone his flashlight into the accused’s vehicle and walked ahead beside the driver’s mirror which put him approximately one foot away from Constable Wilson. He said the accused’s driver’s window was down and Constable Wilson was dealing with the accused. He said that Constable Wilson had the accused’s driver’s licence in his hand and he heard Constable Wilson say to the accused that there was hash oil on her driver’s licence. Constable Pshyk said that the accused was crying and saying that it was not hash oil at which time the accused put her vehicle into drive and accelerated. [32] Constable Pshyk substantially corroborated Constable Wilson’s testimony with respect to the pursuit of the accused. [33] On cross-examination Constable Pshyk testified that he was looking for violations under The Highway Traffic Act and that he was on general duty. On further cross-examination Constable Pshyk stated that when he was near the mirror of the accused’s vehicle standing approximately one foot to Constable Wilson’s left, Constable Wilson was in bent position talking to the accused. He could not recall if Constable Wilson’s body was touching the accused’s vehicle but he did note that Constable Wilson had the accused’s driver’s licence in his hand. He heard Constable Wilson ask the accused if that was hash oil on her driver’s licence but he did not recall if there was mention of cannabis marihuana odour in the vehicle. He heard Constable Wilson arrest the accused but stated that he never heard the accused say, “If give it to you, will you let me go?” [34] On further cross-examination Constable Pshyk said that his notes do not indicate that Constable Wilson asked the accused about the odour of cannabis marihuana in her vehicle. He stated, “It may have been asked. just didn’t put it in my notes.” He did not see Constable Wilson being struck by the accused’s vehicle. [35] It is admitted by both counsel that Constable Pshyk did not smell cannabis marihuana when Constable Wilson first stopped the accused. [36] At the commencement of argument, defence counsel admitted that the Charter arguments refer only to count in the indictment. [37] Counsel for the accused submits that Constable Wilson did not see green material in the accused’s purse as he shone his flashlight into it and he submits further that Constable Wilson did not smell the odour of raw cannabis marihuana emanating from the accused’s vehicle. do not accept either of these submissions. The submission that should not believe Constable Wilson when he stated that he saw green material in the accused’s purse because he did not enter that in any one of the four documents which he prepared in connection with this investigation is without merit. [38] Defence counsel’s submission that this Court should not believe Constable Wilson’s testimony that he was able to smell strong odour of raw cannabis marihuana emanating from the accused’s vehicle because Constable Pshyk said he did not smell any such odour and because Constable Pshyk was not able to say that he heard Constable Wilson ask the accused about the smell of odour of raw cannabis marihuana is also without merit. [39] find that Constable Wilson was candid and straightforward in his testimony. Section Search or Seizure [40] Section of the Charter provides that, “Everyone has the right to be secure against unreasonable search or seizure.” [41] Section 495 of the Criminal Code of Canada provides: 495.(1) peace officer may arrest without warrant (a) person who has committed an indictable offence or who, on reasonable grounds, he believes has committed or is about to commit an indictable offence, (b) person whom he finds committing criminal offence, or [42] find that Constable Wilson observed what he reasonably believed to be marihuana leaves in the bottom of the accused’s purse. He also observed what he believed could have been hash oil stain on the accused’s driver’s licence. find that Constable Wilson smelled strong odour of raw marihuana in the accused’s vehicle. The strong odour of raw marihuana emanating from the interior of the accused’s vehicle would in itself amount to reasonable grounds not only for lawful detention but also for arrest. [43] In The Queen v. Storrey (1990), 1990 CanLII 125 (SCC), 53 C.C.C. (3d) 316 (S.C.C.), at 324, the court stated that although grounds for arrest must be reasonable from both an objective and subjective point of view: the police need not demonstrate anything more than reasonable and probable grounds. Specifically they are not required to establish prima facie case for conviction before making the arrest. [44] In The Queen v. Debot (1986), 1986 CanLII 113 (ON CA), 30 C.C.C. (3d) 207 (Ont. C.A.), at 219, affirmed 1989 CanLII 78 (SCC), [1989] S.C.R. 225, the court stated: The standard of “reasonable grounds to believe” is not to be equated with proof beyond reasonable doubt or prima facie case. The standard to be met is one of reasonable probability. [45] In The Queen v. Sewell, 2003 SKCA 52 (CanLII), (2003) 175 C.C.C. (3d) 242, the Saskatchewan Court of Appeal recognized that the smell of raw marihuana alone can amount to reasonable grounds. At para. 39, there is the following: [39] As for the second basis, namely, that the officer, upon smelling the marijuana, then had reasonable and probable grounds to conduct warrantless search, echo and rely on the comments of Tallis J.A. in R. v. Ladouceur, 2002 SKCA 73 (CanLII), [2002] W.W.R. 209, 165 C.C.C. (3d) 321 (Sask. C.A), and his later reference at para. 141 to R. v. (D.)I.D. (1987), 1987 CanLII 206 (SK CA), 60 Sask. R. 72; [1988] W.W.R. 673, 38 C.C.C. (3d) 289 (C.A.), approved by the Supreme Court of Canada in R. v. Grant, 1993 CanLII 68 (SCC), [1993] S.C.R. 223, 84 C.C.C. (3d) 173. In paras. 125-128 he said: [125] Before turning to the s. question–whether the warrantless search of the vehicle was based on reasonable and probable grounds–I observe that Mellenthin and R. v. Belnavis, 1997 CanLII 320 (SCC), [1997] S.C.R. 341 (S.C.C.) recognized that police officers need not ignore other legitimate aspects of their general duties and powers when manning checkpoint. In the circumstances of the case before us, either officer had every right to open the car door and speak to the passenger: See Belnavis, supra, p. 358, para. 28. When so engaged, officers do not leave their perceptory senses–whether visual, olfactory or auditory–at some other location. Stolen property or illegal firearms are but two examples [Note 20: See for example Part III of the Criminal Code: Firearms and Other Weapons and regulations thereunder.] [126] Although there is an expectation of privacy in automobile travel, it is markedly decreased relative to one’s home or office: See for example R. v. Wise, 1992 CanLII 125 (SCC), [1992] S.C.R. 527 (S.C.C.). Even the sanctity of the home does not preclude warrantless visual surveillance of its exterior. In such circumstances “the eye cannot by the law of England be guilty of trespass”: Entick v. Carrington (1765), 95 E.R. 807, 19 State Tr. 1029 (Eng. K.B.). [127] The same can be said with respect to auditory and olfactory senses. Aromas that are generated in private home, “distillation” plant, laboratory or opium den enter the public domain if and when they leave the building. Indeed the ordinary use of senses might enable member or passing member of the public to pick up the aroma emanating from home, particularly if it is vented. In my opinion the doctrine of “plain smell” is doctrine of common sense–similar to the “plain view” doctrine: See for example R. v. Smith (1998), 1998 ABCA 418 (CanLII), 126 C.C.C. (3d) 62, 161 D.L.R. (4th) 331 (Alta. C.A.). [128] Given the lessened expectation of privacy in an automobile, police officers are entitled and expected to utilize their senses during the course of their duties. If the aroma of liquor or drug is evident, the question then becomes one of the proper test to determine whether reasonable and probable grounds exist for search. Police officers cannot reasonably be expected to avert their eyes from evidence of activity, whether criminal or otherwise, that could be observed by any vigilant member of the public. So too, police officers do not have to avert their senses from detecting emissions or aromas in the public domain such as traces of smoke and suspicious odours. Such sensing of emissions, aromas or odours and drawing sensible conclusions from their detection is entirely reasonable when considering whether reasonable and probable grounds exist for search. [46] find that the strong odour of raw cannabis marihuana smelled by Constable Wilson combined with the other indicators observed by him provide more than sufficient basis for reasonable grounds either for search or for arrest or for both. [47] The s. Charter argument fails. Detention or Imprisonment [48] Section of the Charter provides that, “Everyone has the right not to be arbitrarily detained or imprisoned.” [49] The authorities are clear that during the course of highway traffic stop the police are authorized to make certain inquiries and need not turn blind eye to matters which legitimately raise their suspicions. [50] In The Queen v. Mellenthin, 1992 CanLII 50 (SCC), [1992] S.C.R. 615, at 623-24, there is the following: There can be no quarrel with the visual inspection of the car by police officers. At night the inspection can only be carried out with the aid of flashlight and it is necessarily incidental to check stop program carried out after dark. The inspection is essential for the protection of those on duty in the check stops. There have been more than enough incidents of violence to police officers when vehicles have been stopped. Nor can place any particular significance upon the fact stressed by the appellant that the police only made use of flashlight after the request had been made of the appellant to produce the necessary papers and not when the constable first approached the car. Although the safety of the police might make it preferable to use the flashlight at the earliest opportunity, it certainly can be utilized at any time as necessary incident to the check stop routine. However, the subsequent questions pertaining to the gym bag were improper. At the moment the questions were asked, the officer had not even the slightest suspicion that drugs or alcohol were in the vehicle or in the possession of the appellant. The appellant’s words, actions and manner of driving did not demonstrate any symptoms of impairment. Check stop programs result in the arbitrary detention of motorists. The programs are justified as means aimed at reducing the terrible toll of death and injury so often occasioned by impaired drivers or by dangerous vehicles. The primary aim of the program is thus to check for sobriety, licences, ownership, insurance and the mechanical fitness of cars. The police use of check stops should not be extended beyond these aims. Random stop programs must not be turned into means of conducting either an unfounded general inquisition or an unreasonable search. [51] In later decision, The Queen v. Belnavis, 1997 CanLII 320 (SCC), [1997] S.C.R. 341, La Forest J. (dissenting on another issue), at p. 371, stated: the police, since Ladouceur, supra, have the power to stop cars at their whim for purposes of traffic regulations and the like and to make enquiries relevant thereto from the occupants. also agree that the police in performing that duty need not turn blind eye to things in plain view that evidence, or raise suspicions of illegality, and that he or she may also ask questions about this, subject, of course, to the occupants’ right to silence. [52] In The Queen v. Sewell, supra, the Saskatchewan Court of Appeal recognized that police have legitimate general duties and powers when dealing with stopped motorists including looking, smelling and listening. Paragraphs 38 to 41 of that decision read as follows: [38] Even if were to find that the officer’s presence at the back of the vehicle was unlawful for the reasons contended by the appellant, would be hard pressed to find that the officer lacked authority to arrest the appellant for an offence he found him committing. By way of analogy, offer this set of circumstances. police officer unlawfully enters dwelling house. That unlawfulness is rooted in breach of one of the occupant’s Charter rights. He finds the occupant pointing gun at another person who is strapped to chair in distraught state. Is the officer precluded from arresting that occupant for committing the offence of forcible confinement on the ground that he, the officer, unlawfully entered the dwelling house? would find it very odd, indeed, if breach of the occupant’s Charter right brought about such result. [40] Tallis J.A. wrote in dissent, but the majority found it unnecessary to deal with the issues reflected in these comments. find that in the present case, the officer, after experiencing “a very strong smell of marihuana, raw marihuana, in the back of the vehicle” (trial transcript, p. 26, lines 23-24), had reasonable and probable grounds to continue the search in question, that the evidence satisfies the D.(I.D.) test and that the search was not unlawful. [41] In the result, I find no breach of the appellant’s s. 8 Charter rights. [53] In The Queen v. Brown, 2001 SKQB 382 (CanLII), (2001) 210 Sask. R. 295 (Q.B.) (appeal dismissed without reasons), Saskatchewan Court of Appeal file 362, the court held that police may ask questions of detained motorist concerning observation or involvement in possible break and enter. [54] In the case before me I find that Constable Wilson was not in breach of the accused’s Charter rights by asking her where she had been and how long she had been there. [55] I find that the accused was not arbitrarily detained and there was no breach of her s. 9 Charter rights. Arrest or Detention [56] Section 10 of the Charter provides in part: 10. Everyone has the right on arrest or detention (a) to be informed promptly of the reasons therefor; (b) to retain and instruct counsel without delay and to be informed of that right; [57] In the case before me, I find that on the arrest or detention of the accused she was promptly informed of the reasons therefor and she was informed of her right to retain and instruct counsel without delay. There was no breach of the accused’s s. 10 Charter rights. [58] In summary I find that there has been no breach of the appellant’s ss. 8, 9 or 10 Charter rights. However, even if had concluded that evidence was obtained against the accused in manner that infringed or denied any of her rights or freedoms as guaranteed by the Charter, would not find that, having regard to all the circumstances, the admission of such evidence would bring the administration of justice into disrepute. [59] The test for the exclusion or non-exclusion of evidence was first articulated in The Queen v. Collins, 1987 CanLII 84 (SCC), [1987] S.C.R. 265. This was later clarified in The Queen v. Stillman, 1997 CanLII 384 (SCC), [1997] S.C.R. 607. [60] The factors to be considered in an analysis of s. 24(2) of the Charter were recently stated by Arbour J. in R. v. Buhay (2003), 2003 SCC 30 (CanLII), 174 C.C.C. (3d) 97 (S.C.C.). At p. 116, Arbour J. stated: D. Should the Evidence be Excluded Under Section 24(2) of the Charter? [41] Since this Court’s landmark decision in Collins, supra, the various factors to be considered in making this determination have been organized under three-step inquiry which has been generally adopted and applied in subsequent decisions of this Court. In the recent decision of Law [2002 SCC 10 (CanLII), [2002] S.C.R. 227], the Court summarized at para. 33 the process for determining whether the admission of evidence would bring the administration of justice into disrepute: In Collins, supra, this Court grouped the circumstances to be considered under s. 24(2) into three categories: (1) the effect of admitting the evidence on the fairness of the subsequent trial, (2) the seriousness of the police’s conduct, and (3) the effects of excluding the evidence on the administration of justice. Trial judges are under an obligation to consider these three factors. (1) Trial Fairness [50] The evidence obtained in violation of the Charter which does not emanate from the accused but rather existed independently of the violation is classified as non-conscriptive evidence. Its admission will not affect adjudicative fairness, but the second and third sets of factors may militate towards its exclusion: Stillman, supra; R. v. Evans, 1996 CanLII 248 (SCC), [1996] S.C.R. 8, 104 C.C.C. (3d) 23, 131 D.L.R. (4th) 654. [61] find that the cannabis marihuana discovered at the side of the road near the railway crossing after being thrown from the accused’s vehicle was non-conscriptive evidence. [62] At pp. 119-20 under the heading “Seriousness of the Breach”, there is the following: [52] The second set of factors relates to the seriousness of the Charter violation. The seriousness of the police’s conduct depends on “whether it was committed in good faith, or was inadvertent or of merely technical nature, or whether it was deliberate, wilful or flagrant” Therens [1985 CanLII 29 (SCC), [1985] S.C.R. 613], at p. 652. It is also relevant to consider whether the violation was motivated by situation of urgency or necessity: Therens, at p. 652; R. v. Silveira, 1995 CanLII 89 (SCC), [1995] S.C.R. 297 at p. 367, 97 C.C.C. (3d) 450, 124 D.L.R. (4th) 193; Law, supra, at para. 37. Also pertinent is whether the police officer could have obtained the evidence by other means, thus rendering her or his disregard for the Charter gratuitous and blatant: Collins, supra, at p. 285; Law, supra, at para. 37. The court may also look at some or all of the following factors: the obtrusiveness of the search, the individual’s expectation of privacy in the area searched and the existence of reasonable and probable grounds (R. v. Caslake, 1998 CanLII 838 (SCC), [1998] S.C.R. 51, 121 C.C.C. (3d) 97, 155 D.L.R. (4th) 19, at para. 34). As we have seen, the trial judge is entitled to considerable deference on this point: Law, supra, at para. [63] In the case before me, Constable Wilson conducted legal vehicle stop after observing the broken tail light on the accused’s vehicle. find that Constable Wilson’s conduct was committed in good faith. It was not deliberate, wilful or flagrant. It is apparent that at 4:30 in the morning on dark night on highway there was some urgency or necessity to deal with this matter. Further, in the end result the police officers were able to obtain the evidence of the cannabis marihuana in the accused’s vehicle when it was thrown out of that vehicle. Thus, if there had been any disregard for the Charter rights, such disregard would be rendered gratuitous and blatant. [64] Counsel for the accused submits that the search if any began when Constable Wilson inquired of the accused where she had been and how long she had been there and the statement of fact that she had no luggage. Counsel for the accused also submits that when Constable Wilson shone his flashlight into the accused’s purse, this was search. In the case before me find that the search was not obtrusive. The accused’s expectation of privacy in her vehicle would be minimal and most important of all find that there was an existence of reasonable and probable grounds. [65] At p. 125 in R. v. Buhay, supra, Arbour J., under the heading “The Effect of Exclusion on the Reputation of the Administration of Justice”, states: [67] The third question from Collins is whether excluding the evidence would have more serious impact on the repute of the administration of justice than admitting it. This factor is generally related to the seriousness of the offence and the importance of the evidence to the case for the Crown. In Law, supra, at para. 39, the Court summarized this inquiry as follows: “In general, this turns on whether the unconstitutionally obtained evidence forms crucial part of the Crown’s case and, where trial fairness is not affected, the seriousness of the underlying charge.” [66] In the case before me, the admissibility of the evidence is essential to the Crown’s case in count in the indictment. [67] Count in the indictment is serious offence. [68] At pp. 126-27, Arbour J. stated: [71] Admittedly, there are various precedents where non-conscriptive evidence such as drugs was admitted on the basis that exclusion would bring the administration of justice into further disrepute than admission would, especially where the evidence was essential to the Crown (see, e.g., Mercer [(1992), 1992 CanLII 7729 (ON CA), 70 C.C.C. (3d) 180 (Ont. C.A.)]; Kokesch [1990 CanLII 55 (SCC), [1990] S.C.R. 3]; Evans, supra). Section 24(2) is not an automatic exclusionary rule (see, inter alia, Dyment, supra); in my view, neither should it become an automatic inclusionary rule when the evidence is non-conscriptive and essential to the Crown’s case. [72] The question under s. 24(2) is whether the system’s repute will be better served by the admission or the exclusion of the evidence, and it is thus necessary to consider any disrepute that may result from the exclusion of the evidence: Collins, supra, at pp. 285-86. At the end of the day, though, the constitutional question is whether the admission of the evidence would bring the administration of justice into dispute (Collins, supra, at p. 281).

Background:[2] The Plaintiff operates the only drug store in the semi-rural community of Berwick.","The appellant was convicted of driving a motor vehicle while his licence was suspended.
The appeal centred upon the adjudicator's acceptance of the police officer's evidence and the reliability of that evidence versus the defence witnesses who testified that the appellant's son was actually the driver of the vehicle.
Appeal allowed; verdict of acquittal entered.
The adjudicator erred by failing to address whether the appellant's evidence raised a reasonable doubt as to his innocence, particularly on the central issue of whether the appellant was the only person present in the vehicle.
But not making a finding on this critical issue, this tended to suggest more strongly that the adjudicator engaged in an either/or analysis in accepting the evidence of the Crown's witnesses over that of the four defence witnesses; the adjudicator should have made clear findings of credibility based on the evidence before him.","[1, 3, 2, 4, 6, 5, 7, 8, 10, 9, 11, 13, 12, 15, 0]",394,"J. IN THE SUPREME COURT OF NOVA SCOTIA Citation: R. v. Guthro, 2005 NSSC 297 Date: 20051101 Docket: SH No. 232556A Registry: Halifax Between: Charlie Guthro v. Her Majesty The Queen Respondent Judge: The Honourable Justice M. Heather Robertson Heard: June 1, 2005, in Halifax, Nova Scotia Written Decision: November 1, 2005 Counsel: David S. Green, for the appellant Andrea E. Jamieson, for the respondent Robertson, J.: [1] This appeal arises from a decision of David Johnson, Adjudicator in the Provincial Court of Nova Scotia, who convicted the appellant for driving a motor vehicle while his license was suspended contrary to s. 287(2) of the Motor Vehicle Act, F.S.N.S. 1989, c. 293, as amended. The offence occurred on February 13, 2003. [2] The appellant plead not guilty and the trial was held on May 17, 2004. Following written submissions, the decision was delivered on September 27, 2004. [3] At the trial, the Crown called one witness, Constable Guy Napier of the Halifax Regional Police Force. The appellant testified as did three other witnesses, his son Dennis Guthro who testified it was he who drove the car; Jacqueline Noble, patron at the nearby gas station, where the ticket was issued; and Neil Upham, an attendant at the service station. [4] The appeal centers upon the adjudicator’s acceptance of Constable Napier’s evidence and the reliability of the evidence, i.e., his glimpse of the appellant driving his auto as a sole occupant while unlicensed versus the defence witnesses who testified that the appellant was not the driver of the vehicle but that his son was. [5] The grounds of appeal are: 1. The Honourable Adjudicator erred in not properly interpreting the provisions of s. 287(2) of the Motor Vehicle Act, R.S.N.S. 1989, c. 298, as amended; 2. The Honourable Adjudicator erred by relying solely upon the evidence of only one Crown witness, police officer, and apparently rejecting in total the evidence of the Appellant and three other civilian witnesses; 3. The Honourable Adjudicator erred by failing to give the benefit of reasonable doubt to the Appellant; 4. The verdict was unreasonable and cannot be supported by the evidence; 5. There was insufficient evidence to prove that the Appellant was in fact the driver of motor vehicle driving while suspended; 6. Such other grounds as may appear from reading of the record. [6] The scope of the appellate review in summary conviction appeal is well settled. [7] In R. v. Ryan, 2002 NSCA 153 (CanLII), [2002] N.S.J. No. 514 (C.A.) Justice Oland reviewed the jurisprudence on the standard of review in summary conviction appeals at paras. 14 and 15 of the decision: Absent an error of law or miscarriage of justice, the test to be applied by the Summary Conviction Appeal Court is whether the findings of the trial judge are unreasonable or cannot be supported by the evidence. As stated by the Supreme Court of Canada in R. v. Burns, 1994 CanLII 127 (SCC), [1994] S.C.R. 656 at 657, the appeal court is entitled to review the evidence at trial, re‑examine and reweigh it, but only for the purpose of determining whether it is reasonably capable of supporting the trial judge's conclusions. If it is, the Summary Conviction Appeal Court is not entitled to substitute its view of the evidence for that of the trial judge. In short, summary conviction appeal on the record is an appeal; it is neither simple review to determine whether there was some evidence to support the trial judge's conclusions nor new trial on the transcript. R. v. Biniaris, 2000 SCC 15 (CanLII), [2000] S.C.R. 381 at para 42 confirmed that the test for an appellate court determining whether judgment is unreasonable or cannot be supported by the evidence was that set out in R. v. Yebes, 1987 CanLII 17 (SCC), [1987] S.C.R. 168 at p. 185, namely: whether the verdict is one that properly instructed jury acting judicially, could reasonably have rendered. In Yebes, in discussing the function of an appellate court, the Supreme Court of Canada stated at para 25: The Court must determine on the whole of the evidence whether the verdict is one that properly instructed jury, acting judicially, could reasonably have rendered. While the Court of Appeal must not merely substitute its view for that of the jury, in order to apply the test the Court must re‑examine and to some extent reweigh and consider the effect of the evidence. [8] Crown counsel have also cited R. v. Stone (1996), 1996 CanLII 5576 (NS CA), 148 N.S.R. (2d) 46, 1996 CarswellNS 55 (C.A.); R. v. Davis (1996), 1996 CanLII 5574 (NS CA), 148 N.S.R. (2d) 68, 1996 CarswellNS 52 (C.A.) cases which have reviewed. [9] On the issue of credibility of witness, determined at the trial level they rely on Re Cole Estate (1994), 1994 CanLII 4044 (NS CA), 131 N.S.R. (2d) 296, 194 CarswellNS 111 (C.A.), case in which Roscoe J.A. cited with approval the test articulated by MacDonald J.A. in Travelers Indeminity Co. of Canada v. Kehoe (1985), 66 N.S.R. (2d) 434 at para. 15: This and other Appellate Courts have said time after time that the credibility of witnesses is matter peculiarly within the province of the trial Judge. He has the distinct advantage, denied Appeal Court Judges, of seeing and hearing the witnesses; of observing their demeanor and conduct, hearing their nuances of speech and subtlety of expression and generally is presented with those intangibles that so often must be weighed in determining whether or not witness is truthful. These are the matters that are not capable of reflection in the written record and it is because of such factors that save strong and cogent reasons appellate tribunals are not justified in reversing finding of credibility made by trial Judge. Particularly is that so where, as here, the case was heard by an experienced trial Judge. [10] The Crown also cited R. v. W. (R), 1992 CanLII 56 (SCC), [1992] S.C.R. 122, 1992 CarswellONT 90 wherein McLachlin J., as she then was, commented on the scope of appellate review turning on findings of credibility. At para. 21 she stated: 21 It is thus clear that court of appeal, in determining whether the trier of fact could reasonably have reached the conclusion that the accused is guilty beyond reasonable doubt, must re‑examine, and to some extent at least, reweigh and consider the effect of the evidence. The only question remaining is whether this rule applies to verdicts based on findings of credibility. In my opinion, it does. The test remains the same: could jury or judge properly instructed and acting reasonably have convicted? That said, in applying the test the court of appeal should show great deference to findings of credibility made at trial. This Court has repeatedly affirmed the importance of taking into account the special position of the trier of fact on matters of credibility ... The trial judge has the advantage, denied to the appellate court, of seeing and hearing the evidence of witnesses. However, as matter of law it remains open to an appellate court to overturn verdict based on findings of credibility where, after considering all the evidence and having due regard to the advantages afforded to the trial judge, it concludes that the verdict is unreasonable. [11] The evidence of Constable Napier was that while waiting to enter Caldwell Road, he was stopped at stop sign on Sherwood Street which forms with Caldwell Road. He testified that he saw the appellant driving his vehicle along Caldwell Road, at posted rate of speed of 50 km per hour. He testified that he had approximately five seconds to observe the appellant driving the vehicle and that he saw only one occupant in the vehicle. He testified that he called in the vehicle license plate number and he received information back that the license of the registered owner of the vehicle was suspended. [12] He testified that this plate query was completed in approximately two minutes. He then testified that he did u-turn to follow the vehicle. He stated that about half block past Sherwood Street he came up to gasoline gaming establishment called Treaty Gas, where he observed the appellant’s vehicle parked just beyond the front door of the establishment. He stated that he then walked to the rear of the then empty vehicle and saw that its plate matched the plate number of his query. At this point male exited the service station who Constable Napier testified was the appellant; the man he had seen driving the vehicle minutes earlier. [13] Constable Napier said he requested of him driver’s license, vehicle registration and vehicle insurance. Constable Napier then testified: made the gentleman aware of the reason that requested the documentation and that was why was carrying out an investigation with regards to suspended driver. Immediately this gentleman stated to me ... [objection dealt with by the Court and disallowed] “Can’t you give me break.” [14] Mr. Guthro the appellant, in his evidence explained his statement by testifying that Constable Napier had not specified why he wanted to see his documentation and that he believed the reason for the request was that he had failed to turn in his license pursuant to letter he had received from the Registry of Motor Vehicles in December 2002 after his license had been suspended and that he would therefore receive another expensive ticket. [15] He testified that the ticket had been handed to him folded and that not until he returned inside the service station did he realize the nature of the ticket. He said he flipped out and that is when people spoke up, referring to the witnesses Neil Upham and Jacqueline Noble, who agreed he had not been the driver of the vehicle. [16] The appellant also testified that just before this, Constable Napier had asked him to move his vehicle away from the pump, twice, but he had refused saying that he could not, he had no license and that he then went inside to ask his son to move the car. [17] The appellant’s son Dennis Gutho testified that he had been ill that morning and was at home when friend called from the local high school requesting help, as his vehicle would not start and needed jump. He testified that he drove his father’s car, but had asked his father to come along. He testified that on the way to Cole Harbour High they needed gas and stopped at Treaty Gas where he, still feeling unwell, rushed from the car and went into the service station to the bathroom where he remained for some time. [18] This evidence was supported by the evidence of the two independent witnesses Neil Upham and Jacqueline Noble, both of whom said they did not know the appellant before that day and had both volunteered to go to court and testify that he was not the driver of the vehicle because they had seen Dennis Guthro get out of the driver’s side of the vehicle and rush into the service station. Both these witnesses in the course of their testimony had confused passenger side with driver side door and quickly corrected their testimony and testified that Dennis Guthro did get out of the driver’s side of the vehicle. [19] significant issue arising out of the evidence before the adjudicator was whether the vehicle was driven by sole occupant or whether both Guthro’s were in the vehicle as well as their mixed breed dog. [20] This is an issue that the adjudicator did not address. Indeed the adjudicator made no significant review of the evidence before him. [21] The adjudicator stated: had subsequent opportunity to peruse by way of transcript. The accused inter alia indicated he was not driving the vehicle, and the other witnesses globally, either by inference or direct reference, indicated the accused was not the driver of the vehicle. closely observed the deportment and demeanour of all witnesses in this matter. was particularly impressed by the demeanour of the Crown’s witness, Cst. Napier. found his evidence to be detailed, forthright, unreserved, unequivocal, and in particular, unwavering on cross-examination. On the other hand, found the witnesses for the accused and their evidence to be, in some cases, convenient, somewhat confused, illogical, unconvincing and, on the whole, uncompelling. therefore accept the evidence of Cst. Napier in this matter and reject the evidence of the aforementioned witnesses presented by counsel for the accused. Given the experience of the Crown’s witness, his location at the time, the time of day, duration of opportunity, and distance from the accused’s vehicle on initial contact, together with the aforementioned explanation of the accused to the officer, am satisfied that the Crown has established to my satisfaction prima facie case, having proved all the elements of the offence necessary for conviction, and on the basis of the acceptable evidence have heard, I’m satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of the guilt of the accused in this matter. [22] The adjudicator accepted the evidence of Constable Napier over that of the appellant and the three other corroborating witnesses. The adjudicator found the Constable Napier’s evidence to be more credible. He appeared to relate the credibility of the Crown’s witness to the confidence and experience of this witness in giving his testimony. [23] The adjudicator fell into error by failing to address whether the appellant’s evidence raised a reasonable doubt as to his innocence, particularly on the central issue of whether the vehicle was solely occupied. [24] Absent of finding on this issue, the credibility of Constable Napier’s evidence is brought into question. By not making a find on the critical issue of whether there was a sole occupant in the vehicle, this tends to suggest more strongly that the adjudicator engaged in an “either/or” analysis in accepting the evidence of the Crown’s witness over that of the four witnesses for the defence. [25] The adjudicator did not instruct himself in accordance with the test set out in R. v. W. (D.), 1991 CanLII 93 (SCC), [1991] S.C.R. 742 (S.C.C.) where the case rested solely on his findings of credibility. [26] As Cory J. stated at p. there are three steps which must be addressed onthe issue ot credibility: First, if you believe the evidence of the accused, obviously you must acquit. Second, if you do not believe the testimony of the accused but you are left in reasonable doubt by it, you must acquit. Third, even if you are not left in doubt by the evidence of the accused, you must ask yourself whether, on the basis of the evidence which you do accept, you are convinced beyond reasonable doubt by that evidence of the guilt of the accused. [27] The adjudicator should have made clear findings of credibility based on the evidence before him. In this case the evidence before the adjudicator was clearly capable of being evidence to the contrary so as to raise reasonable doubt. The adjudicator failed to examine the evidence in this light and make findings of credibility based on the weight of the evidence before him. [28] I allow this appeal of the conviction. I find it would be impractical to order a new trial at this date and accordingly order that a verdict of acquittal be entered. Justice M. Heather Robertson",9_2005nssc297.txt,"The appellant was convicted of driving a motor vehicle while his licence was suspended.

The accused was found not guilty.
The court found that the accused’s s. 8 Charter rights had been breached.
After applying the Grant analysis, the court decided that the breach was serious and that the unreasonable search affected the accused’s privacy, liberty and dignity because the accused did not invite the officer into her house, she was followed by the officer throughout her home and then handcuffed outside her home in full public view.
The court concluded that society’s interests to be free from police interference in their own home without proper judicial authorization supported the exclusion of the evidence.

For the Crown Merv Nidesh, Q.C. For the Accused JUDGMENT M. GORDON, Introduction [1] Erinn Maria Babich is charged as follows: On May 20, 2016 at or near Moose Jaw, Saskatchewan did without reasonable excuse, fail, or refuse to comply with demand made to her by peace officer pursuant to section 254(2) of the Criminal Code to provide sample of her breath to enable analysis to be made by means of an approved screening device contrary to section 254(5) of the Criminal Code On May 20, 2016 at or near Moose Jaw, Saskatchewan did while her ability to operate motor vehicle was impaired by alcohol or drug, operate motor vehicle, contrary to section 255(1) and section 253(1)(a) of the Criminal Code. [2] The Crown proceeded summarily and the trial took place September 7, 2016 in Moose Jaw. [3] The defence served and filed Charter notice alleging several breaches. [4] Counsel agreed that all evidence would be heard on the voir dire and all admissible evidence on the voir dire would apply to the trial proper. The defence did not call any evidence on the voir dire or during the trial proper. [5] The defence agreed that the only Charter issue being pursued was breach of Section 8. [6] Kelly Smith worked at the 7-11 on 13th Avenue in Moose Jaw. On May 20th woman came to her till asking for cigarettes. Ms. Smith had to ask her few times what brand of cigarettes which she thought was strange. She also noted strong odour of alcohol coming from this woman. The woman had little child with her and left the store and got into her vehicle and drove towards Grace Street. The woman put the child in car seat in the back of the vehicle. This was about nine to ten in the evening. Ms. Smith could not identify this woman and Ms. Smith called 911 as she was concerned that the woman was driving around with child in the vehicle under the influence of alcohol. [7] Constable Clements was on regular duty May 20th and received dispatch relating that an employee of 7-11 had called saying there was lady in the store who was intoxicated, had small child and then she had got into vehicle and driven away. The vehicle licence plate was provided and the SGI check showed it was registered in the name of Babich Farms and gave an address of an Erinn Babich. As result of this information Constable Clements drove to an address on Simcoe Street and drove by the residence looking for the vehicle which had been described to her. She was concerned that perhaps this person was out driving around with young child in the vehicle. She pulled up in her unmarked police vehicle in front of the house and knocked on the door. She stood on the landing by the front door. Ms. Babich answered the door and identified herself. The officer noted she had glossy eyes her speech was slow and there was smell of alcohol. Ms. Babich said she had come from the 7-11 store and had couple of drinks before driving but insisted she was not drunk. Constable Clements advised Ms. Babich that she had reasonable grounds to suspect Ms. Babich was operating motor vehicle while impaired. The officer told Ms. Babich that she was investigating this complaint of drinking and driving and that she would be making an approved screening device demand and administering this test. This was at 9:39 p.m. The basis for the officer’s suspicion was information from Ms. Babich. There was smell of alcohol coming from the woman. The eyes were droopy and the speech was very slow and Ms. Babich’s admission of having few beverages before driving to the 7-11 store. [8] Ms. Babich kept saying she knew her rights and wanted lawyer and was concerned that the police officer was there at the direction of her ex-spouse. There was some discussion with respect to what to do with the child and Ms. Babich informed her there was nanny present and so the officer followed Ms. Babich to the kitchen then upstairs looking for the nanny. The officer read the approved screening device from her issued card while both were inside the residence. [9] Ms. Babich accompanied the police officer to the police vehicle and was requested to stand outside. Constable Clements retrieves an ASD device and readies it. The accused still refused despite being explained the consequences. Ms. Babich was arrested for impaired driving, handcuffed, read her rights and warnings, and placed in the back of the police vehicle. At this time Ms. Babich said she wanted to talk to certain lawyer and that he was unavailable as he was in Hawaii. She refused any other options. [10] Corporal Lewis was on scene as well and after some discussion Ms. Babich was released to appear in court at later date. [11] On cross-examination Constable Clements acknowledged that the purpose of her going to the house was to locate the vehicle and who was the driver. She was looking for possible impaired driver. In other words she was investigating under the Criminal Code. She later agreed in cross-examination that she was going to the residence “searching for person and vehicle”. The officer did not see person or vehicle when she gets to the residence on Simcoe. She did not know if person or the vehicle was there and the only way to find out was to go to the door and request the person to open it and identify herself. This is in fact what the officer does when Ms. Babich comes to the door. Constable Clements says she is investigating an impaired driving complaint and watching the person to get evidence. She admitted to engaging the accused in conversation to find out if the accused was the driver and to get evidence with respect to this investigation such as the accused’s speech and actions. The officer says these are critical pieces of information in an impaired driving investigation. [12] Mr. Nidesh agreed that his application on behalf of Ms. Babich was under Section of the Charter of Rights and Freedoms. The officer filed the case of Stevens, 2011 OJ No 6059 as well as the case of Minielly, 2009 YJ No Yukon Territorial Court. In addition Mr. Nidesh referred to the very recent case from the Saskatchewan Court of Appeal of Rogers, 2016 SKCA 105 (CanLII). [13] Defence counsel referred to the Minielly case from the Yukon saying that once the officer formed reasonable and probable grounds to arrest Ms. Babich for impaired driving making the ASD demand was unlawful. [14] The second argument of the defence was based on the Rogers case submitting that the within facts are very similar. The argument is that the police officer’s only purpose was to locate the vehicle and the person and therefore Constable Clements was engaged in search under the Criminal Code to find the person and specific vehicle and to get evidence to support the grounds for impaired driving. [15] The observations that the officer makes from engaging Ms. Babich in conversation at the door are very similar as the Rogers case. The officer engaged in warrantless search that was without justification as it was with respect to dwelling house. The officer should have obtained warrant to enter the house. [16] The defence submits that pursuant to 24(2) of the Charter all evidence should be excluded from the time of the breach. Crown’s Argument [17] The Crown indicated that certainly Rogers needs to be considered but refers in particular to paragraphs 28 and 29 for support. The Crown also refers to the Gothiam case which was Court of Appeal Case of some vintage where the officer was investigating as result of an accident and was invited into the house. [18] The Crown also refers to the Vanwick case where the police go to the registered owner’s home who turns out to be the driver and he is arrested in his house. The Crown specifically points to paragraph 25 in Vanwick. [19] The Crown argues the police officer went to the house because there was continuing offence and as result it is different from the Rogers case. Crown suggests that Constable Clements did not go to the house for the purpose of securing evidence for crime but rather concern with continuing offence. [20] Counsel agreed that the only issue is whether there was breach of Ms. Babich’s Charter rights pursuant to Section of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. [21] Section of the Charter reads as follows: Everyone has the right to be secure against unreasonable search or seizure. [22] The recent case of Rogers, 2016 SKCA 105 (CanLII) is of course binding on me and the facts are almost identical. In Rogers, Madam Justice Jackson speaking for the court states at paragraph one: [1] This appeal concerns the powers of the police to knock on the door of residence for the purpose of securing evidence as to whether the occupant, who was recently seen driving motor vehicle, is impaired. [3] Ms. Rogers was acquitted at trial of both counts. The trial judge found that the officer had knocked on his apartment door for the purpose of obtaining evidence against the occupant. The trial judge found that this constituted an unreasonable breach of s. of the Charter (R Rogers, 2012 SKPC 42 (CanLII), 394 Sask 302) [Voir dire Decision]). [1] When the trial resumed, the Crown made no submissions as to whether any of the evidence should be excluded under s. 24(2) of the Charter and the defence referred only briefly to Grant, 2009 SCC 32 (CanLII) [2009] SCR 353 [Grant]. The trial judge excluded all of the evidence and entered not guilty verdicts. The Crown appealed to the summary conviction appeal court. [5] have concluded for the reasons that follow that the appeal should be allowed and the decision of the Provincial Court restored. [23] The facts in Rogers are set out in paragraphs through 10. When say that the facts are almost identical note paragraph which states as follows: [8] Constable Dechief went directly to this building and he entered what he recalled was an unlocked exterior door and approached the door of Mr. Roger’s apartment. When he knocked on the door, Mr. Rogers opened the door and, while the two remained on either side of the door jam, Cst. Dechief formed the opinion that Mr. Rogers was impaired. The officer described his speech as “very slurred”. [24] The police officer then decided that he had grounds to make an improved screening device on Mr. Rogers. On appeal to the Court of Queen’s Bench Mr. Justice Chicoine relying on Vanwick, 104 OTC 161 at paragraph 33 (Superior Court SUP. CT), affirmed 2002 OJ 3144 (QL) (CA) held that the investigative questioning by the police officer does not exceed the bounds of the implied right to approach and knock and is not trespassing or in breach of Section of the Charter. The Crown in this case also relies on Vu, 1999 BCCA 182 (CanLII) leave to appeal to SCC refused and Grothiem, 2001 SKCA 116 (CanLII) as well as the Vanwick case. Considering these cases Madam Justice Jackson says in Rogers at paragraph 28 as follows: agree with Crown counsel’s submissions, as stated in the above paragraph, but Crown counsel goes on to extract from the above cases the principle that the police have an implied power to knock on someone’s door for the purpose of investigating possible drinking and driving offence, even if they do so with the intention of gathering evidence about the state of an occupant’s sobriety. In my view the cases do not go that far. At paragraph 29 Madam Justice Jackson concludes: The investigation of the crime of drinking and driving, or similar offence, necessarily entails the potential to obtain evidence from conversing with or observing the person answering the door. Nonetheless, based on my review of the authorities, have concluded that if trial judge finds on all of the evidence police officer knocked on the door to residence for the purpose of securing evidence against the occupant, the officer is conducting search within the meaning of s. of the Charter. This principle applies equally to drinking and driving offences as well as to other offences where observing the person opening the door will give visual, auditory and olfactory clues about the person’s participation in the crime under investigation. Evans remains the leading authority on point, and nothing in the jurisprudence extends the principles articulated by the majority in that decision as far as Crown counsel suggests. [31] For Sopinka J., the implied invitation to knock extends no further than is required to permit “convenient communication with the occupant of the dwelling’ (at 18). [25] Madam Justice Jackson states that Evans is still good law and the leading case on Section challenges. She also reviews in paragraphs 30 to 34 various more recent authorities from the Supreme Court. [26] The cases are fact based. It is the officer’s purpose that is accepted by the court that is crucial. Is the purpose of the police officer to talk to the home owner about an accident for example or is the sole purpose to continue an investigation and obtain further evidence against the occupant? The police are clearly engaged in search within Section of the Charter. With this distinction in mind it is clear that cases such as Grotheim and Vanwick and the like are distinguishable on the facts. At paragraph 53 of Rogers the court refers to the transcript of the questions and answers of Constable Dechief in both examination in-chief and cross. My notes indicate that Mr. Nidesh put the same or almost the same questions to Constable Clements in the within case and received similar answers. [27] rely on the following evidence which was not challenged: The police officer received certain information from dispatch about possible impaired driver The officer attended at the address of the registered owner obtained via licence plate information. The officer saw no person or vehicle in the area. The officer knocked on the door, woman answered. The police officer testified that she was investigating possible Criminal Code offence and went to this residence searching for person and vehicle. The officer’s sole purpose was to obtain the identity of the driver and to obtain grounds to make an approved screening device demand. [28] The police officer testified that the information she received from the occupant was the identity of the occupant being the accused, she could smell alcohol and she made observations of the accused. The officer admitted the only way that she could obtain information for an approved screening device demand was in this fashion. Officer Clements testified in cross-examination that she told the occupant she was investigating an impaired driver complaint and that she was watching the person to get evidence, such as her speech and actions. These were critical pieces of information. [29] In Rogers the Court of Appeal upheld the trial judge’s conclusions that the police officer was attending to conduct search for evidence following Evans, 1996 CanLII 248 (SCC), 1996 SCJ 1, the police officer exceeded the authority conferred by the implied licence to knock. The Court of Appeal affirmed in Rogers the trial judge’s decision that this search was found to be unreasonable and therefore breach of Section of the Charter. warrantless search is primefecia unreasonable and the Crown bears the onus of showing that it is reasonable. In Collins, 1987 CanLII 84 (SCC), 1987 SCR 265, Chief Justice Lamer stated that warrantless search is presumed to be unreasonable and the Crown must establish the search was reasonable on balance of probabilities. search will be reasonable if it is authorized by law, if the law itself is reasonable and if the manner in which the search was carried out is reasonable. The Crown fails on all three requirements. Applying Evans the search was not authorized by law as well the case of Feeney, 1997 CanLII 342 (SCC), 1997 SCR 13 requires the police have warrant and judicial authorization to enter dwelling house unless the police officer is in hot pursuit of an individual in attempting to make an arrest. [30] Finally Constable Clements and several police officers as it turns out were in front of the Babich home in this residential area. Ms. Babich was handcuffed outside her home on the street in full public view. Constable Clements had already walked around inside the house with the accused to keep contact with her and watch her. There was very young child present. conclude Constable Clements had no lawful authority to conduct search at the entrance to the house nor to enter the house without permission. [31] Neither counsel made any argument with respect to the appropriate remedy other than referring to Grant analysis. section 24(2) analysis pursuant to Grant 2009 SCC 32 (CanLII) requires the court to consider and balance the effect of admitting into the trial process the unconstitutionally obtained evidence on the one hand against society’s confidence in the long term criminal justice system. The court must have regard to the following: i. The seriousness of the Charter infringing state conduct. ii. The impact of the breach on Charter protected interests of the accused. iii. Society’s interest in adjudication of the case on its merits. [32] When consider the first line of inquiry have to look to Constable Clement’s actions that night. accept that Constable Clement’s felt this was acceptable police procedure. Indeed the Rogers case is very recent judgment of the Court of Appeal dated August 19, 2016 of the within incident. From the case law it is clear that the police and indeed often courts have upheld this type of investigation. What do find more serious with respect to the police actions that evening was the entering of the home without consent or invitation and following Ms. Babich around the home so she did not lose eye contact with her. In addition the arrival of other officers on scene and placing Ms. Babich in handcuffs outside the police car and requesting that she go down to the police station initially, find more objectionable. Although I do not find the police officer behaviour egregious I do find the Charter breach is serious. [33] The second stage of analysis calls on the court to consider the extent to which the breach undermines the interest protected by the Charter. Here I find the unreasonable search contrary to Section 8. It affected the accused’s privacy, liberty, and human dignity. She was in her own home. She did not ask the police officer in and as I have said the police officer’s accompanying her around the home and the actions outside of the home in full public view in a residential neighbourhood are serious. [34] Finally the third factor in Grant being the adjudication of the case on its merits has to be considered. Breath samples of course constitute very reliable evidence with respect to this charge. The refusal to provide samples is also viewed as serious offence and carries the same penalty. An individual should not be allowed or rewarded for frustrating the system and frustrating the detection of impaired drivers. Parliament and society at large have acknowledged the serious social impact of impaired drivers. On the other hand again cannot over emphasize Ms. Babich was in her own home when the police officer came and entered the home for one specific purpose only. There were other methods to obtain this information such as search warrant. Certainly the public has a strong interest in the detection of impaired drivers but also I would suggest the public has equally or stronger interest in the right of citizens to be free from police interference in their own home without proper judicial authorization. Therefore balancing the three lines of inquiry in the Grant analysis do not condone such Charter breach when other avenues were available to the police. find admitting the evidence would undermine the long term repute of the administration of justice. As such the evidence will be excluded. Counsel at the outset said my decision on the voir dire would be determinative of the final decision in this matter. [35] Therefore, I find Ms. Babich not guilty on count one. Impaired Driving [36] The Crown must prove the essential elements of this charge beyond reasonable doubt. The leading cases Stellato, 1994 CanLII 94 (SCC), [1994 SCR 478]. The case stands for the proposition that as long as the evidence of impairment establishes beyond reasonable doubt any degree of impairment ranging from slight to great the offence has been made out. [37] There was no evidence of driving at all. Ms. Babich walked to her vehicle carrying small child put the child in car seat in the backseat and drove away. Ms. Smith, the 7-11 employee, went outside the store to obtain the licence plate. Ms. Smith gave no evidence with respect to the driving actions of Ms. Babich. Constable Clements received call from dispatch about possible impaired driver and attended very quickly to the Simcoe Street address as she was the in the area. There was no vehicle outside and when she knocked on the door the occupant answered. [38] The Crown did not really argue the impaired driving charge and I find there was little if any evidence to support the charge. Therefore count two with respect to the impaired driving I find Ms. Babich not guilty as well.",9_2016skpc123.txt,"HELD: The Charter application was granted.

After applying the Grant analysis, the court decided that the breach was serious and that the unreasonable search affected the accused’s privacy, liberty and dignity because the accused did not invite the officer into her house, she was followed by the officer throughout her home and then handcuffed outside her home in full public view.
The court concluded that society’s interests to be free from police interference in their own home without proper judicial authorization supported the exclusion of the evidence.

Gordon QUEEN’S BENCH FOR SASKATCHEWAN Citation: 2016 SKQB 216 Date: 2016 06 21 Docket: DIV 757 of 2015 Judicial Centre: Saskatoon BETWEEN: ALISON STEPHANIE HERCHAK McCORRISTON and JAMES ROBERT McCORRISTON Counsel: James M. Streeton for the petitioner wife Alan W. Rankine for the respondent husband FIAT GOEBEL J. June 21, 2016 Introduction [1] The wife applies for interim spousal support and an order providing her with an interim distribution of property in the amount of $25,000. [2] The parties were involved in spousal relationship for almost 10 years. They had no children together although the husband has children from prior relationship for whom he pays support. During the relationship the wife suffered from health problems which resulted in her becoming disabled and unable to continue her employment. During this same time period the husband secured full-time employment with CN. [3] The parties separated in July 2015. The wife currently supports herself from two sources of disability benefits for total income in the range of $20,000 per year. She has lived frugally and has kept her expenses at minimum. Since separation she has resided with extended family members, most recently her mother, with the result that she has no costs for housing. Although she deposes that this is not sustainable long-term, she has not provided any evidence respecting her future plans or whether she has applied for subsidized housing. [4] The husband’s total reported income in 2015 was $74,174. He has one minor child in his care and continues to pay $1,100 in child support each month to his former spouse. He claims that he has no monies remaining after his basic expenses are paid. Interim Spousal Support [5] The wife seeks an order in the amount of $2,000 per month to equalize the gross incomes of the parties. In so doing she suggests that the Spousal Support Advisory Guidelines: Carol Rogerson Rollie Thompson, Spousal Support Advisory Guidelines ([Ottawa]: Department of Justice, 2008), should not apply in these circumstances. Further, in proposing this sum she makes no adjustment for the husband’s child support obligations nor the fact that he is supporting minor child in his care. [6] The husband does not take issue with the wife’s entitlement to interim support but states that she has failed to demonstrate need for support at this time. Specifically, he points out that her sworn financial statement shows modest surplus, which is enhanced given additional evidence that 94% of the cost of her medical expenses is covered. The husband also argues that he is not able to afford support payment at this time. It is noted that his calculations of affordability rely solely on net income figures making no allowance for the fact that spousal support is deductible payment. [7] In Hein Hein, 2004 SKQB 277 (CanLII) [Hein], Sandomirsky J. addressed the issue of interim spousal support claims by saying, at para. 32: 32 At an interim stage it is often quoted that the paramount consideration at an early stage of the breakdown is “need and ability to pay.” The statutes do not prescribe separate considerations, factors or objectives for interim spousal support as opposed to final determination of spousal support. The paramountcy of need and ability is reflection that an interim order is made before family property division is completed and also anticipates that the attainment of economic self‑sufficiency and overcoming the economic hardship of the marriage breakdown are yet to be achieved. The primary purpose of interim spousal support is to allocate family income in fair and equitable manner during this transition period. [8] In Antonishyn Boucher, 2011 SKQB 147 (CanLII), 373 Sask 154, he expanded on his comments in Hein and provided comprehensive overview of the principles to be considered on an interim application for spousal support as follows: 38 Case law has established that at an interim stage, what may be “reasonable” may differ from what may be “reasonable” at the final or variation stage. The case law emphasizes that need and means take on greater significance because: (i) the interim order usually precedes the division of family property; (ii) one of the spouses may be in control of the income generating family assets and have access thereto, whereas the other spouse may not have equivalent or any such access; (iii) section 5(1) of The Family Maintenance Act expressly emphasizes, “need and capability to pay”; (iv) section of The Family Maintenance Act expressly mandates that, “the court shall take into account the needs, means and economic circumstances of the parties”; (v) similarly, s. 15.2(4) of the Divorce Act mandates that the court shall take into account “the conditions, means, needs and other circumstances of each spouse”; (vi) spouse is not required to consume one’s capital, savings or other family property when there is ability to reallocate family income to overcome disparities in the incomes of the spouses; (vii) attainment of economic self sufficiency [sic] and overcoming economic hardship of the marriage breakdown are yet to be achieved. See: Frass v. Frass 2006 SKQB 189 (CanLII); [2006] S.J. No. 287 (QL) at para. 12 (Sask. Q.B.) Sandomirsky J. states: [12] At this interim stage, rely upon need and ability to pay, largely circumscribed by the difference in the party’s respective incomes, $73,000.00 versus $29,000.00, rounded. also rely upon the principles of spousal support enunciated so carefully in the Supreme Court of Canada’s decision of Moge v. Moge, 1992 CanLII 25 (SCC), [1992] S.C.R. 813, wherein Madam Justice L’Heureux-Dubé focussed upon the economic consequences of the marriage and marriage breakdown as they impact upon each spouse. Where there is a significant disparity in the incomes of each of the former spouses in the immediate post‑separation period, and such economic disparity defines a corresponding disparity in the affordability of lifestyles of the former spouses, spousal support is the appropriate mechanism to diminish those disparities. The amount of spousal support should provide both of the former spouses with an interim standard of living which more closely relates to that of each other and to the standard of living experienced by both before their separation. This principle does not, however, demand equal household incomes as is so often misunderstood. See: Hein v. Hein, 2004 SKQB 277 (CanLII); [2004] S.J. No. 458 (QL) (Sask. Q.B.) at para. 32; See: Marcotte v. Marcotte 2008 SKQB 223 (CanLII); (2008), 315 Sask. R. 280 (Sask. Q.B.); See: Skomorowski v. Bernier, 2009 SKQB 55 (CanLII); [2009] S.J. No. 125 (QL) (Sask. Q.B.); See: Cey v. Cey, 2004 SKQB 493 (CanLII); [2004] S.J. No. 767 (QL) (Sask. Q.B.); See: Messer v. Messer (1997), 1997 CanLII 9794 (SK CA), 33 R.F.L. (4th) 426; (1997), 163 Sask. R. 101 (Sask. C.A.); (viii) at this interim stage, spousal support application does not involve property analysis per se, but does constitute an income analysis: See: Van De Sype v. Riviere, 2009 SKQB 269 (CanLII); (2009), 336 Sask. R. 284 (Sask. Q.B.); (ix) equalization of income is not the goal, but adjusting disparity between incomes, and therefore lifestyles, is to be considered: Moge v. Moge, supra. See: Frass v. Frass, supra; (x) remember Moge v. Moge, supra, wherein L’Heureux Dubé [sic] J. states that the new Divorce Act, (1985) is move away from strict needs/means analysis to broader based analysis of factors (s. 15.2(4) and objectives (s. 15.2(6) of spousal support. Further, in Bracklow v. Bracklow, 1999 CanLII 715 (SCC), [1999] S.C.R. 420 McLachlin J., as she was, concedes at para. 43 that, “need alone may be enough”. 39 Only when entitlement is established does the court proceed to the second step of the analysis being quantum and duration. An interim spousal support order is normally not compensatory and addresses imminent economic hardship in the immediate post‑separation period. [Emphasis in the original] [9] In this instance, there is no dispute that the wife is entitled to interim support. In addition, there is no dispute that there is a significant disparity in incomes and lifestyles between the spouses. Interim spousal support is an appropriate mechanism to diminish those disparities. In addition, the husband can arrange for an immediate tax adjustment from his employer which will increase his net monthly income and allow him to absorb spousal support obligation into his monthly cash flow. [10] On the other hand, the analysis must reflect an adjustment for the after tax cost of his child support payment as well as his obligation to support the minor child in his care. Child support obligations take precedence over spousal support. [11] Having considered all of these matters, I direct that the husband pay to the wife the sum of $500 per month in interim spousal support commencing on June 1, 2016 and continuing on the first of each month until further agreement or court order. This amount shall be tax deductible to the husband and taxable to the wife. Interim Distribution of Property [12] The wife asks for an interim distribution in the sum of $25,000 and, recognizing that there is no liquid funds available, proposes that the husband be ordered to take out loan to facilitate the payment. The husband opposes the application and asks that it be dismissed. [13] The court has authority to order an interim distribution pursuant to s. 26(2) of The Family Property Act, SS 1997, F-6.3. [14] Conley Conley (1985), 1985 CanLII 2599 (SK QB), 44 Sask 76, (QB) [Conley], is the leading case in Saskatchewan on such an application. The Conley factors were succinctly summarized by Ryan-Froslie J. (as she was then) in Geransky Geransky, 2012 SKQB 218 (CanLII), and have been repeatedly cited and applied, as follows: (i) Were the assets for distribution acquired during the marriage? (ii) Do the net assets for distribution far exceed the amount of the interim distribution requested? (iii) Will there be some considerable period of time before the matter can be brought to trial? (iv) Who has possession and control of the assets? (v) Can funds be made available for the purpose of an interim distribution either from cash on hand or by way of loans? (vi) Can the distribution be made without prejudicial tax implications? (vii) Can the distribution be made without serious prejudicial effect to the family assets? (viii) Does the applicant need the distribution to meet capital demands? [15] These factors do not constitute an exhaustive list with the most important consideration being whether the net assets for distribution “far exceed” the amount of the interim distribution being sought: Waldherr Waldherr (1992), 1992 CanLII 8120 (SK QB), 106 Sask 140 (QB). See also: Savoy Savoy, 2014 SKQB 293 (CanLII), 456 Sask 16; Schaffel Schaffel, 2008 SKQB 91 (CanLII), 313 Sask 203; Gray Breeze, 2011 SKQB 193 (CanLII); Shurvell Shurvell, 2012 SKQB 380 (CanLII), 406 Sask 86. [16] In this instance there is some dispute between the parties as to whether they have any beneficial interest in the house they were residing in at the date of separation (which appears to be legally owned by third party). They concede that this issue cannot be resolved on an interim motion. [17] The other assets listed in their property statements are mainly household goods and locked-in retirement funds, portion of which are subject to an exemption claim. Even if they could be accessed on an interim basis, and there is no evidence that this is the case, doing so would attract significant tax consequences. [18] This is not a situation where the net assets far exceed the amount of the distribution claimed. In addition, ultimately the distribution may have to be by way of spousal rollover from the locked-in retirement funds as there appear to be no liquid assets available to the husband. [19] For these and other reasons, an order requiring the husband to take out loan to pay an interim distribution is not justified on the evidence. The wife’s application for an interim distribution is dismissed. [20] Given the mixed success, there shall be no order as to costs. J. G.V.

McLellan and Sadie McLellan and Marian McLellan v. Tina Louise Shea and Dr. H. G. Malik Respondent Judge: The Honourable Justice F.B. William Kelly Heard: October 13, 2004, in Sydney, Nova Scotia Written Decision: December 6, 2004 Counsel: Harvey M. MacPhee, for the plaintiffs Brian W. Downie, for Dr. H.G. Malik Robert M. Purdy, Q.C. for Tina L. Shea By the Court (Orally): [1] The applicant, Mr. Kenneth McLellan, was injured in single motor vehicle accident shortly after midnight on November 26, 1998, while riding in vehicle operated by one defendant, Ms. Tina Louise Shea. The accident is substantially based on injuries he received in the accident and, more specifically, on the treatment provided to him by the other respondent, Doctor H.G. Malik, at the Cape Breton Regional Hospital in Sydney, Nova Scotia. [2] Doctor Malik now applies, pursuant to s. 34 (a)(ii) of the Judicature Act R.S.N.S. 1989, c. 240, to set aside the Jury Notice filed by the applicants. The application was heard at Sydney on October 13, 2004. The other Applicants in the action are Mr. McLellan’s wife, Sadie McLellan, and his mother, Marion McLellan, who died after the commencement of the action. Counsel for the Applicants advises that he had not been made aware of the death of Marion McLellan until the hearing of this application. He indicated he needs to further consider the effect of her death on the action before taking any steps in response to this information. do not consider this uncertainty will affect the outcome of this application such that should not proceed to decision on this time. [3] The claim against the other defendant, Ms. Shea, was dismissed by Court Order dated March 21, 2001. However, she is still party by virtue of her cross-claim against Doctor Malik and his cross-claim against her. Her counsel has advised the Court in writing he would not appear at this hearing to make submissions but that his client desires the matter to be heard by jury. [4] In Marshall v. Curry (No. 2), 1933 CanLII 346 (NS CA), [1933] D.L.R. 198 (N.S.S.C.), Chisholm C.J. concluded that “[i]f the trial requires scientific investigation, think it must be conceded that the investigation cannot conveniently be made with jury” (p. 200). This decision was subsequently affirmed (see pp. 200-201). Since that time the education and experience of the average juror has improved considerably and it has been acknowledged by our courts that some level of complex and scientific evidence could comfortably be left with the jury. In the modern era, an established authority in this province with respect to striking jury has been the decision of Hallet, J., as he then was, in Leadbetter v. Brand (1980), 37 N.S.R. (2d) 660 (T.D.), where he stated that: “the degree of complexity is the key issue in an application to strike on that ground” (para. 8; emphasis in original). He concluded that the judge hearing the matter must review the relevant facts to assess whether or not the party who served the notice should be deprived of his or her prima facie right to jury trial (at para. 8). [5] Further, in MacIntyre Nova Scotia Power Corp.(1995), 1995 CanLII 4399 (NS SC), 145 N.S.R. (2d) 209 (S.C.) Tidman J. expanded this obligation at paragraph 14: The “degree of complexity” ... relates not only to the expert evidence per se, but also encompasses the extent and type of other evidence to be offered and the complexity in relating and applying all of the evidence to the issues before the court. [6] It is not disputed that the right of party to civil jury pursuant to the Judicature Act is right of substance, not to be easily set aside by the Court. This principle is well expressed in Neelands and Neelands v. Haig (1957), 1957 CanLII 357 (ON CA), D.L.R. (2d) 165 (Ont. C.A.), at p. 167: The right of party to trial with jury is substantive one. The defendant in this case gave notice of trial by jury, and he is not lightly to be deprived of his right to have the trial proceed in that way. trial Judge has wide, and indeed one might say an absolute, discretion as to the mode of trial, but his power to decide whether case should be tried with jury or without jury is one that cannot be exercised arbitrarily or capriciously. It must be exercised in judicial manner and there must be sufficient reason to deprive party of the substantive right to trial in the manner chosen by him.... In Leadbetter, supra, Hallett J. cited the Alberta decision in Wenger v. Marien (1977), 1977 CanLII 584 (AB QB), 78 D.L.R. (3d) 201 (Alta. S.C.T.D.), where Milvain C.J.T.D. discussed the problems that can arise in medical malpractice cases. Hallett J. said, at paragraph 7: In Alberta party has right to jury trial as in Nova Scotia.... [Milvain C.J.T.D.] considered number of cases dealing with the question of scientific investigation. He came to certain “definite conclusions” which he stated as follows [at p. 205]: (1) Section 32(2) [of the Alberta Jury Act] confers discretionary power that must be exercised judicially and which should not be cabined and confined within rigid rules. (2) The situations envisaged in the subsection require wide rather than restricted interpretation. (3) jury is suitable tool for determining common sense matters but not those of more complex nature. (4) Cases involving negligence of professional people bring into play determination beyond that of the reasonably prudent man in his actions, to that of the properly trained and careful professional. (5) In general, consideration of evidence where professional negligence is in issue falls into two important aspects. One aspect is as to what all of the relevant facts are and in the second place as to what are the requirements which must be met by the professional and what departure amounts to negligence. (6) That it is certain the search for evidence in any action involving the professional conduct of doctor does involve complicated and difficult scientific investigation, both from the point of view of determining and understanding the relevant facts as to what happened and from the point of view of determining whether there has been departure from professional skill, knowledge and care. [7] would also refer to Vaninetti Victoria General Hospital and Huestis (1994), 1994 CanLII 4260 (NS SC), 135 N.S.R. (2d) 385 (S.C.), where Gruchy J. said, at para. ... am sure that (to use the words of MacDonald J. in Young et al. v. St. Rita Hospital and Critchley (1985), 68 N.S.R. (2d) 293 (T.D.), ... ...a jury's discernment of the issues will improve when the jargon of the medical experts is reduced to terminology more easily understood"". Grant, J. made much the same point in Heartz v. Halifax Infirmary and Attia (1990), 1990 CanLII 4149 (NS SC), 99 N.S.R. (2d) 317 ... when he said that, ""Much of the terminology used is of Latin or Greek derivation; however, the terms can be readily translated into lay term."" tried the latter case and my observation was that the jury appeared to experience no difficulty. had similar experience with the case of Upham v. You (1990), 1990 CanLII 4147 (NS SC), 101 N.S.R. (2d) 376.... [8] It remains fore me to review the submissions of the parties and the materials presented at the hearing, most significantly the affidavits of counsel with attached medical and actuarial evidence, to determine if this material is of such complexity and of such technical nature that it could not be fully assessed by properly informed jury. [9] In the particular context of this application, follow number of authorities in citing with approval the words of Rogers J. in Myra v. Langille (1987), 80 N.S.R. (2d) 135 at paragraphs 13 to 17: 13. Not all malpractice suits, perhaps not even the majority, involve that kind of complexity, although with technical expert testimony, that jury cannot come to grips with the evidence with which they have been presented, particularly with the help of counsel and the court directing their attention to the relevant evidence and law, and particularly if they have the necessary time to deliberate. 14. In my view, reasonably educated and informed jury is just as capable, perhaps even more so, because there are seven of them, of assessing expert medical testimony, as single judge. This is so, particularly if that evidence is presented to it, as it should be, in way that reasonably educated and informed group of lay people can understand it. No more is done when single judge hears the case. The judge is not an expert in medicine when he hears medical malpractice suit and must assess what are often conflicting medical opinions without medical expert's background. He is faced with the same difficulties jury is faced with when medical evidence is introduced. He and they must assess the evidence, the weight of it, the conflicts in it, and make findings with respect to it. 15. Complicated medical evidence is often presented in criminal jury trials, yet the trials go forward and the juries deal with the issues raised by that evidence. 16. The knowledge of no profession which deals with the public should be clothed in so much mysterious complexity that it cannot be explained in understandable terms to reasonably intelligent jury of fellow citizens. 17. In applications to strike out jury notice otherwise properly made judge must weigh the complexity of the evidence that will be adduced at trial against the longstanding, traditional and substantive right of applicant in Nova Scotia to jury trial. There must be cogent reasons to remove case from jury. [Emphasis in original.] [10] would suggest that many medical malpractice suits, almost all of which involve expert medical reports with associated records and comprehensive actuarial reports, should not be beyond the capacity of civil jury. In most cases, as here, they will be handled by competent and experienced counsel who are skilled at presenting such evidence to judge or jury. If, at trial, the judge considers the case is becoming too complex, she or he may sever part of the case or, if necessary, may refuse to leave the case to the jury. [11] Most of the facts relating to causation in this matter appear to be agreed upon or not in significant dispute. The principal dispute relates to the medical condition of Mr. McLellan in the period before his treatment by Dr. Malik, the doctor’s medical involvement with the patient and the patient’s medical condition after Dr. Malik’s treatment. ACCIDENT AND MEDICAL SUMMARY [12] will give an overview of the facts relating to causation. Mr. McLellan was injured in motor vehicle accident at approximately 12:30 a.m. on November 26, 1998 when the vehicle in which he was passenger (driven by Ms. Shea) apparently hit an ice patch and went off the road near Ingonish Beach, Nova Scotia. It was reported that he was able to “walk away with assistance” from the accident scene and he, along with Ms. Shea, was driven by passerby to residence where he spent an uncomfortable night. Around 8:05 the next morning he attended at the Buchanan Memorial Hospital, where it was reported that he walked into the emergency room and had the use of all four extremities. Because he complained of severe cervical pain and other symptoms, cervical x-ray was taken which revealed C-6 subluxation on C-7, and spinous process fracture; in effect, broken neck. The physician placed him in cervical collar and arranged transport to the Cape Breton Healthcare Complex in Sydney later that day. [13] During transport Mr. McLellan was observed to be capable of limited movement of his limbs. In Sydney he came under the care of Dr. Malik, who instituted cervical traction to reduce the spinous dislocation, process that appears to have brought the spine into reasonable alignment. Subsequently, at about 3:00 p.m. on November 26, it was reported that he had some sensations in all of his limbs, but some muscle reflex was diminished, as was pin prick perception in both hands. Dr. Malik observed the injured area at about 8:00 p.m. using an x-ray device which apparently, in this case, produced no record. He determined from this observation that he should operate, and did so the following day, November 27. understand that the purpose of the operation was to stabilize the injured site by the application of internal fixators or clamps. When Mr. McLellan was in the recovery unit after this surgery nurse noted that he was not moving his legs and Doctor Malik was called again. myelogram indicated complete blockage in the upper thoracic area, apparently indicating complete C6 quadriplegia. [14] The next day Mr. McLellan was flown to the Queen Elizabeth II Health Science Centre in Halifax, where an M.R.I. imaging sequence revealed C6/7 acute disk herniation which caused displacement of the spinal cord. Another operation resulted in the removal of the clamps inserted by Dr. Malik. Other procedures were performed, including internal fixation by lens plate and screws. Despite this intervention, Mr. McLellan was discharged many weeks later from the Q. E. II Rehabilitation Centre with the same diagnosis as the admission diagnosis: “traumatic C6-7 facet dislocation (C6 fracture) with C6 quadriplegia.” CONSIDERATION [15] The burden of proof in an application to strike jury is on the applicant to show that there are cogent reasons to do so: Atkinson v. Flynn et al. (1998), 1998 CanLII 6303 (NS CA), 170 N.S.R. (2d) 385 (C.A.) at para. 5. Counsel for the applicant submits that the action will involve complex medical questions and notes that the medical charts exceed 1,500 pages, but it appears that the more relevant hospital records are less than 100 pages. Volume is relevant in assessing complexity but, as Grant J. said in Corkum v. Sawatsky et al. (1992), 1992 CanLII 4653 (NS SC), 113 N.S.R. (2d) 406 (S.C.T.D.) at paragraph 34: “The volume of the material in itself is not the determining factor. Here, however, much of it is contradictory and all of it is complex.” Grant J. concluded that the expert evidence was of such complexity that it should be assessed by judge and not jury. He considered splitting the two elements of the trial between the judge and the jury, noting that there may be circumstances where it would be equitable to split, but said he had “not been asked to do so” (para. 37). [16] In Corkum, supra, damages included ten disputed appraisals of property along with several reviews of these appraisals, one by consulting economist, all lengthy. This expert evidence was in addition to the assessment of damages to an applicant totally disabled from employment as well as the usual medical evidence. In these somewhat unusual circumstances Grant J. struck the jury in part because he was not the trial judge. As in the present proceeding, the trial judge was not yet appointed. Grant J. commented that the trial judge should normally deal with an application to strike (para. 35). [17] Counsel in the present matter agree that the length of the trial will be approximately three weeks. They appear to agree that the essence of the liability issue will be limited in time (since the medical interventions occurred within two to three days), in the most relevant anatomical area (the thoracic vertebrae region of the spinal column) and in the number of medical personnel involved in the relevant interventions. [18] The medical experts will mainly focus on the interventions of physicians and neurosurgeons at the medical centres at Neil’s Harbour, Sydney and Halifax. The principal subject matter will be the interventions of Doctor Malik and of the personnel at the Q.E.II Health Sciences Centre, particularly the neurological surgeon, Doctor R.O. Holness. [19] Counsel for the respondent proposed that the causation issue could be set out as follows (I paraphrase): was Mr. McLellan’s dramatic result caused by or contributed to by Doctor Malik’s operation to insert pressure clamps in the presence of an undetected disk hernia? The respondent’s expert reported in an opinion letter that he believed the spinal cord injury was exacerbated during the surgery, resulting in quadriplegia. The medical report of the defendant’s expert (dated June 14, 2004) indicated that he believed “there were three major contributing factors that combine to precipitate it. 1. congenitally narrow spinal canal. 2. C6/7 herniation and, 3. Insertion of the clamp fixating devices.” presume his reference to the fixating devices are those inserted by Doctor Malik. [20] understand that the position of the respondent/applicant is that Doctor Malik, when presented with the x-ray evidence of C6 dislocation on the C7 and the C6 spinous process fracture, should have used further radiological investigation to determine if there was disk herniation or other impingement into the spinal canal. The submission is that he should have used more appropriate imaging device before operating or, failing access to such device, transport Mr. McLellan to Halifax where such imaging devices were available. [21] The position of the applicant/defendant is that, because Mr. McLellan presented with very unstable dislocation and was at high risk for neurological injury, it would have been dangerous to transport him to Halifax in that condition, and that his medical intervention demonstrated an acceptable standard of care given the imaging resources available to him. [22] In my opinion much of the factual material relating to these issues is not substantially contested, but the opinions of the opposing medical experts will be a major area of contention at trial. [23] It is my opinion these issues are no more complex than most causation issues presented in medical malpractice cases. The three opinion letters provided by the respective medical experts consists of total of nine pages and appear to agree on most of the facts upon which their contradictory opinions rely. am satisfied that jury will be capable of dealing with the medical evidence. [24] The other major matter to be considered in this application is the potential evidence relating to damages. The applicant/defendant submits that this evidence will be so technical and complex that, combined with the evidence relating to causation, it will be of such complexity and volume that it should be taken from the jury. Mr. McLellan has advanced substantial claim, including pain and suffering, past and future cost of care, loss of income and amenities and interest on those claims, as well as costs. [25] substantial part of these claims will be based on the report of Linda Stanley, M.S.W., R.S.W., consultant in rehabilitation and cost of future care. This is 17-page report, including 15 pages of analysis of Mr. McLellan’s pre-injury personal profile (including his medical history), summary of the accident, diagnosis and treatment as well as post-injury complications. It also gives the reporter’s assessment of his present functional abilities and his present daily living activities. Finally the report deals with his current management and care, including medications. Each category concludes with her recommendation of methods to assist him in coping with his limitations in the future. Attached to the report is breakdown and explanation of cost projections and summary of the costs of these recommendations, extending to ten pages. further five-page appendix deals with information about spinal cord injury, which assume is the technical medical information that the reporter used for reference. [26] In my opinion, none of this material appears to be unusually complex. It is the usual type of analysis expected with most claims, particularly those involving significantly disabling injuries. [27] do not doubt counsel for Doctor Malik when he claims that many of the reporter’s assumptions will be challenged. The applicant’s expert reports differ somewhat in their conclusions, but this is not unexpected, as Mr. McLellan’s income was not regular, consistent one. They agree, however, that the source of his income was fishing, employment insurance benefits and the operation of camp ground, as well as whale-watching tour operation. In any event one could also expect that the assumptions of report by Brian A. Burnell of Burnell Actuarial Consulting Inc. would be challenged in the same way. The report provides an opinion of the value of Mr. McLellan’s past and future losses. As have stated above, reports such as these are not unusual nor unexpected in such cases and are helpful to the trier of fact in considering variations from the amounts claimed, after hearing directions by the trial judge as to relevant evidence and law and after receiving argument by counsel. have reviewed these reports in detail. [28] Counsel for Dr. Malik advises that an expert report from an economist will be presented at trial in support of his client’s position. This will add to the complexity but have no basis to determine that this report will add substantially to the complexity of the evidence. [29] After considering the issues involved in this case and the nature of the medical and actuarial evidence that will likely be adduced, am satisfied that jury would be capable of understanding the issues. I conclude that the evidence will not be so complex and scientific that the applicant’s substantive right to a trial by jury should be denied. To do justice to all of the parties, including those other than Mr. McLellan and Dr. Malik, find that there are not sufficiently cogent reasons to set aside the jury in this case. [30] Consequently, the application of the defendant, Dr. Malik, to set aside the jury notice is dismissed with costs of $2,500 and disbursements relating directly to the application.",b_2004nssc255.txt,"The defendant doctor in a personal injury case applied to set aside the Jury Notice filed by the plaintiff.
Application dismissed;
the evidence would not be so complex and scientific that the plaintiff's substantive right to a jury trial should be denied.
Although the medical charts exceeded 1500 pages, the more relevant hospital records were less than 100 pages; the essence of the liability issue would be limited in time, in the most relevant anatomical area and in the number of medical personnel involved in the relevant interventions; the factual material did not appear to be in dispute; and the issues were no more complex than most causation issues presented in medical malpractice cases."

Mr. Steve Kritzer For the Crown Mr. Adrian McBride For the Defence Note: An Order pursuant to s. 486.4 of the Criminal Code of Canada has been made directing that any information that could identify the complainant or witness shall not be published in any document or broadcast or transmitted in any way in respect of the proceeding. JUDGMENT L.A. MATSALLA, [1] The accused, F.D.J.T., is more commonly known as J.T. and will refer to him as such. [2] Mr. J.T. is charged that he did, on March 1st of this year: 1. commit sexual assault on K.S. contrary to section 271(1) of the Criminal Code, and 2. for sexual purpose touch K.S., person under the age of 16, directly with part of his body, to wit his penis, contrary to section 151 of the Criminal Code. The Crown elected to proceed by way of indictment on both charges and the accused elected trial by this Court. [3] It is important to place the facts in this case in context. [4] Both parties are aboriginal persons who live on the N[...] First Nation in the Maple Creek district of this Province. The accused and the complainant are well acquainted with one another in fact their mothers are cousins. The accused lives with his grandmother in trailer and K.S., along with her father and her young cousin, live in her grandmother’s house. She has twin sister and another sister who lives in trailer near the house. At the time of the alleged offences, yet another sister (who shall refer to as C.Y.S.) was in relationship with the accused and they had two-year-old daughter. It was not made clear as to where C.Y.S. was residing at the time of the alleged offence. It should also be noted that the evidence disclosed that there appeared to be some animosity between K.S.’s family and the family of J.T. arising out of the issue of access to the two-year-old child and, in particular, there was dispute as to who should be entitled to the Child Tax Benefit for the child. The complainant told the Court that she did not get along well with J.T. before the incident and in cross examination, she more specifically said that she did not like him because of the way that he had treated, C.Y.S. It appears that she was aware that he had had other liaisons with other women while he was in the relationship. Nonetheless she told the Court that since the incident she no longer feels the same way about him. The Evidence of the Crown [5] policeman testified that on June 4, while J.T. was in custody, he obtained statement from him. The Crown’s main witness was K.S. It is common ground that she was 15 years of age on the date of the alleged incident and that she was 16 at the time of trial. [6] Ms. S. testified that on February 28, 2013, she had returned home from school, picked up her laundry and, with her grandmother, made her way to Maple Creek and then to the residence of “Jillian” (whose last name was not made clear to the Court). At about 5:00 p.m. J.T. was dropped off outside the residence and K.S. testified that she could tell he had been drinking. She said that she stayed away from him when he drinks. K.S. went to the laundromat with her grandmother and, after completing the laundry, they met K.S.’s father and then returned to the residence on the N[...]. Later K.S. went into town with others to pick up J.T. and C.Y.S. from jigging class. take the class to be cultural dance class. She went on to say that J.T. and C.Y.S. were “hammered” when they were picked up. [7] Upon returning to the residence, she watched television. Then, at about 9:00 p.m. she went to C.A.S.’s trailer where she met J.T. and her two older sisters. She had mickey of vodka in her purse. She recalled that she sat between her sisters and they drank the vodka out of her bottle and from another similar bottle. She told the Court that she had had only little bit and she felt sober when, after midnight, she made her way back to the house however, in cross examinations she said that she was “hammered” when she left the trailer. She tripped and fell and recalled that some dogs came to her and jumped upon her. Once in her bedroom she changed into her pajamas. She recalled that she was wearing undergarments each of specific brand. She turned off the light, turned on fan and went to bed. [8] She believed that she later heard J.T. and C.Y.S. walk into the living room of the house and they were arguing. Evidently she did not want to hear them arguing because she turned up the speed of the fan and went back to bed. [9] She told the Court that the accused came into her bedroom about 20 minutes to one and half hour later and called her by her nickname (“Freida”), and he asked her if she was still up. She responded affirmatively and asked him why he wanted to know. J.T. said that he loved her (which take to be C.Y.S.) and that he didn’t “like it when we fight”. K.S. did not participate in the conversation. She said that she listened to him for couple of minutes and then she decided not to listen. J.T. crawled on top of her, tried to take her pajama bottoms down while she said “no, no”. At this point in her testimony, she requested that C.Y.S. be removed from the courtroom because, she explained, her crying “made it harder for me”. By agreement C.Y.S. briefly left the room only to return. She then went on to tell the Court that he removed her pajamas as she said “no, no, don’t”. She had placed her hands on her stomach but he pushed them away in the process causing one hand to hit wall and the other the frame of the bed. She said that he pushed the bottom of her pajamas down to her ankles, dropped his pants similarly, undid his belt and “shoved his penis into me” as he held her hands down. She clarified her testimony by saying that he “put it into my vagina”. She said that she was too weak to resist and too scared to scream but she did tell him “no [J], no [J], stop”. She had her face in pillow but he grabbed her face and made her “tongue kiss” him. She remembered smelling alcohol on his breath. In her words, he “raped me”. She testified that during this time she hoped that her mother would save her. He then got up, pulled up his pants and left the room. She put on her night clothes, turned on the light to see if he had left the room and then she used room freshener spray “to make the room smell cleaner” because she “felt so ugly”. She then said that she forced herself to sleep. She told the Court that, prior to the incident, she had not experienced sexual intercourse. [10] She said that the next day she had trouble getting up because she was hung over and she was sore howver she was able to go to school in the afternoon. She told the Court that she felt little effect from the alcohol that she had consumed. Five days later she tried to call her cousin to speak to her about the incident but she could not get the words out. She also was about to tell teacher at school but the teacher was busy with other students. She expressed her feelings in her journal but then burnt the pages after she gave statement to the police about the incident. The pertinent pages were tendered in Court by the defence during cross examination. Subsequently K.S. took pregnancy test that proved to be negative and, since she was concerned about getting sexually transmitted disease, she underwent HIV/AIDS tests that also proved to be negative. [11] As one might expect, K.S. faced many questions from defence counsel including questions relating to statement that she made to the police and to the statements that she made in her journal. [12] Counsel pointed out that she did not tell the officer about number of events including the suicide of friend or relative that had taken place during the same period of time and she had not advised the officer that J.T. had been picked up at jigging class. She had told the Court that J.T. had removed his pants but in the statement she told the officer that she did not see him get undressed. In Court she said that J.T. pulled the blanket away from her but in her statement she told the officer that she did not know if he removed the blankets from her. In Court she said that J.T. tried to kiss her but she did not tell the officer about the incident. [13] In her journal she admitted that she wrote that she thought that J. raped her the night before and, after describing the incident in her bedroom in some detail, she went on to say that she did not know if it had all been dream or real life yet she goes on in her journal to write that she intended to get pregnancy test. In an entry dated March 3, she wrote that she had discussed the incident with her twin sister although, in cross examination, she testified that when her sister questioned her about the incident, she denied it. [14] Overall, she was not comfortable in cross examination. At one point she was reluctant to answer some questions. The Evidence of the Defence [15] The only witness called by the defence was the accused. He was 22 years of age at the time of the alleged offence. [16] He told the Court that on February 28, he was caring for his daughter at his grandmother’s residence on the N[...]. At about noon, he left the residence with his grandmother to go to Maple Creek and he then went to cousin’s residence where he and four others drank 24 beer between 3:00 and 5:00 p.m. He himself drank five beer. At about 5:00 p.m. he left the residence to try and find more beverage alcohol and when he returned he discovered that the others had obtained more beer which was then consumed. He said that he drank about eight more beer. At about 10:00 or 11:00 p.m. he returned to his grandmother’s residence and he went to his bedroom in the basement where he sat in chair and watched television. He then advised the Court that earlier that evening between 5:00 or 6:00 p.m. he went to the nearby trailer where he was drinking with K.S.’s sisters. K.S. arrived at the trailer at about 8:00 p.m. with some alcohol. Prior to her arrival he drank one half of mickey bottle and after K.S. arrived he had couple of sips from her mickey bottle. [17] He said that K.S. left the trailer at about 9:00 or 10:00, however he continued to drink vodka and beer and he smoked cannabis joint before leaving with C.Y.S. at about 11:00. During the time that he was at the trailer he and C.Y.S. had argued about the baby and she had become sick. He went downstairs with C.Y.S. until about 12:00 midnight or 12:30 when, as result of an argument, she went upstairs. She later brought J.T. something to eat. [18] He testified that he did not leave the basement until the following day. He did not go to K.S.’s room and he did not touch her inappropriately or have intimate relations with her. He did say that he saw her the following day either before or after she had gone to school. [19] According to him there was no animosity between the two of them that night, however, he recalled that K.S. had told him on prior occasion that she did not like the way in which he had treated C.Y.S. [20] In cross examination, he admitted that on July 27, 2006, he had been convicted, as youth, of three counts of failing to comply with disposition and two counts of failing to comply with an Undertaking. He admitted that on July 26, 2008, he had been convicted of two counts of failing to appear in Court. He admitted that he had provided statement to the police about the incident during the morning of June 4, but that he was drunk at the time. He recalled being arrested on June 2, being in Court on June 3, and then giving the statement the next day. The defence admitted that he had been in custody for 51 hours prior to giving the statement and that the statement was provided to the police voluntarily. He admitted that he was released from custody on the present charges subject to an electronic monitor and that his cousin cut off the monitor which resulted in his arrest. He has been in custody since that time. [21] He neglected to mention to the officer that he had watched T.V. in the basement. He admitted that he had flirted with C.A.S. at the trailer that night. At one point, he said that he could remember the whole evening but he said that he could not recall parts of the argument with C.Y.S. He recalled telling the police officer that he may have committed the alleged offence and that he did not know if he “did it” or not. He then said that he thought that he did not commit the offences because others said he did not go upstairs from the basement. There was no evidence provided to the Court as to the presence of any other persons (other than C.Y.S.) in the basement or at the house. No other persons testified for the defence. [22] At the end of his testimony, he told the Court that on the night of the alleged incident he had spent the night at his grandmother’s trailer. He identified that night as the night of February 28. He told the Court that on March 1, he had gone to Maple Creek where he drank with his cousin. The dates provided by the accused are not consistent with the other evidence provided at trial nor are they consistent with his earlier testimony in Court. [23] The accused is charged under the following provisions of the Criminal Code: 271. (1) Every one who commits sexual assault is guilty of (a) an indictable offence and is liable to imprisonment for term not exceeding 10 years and, if the complainant is under the age of 16 years, to minimum punishment of imprisonment for term of one year and, 151. Every person who, for sexual purpose, touches, directly or indirectly, with part of the body or with an object, any part of the body of person under the age of 16 years; (a) is guilty of an indictable offence and liable to imprisonment for term not exceeding 10 years and to minimum punishment of imprisonment for term of one year. [24] The matter of consent is not live issue in this case and so consideration of section 150.1 is not necessary, however the credibility of the witnesses is the most significant issue and therefore an application of the instructions in R. v. W.D.[1] must be undertaken. This Court is the trier of fact and law so am obliged to decide the facts in this case by applying the same principles that jury would be required to apply. In W.D. the complainant testified and she told the Court about two sexual assaults that she said were committed by the accused. The defence tendered the evidence of the accused who denied that the incident had occurred. The case is similar to the case before me. [25] At paragraph 27 and 28, Mr. Justice Cory said this respecting the burden of proof on the Crown on the issue of credibility: In case where credibility is important the trial judge must instruct the jury that the rule of reasonable doubt applies to that issue. The trial judge should instruct the jury that they need not firmly believe or disbelieve any witness or set of witnesses. Specifically, the trial judge is required to instruct the jury that they must acquit the accused in two situations. First, if they believe the accused. Secondly, if they do not believe the accused’s evidence but still have reasonable doubt as to his guilt after considering the accused’s evidence in the context of the evidence as whole: see R. v. Challice (1979), 1979 CanLII 2969 (ON CA), 45 C.C.C. (2d) 546 (Ont. C.A.); approved in R. v. Morin, supra, at p. 357. Ideally, appropriate instructions on the issue of credibility should be given, not only during the main charge, but on any recharge. trial judge might well instruct the jury on the question of credibility along these lines: First, if you believe the evidence of the accused, obviously you must acquit. Secondly, if you do not believe the testimony of the accused but you are left in reasonable doubt by it, you must acquit. Thirdly, even if you are not left in doubt by the evidence of the accused, you must ask yourself whether, on the basis of the evidence which you do accept, you are convinced beyond reasonable doubt by that evidence of the guilt of the accused. If that formula were followed, the oft repeated error which appears in the recharge in this case would be avoided. The requirement that the Crown prove the guilt of the accused beyond reasonable doubt is fundamental in our system of criminal law. Every effort should be made to avoid mistakes in charging the jury on this basic principle. Since the matter of credibility is frequently an issue in court, the instructions set out by the Supreme Court have been discussed in many cases. [26] significant effort has been made to determine with greater precision how the instructions are to be considered. It is clear that the trier of fact must apply the standard of proof beyond reasonable doubt to all of the evidence and it is inappropriate to do so in respect of the defence evidence without consideration of the Crown’s evidence. The instructions ought not to be applied to individual pieces of evidence but to all of the conflicting evidence and must be applied only to the elements of the offences charged by the Crown and the elements of the defences raised by the accused[2]. [27] jury may have the impression that even if the accused’s testimony is disbelieved it can raise reasonable doubt. In the case of R. v. S.(J.H.), Mr. Justice Binnie, in an effort to elaborate on the second instruction mentioned above, pointed out that additional instructions could be added[3]. He referred favorably to the dictim of Wood J.A. in R. v. H.(C.W.)[4] where the Court said: would add one more instruction in such cases, which logically ought to be second in the order, namely: “If, after careful consideration of all the evidence, you are unable to decide whom to believe, you must acquit”. When the evidence is examined in light of the direction, jury ought not to think of the case as contest between two sides thereby reducing the burden on the Crown and imposing burden on the accused. Rather, the fact finder may totally accept or totally reject the evidence or may conclude that the evidence falls in between the two positions[5]. It is entirely possible for the jury to disbelieve the evidence of the accused yet, in light of all of the evidence, conclude that they have reasonable doubt. The case was recently referred to by Ottenbreit J.A. in R. v. B.G.S. 2010 SKCA 24 (CanLII), [2010] S.J. No. 106 at paragraph when citing passage from the Court’s decision in R. v. McKenzie (P.N.)[6]. The Evidence of Child [28] It should be noted that the Supreme Court of Canada has spoken on the way in which court should deal with the evidence of children. [29] In the case of R. v. B.(G)[7], three young children were charged with sexually assaulting another student who was seven years of age at the time. At trial, the eight-year-old complainant testified about an incident that had occurred when she was seven years old and in grade one. The trial judge concluded that if the incident had occurred during the time suggested then it would have happened year earlier than alleged. While the case turned on whether the date of the offence was an essential element and whether an amendment should have been allowed, the Court, at paragraph 48, referred favorably to the dictum of Wakeling J.A. from the Court below who said: While children may not be able to recount precise details and communicate the when and where of an event with exactitude, this does not mean that they have misconceived what happened to them and who did it. In recent years we have adopted much more benign attitude to children’s evidence, lessening the strict standards of oath taking and corroboration, and believe that this is desirable development. The credibility of every witness who testifies before the courts must, of course, be carefully assessed but the standard of the “reasonable adult” is not necessarily appropriate in assessing the credibility of young children. [30] The case was referred to in R. v. W.(R.)[8]- case in which the accused was charged with indecent assault, gross indecency and sexual assault against three girls one of whom was between two and four years old, another between nine and ten and the older girl who was ten at the time of the incident. They were 9, 12 and 16 years of age at the time of trial. The evidence of the oldest girl was uncontradicted except for the accused’s denial that anything untoward had occurred. The convictions were upheld and at paragraph 23, Madam Justice McLachlin said the following: The repeal of provisions creating legal requirement that children’s evidence be corroborated does not prevent the judge or jury from treating child’s evidence with caution where such caution is merited in the circumstances of the case. But it does revoke the assumption formerly applied to all evidence of children, often unjustly, that children’s evidence is always less reliable than the evidence of adults. So if court proceeds to discount child’s evidence automatically, without regard to the circumstances of the particular case, it will have fallen into an error. She pointed out that it may be wrong to apply adult tests for credibility to the evidence of children. She went on to say at paragraph 25: As Wilson J. emphasized in B. (G.), these changes in the way the courts look at the evidence of children do not mean that the evidence of children should not be subject to the same standard of proof as the evidence of adult witnesses in criminal cases. Protecting the liberty of the accused and guarding against the injustice of the conviction of an innocent person require solid foundation for verdict of guilt, whether the complainant be an adult or child. What the changes do mean is that we approach the evidence of children not from the perspective of rigid stereotypes, but on what Wilson J. called “common sense” basis, taking into account the strengths and weaknesses which characterize the evidence offered in the particular case. Therefore, it cannot be assumed that the evidence of child is necessarily unreliable nor is it acceptable to measure the evidence of youth to that of an adult. Yet, just as the evidence of an adult must be carefully scrutinized so too must the evidence of young person. [31] There is evidence that, in general, there were bad feelings between the respective families and there is evidence that the complainant did not like the accused however, there was no evidence of any specific instances of ill-will between them and, in fact, they had been in contact with one another earlier in the day without incident and they visited and drank together that evening. Furthermore, each told the Court that he and she did not have any difficulties with the other on that day. In any event, even if people may dislike one another that, in itself, is not sufficient reason to disbelieve their evidence. While there is evidence that the complainant and the accused neglected to mention certain facts to the officer who took statement from each of them, neither person was specifically asked about the facts referred to and so find no reason to question the veracity of their evidence on that account. further examination of all the evidence is necessary. [32] It is of more significance that K.S., when describing what had occurred in her bedroom, told the Court that the accused had pulled the blanket away and that he removed his pants when she had earlier told the officer that she did not know if the blanket was removed and that she did not see him remove his pants. However, it is entirely likely that 15 year old would not consider those parts of the narrative as important given her focus at the time that she spoke to the officer and when she testified in Court. [33] It is curious that in the journal in which she kept her private thoughts, she would write that she thought that she had been raped or that she did not know if it was all dream however, her comments must be examined in the context of the rest of her journal entries, in which her emotions appear to range from anger at the accused to uncertainty about whether she was pregnant and how to deal with possible pregnancy. Given her age, her lack of experience in sexual matters and her explanation in Court that she could not believe that the incident had occurred, her comment is not entirely surprising. [34] At trial she was uncomfortable about answering some questions from defence counsel and she was reluctant to testify as to the details of the incident in the presence of her sister J.T.’s companion. It seems to me that her reaction was to be expected. It is not unusual for any person (especially sixteen-year-old girl) to be reluctant to testify in front of family, friends and the public generally about an incident that was clearly traumatic to her. Nor did it surprise me to see that she was upset when describing details of the incident in courtroom setting. [35] She had not consumed alcohol until she drank vodka in the trailer that evening but her recollection of what happened was detailed and her evidence was not shaken in cross examination. She shared the vodka with three other persons yet her description of her condition ranged from being sober when leaving the trailer to being “hammered”. In the circumstances, think that it is unlikely that she was heavily under the influence of alcohol when she returned to the house. J.T., however, was clearly under the influence of alcohol throughout the afternoon and evening. He testified with some considerable detail as to the times that certain events occurred yet he was confused as to the day in question. When speaking to the officer he was uncertain as to whether he had committed an offence relying instead upon what other persons may have seen him do. Peculiar evidence for someone who claimed in Court that he recalled the events of the entire day and who insisted that he did not commit the offences. He was clearly wrong when he told the Court that he was intoxicated when he gave his statement to the police on June 4, since he had been in custody for 51 hours prior to giving the statement. [36] After examining all of the evidence and viewing the demeanor of the complainant and the accused on the stand, conclude that cannot believe J.T.’s evidence when he told the Court that he remained in the basement of the house for most of the night in question, that he did not go to K.S.’s bedroom and that he did not have contact with her. I believe the testimony of K.S. as to what transpired in her bedroom during the early hours of March 1. Any inconsistencies in her evidence are not significant. Her evidence on material points was clear and consistent. do not believe that she was motivated by revenge against J.T. when giving her evidence and do not accept any suggestion that her testimony was given with the intention of falsely accusing J.T. of committing the offences in question. [37] The Crown seeks finding on each of the charges before the Court. The Crown has proven beyond a reasonable doubt that J.T. forced himself upon K.S. and committed a sexual assault upon her at a time when she was under the age of 16 years contrary to section 271(1) of the Code. The evidence similarly proves that J.T. touched K.S. for the purpose of having sexual intercourse with her contrary to section 151 of the Code. [38] We will now proceed to conclude the case. L.A.

794,"MAY 5, 2016INTRODUCTION [1] A mystery has occurred on this file.
The transcript from the small claims trial was not filed within the six month period set forth in ss.
39(5) of The Small Claims Act, 1997, SS 1997, c S-50.11 [Act].
Why the transcript was not filed is unknown.
What is known is the failure did not occur through the fault of the appellant.
[2] Because of this non-filing, the respondent argues the appeal must be dismissed based on ss.
39(5) of the Act.
The appellant, however, says it did nothing wrong here and it would be an affront to the administration of justice to simply determine the appeal to be dismissed.
BACKGROUND [3] A small claims trial was conducted before Judge Kovatch.
A decision was rendered on April 30, 2015 and certified a judgment on May 28, 2015.
Accompanying that notice of appeal was a copy of the request for transcript which the solicitor for the appellant had forwarded to the Provincial Court of Saskatchewan.
Presumably the reference to tapes means the recording of the trial proceedings in whatever form they exist.
That letter is not copied to either the appellant or the respondent.
There is no indication the appellant or the respondent received a copy of this correspondence.","HELD: The applicant’s first two grounds of appeal related to the evidence of the respondents’ and police.
The Court of Appeal was not persuaded that questions of evidence were of sufficient importance to grant leave.
The applicant’s third ground was that the Chambers judge failed to take into account the interests of the public, particularly, the need to deter the public and the need to remove profit from crime to compensate victims.
The Court of Appeal did not grant leave on the third ground.
The Chambers judge reviewed the relevant case law and did not fail to take those items into account.
The last ground of appeal was the fact that the vehicle had already been held for 90 days.
The Court of Appeal said that this ground did raise some interest but they were not convinced that this was the case to grant the leave to appeal.","[2, 6, 1, 3, 5, 4, 7, 8, 9, 10, 18, 19, 15, 12]",66,"THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR SASKATCHEWAN Citation: 2013 SKCA 113 Date: 2013-10-29 Between: Docket: CACV2471 The Director under The Seizure of Criminal Property Act, 2009 Prospective Appellant (Applicant) and Aaron Tropeau, Cheryl Brinkman and the Chief of Police of the Saskatoon Police Service Prospective Respondents (Respondents) Before: Richards C.J.S. (in Chambers) Counsel: Tammy Pryznyk for the prospective appellant Aaron Tropeau and Cheryl Brinkman appearing on their own behalf Application: From: 2013 SKQB 361 (CanLII) Heard: October 24, 2013 Disposition: Application dismissed Written Reasons: October 29, 2013 By: The Honourable Chief Justice Richards Richards C.J.S. I. introduction [1] The Director under The Seizure of Criminal Property Act, 2009, S.S. 2009, c. S-46.002 (the “Act”) seeks leave to appeal Queen’s Bench Chambers decision which denied his application for the forfeiture of vehicle registered to the respondent Cheryl Brinkman. The Director’s application was brought pursuant to s. of the Act on the ground that the vehicle had been used in criminal activity. [2] Ms. Brinkman and the respondent Aaron Tropeau are common-law spouses. [3] The vehicle in question (the “Vehicle”) is 2010 Ford Transit Cargo Van. Ms. Brinkman purchased it in 2010, with money received from her father’s estate. Beginning in January of 2012, she and Mr. Tropeau used it to haul items on an on-call basis. The business averaged $3,000 in profit every month. [4] In March of 2012, Mr. Tropeau was seen removing copper material from the back of truck. As witness approached the scene, Ms. Brinkman (who was sitting in the Vehicle) called out warning to Mr. Tropeau. [5] second incident occurred on March 29, 2012. Mr. Tropeau was found in the back of parked truck with rolls of copper in his arms. Ms. Brinkman was also at the scene. When the driver threatened to call the police, Ms. Brinkman and Mr. Tropeau returned to the Vehicle and fled. [6] third incident took place in January of 2013. Mr. Tropeau was seen operating the Vehicle near fenced compound. He entered the compound through hole in the fence and returned to the Vehicle with two pails full of copper wire. [7] Mr. Tropeau pled guilty to three counts of theft under $5,000 and one count of break and enter. He was sentenced to 12 months of probation and 80 hours of community service. Ms. Brinkman was charged with two counts of theft under $5,000. Both charges were ultimately withdrawn but Ms. Brinkman does not deny her involvement in the events of March 21 and March 29, 2012. [8] Ms. Brinkman is 58 years of age. She suffers from chronic depression and has been diagnosed as “borderline bipolar.” She has been receiving ongoing psychiatric care. She was also diagnosed with brain aneurysm in March of 2010. The resulting surgery has left her with both physical and mental limitations. More recently, Ms. Brinkman advises that cancer problem, formerly in remission, has returned. [9] Mr. Tropeau is 51 years of age. He also has medical problems. He was admitted to hospital in February of 2013 with necrotizing fasciitis. This has affected his leg strength and left him, he believes, largely unemployable. Nonetheless, he contends that he will be able to operate the haulage business so long as he takes some care. [10] Ms. Brinkman and Mr. Tropeau indicate that they are dependent on the Vehicle to earn their living. They say it is their only asset of any value and that, without it, they will be forced to live on social assistance. III. the decision of the chambers judge [11] The Director brought an application for the forfeiture of the Vehicle pursuant to s. 3(1) of the Act. Section 3(1) reads as follows: 3(1) The director may apply to the court for forfeiture order if the director is satisfied that property is proceeds of unlawful activity or an instrument of unlawful activity. [12] There was no real contest about whether the vehicle was used as “an instrument of unlawful activity” within the meaning of s. 3(1). As result, the key issue before the Chambers judge was whether it clearly would not be “in the interests of justice” to make forfeiture order. In this regard, s. 7(1) of the Act says this: 7(1) Subject to section 8, and unless it clearly would not be in the interests of justice, the court shall make an order forfeiting property to the Crown if the court finds that the property is proceeds of unlawful activity or an instrument of unlawful activity. [emphasis added] [13] The Chambers judge canvassed the relevant authorities, including this Court’s recent decision in Saskatchewan (Director, Seizure of Criminal Property Act, 2009) v. Mihalyko, 2012 SKCA 44 (CanLII), 348 D.L.R. (4th) 756. He then examined the particulars of the situation before him, noting that the Vehicle had been used in several criminal acts and that the acts in question were planned and deliberate. The Chambers judge also noted that the Vehicle was worth considerably more than the amount of copper involved in the attempted thefts and that the loss of the vehicle would have drastic consequences for Ms. Brinkman and Mr. Tropeau as it is what stands between them and life on the welfare rolls. The judge further observed that, as of the date of his decision, Ms. Brinkman and Mr. Tropeau had already been without the Vehicle for some nine months because it had been held by the Director pending the outcome of his application. [14] In the end, the Chambers judge decided not to order the forfeiture of the Vehicle. He wrote as follows: [33] In all the circumstances of this exceptional case, exercise my limited discretion to refuse forfeiture of the vehicle. In coming to this difficult decision, fully accept, and agree with, the proposition that exception from forfeiture under s. is to be ordered sparingly and only in rare cases. After giving this application considerable thought, have decided this is such case. Very little public interest would be served by forcing these middle aged and ailing respondents to forfeit their vehicle, and with it their livelihood, as consequence of three ineptly carried out efforts to steal copper material. To do so, in my opinion, would narrowly cross the threshold of being draconian and manifestly unjust. IV. analysis [15] The test for granting leave to appeal is well known. It involves consideration of both the merits and the importance of the proposed appeal. See: Rothmans, Benson Hedges Inc. v. Saskatchewan, 2002 SKCA 119 (CanLII), 227 Sask. R. 121. [16] In this case, the Director submits that the Chambers judge made four errors of consequence in coming to his decision. He says the judge erred by:(a) considering certain information about the circumstances of Ms. Brinkman and Mr. Tropeau even though that information had been submitted by those two individuals as part of their arguments rather than formally by way of affidavit;(b) characterizing the evidence of Sgt. Pfeil as having been made on information and belief;(c) failing to give primacy to the interests of the public and, in particular, failing to consider the need to deter crime, the need to remove the profit from crime and the need to compensate victims; and(d) taking into account the fact that the vehicle had been been held by the Director for 90 days. [17] With respect to issues (a) and (b), I am not persuaded that, in the context of this case, questions of evidence are of sufficient importance to engage the attention of the Court. [18] With respect to issue (c), I am not at all sure that the Chambers judge overlooked the interests of the public or failed to consider the need to deter crime, undercut the profitability of crime and so forth. He conducted a relatively thorough review of the relevant case law in the course of establishing the framework governing his decision-making. This included Saskatchewan (Director, Seizure of Criminal Property Act, 2009) v. Mihalyko, supra. Paragraph of his decision would suggest that the judge did consider matters relating to the deterrence of crime. The Chambers judge was also at pains to underline the exceptional nature of his power to deny forfeiture application. [19] With respect to issue (d), the Director has raised a point of some interest but I am not convinced that it needs to be explored at this time and in the context of this particular case. doubt that the Chambers judge’s decision on this issue will have an especially important precedential impact given that he emphasized s. of the Act is to be engaged “sparingly and only in rare cases” and given his characterization of the facts before him as “exceptional.” [20] Taking into account both the merits and the importance of the Director’s proposed appeal, I am not persuaded by his arguments about granting leave to appeal. V. conclusion [21] In the end, this is not a case where, in my view, leave to appeal should be granted. The Director’s application is dismissed. The Vehicle shall be returned to its owner, Ms. Brinkman.

JANUARY 24, 2018 THE APPLICATION [1] The applicant/petitioner, Jeffery Reid, filed second Application for Variation with the court September 29, 2017, seeking to vary Consent Interim Order issued by Zarzeczny J. August 7, 2007 [Order]. THE INTERIM CONSENT ORDER [2] The provisions of the Order addressed Mr. Reid’s child and spousal support obligations. It was based upon the petitioner’s then income of $48,196 and the respondent’s income of $0. Paragraph 2(b) of the Order provided that Mr. Reid: …shall pay to the Respondent for child support and s. expenses the sum of $150 per month commencing August 1, 2007 and continuing on the first of each and every month thereafter for so long as the child is child within the meaning of the Divorce Act. [Emphasis added] [3] The parties agreed by this provision of the Order that: Given the amount of spousal support, the parties agree that these are reasonable arrangements for the support of the child pursuant to s. 15.1(8) of the Divorce Act. [4] Paragraph 3(a) of the Order provided that Mr. Reid would pay to Ms. Ellis-Reid as spousal support the sum of “$1,250 per month commencing August 1, 2007 and continuing on the first of each and every month thereafter until further Order or agreement.” [Emphasis added] [5] Subparagraph 3(d) of the Order provided that spousal support is reviewable “if the CPP claim is successful and may be recalculated retroactively.” Subparagraph 3(c) obliged Ms. Ellis-Reid to advise Mr. Reid once her CPP claim was ruled upon. This requirement reflected the understanding between the parties that because Ms. Ellis-Reid claimed she was disabled and therefore unable to work, she would make an application for CPP disability benefits/payments. THE POSITION OF THE PARTIES [6] Succinctly stated, and as reflected in the written Briefs of Argument filed by counsel for each of the parties upon the hearing of this variation application in chambers, the position of the parties is as follows: [7] Mr. Reid, advises the court that he has continued to pay the $150 per month child support and $1,250 per month spousal support ordered to the present date. He was, when the Order was made and now continues to be, member of the Canadian Armed Forces. At para. 23 of his affidavit he deposes that: The compulsory retirement age for the Canadian Military is 60 years old, which will turn on December 5, 2019. am currently planning on retiring one year early in 2018. My estimated total annual income at this time will be $37,500 per year, but am willing to continue to provide child support in the Guideline amount until Elizabeth receives her first degree. [8] Insofar as spousal support is concerned, Mr. Reid seeks an order from the court terminating his obligations for payment. This is based upon Ms. Ellis-Reid’s failure to obtain employment of any significance since the Order and her failure to diligently make and pursue an application for CPP disability benefits for which she may be eligible as required by the Order. Mr. Reid also bases his position on the fact that the marriage was an 11 year marriage. He has continued to pay over 12 years of spousal support. [9] As the court understands it, insofar as material changes in circumstances are concerned, Mr. Reid relies upon the following: i) his intention to retire early from the Canadian Armed Forces which will reduce his income from $67,000 to $37,500; ii) the fact that Ms. Ellis-Reid has not applied for split in his CPP credits (which he supports) which may make her eligible for disability pension; and iii) Insofar as his child support obligations are concerned, his daughter, Elizabeth, receives incomes and financial support for her university studies from student loans, bursaries, scholarships and summer and part-time academic year employment. While he acknowledges he must and intends to support Elizabeth, the amount should take into account these financial resources and support should only continue for her first degree. [10] These circumstances, Mr. Reid claims, meet the material change threshold for successful variation application. [11] Ms. Ellis-Reid opposes Mr. Reid’s variation application. Her position, advanced by her counsel, is that Mr. Reid has not established the threshold requirement of material change in circumstances. The general circumstances of the parties are basically the same, albeit with some changes (in law not material) from those existing throughout the period of time that Mr. Reid has paid the child and spousal support payments that he has. In response to his now declared intention to take early retirement, no sound reason for Mr. Reid’s choice to retire early is provided. It appears simply to be matter of choice, not necessity. Implicitly she takes the position that so long as he has spousal and child support obligations that choice, in law, should not be open to him. [12] Ms. Ellis-Reid responds, through her counsel’s submissions, that she is prepared to take reasonable steps and to diligently pursue new CPP disability application which she had previously pursued but which was denied because she did not have sufficient CPP credits. Now that Mr. Reid is prepared to either apply for or agree to split his CPP credits or support her application to do so, she will reapply. To do so she requires and is waiting to receive sufficient supporting medical reports from her current (but new) medical specialist that she consults in Saskatoon where she now lives with her daughter Elizabeth. [13] There are two issues to be decided with respect to this variation application, namely: 1. Has the applicant met the threshold obligation to satisfy the court that there is (are) material change in circumstance(s) to support the court’s variation of the Order? 2. If the applicant has met the “material change in circumstance” threshold, what should be the disposition of his variation application?

B.(G.), 1995 CanLII 65 (SCC), [1995] SCR 370, identify and illustrate how the principle of “material change of circumstances” applies in the context of applications to vary child and/or spousal support orders. The guiding question cited is “if known at the time of the original order, would the change have resulted in different order?” [15] Mr. Reid recommenced his military career in early 2000 and served in the military at the time he authorized the Order he now seeks to vary. Much younger at that time than he is now, nevertheless he would have then and must throughout the duration of his payment of support, been aware of the retirement regulations for persons serving in the Canadian military. He nevertheless agreed, by the provisions of the Order, to continue to make child support payments to support his daughter so long as she remained child within the provisions of the Divorce Act, RSC 1985, (2d Supp). [16] His affidavits also recognize and acknowledge that at the time he entered into the Order, Ms. Ellis-Reid had no income and she suffered from at least two of the now longer list of medically disabling conditions set out in her affidavit. She continues to assert she is disabled and unable to engage in employment. [17] Cases in Saskatchewan have consistently concluded that voluntary early retirement, or for that matter, the choice of a payor to either leave the work force, stop working, go back to school or change jobs for lesser pay, all by choice as opposed to necessity, do not constitute a material change of circumstance sufficient to support a variation application to eliminate or reduce a payor’s obligation to pay child or spousal support (see Zaleschuk v Zaleschuk, 2009 SKQB 356 (CanLII), 340 Sask R 305 and the cases therein cited including Poitras v Poitras, 2006 SKQB 96 (CanLII), 276 Sask R 163; Grey v Grey, 2003 SKQB 266 (CanLII), 237 Sask R 109). [18] In the circumstances of these parties, both at the time the Order was entered into and now in excess of the 10 years that its provisions have been (to the credit of Mr. Reid) complied with, I have concluded that there is not a material change of circumstances established in this case as legally required to support the granting of the variation application. [19] Mr. Reid continues to be employed with the Canadian Armed Forces and can maintain this employment for another two years. Ms. Ellis-Reid claims to be and have been disabled and unable to work. As the Order contemplates, she now undertakes to diligently pursue split of her and Mr. Reid’s CPP credits and reapply for CPP disability benefits previously applied for but denied. [20] The parties’ daughter Elizabeth continues to be child within the meaning of the Divorce Act based upon the authorities applicable to children attending university full-time. [21] The changed circumstances argued for are, at best, future contingencies not present changes. The parties have been content to follow the existing Order, both payor and recipient, for the last 10 years in all their circumstances prevailing during that time. see no basis in law or fact to vary that status quo. note further that the parties have agreed to inextricably intertwine the payor’s spousal and child support obligations to the total “lump sum” payment of $1,400 for tax purposes favouring large sum payable for spousal support and lesser sum than that which would be required for child support. If future consent order is reached, the parties should reconsider the advisability of doing so. [22] For the reasons stated and analysis undertaken, I dismiss the applicant’s variation application. [23] Before leaving this matter wish to make the following additional comments and observations. While have dismissed Mr. Reid’s variation application, it may well be the case that from and after the date of his mandatory retirement, which is scarcely two years away, his circumstances including the substantial decrease in his income from the current level of approximately $67,000, may well constitute material change in circumstance prompting yet another variation application at that time. It may also be that Elizabeth will have completed her first degree. In addition, Mr. Reid advises he is prepared to fully support Ms. Ellis-Reid’s eligibility to apply for and obtain split of Mr. Reid’s CPP credits. This when achieved, will allow her to reapply for CPP disability benefits. If she is successful and receives disability pension, that increase in Ms. Ellis-Reid’s income, combined with the reduction of Mr. Reid’s income upon retirement, may also support the conclusion that all these events combined are sufficient material changes in the circumstances of the parties to then support variation application being made if an agreement is not reached. [24] For this reason, and in the interests of avoiding multiple court proceedings in the future, in dismissing the present variation application, I further order the following: 1. That Ms. Barbara Lynn Ellis-Reid immediately proceed to complete an application to split the CPP credits to the account of Jeffery Allan Reid equally, the same to be supported by Jeffery Allan Reid either through a joint application made or consent endorsed upon the application made by Barbara Lynn Ellis-Reid. Both parties will cooperate to execute such further or other documents as necessary to achieve the CPP credit split; 2. That upon confirmation of the split of the CPP credits, Barbara Lynn Ellis-Reid will, within 60 days thereafter, apply for CPP disability benefits and pursue the application diligently. She shall provide all information reasonably required by CPP to support her application; and 3. That Barbara Lynn Ellis-Reid will keep Jeffery Allan Reid informed of all communications received from the CPP disability claims administrators and provide copies of such correspondence to him immediately upon receipt. J. T.C. ZARZECZNY",c_2018skqb29.txt,"HELD: The application was dismissed.
The court found that the applicant had not proven that there was a material change in circumstances as voluntary early retirements do not constitute material change of circumstance.

Y. IN THE QUEEN'S BENCH JUDICIAL CENTRE OF YORKTON BETWEEN: JULIUS CHORNEY and HER MAJESTY THE QUEEN RESPONDENT Orest Rosowsky, Q.C. for the appellant Daryl B. Bode for the Crown JUDGMENT ARMSTRONG J. January 24, 1995 The appellant, Julius Chorney (herein sometimes""Chorney""), seeks to overturn a conviction by Andrychuk J. inthe Provincial Court that he:. . . did operate a motor vehicle while his ability to operatethe vehicle was impaired by alcohol and/or a drug contrary toSection 253(a) and Section 255 of the Criminal Code. The powers of this Court on this appeal are set forth in ss. 686(1)(a) of the Criminal Code: 686.[613](1) On the hearing of an appeal against conviction or against verdict that the appellant is unfit to stand trial or not criminally responsible on account of mental disorder, the court of appeal (a) may allow the appeal where it is of the opinion that (i) the verdict should be set aside on the ground that it is unreasonable or cannot be supported by the evidence, (ii) the judgment of the trial court should be set aside on the ground of wrong decision on question of law, or (iii) on any ground there was miscarriage of justice. The notice of appeal cites six grounds, one of them an alleged violation of the Charter. There is an added catch all ""any other grounds that may appear from reading of the transcript"". There is no mention in the notice of appeal, at least in the language of the section, of any of the grounds set out in ss. 686(1)(a). However at the opening of argument theappellant abandoned all but the Charter matter and oneinvolving the ""principle of reasonable doubt"". The Charter allegation reads:. . .d)That the accused's right to life, liberty and security ofthe person and the right not to be deprived thereof except inaccordance with the principles of fundamental justice as setout in Section 7 of the Charter were infringed by virtue ofthe fact that the Crown failed to provide disclosurerespecting crucial evidence of impairment to the accused orhis counsel after being requested to do so, thereby denied theaccused his right to make full answer and defence. Notices of this allegation were served on the Attorneys General of Canada and Saskatchewan as required by The Constitutional Questions Act, R.S.S. 1978, c. C-29, in the following terms: TAKE NOTICE that the accused JULIUS CHORNEY through Counsel on his behalf intends to make an application for dismissal of the charge on the grounds that the accused's right to be provided with timely disclosure of the Crown's evidence was infringed as guaranteed by Section of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. Particulars are noticeably absent from the notice of appeal and even more so from the notices for the Attorneys General. Neither Attorney General was represented at the trial. The information that was not disclosed by the Crown before trial was that the investigating officer had received telephone call in which she was informed that Chorney ""had left [the town of] Endeavour and was driving intoxicated."" The fact of the telephone call was revealed when it was volunteered in the examination in chief of the investigating officer. It is agreed that counsel for the Crown knew nothing whatsoever about the telephone call prior to hearing it from the witness at trial. Failure to disclose was not raised before the trialjudge. (Counsel for Chorney on this appeal was not counsel at the trial). It should have been if it was to be raised atall. See Mark Joseph Cartier v. Her Majesty the Queen, Sask. Q.B.C.A. No. 12/93, J.C. Prince Albert, August 31, 1994, Baynton J. (as yet unreported) and the cases cited by Baynton J., R. v. Anaquod (1990), 1990 CanLII 7459 (SK QB), 88 Sask. R. 205 and R. v. Kutynec (1992), 1992 CanLII 12755 (ON CA), 12 C.R. (4th) 152 159. Had the objection of failure to disclose been raisedat trial the trial judge would then have had to decide whetherthere was a reasonable possibility that the withholding ofinformation had impaired the right of the accused to make fullanswer and defence  R. v. Stinchcombe, 1991 CanLII 45 (SCC), [1991] 340. If the information could be of some use to the accused,it is relevant and should have been disclosed. The trialcould have been adjourned if wanted. There being no complaint at the trial, of nondisclosure, this appeal on this point could justifiably be dismissed. However invited counsel in argument to advance any idea as to how knowledge of the telephone call might have prompted anything different in the action or inaction of the defence. The defence did not call evidence at the trial. In R. v. Durette (1994), 1994 CanLII 123 (SCC), 88 C.C.C. (3d) (S.C.C.), Sopinka J. held that an accused should not be required to demonstrate the specific use to which information the accused had not even seen, might be put. But in the present case the information that the telephone call was made has been known since the trial (if not before as to which see below). do not see how Chorney was prejudiced in making full answer and defence by not knowing that someone other than the investigating officer thought he was inebriated the night in question. Counsel argues that it is impossible to tell what use could have been made if the information had been available before trial. But this does not bring this case within the Durette provision. It is not ""Catch 22"" situation. In Durette, the appellants did not know what had not been disclosed. In the present case the appellant has now had the information seven months, if not longer. Besides, Durette dealt with securing wire tap evidence which Sopinka J. said formed substantial part of the evidence against the appellants in that case. In the present case, neither the telephone call nor the information conveyed thereby was any evidence against the accused. The telephone call was no more than part of the investigating officer's narrative of how she came to be out on the highway on the night in question. do not know how the appellant might have benefited from disclosure of the telephone call before trial but more significantly, Chorney does not offer any idea. Accordingly reject this ground of appeal. should mention that even if allowing the appeal on this point, the proper disposition would be to order new trial. Durette, p. 59. There may be another and disquieting ground for rejecting the appellant's Charter argument. The following is from the cross-examination of the investigating officer (transcript, p. 25): QNow you'd indicated earlier you'd received call with respect to Mr. Chorney. When did that call come in? AApproximately five to 6:00. QAnd where did that one where did the call come from? AI just took it that it came from Endeavour. There was no name given. The caller just said that he had left Endeavour, driving intoxicated. QFrom what understand, you're aware of the identity of this person? AHe's an anonymous caller. QWell understand, from what you're saying, that he didn't give his name but understood also that you do know who it is, regardless of whether he named name or not? AI do. The foregoing exchange taken together with the fact that there was no objection raised at trial over the nondisclosure by the prosecution of the telephone call suggests very strongly, if not conclusively, that the defence knew before trial about the telephone call and accordingly knew more than counsel for the Crown. There is then the ground and argument ""involving the principle of reasonable doubt"" so described by counsel for the appellant. Although not specifically so characterized by the appellant it has to be under ss. 686(1)(a)(i) that the verdict is unreasonable or cannot be supported by the evidence. Chorney is deaf. The investigating officer knew Chorney prior to the incident resulting in Chorney's conviction. She knew he was deaf. When Chorney's car was stopped by the officer he was not wearing his boots but they were on the floor beside him in his car. The officer wanted him to leave his car and come back to the police car but wanted him to first put his boots on. She said that he refused to do so. The following brief exchange took place in cross-examination of the officer: QDid you ask him why he was why he didn't want to wear his boots? AI no, just asked him to put them on and he refused to put them on. QWere they taken with you back to the detachment? AYes, they were. There were few more questions that concerned the alleged condition of the boots but nothing relating to how the officer ""asked"" Chorney to put on his boots. When Chorney got out of his car as requested by the officer he did so in his stockings only. It was the 12th of January, there was snow on the ground and it was very cold. The fact that Chorney did not put his boots on was emphasized by the trial judge in his decision. He said this: Over and above everything that have just commented on insofar as the officer's evidence is this issue of the shoes. Now it's twenty below, Officer Grimsrud's evidence think is in the low twenties, whether that means twenty-one is low number in the twenties or twenty-nine is also low because you're close to thirty, but accept as fact that her evidence is that it's in the twenties. She's trying to get the Defendant to put his shoes on and he won't and, if you are visualizing or attempting to visualize in your mind's eye what the actions would be of person who is impaired by alcohol, it seems to me that sensible, sober person may well complain if he is not given an opportunity to put his shoes on in these circumstances, or indeed may refuse to exit the vehicle. Here the driver is refusing to put his shoes on. And the trial judge went on to find Chorney guilty. Now counsel (and again, present counsel was not counsel at trial) argues that the evidence of the officer asking Chorney to put on his boots should never have been considered because Chorney is deaf and wouldn't know he was being asked to put his boots on. He goes on to argue that without this particular evidence there is not enough other evidence to convict ""beyond reasonable doubt"". First of all, if the evidence was to be challenged it should have been challenged at first opportunity. It was not challenged; the officer was not even cross-examined on how she ""asked"" Chorney to put his boots on. In examination-in-chief she testified how she wrote out the required warning to him, that she wrote out the demand for breathalyser test and wrote out questions regarding calling lawyer. She knew Chorney was deaf and there is nothing in the evidence to indicate that he did not get her message. But even if one assumes that Chorney did not get the message, is it any less ""different"" that he gets out of his car in only his stockings? The trial judge observed that sober person might refuse to exit his vehicle without his boots, never mind any request to put them on. Secondly, even if one could find merit in counsel'sargument, which I do not, and even if it was accepted, thetrial judge could reasonably convict on the other evidence heconsidered. In the so often referred to case R. v. Andres (1980), 1979 CanLII 2238 (SK CA), Sask. R. 96 (C.A.) Culliton C.J.S. said (p. 99): The right of the Appeal Court to set aside conviction on the evidence is set out in Section 613(1)(a)(i) namely that the verdict is unreasonable or cannot be supported by the evidence. The Court of Appeal cannot and should not set asidea conviction merely because it would have taken a differentview of the evidence than did the trial Judge. The Court of Appeal must remember that it is neither its duty or its function to re-try cases its function is one of review. Thus while the Appeal Court may differ with the trial Judge as to the facts established by the evidence, it will only disturb his findings of fact if it is satisfied that such findings are not supported by the evidence or that the conclusion reached by the trial Judge is so clearly wrong as to make that decision unreasonable. See the judgment of Branca, J.A., in R. v. Dhillon (1973), 1972 CanLII 1356 (BC CA), C.C.C. (2d) 414, for correct statement of the principles to be followed and very helpful review of authorities.

BETWEEN: THE DIRECTOR OF ASSESSMENT Randall R. Duplak, Q.C. and Gwendolyn Fountain Appellant for the Appellant Thomas M. Macdonald and for the Board Paul Warren, in person Respondent J. PAUL WARREN and BERNADETTE WARREN and the CAPE BRETON Demetri Kachafanas REGIONAL MUNICIPALITY for the Respondent, Cape Breton Regional Municipality Respondents Appeal Heard: November 9, 1999 Judgment Delivered: November 9, 1999 THE COURT: The appeal is dismissed, per reasons for judgment given orally by Chipman, J.A.; Roscoe and Flinn, JJ.A., concurring. Chipman, J.A.(Orally): [1] This is an appeal by the Director of Assessment from a decision of the Nova Scotia Utility and Review Board. An appeal to this Court lies on any question relating to the Board’s jurisdiction or upon any question of law; s.30(1) of the Nova Scotia Utility and Review Board Act, 1992, c.11. [2] The Regional Assessment Appeal Court made decision respecting property in Port Morien in the respondent Cape Breton Regional Municipality. The respondent Paul Warren appealed the decision by filing notice of appeal with the Board on October 13,1998. He did not serve notice on the clerk of the Municipality, but the clerk of the Board forwarded the notice to the Municipality. The Director did not deny that the clerk of the Municipality received copy of the notice of appeal within thirty days of the decision of the Regional Assessment Appeal Court. The Director did, however, take the position that the Board did not have jurisdiction to hear the appeal because Mr. Warren failed to serve notice on the clerk of the Municipality as required by s. 86(1) of the Assessment Act, R.S.N.S. 1989, c.23. [3] Section 85 and s. 86(1) of the Assessment Act read: 85 Any person aggrieved by decision of the assessment appeal court, including the clerk on behalf of the municipality and the Director, may appeal therefrom to the Nova Scotia Utility and Review Board 86 (1) Notwithstanding the provisions of any other Act, any person aggrieved by decision of the regional assessment appeal court may appeal by serving notice of appeal, within thirty days from the day when notice of the decision was received, on the clerk of the municipality in which the property is situate, the Director, the person in whose name the property is assessed if he is not that person and the person who appealed the assessment if he is not that person, and by filing copy of the notice of appeal with the Clerk of the Nova Scotia Utility and Review Board, and not otherwise. [4] preliminary hearing was held by the Board to address the Directors’ objection to its jurisdiction. The Director filed an affidavit by the clerk of the Municipality deposing that Warren had failed to serve him with the notice of appeal. In the affidavit he stated he received copy of the notice from the clerk of the Board and he attached to his affidavit letter in which he took the position that he disagreed with any attempt by the Director to deny Warren hearing before the Board, and further took the position that the Municipality was sufficiently notified by the Board through its clerk. [5] The Board, by decision dated May 14, 1999, dismissed the Director’s preliminary motion holding that it did have jurisdiction to hear the appeal. In the Board’s view, as long as the person required to be served with the notice of appeal did in fact receive it within thirty days from the decision of the Regional Assessment Appeal Court the purpose of the requirement in s. 86(1) of the Assessment Act was fulfilled. [6] Before us, the Director contends that the Board erred in law in holding that it had jurisdiction because Warren simply did not comply with the provisions of the Act, and there are no provisions for extending the time or otherwise relieving from failure to comply with the service requirements. [7] We are unanimously of the opinion that this appeal must fail because, although s. 86(1) of the Assessment Act was not complied with respecting service on the Municipality, that party expressly waived its right to notice required by the statute. That party can waive statutory requirement of notice was recognized by the Rand, J. in Canadian Acceptance Corporation Limited v. Fisher (1958), 1958 CanLII 56 (SCC), 14 D.L.R. (2d) 225 (S.C.C.). [8] The principle of waiver of statutory requirement was applied by the Divisional Court of the Ontario High Court of Justice In Re N.H.D. Developments Limited and Regional Assessment Commissioner, Region No. 11 et al. (1980) 1980 CanLII 1596 (ON SC), 118 D.L.R. (3d) 365, 30 L.R. (2d) 689. In that case, the Ontario Municipal Board held that it had no jurisdiction to hear an assessment appeal because the taxpayer failed to comply with the service requirement of s. 63(6) of the Assessment Act, R.S.O. 1970, c.32, notwithstanding that the party who was not properly served waived the service requirement. [9] Section 63(3) of the Assessment Act, R.S.O. 1970, c. 32, like s. 85 of the Assessment Act, supra, provided right of appeal to the Ontario Municipal Board. Section 63(6) of the Assessment Act, R.S.O. 1970, c.32, like s. 86(1) of the Assessment Act, supra, set out the requirements of service of the notice of appeal. [10] In allowing the appeal from the Board’s decision Southey, J. said: With the greatest respect to the learned member of the Board, who recognized that the problem was one of some difficulty, we are all of the view that the requirements for service contained in s. 63(6) do not go to the jurisdiction of the Board to hear an appeal from the Assessment Review Court. That jurisdiction is derived in the first instance in this case from s. 63(3). Because the matter is not one of jurisdiction, there is no question in our minds that party for whose benefit the provisions for service set out in s. 63(6) have been enacted can waive compliance with those provisions. When such waiver occurs, the failure to comply with the provisions for service do not constitute bar to the Board’s hearing the appeal. [11] We think that reasoning applies to the case before us. [12] It is not therefore necessary to consider the other points raised in argument. The appeal is dismissed with costs to each of the respondents, Warren and the Municipality, in the amount of Five Hundred Dollars ($500.00) plus disbursements to be paid by the appellant.

BATEMAN, J.A.: [1] This is an appeal from the decision of Justice John M. Davison of the Supreme Court, in chambers [reported at [2000] N.S.J. No.37 (Q.L.)], dismissing the appellant’s application, inter alia, to set aside recovery order issued by the Prothonotary. BACKGROUND: [2] The appellant, Paranet Services Inc. carrying on business as Atlantic Business Systems (“ABS”) agreed to provide materials and labour to construct home for the respondent, Robert Brett Barefoot, in Sapporo, Japan. As part of that arrangement ABS contracted to ship the necessary building materials and supplies to Mr. Barefoot in Sapporo in three separate containers. Whether the shipment of fourth container was contemplated is in dispute. The first two containers were shipped in September and October, 1999. By fax dated October 22, 1999 ABS advised Mr. Barefoot that the third container was ready for shipment and that the total amount owing to ABS to that point, including the cost of shipment of the container was $41,802.14 (CDN) or $28,289 (US). This amount was wired by Mr. Barefoot to ABS on October 26, 1999. On November 5, 1999, Mr. Barefoot received further invoice from ABS advising that the balance owing was $83,896.60 (CDN) or $43,789.17 (US). This sum was in addition to the invoice of October 22 and included the cost of fourth container yet to be shipped and for labour supplied by ABS. ABS advised that if Mr. Barefoot did not pay this further amount, the third container would be re-routed back to Canada. That additional sum was not paid and by mid-November the arrangement between the parties had completely broken down. ABS tradesmen were called off the project and the third container was re-routed to Canada. [3] On January 11, 2000 Mr. Barefoot commenced an action against ABS in the Supreme Court alleging, inter alia, breach of contract and seeking possession of the third container. On January 13, 2000 he successfully applied to the Supreme Court for an interlocutory recovery order. That order was issued ex parte by the Prothonotary pursuant to Civil Procedure Rule 48.01. Mr. Barefoot posted cash security in lieu of the bond which is required by the Rule. [4] ABS applied, pursuant to Civil Procedure Rules 48.06 and 48.08, for interlocutory relief from the recovery order and for security for costs. That application was heard by Justice Davison. He granted the order for security but dismissed the Rule 48 application. It is from that dismissal that ABS appeals. [5] The Notice of Appeal lists seven grounds, which can be summarized as follows: The judge erred: (i) in striking the appellant’s affidavit from the record and in failing to consider three further affidavits filed by the appellant; (ii) in permitting reference to Mr. Barefoot’s affidavit, which had been filed in support of the original recovery order, and in not requiring Mr. Barefoot’s attendance for cross-examination on that affidavit; (iii) in failing to conclude that the respondent had not made full and fair disclosure of the facts on the original application for the recovery order; and (iv) in incorrectly applying the legal principles relevant to Rule 48.08. STANDARD OF REVIEW: [6] In Gateway Realty Ltd. v. Arton Holdings Ltd. and LaHave Developments Ltd. (1990), 1990 CanLII 2410 (NS CA), 96 N.S.R. (2d) 82, Matthews, J.A. wrote at p. 85: [10] The approach an appeal court must adopt in considering discretionary order made by chambers judge has been stated by this Court in Exco Corporation Limited v. Nova Scotia Savings and Loan et al. (1983), 59 N.S.R. (2d) 331; 125 A.P.R. 331, wherein Chief Justice MacKeigan in delivering the unanimous judgment of the Court on an appeal concerning an interlocutory injunction stated at p. 333: ""This Court is an appeal court which will not interfere with discretionary order, especially an interlocutory one such as this that is now before us, unless wrong principles of law have been applied or patent injustice would result."" [7] The original recovery order was obtained pursuant to Civil Procedure Rule 48.01 which provides in relevant part: 48.01 (1) Any party or intervenor in proceeding may apply for an interlocutory order to recover possession of property that was unlawfully taken or is unlawfully detained from him by any other party, or is held by an officer under any legal process issued in the proceeding. (2) When an applicant applies to recover possession of personal property and files an affidavit that complies with rule 48.02 and bond that complies with rule 48.03, the prothonotary, on an ex parte application, shall, unless the court otherwise orders, grant and issue an interlocutory recovery order in Form 48.04A. [8] Rule 48.03 requires bond with sureties in an amount equal to one and one-quarter (1¼) times the value of the property sought to be recovered. Rule 48.02 sets out the information to be contained in the affidavit filed in support of the application: 48.02. The affidavit of an applicant or his agent in support of an interlocutory recovery order shall, (a) sufficiently describe any property claimed and the value thereof, (b) set out facts showing that, (i) the applicant is the owner or lawfully entitled to the possession of the property; (ii) the property was unlawfully taken or is unlawfully detained from the applicant by the other party or is held by an officer under any legal process issued in the proceeding; (iii) the applicant or his agent has made demand for the property which has been refused; and (c) state the applicant was advised by his solicitor, naming him, and verily believes he is lawfully entitled to recover possession of the property. [9] ABS, on application before Justice Davison, sought the following relief, as is relevant to this appeal: (i) an order, pursuant to Rule 48.06(1) or 48.08(b), that ABS was entitled to retain possession of the third container; (ii) an order, pursuant to Rule 48.06(1)(b), releasing ABS from the requirement to file bond; and, (iii) pursuant to Rule 48.03(4), an order requiring the Prothonotary to assign to ABS the proceeds of the cash in lieu of bond filed by Mr. Barefoot. [10] Civil Procedure Rule 48.06 and 48.08 provide, as relevant here: (1) Any party or person, claiming to be the owner or entitled to possession of any property recoverable under an interlocutory recovery order, is entitled to retain or regain possession of the property if he files with the prothonotary, and delivers to the sheriff as his agent, not later than three (3) days after true copy of the order is served on him, (a) an affidavit stating he is entitled to possession of the property by virtue of the facts set forth therein; and (b) unless the court otherwise orders, bond in Form 48.06A, in an amount equal to one and one‑quarter (1¼) times the value of the property recovered, as determined by the sheriff, with two sufficient sureties who are approved by the sheriff and who shall justify, or other form of sufficient security, approved by the sheriff. 48.08. Any party or person, claiming an interest in any property taken under an interlocutory recovery order or claiming that the order was wrongfully granted or issued, may (b) make an application in the proceeding as party or intervenor, and the court may on the hearing thereof; (i) grant the applicant reasonable opportunity to amend any affidavit or bond used in support of the grant of the order; (ii) upon such terms as it thinks just, vary or modify or set aside the order or stay the proceeding; (iii) order any property taken under the order to be held by the sheriff pending judgment or further order of the court or to be returned or disposed of upon such terms as it thinks just, or to grant any other relief with respect to the return, safety, or sale of the property, or any part thereof; (iv) order any bond to be released or given; (v) grant such other order as it thinks just. (Emphasis added) [11] ABS took the position before Justice Davison that the original recovery order should not have been granted because Mr. Barefoot’s affidavit in support was deficient and, that, in any event, ABS was entitled to retain possession of the container. ABS filed four affidavits on the application, the deponent in each being Douglas MacArthur, an officer of the appellant company. The first, filed January 17, 2000, contained fifty-six (56) paragraphs primarily responding to the affidavit filed by Mr. Barefoot in the original application for recovery order; the second, dated January 19, attached copies of the Statement of Claim and Defence; the third, dated January 19 (“the main affidavit”), titled “Supplementary Affidavit of Douglas MacArthur” was an expanded version of the first affidavit; the final affidavit, dated January 20, simply confirmed that it was Mr. MacArthur, for ABS, who had all of the dealings with Mr. Barefoot in relation to the house construction and stated that his three earlier affidavits were prepared in his capacity as president and chief executive officer of the company. [12] Counsel for Mr. Barefoot objected to the form and content of the MacArthur affidavits. Justice Davison said of the main affidavit: [12] It contains 85 paragraphs and is replete with paragraphs which were irrelevant, scandalous, containing information not within the personal knowledge of the deponent, with no indication of information and belief and paragraphs which intend to attack the credibility of the plaintiff with respect to the affidavit he supplied to the court in the process of getting the recovery order. [13] He cited Waverley (Village Commissioners) et al. v. Nova Scotia (Minister of Municipal Affairs) et al. (1993), 1993 CanLII 3403 (NS SC), 123 N.S.R. (2d) 46 (S.C.) and Wall v. 679927 Ontario Ltd. et al. (1999), 1999 CanLII 7240 (NS CA), 176 N.S.R. (2d) 96 (C.A.), both decisions addressing the proper requirements of affidavits. He referred in particular to the comments of Cromwell, J.A. in Wall at p.110: [41] ... that the Chambers judge erred in failing to make clear ruling on the admissibility of the Carter affidavit. It was central to his conclusions and its admissibility, in its entirety, was objected to and the objection was fully argued. Moreover, significant portions of the affidavit are clearly irrelevant, scandalous or consist of innuendo and conjecture. The affidavit is so fundamentally defective that the court should not be required to take it apart in pieces to preserve some possibly admissible material. It should have been struck. (Emphasis added) [14] Justice Davison considered whether the main affidavit could be edited but concluded that it was so materially defective it ought to be struck. In so doing he cited examples of paragraphs from the affidavit, which were objectionable for variety of reasons: in one paragraph the affiant attested to question of law; in others there is no indication of the affiant’s source of knowledge; others are irrelevant and scandalous. He referred, as well, to eighteen (18) paragraphs of the affidavit which purport to contradict portions of Mr. Barefoot’s affidavit. As noted by Justice Davison, the contest between Mr. Barefoot’s interpretation of the contract and that of ABS is precisely the subject matter of the main action. These issues will only be resolved in the context of findings of credibility. Such matters do not readily lend themselves to resolution on an interlocutory application. He referred again to Cromwell, J.A. in Wall, at p.106: [26] an interlocutory application for security for costs should not be the occasion for the determination of the merits of the case where it is complex or depends on disputed facts and findings of credibility. [15] Cromwell, J.A. elaborated at p.111: [43] Our system of civil litigation is based on the principle that disputed issues of fact are to be determined at trial. There are numerous instances throughout our rules of procedure in civil matters that illustrate this principle. [47] This reluctance to assess the merits of claim or defence before trial is based both on procedural values and practical concerns. The prime procedural value is that ""plenary trial on the merits"" is key element of fair procedure: see Dawson et al. v. Rexcraft Storage and Warehouse Inc. et al (1998), 1998 CanLII 4831 (ON CA), 111 O.A.C. 201; 164 D.L.R. (4th) 257 (C.A.) per Borins, J.A., at para. 6. Practical concerns relate to the difficulty of making correct factual determinations on the limited material available on interlocutory applications and the important advantages of trial court in evaluating evidence in light of the factual context of the entire case rather than on selective and partial record at the interlocutory stage: see Rexcraft, supra, at para. [48] In my view, consideration of the extent to, and the manner in which, the merits of the case may be assessed on security for costs application must take place in the context of this reluctance, evidenced throughout our Rules, to assess the merits of cases turning on disputed facts other than at trial on the merits. [16] Although made in the context of an application for security for costs, Justice Cromwell’s remarks are applicable in broader context. [17] Civil Procedure Rule 38.02 provides: (1) An affidavit used on an application may contain statements as to belief of the deponent with the sources and grounds thereof. (2) Unless the court otherwise orders, an affidavit used on trial shall contain only such facts as the deponent is able of his own knowledge to prove. [18] The words of Justice Davison in Waverley, supra at p.50, bear repeating: [13] Great care should be exercised in drafting affidavits. Both pleadings and affidavits should contain facts but there are marked differences between the two types of documents. Affidavits, unlike pleadings, form the evidence which go before the court and are subject to the rules of evidence to permit the court to find facts from that evidence. They should be drafted with the same respect for accuracy and the rules of evidence as is exercised in the giving of viva voce testimony. [14] Too often affidavits are submitted before the court which consist of rambling narratives. Some are opinions and inadmissible as evidence to determine the issues before the court. [19] would agree with Justice Davison’s assessment of Mr. MacArthur’s main affidavit. It contains substantial commentary, opinion and scandalous allegations irrelevant to the matters in issue on the application. Parts of the affidavit are narrative rant, paragraphed at random and attacking Mr. Barefoot’s character. Included are comments such as: “. he appeared to be using drugs or experiencing withdrawal symptoms”; “. it became increasingly likely by his actions that he was frequent drug user .”; “. he proceeded to eat too many jelly donuts”; “Barefoot again went back to the trunk of his car and, in an extremely agitated state, again began looking for something. was afraid it might be gun.”; “[he] got back into his car and almost ran me over down (sic) before could run behind street light pole.” The offending material so pervaded this lengthy affidavit, it could not be and should not have been edited by the judge so as to conform with the requirements of Rule 38.02. While some technical deficiencies in affidavits may not preclude admission, this material was markedly below the standard. [20] The appellant, while maintaining that the affidavit was not fatally flawed, says in the alternative, that Justice Davison should have considered the remaining three affidavits in support of his application. The information from the first affidavit was incorporated into the main affidavit. The first affidavit suffers from the same deficiencies. Additionally, the appellant’s intention was clearly to replace the earlier affidavit with the subsequent one. In any event, it, like the main affidavit, was not admissible. The remaining two affidavits do not advance the application. They simply attach the pleadings and confirm Mr. MacArthur’s status in the company. [21] Counsel for ABS further submits that, independent of Mr. MacArthur’s affidavits, there was sufficient information in the respondent’s cross-examination of him to support the application. The respondent had objected to the admission of the affidavits. Justice Davison reserved his decision on that issue. Accordingly, Mr. Barefoot’s counsel, while maintaining the position that the affidavits were inadmissible, cross-examined Mr. MacArthur. In my view, upon the judge ruling subsequently that the affidavit was inadmissible, the cross-examination cannot form part of the evidence. In any event, am not satisfied that the information provided in the cross-examination, even had it been admissible, would have satisfied the requirements of Rule 48.06(1)(a). [22] In summary, having excluded the main affidavit, there was, in my opinion, no admissible evidence before the judge to found the appellant’s position. The remaining evidence neither supported Mr. MacArthur’s application for recovery order pursuant to Rule 48.06(1)(a) nor was it adequate to justify the setting aside or modification of the original recovery order pursuant to Rule 48.08(b)(ii). Justice Davison did not err in dismissing the applications. DISPOSITION: [23] I would dismiss the appeal with costs to the respondent, in any event of the cause, fixed at $1000 plus disbursements.

The offer was not accepted (and indeed never was accepted) and the case proceeded to trial.
The trial was concluded and the matter stood reserved pending my decision.
About a week after the conclusion of the trial, but before I rendered my decision the petitioner revoked his offer.
[2] I have compared the offer of settlement to my decision.
Suffice to say that my decision ended up being considerably more favourable to the petitioner than what the petitioner offered to settle for.
This was the case for not only the family property issues (which the petitioner calculates he received about $229,888.00 more in my judgment than what he proposed in his offer) but also in terms of spousal support.
The petitioner had offered to waive any spousal support but after trial I ordered retroactive spousal support in the amount of $18,000.00.","The applicant commenced a divorce action against her husband incorporating a claim for a division of assets under the Matrimonial Property Act.

IN THE SUPREME COURT OF NOVA SCOTIA Citation: Walker and Walker, 2003 NSSF002 Date: 20021210 Docket: SH 1201-55269 SFHD-008382 Registry: Halifax Between: Virginia TheresaWalker and Russell Edward Walker Respondent Judge: The Honourable Gordon A. Tidman Heard: December 10, 2002, in Halifax, Nova Scotia Written Decision: January 16, 2003 Counsel: Virginia T. Walker (The Applicant, in Person) Judith Ann Schoen, for the Respondent [1] This is an application to determine whether this court has jurisdiction to vary consent order of the Ontario Court (General Division). Background: [2] On June 13, 1994 the Ontario Court (General Division) granted judgment by consent which incorporated by reference an agreement made between the separated married couple of Virginia and Russell Walker. Part one of the Order incorporates the following term which was agreed to by the parties: That the defendant, Russell Edward Walker, shall pay to the plaintiff, Virginia Theresa Walker, on or before April 9th, 1994 to (sic) [the] sum of THIRTY SEVEN THOUSAND DOLLARS ($37,000.00) in full and final satisfaction of all claims with respect to property, division of property and an equalization payment. [3] At the time of the granting of the Order, the Walkers resided in Ontario, thus the Ontario court had jurisdiction to grant the Order. Mrs. Walker now resides in Nova Scotia where she has commenced against Mr. Walker an action for divorce. In the action Mrs. Walker also seeks a division of assets under the Matrimonial Property Act. The asset she seeks to have divided is the interest of Mr. Walker in federal government pension. [4] Since the Ontario court order purported to finalize a property division between the parties, Mrs. Walker, who claims a portion of Mr. Walker’s pension entitlement, seeks to set aside the agreement she made with Mr. Walker, which was incorporated into the Ontario court order. She does so on the grounds that she was not aware of her entitlement to share in her husband’s pension benefits at the time she entered into the agreement. Her claim is based on the equitable grounds of fraud, duress and unconscionability. [5] The issue the parties present to the court is whether this court has jurisdiction to hear Mrs. Walker’s claim to set aside the agreement. The real question embodied in that issue is whether this court has jurisdiction to set aside or vary consent order of the Ontario court. Deliberations: [6] First of all, as agreed by the parties, there is no question that Mrs. Walker is entitled to commence the divorce action in Nova Scotia. She is also in the same action entitled to seek division of assets under the provisions of the Nova Scotia Matrimonial Property Act. [7] Section 22(1) of the Nova Scotia Matrimonial Property Act provides: Conflict of laws 22 (1) The division of matrimonial assets and the ownership of movable property as between spouses, wherever situated, are governed by the law of the place where both spouses had their last common habitual residence or, where there is no such residence, by the law of the Province. [8] Therefore, although the Nova Scotia court has jurisdiction to hear the property division application, the court in determining the division must in doing so, apply the law of the last common habitual residence of the parties. Since it would appear that Mr. And Mrs. Walker had their last common habitual residence in Ontario, the division of matrimonial assets would be governed by Ontario law. [9] Section 29 of the Nova Scotia Matrimonial Property Act provides: Harsh or fraudulent contract or agreement 29 Upon an application by party to marriage contract or separation agreement, the court may, where it is satisfied that any term of the contract or agreement is unconscionable, unduly harsh on one party or fraudulent, make an order varying the terms of the contract or agreement as the court sees fit. [10] Under the provisions of s.29 of the Act Mrs. Walker is also entitled to seek to vary the terms of the separation agreement entered into between her and her husband upon the equitable grounds as set out in the Act. But does the Nova Scotia court have jurisdiction to vary the terms of separation agreement embodied within the terms of consent order? [11] Ms. Schoen, on behalf of Mr. Walker, submits that the Matrimonial Property Act while, by s.29, providing the court with jurisdiction to vary marriage contract or separation agreement on grounds of fraud, harshness or unconscionability, does not provide the court with jurisdiction to vary court order. Ms. Schoen submits further that there have been findings by the Family Division of this court that it has no jurisdiction to vary an order incorporating such an agreement. Ms. Schoen provides no citations or case names for her submission. [12] The Nova Scotia Court of Appeal in Bank of N.S. v. Golden Forest Holdings (1990), 1990 CanLII 2489 (NS CA), 98 N.S.R.(2d) 429, dealt with consent orders and approved the following passage from Citel v. Rothbart (1987), 19 C.P.C. (2d) 48 (Ont. S.C.): consent order is contract and must be treated as such. Such an order can only be set aside or varied by subsequent consent, or upon grounds of common mistake, misrepresentation or fraud, or on any other ground which would invalidate contract. [13] Based on that passage, it seems to me that the court has jurisdiction to vary the consent order upon the grounds as alleged by Mrs. Walker, notwithstanding that s.29 of the Matrimonial Property Act does not specifically provide the court with jurisdiction. [14] Additionally, as set out by Mrs. Walker in her brief, the English Court of Chancery in Wilding v. Sanderson, [1897] Ch.C.A., had previously determined that that court had jurisdiction to vary consent order. The court in that case stated: ..a consent order based on and intended to carry out an agreement come to between the parties, ought to be treated as an agreement which could be properly set aside on any ground on which an agreement in the terms of the order could be set aside. [15] Section 41(a) of the Judicature Act R.S.N.S. 1989 c.240 provides: If plaintiff claims to be entitled to any equitable...right, or to relief upon any equitable ground against any deed, instrument or contract...the court shall give to the plaintiff the same relief as would have been given by the court of the Equity Judge or the High Court of Chancery. [16] It follows then that Mrs. Walker by virtue of the Judicature Act is entitled to the same relief the English Court of Chancery accorded to the plaintiff in Welding v. Sanderson (supra). It then seems clear, and so find, that this court has jurisdiction to vary consent order. [17] The only question remaining is whether this court has jurisdiction to vary an order of the Ontario court. [18] There is no question that this court has jurisdiction to hear Mrs. Walker’s claim for divorce and her claim for division of property under the Matrimonial Property Act. precondition to hearing her claim for division of property requires finding as to the validity of the contract embodied in the consent order. [19] In my view it follows that the court must also have jurisdiction to deal with the precondition. In reaching that conclusion, have also considered that the Divorce Act has provided for jurisdictional difficulties arising because of the increased mobility of the population in Canada and no doubt it was with that same concern in mind that resident of the province may commence an action for divorce in this province and incorporate therein claim under the Matrimonial Property Act regardless of where the applicant’s spouse resides, where the married parties were residing at the time separation agreement was entered into or where the parties had their last common habitual residence. In the latter case, however, as provided by s.22(1) of the Nova Scotia Matrimonial Property Act the law of Ontario would govern the division of the parties’ assets. In this case the asset is personal; i.e., federal pension entitlement. Decision On Issue: [20] Under the circumstances as set out, find that the Nova Scotia court has jurisdiction to vary the Consent Order of the Ontario court. Forum Conveniens Issue: [21] Ms. Schoen argues that even if this court finds that it has jurisdiction to deal with the matter, the Ontario court would also have jurisdiction to vary the terms of its own order. would agree with that submission. Ms. Schoen submits that since both courts have jurisdiction, under the circumstances here, the Ontario court is the more convenient forum for hearing the matter. Mrs. Walker disagrees and submits that this court should be determined as being the forum conveniens. [22] The court declines to make finding on this issue on the basis that no factual body of evidence has been submitted with the application upon which the court could make such finding. No evidence relating to the issue was adduced at the hearing and no affidavits were filed by the parties setting out the facts relied upon for such finding. Tidman, J.

864,"JUDGMENT P.S.
KOLENICK, JBACKGROUND [1] The accused is charged that he did, on or about November 29, 2010, at Saskatoon, commit common assault against the complainant contrary to s. 266 of the Criminal Code.
The issue which has arisen is whether the evidence of the Crown is sufficiently credible to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the only physical contact he had on the complainant was for the purpose of defending himself from the alleged aggression of the complainant.
Related to that was whether, on the evidence the Crown was able to prove non-consent beyond a reasonable doubt.
Regardless, the accused bears no onus whatsoever in these proceedings.
[2] For roughly two months prior to this alleged matter, the complainant, age 17, had lived in a blended family with her father as well as, the accused and his mother.
A disagreement arose between the accused and the female complainant when he had accidentally allowed the baby to slip from his grasp while removing him from the Jolly Jumper.
The child had struck the floor, but suffered no injury, and was quickly comforted.
The actions of the accused had been unintentional with no harm to the baby.
Despite that, it led to a sharp verbal exchange, as the circumstances between the parties deteriorated, leading to more.","The plaintiff brought an action against the defendants for breach of contract in regard to the defendants' refusal to return to her the substantial security deposit that she paid as part of a motel lease.
After being clearly told that the money would not be returned, she waited 9 years before commencing the action.
The plaintiff applied for an order disallowing the defendants' limitation defence.
Application to disallow the limitation defence dismissed; plaintiff's action dismissed.
The plaintiff's evidence did not show any valid reason for such a lengthy delay and the defendants thought that all outstanding issues with the plaintiff had long since been settled.
Not only was there a presumption that the evidence would now be less cogent than it would have been, but the defendants' storage warehouse was destroyed by fire 3 years ago resulting in the loss of many old records, including those relating to the motel.","[6, 2, 7, 5, 9, 11, 4, 3, 10, 12]",433,"IN THE SUPREME COURT OF NOVA SCOTIA Citation: Cluett v. Metro Computerized Bookkeeping Limited et al 2004 NSSC 196 Date: 2004/10/05 Docket: S. H. No. 174414 Registry: Halifax Between: Jeanette Cluett v. Metro Computerized Bookkeeping Limited and Ian Hill Defendants Judge: The Honourable Justice K. Peter Richard Heard: September 20, 21 and 22, 2004, in Halifax, Nova Scotia Counsel: Kevin A. MacDonald, for the plaintiff Raymond S. Riddell, Q.C., for the defendants By the Court: [1] In this action the Plaintiff, Jeanette Cluett (Cluett) claims against Metro Computerized Bookkeeping Limited (Metro) and Ian Hill (Hill) damages for breach of contract in the amount of $20,000 as well as general damages and exemplary damages. Hill and Metro counterclaim for the sum of $56,000 for additional rent and unpaid business taxes for 1992. [2] At pretrial conference it became clear that there are two preliminary issues involving an application by the plaintiff to add or substitute another plaintiff and to seek relief from the provisions of the Limitation of Actions Act. At that time directed that would deal with these matters at the opening of trial. After two days of hearings the matter was adjourned pending the determination of these preliminary issues. [3] The plaintiff Cluett she had Grade IX education and had subsequently taken courses in accounting or bookkeeping. She had been employed in the securities section of Canada Trust following which she worked as an accounts receivable clerk at the Holiday Inn. Sometime later she became office manager for Maritime Graphic Arts and then was employed by the Royal Nova Scotia Yacht Squadron as an accountant for four years. It was in this position that she met the Defendant Hill who seemed impressed with her abilities. Hill told Cluett that if she ever wanted to make move he might have something for her. In 1988 Cluett left the RNSYS and joined Hill Investments where she acted as office manager and did most of the accounting for several of the companies in which Hill had interests. In this capacity she did most of the accounting for the defendant Metro. After Metro acquired the Maritime Motel she did the accounts for that operation also. find that at all material times Cluet was an experienced and competent records keeper and office manager. [4] In June of 1991 Cluett, through numbered company, 2110250 Nova Scotia Limited, assumed the operation of the Maritime Motel by lease with an option to purchase. The lessor was Metro. During the time that she operated the Motel Cluett continued to do the ""financials"" for Hill Investments. On September 30, 1993, after some 27 months, she gave up the operation of the Motel and also resigned her other employment with Hill Investments. This action relates to this time frame. [5] Sometime in 1993 Cluett began treatment with her family doctor for stress and depression. According to the evidence she was prescribed medium strength dosage of Atavin which is described as medication used ""to relieve nervousness and tension or improve sleep disturbances"". Cluett indicated that in 1994 through 1996 she had several personal problems including the serious illnesses of her mother and her sister. These and other stresses prompted her doctor, in early 1996, to order her on sick leave for two to four months. [6] After her departure from the Motel and Hill Investments Cluett through her numbered company operated video rental outlet for about six months in early 1994. She worked for another company for period of time but this was terminated when she went on sick leave as previously indicated.. Although the evidence is not clear, it appears that Cluett returned to employment with Sobeys for about three months. Following that she ran small gift shop at the Lord Nelson Hotel, again through her numbered company. It appears that this lasted about two years. At the present time Cluett, through the same numbered company operates commercial and domestic cleaning company and has been so engaged for about five years. [7] The defendants Hill is businessman in the metro area with wide ranging interests in businesses such as automobile sales, automobile and property leasing as well as the operation of Metro Computerized Bookkeeping. All of his operations were conducted through limited companies and he did little or no business in his personal capacity. At times material to this action Hill spent considerable time (approximately four winter months) out of the country. Hill described 2001 as ""not good year"". His son, quadriplegic with whom he had very close relationship, died in June of that year. Hill had, what he described as ""nervous breakdown"" and went into extreme depression. Later that year he underwent surgery for prostate cancer. Sometime in November 2001 storage building, owned by one of the Hill companies and containing many of the old corporate records, was destroyed by fire. For this reason Hill or his business associate Corkum were unable to review any of their documents relating to this matter. The Cause of Action [8] In May of 1991 Cluett and Hill commenced negotiations respecting the operation of the Maritime Motel in Bedford. On 13 May Hill wrote memo to Cluett outlining the terms of five year lease with option to purchase. The proposal called for base rental of $90,000 per year and additional rental of $20,000 payable on 30 September of each year. It also called for ""security deposit"" of $20,000. As to the security deposit the proposal stated: “A security deposit of $20,000 would be held by Metro during the term of the lease to be returned to you upon satisfactory completion of the lease or to be applied to the purchase price of the property should you exercise your option to purchase referred to below.” The security deposit is the subject matter of this action. [9] Cluett immediately instructed her lawyer, Kevin MacDonald to incorporate numbered company through which she would operate the Motel. She entered into possession of the Motel on June on her understanding that Metro would provide the lease purchase agreement later in the month. Cluett also retained MacDonald to act for her in the sale of her home since she needed cash for the payment of the security deposit. Also, there was small home on the Motel property which she intended to move into in order to be close to her business. [10] The evidence is not clear as to the preparation of the lease after Cluett went into possession of the Motel property. draft was prepared by Metro, or by Hill's business associate Eric Corkum, although there is some suggestion that another lawyer may have had hand in the preparation of the lease. In any event, draft copy of the lease was given to Cluett's lawyer who made several changes in the interests of his client. Sometime during the summer, or probably in September of 1991 Cluett was successful in selling her home. In early October Hill attended at the Motel and took delivery of the $20,000 cheque drawn on Cluett's personal account and marked as ""Sec. Dep M.Motel"". In the records of Cluett's numbered company the security deposit is recorded as ""shareholders loan"". Later financial statements of the numbered company show that this shareholders loan had been paid off. [11] The lease was long time ""in process"" as evidenced by the fact that Cluett's lawyer wrote letter to Metro indicating that if the lease was not executed within reasonable time then she would require the return of the security deposit. It is unclear what happened as result of this, but in letter from Hill to Cluett of 24 September, 1992 Hill indicates that the lease was never executed. [12] During the time that Cluett was operating the Motel she was also employed by Hill Investments keeping the records for one or more of the Hill companies. [13] There is evidence to show that the Motel operation was not as lucrative as Cluett had originally hoped which may have been due, at least in part, to downturn in the economy which had detrimental effect on the tourism industry. On 23 September, 1992 Hill and Cluett met to review the situation. This resulted in the letter of 24 September which outlined the terms of new arrangement which included lower rental and other decreased expenses for Cluett. The letter also enumerated outstanding obligations under the lease which totaled $56,000. This amount was comprised of “additional rental” for two years and unpaid realty taxes. This letter was apparently passed to Cluett's lawyer who responded by letter of 30 October 1992 which stated in part that Cluett: “wishes to have no further dealings with yourself or Metro Computerized Bookkeeping in relation to the Maritime Motel.” The letter further advises Metro that Cluett is entitled to return of the $20,000 security deposit... and reserves her right to maintain an action against Metro if the deposit is not returned to her. [14] In spite of that letter new lease with term of one year was drafted and given to Cluett's lawyer for review. Several changes were made and the revised document was reviewed by Cluett and Hill at the Motel in early October. It was then signed by the parties and Cluett delivered the signed copies to her lawyer who completed the jurat and registered the lease on 22 October, 1992. This lease contained clause which purported to cancel all of the debts between the parties “By signing this lease the parties herein and Jeanette Cluett acknowledge that any agreements or leases entered into prior to the date of this lease on the property are replaced by this agreement and any monies owing between the parties are considered null and void.” In her evidence Cluett said that she never read the leases that evening before signing it, even though she had initialled all of the changes before signing. [15] On 10 August, Cluett 1993 wrote letter to Hill indicating that she would not be renewing the lease for the Motel and would terminate her employment with Hill Investments as of 30 October, 1993. Cluett said that in conversation with Hill around this time she asked for the return of the $20,000 and he said ""its all gone"". She said that she then knew he would not repay the security deposit. conclude from the evidence that the separation on 30 October was amicable. Cluett asked if she could stay in the house for October if necessary, Hill agreed to this although it proved unnecessary since Cluett found alternate accommodation. On 28 July, 1994, at the request of Cluett, Hill wrote what only can be described as glowing letter of recommendation for Cluett which ended with the comment believe whomever employes (sic) Jeannette would acquire valuable asset"". Cluett also said she continued friendly relationship with Hill's disabled son. [16] Based on this evidence find that this alleged cause of action arose on October 1992 when Cluett, through her numbered company executed the lease (without purchase option) which purported to absolve the parties from any and all debt existing at the time. Hill was of the opinion that all outstanding matters between the parties had thus been resolved. [17] Cluett said that on New Years Eve of 2000 she resolved to do whatever was necessary to get the $20.000 security deposit returned to her. Even after making that decision it was some seven and half months, in mid‑August that she met with Hill to make her demand. In August of 2001 Cluett met with Hill at Tim Horton's on Kempt Road and made demand for the return of the security deposit. Hill said he dismissed this demand as frivolous. Hill said he was upset with this turn of events and he advised her to call Eric Corkum. This happened years and 10 months after the cause of action arose without any other activity during the intervening time. The action was not commenced until October, 2001, full nine years after the cause of action arose on October 1992. [18] There is no evidence that Cluett sought or received any legal advice during this time respecting the matter. It was open to Cluett to seek such advice respecting her legal rights as set out in MacDonald's letter of 30 October 1992 at any time but she apparently elected to do nothing. [19] This is contractual matter which, under S. (1) (e) of the Limitation of Actions Act, requires that the action must be commenced ""within six years after the cause of any such action arose"". However, S.3 of the Act purports to give the trial judge wide discretion in disallowing defence based upon the prescribed limitation period. The relevant portions of S.3 are: 3(1) In this Section, (a) ""action"" means an action of type mentioned in subsection (1) of Section 2; (b) ""notice"" means notice which is required before the commencement of an action; (c) ""time limitation"" means limitation for either commencing an action or giving notice pursuant to (i) the provisions of Section 2, (ii) the provisions of any enactment other than this Act, (iii) the provisions of an agreement or contract. (2) Where an action is commenced without regard to time limitation, and an order has not been made pursuant to subsection (3), the court in which it is brought, upon application, may disallow defence based on the time limitation and allow the action to proceed if it appears to the court to be equitable having regard to the degree to which (a) the time limitation prejudices the plaintiff of any person whom he represents; and (b) any decision of the court under this Section would prejudice the defendant or any person whom he represents, or any other person. 3(4) In making determination pursuant to subsection (2), the court shall have regard to all the circumstances of the case and in particular to (a) the length of and the reasons for the delay on the part of the plaintiff; (b) any information or notice given by the defendant to the plaintiff respecting the time limitation; (c) the extent to which, having regard to the delay, the evidence adduced or likely to be adduced by the plaintiff or the defendant is or is likely to be less cogent that if the action had been brought or notice had been given within the time limitations; (d) the conduct of the defendant after the cause of action arose, including the extent if any to which he responded to requests reasonably made by the plaintiff for information or inspection for the purpose of ascertaining facts which were or might be relevant to the plaintiff's cause of action against the defendant; (e) the duration of any disability of the plaintiff arising after the date of the accrual fo the case of action; (f) the extent to which the plaintiff acted promptly and reasonably once he knew whether or not the act or omission of the defendant, to which the injury was attributable, might be capable at that time of giving rise to an action for damages; (g) the steps, if any, taken by the plaintiff to obtain medical, legal or other expert advice and the nature of any such advice he may have received. (6) court shall not exercise the jurisdiction conferred by this Section where the action is commenced or notice given more than four years after the time limitation therefor expired."" [20] shall now deal with each of the circumstances of the case as outlined in S.(3)(3) of the Act. (a) The delay in this case is full nine years after the cause of action arose. I am unable to discern, from the evidence of the plaintiff, any valid reason for such a lengthy delay. She did speak to stress related health problems which required medication and four month period of leave. But her own evidence indicates that she was actively involved in business, either self‑employed or as an employee during the balance of these years. (b) ‑ I am satisfied that the defendants thought that all outstanding issues with Cluett had long since been settled so they had no possible reason to give any notice to Cluett respecting time limitations. (c) This action could have been commenced at any time after 30 October 1992. In my view, the elapse of 9 years raises a presumption that the evidence would be less cogent than it otherwise would have been. The evidence of Hill, taken as whole, suggests certain lack of cogency which can be attributed to the passage of time and the fact that for nine years the matter was completely ""out of mind"". Further, in mid November 2001 the defendant's storage warehouse in Dartmouth was destroyed by fire and the defendant lost many old records including those relating to Metro and the Maritime Motel. The defendant was therefore prevented from determining what, if any, old records would have been germane to the defence of the plaintiff's action. (d) The defendants were not aware of the cause of action until the Cluett/Hill meeting in August of 2001 at Tim Horton's. Accordingly, there were no requests made by the plaintiff to which the defendants could respond. (e) It seems that this circumstance relates to disability arising out of the cause of action. In this case there is no disability other than that alluded to in (a) above. (f) This also seems to relate more to personal injury situation. In the context of this case, the plaintiff's lawyer had stated the nature of the claim to the defendants in his letter of 30 October 1992. It is presumed that this was done on the instructions of Cluett. Therefore, it is reasonable to conclude that the plaintiff acted neither promptly nor reasonably by ""sitting on her rights"" for some nine years. In Butler v. Southam, (2001), 2001 NSCA 121 (CanLII), 197 N.S.R. (2d) 97 NSCA) Cromwell, J.A. said at para 142 ""Moreover, concern with the Plaintiff's diligence is consistent with s. (2)'s focus on what is equitable. It will generally be less equitable for limitation defence to defeat the claim of diligent Plaintiff than of one who has sat back on his or her rights.""(underscoring mine). [21] In Woods v. Hubley, (1996), 1995 CanLII 4280 (NS CA), 146 N.S.R. (2d) 97, Chipman JA noted in paragraph 36: review of all of the cases suggests to me that the amendments give trial judge very substantial discretion to virtually do away with limitation defences, subject only to the limit imposed by s. 3(6) of the Act. do not read this as direction to the trial judge to routinely grant all applications for relief from statutory time limitations. Indeed, such an interpretation is tantamount to adding four years to the prescribed limitation periods as matter of course. In the Random House Dictionary, 2nd Ed discretion is defined as ""The power or right to decide or act according to one's own judgement"". In my view, had found in favour of the plaintiff and disallowed the defence under the Limitation of Actions Act would have abdicated my statutory duty to exercise discretion. [22] Accordingly, the plaintiff's application to disallow the defence under the Limitations of Actions Act is denied and the action fails on that ground. [23] Since this disposes of the entire action deem it unnecessary to rule upon the other preliminary matters which counsel addressed in their submissions. [24] In the result, the plaintiff's action is dismissed. Costs will follow the cause. If necessary, will accept submissions from counsel respecting quantum of costs. [25] Judgement Accordingly",d_2004nssc196.txt,"The plaintiff brought an action against the defendants for breach of contract in regard to the defendants' refusal to return to her the substantial security deposit that she paid as part of a motel lease.
After being clearly told that the money would not be returned, she waited 9 years before commencing the action.
The plaintiff applied for an order disallowing the defendants' limitation defence.
Application to disallow the limitation defence dismissed; plaintiff's action dismissed.
The plaintiff's evidence did not show any valid reason for such a lengthy delay and the defendants thought that all outstanding issues with the plaintiff had long since been settled.
Not only was there a presumption that the evidence would now be less cogent than it would have been, but the defendants' storage warehouse was destroyed by fire 3 years ago resulting in the loss of many old records, including those relating to the motel."

Christopher Lee Rhyno Respondent Judge: The Honourable Justice Arthur J. LeBlanc Heard: January 15, 2004, in Halifax, Nova Scotia Counsel: Kimberly A. Rhyno, self for the Petitioner Christopher L. Rhyno, self for the Respondent By the Court: [1] The petitioner, Kimberly Guy, seeks a divorce from Christopher Rhyno. She also seeks custody, child support (with payment for extraordinary expenses), a division of matrimonial assets and an order directing that Mr. Rhyno’s equity in the matrimonial home be postponed until the youngest child is 19 years old. She proposes to sell the home and put the proceeds – together with a new mortgage – toward the purchase of a new home. In his counter-petition, Mr. Rhyno seeks an equal division of the matrimonial assets and joint custody of the children, with Ms. Guy having primary care and himself having liberal access. [2] The parties were married on August 20, 1983. They first separated on April 24, 2002. After an attempted reconciliation they finally separated prior to December 1, 2002. have determined that there is no possibility of reconciliation and the divorce is granted as result of permanent breakdown of the marriage pursuant to paragraph 8(2)(a) of the Divorce Act. THE PARTIES’ CIRCUMSTANCES [3] Ms. Guy works as commission retail sales agent for Whacky Wheatleys. In 2002 she earned total income of $33,135.30 [2002 tax return summary, line 150] and in 2003 she earned $27,147.14 [gross, pay stub dated December 15, 2003]. [4] Mr. Rhyno is carpenter. He earned $33,135.00 in 2002. In 2003 he received income from three sources: Employment Insurance ($4,915.00 gross), Force Construction Limited ($13,253.76) [$12, 704.64 plus $549.12 for the last two weeks of 2003, based on pay stubs dated December 13 and 20, 2003] and T.P. Pulsifer Construction ($2,890.49) [beginning December 30, 2002]. Thus his total income in 2003 was $21,059.25. [5] Mr. Rhyno did not provide an updated statement of financial information, but reviewed his monthly expenses at the hearing: Line of credit payment $250.00 Telephone $80.00 Taxes $50.00 Heat $80.00 Wood $35.00 Vehicle $400.00 Children’s allowance $50.00 Alcohol $75.00 House repairs $100.00 Clothing $50.00 Parking and tolls $30.00 Drugs and dental $25.00 Gifts $25.00 Child support $706.00 ($500.00 while unemployed) [6] Mr. Rhyno is living common-law. His common-law spouse works outside the home as caregiver for elderly people. She pays for the groceries. Mr. Rhyno said he will likely need to replace his vehicle within the next year, and said his current vehicle has little or no value. Therefore his motor vehicle expenses will increase substantially. He said there is also potential problem with the septic tank at his home. CUSTODY AND ACCESS [7] There are four children of the marriage: Nicholas Roland, born March 31, 1987; Jason Christopher, born April 5, 1989; Jeremy Thomas, born June 27, 1993; and Lucas Tanner, born November 29, 1994. At the time of separation Ms. Guy had care and custody of the children. She sought custody of all four children in the petition for divorce. Mr. Rhyno sought joint custody, with primary care and control to Ms. Guy. However, Nicholas, the eldest son, has been living with his father following an incident with his mother that resulted in recognizance against him to keep the peace. Ms. Guy seeks custody of the three younger sons. [8] The parties have advised me that Nicholas is undergoing anger management counselling, although Mr. Rhyno has suggested that Nicholas is unwilling to attend because the sessions are not actually anger management. Any future counselling for Nicholas will be arranged by Mr. Rhyno, with the costs paid by Ms. Guy. Mr. Rhyno should be consulted with respect to the schedule and the contents of the program being offered. [9] I order joint custody of all four children to Mr. Rhyno and Ms. Guy. Mr. Rhyno will have primary care and control of Nicholas, while Ms. Guy will have primary care and control of the three younger children. Ms. Guy will provide Mr. Rhyno with information concerning the three younger children’s health and education. In the event that the children require major medical attention Mr. Rhyno will be notified. Mr. Rhyno will also be notified of all parent-teacher meetings involving the children in Ms. Guy’s care, so that he too can attend those meetings. Mr. Rhyno is required to provide Ms. Guy with information of Nocholas’ health and education and if any major medical attention is required. [10] Insofar as access is concerned, Mr. Rhyno will have access to the three children in Ms. Guy’s custody on Saturdays. He advises that more time than this is not possible due to the demands of his work during the summer and fall. There have not been dates set for Mr. Rhyno to visit with the children at Christmas. He would like to see them during the days when they are on March break. If the parties are unable to arrange an acceptable schedule for access visits at Christmas or March break, they are free to apply to the Court to fix schedule. Given the particularly strained relationship between Ms. Guy and Nicholas, make no direction concerning access to Nicholas by Ms.Guy. [11] Ms. Guy advised the Court that there is no communication with Mr. Rhyno regarding access, and no advance notice. Although there appears to be some strain in the relationship, this should not interfere with Mr. Rhyno’s reasonable access with reasonable notice. CHILD SUPPORT [12] Mr. Rhyno is required to pay child support for the three children in Ms. Guy’s care based on the federal Child Support Guidelines. Based on his income for 2003 of $21,059.25 he is required to pay $401.20 [$400 2.04% of $59.25] per month. Ms. Guy must pay support for the one child in Mr. Rhyno’s care. Her 2003 income was $27, 147.14. Her amount payable under the federal Child Support Guidelines is $235.29 per month [$234 .88% of $147.14]. Section of the federal Child Support Guidelines provides that “[w]here each spouse has custody of one of more children, the amount of child support order is the difference between the amount that each spouse would otherwise pay if child support order were sought against each of the spouses.” Accordingly, pursuant to the Federal Child Support Guidelines direct that each parent pay their respective amounts payable to the Maintenance Enforcement Program. [13] Ms. Guy also seeks payment for various special and extraordinary child care expenses. Special or extraordinary expenses are covered by section of the federal Child Support Guidelines. Subsections 7(1) and (2) state: Special or extraordinary expenses 7.(1) In child support order the court may, on either spouse’s request, provide for an amount to cover all or any portion of the following expenses, which expenses may be estimated, taking into account the necessity of the expenses in relation to the child’s best interests and the reasonableness of the expense in relation to the means of the spouses and those of the child and to the family’s spending pattern prior to the separation: (a) child care expenses incurred as result of the custodial parent’s employment, illness, disability or education or training for employment; (b) that portion of the medical and dental insurance premiums attributable to the child; (c) health-related expenses that exceed insurance reimbursement by at least $100 annually, including orthodontic treatment, professional counselling provided by psychologist, social worker, psychiatrist or any other person, physiotherapy, occupational therapy, speech therapy and prescription drugs, hearing aids, glasses and contact lenses; (d) extraordinary expenses for primary or secondary school education or for any other educational programs that meet the child’s particular needs; (e) expenses for post-secondary education; and (f) extraordinary expenses for extracurricular activities. Sharing of expense (2) The guiding principle in determining the amount of an expense referred to in subsection (1) is that the expense is shared by the spouses in proportion to their respective incomes after deducting from the expense, the contribution, if any, from the child. [14] In her submissions, Ms. Guy seeks additional child support payments for special and extraordinary child care expenses: Cubs: $75.00 per child plus $2.00 for each weekly meeting; Child care expenses: $4,653.60 (day care); Orthodontic treatment for Jason Rhyno: $4,740.00 [based on estimate dated January 5, 2004](of which $500.00 has already been incurred); Back-to-school costs for the 2003-2004 school year: $1460.36; Health and dental plan:$440.82 [estimate for 2004, dated January 8, 2004]; Family medical and drug plan expenses for herself and the children” $120.00; Extra dental expenses for 2003: $80.20.In total, these expenses amount to more than $14,000.00 per year. While necessary, these expenses must be reasonable and may not be incurred in vacuum. [15] Ms. Guy said the two youngest children have been members of cubs since before the separation. Mr. Rhyno agreed. [16] Ms. Guy said the orthodontic expenses are required for one child, and provided summary of the expenses that have already been incurred, as well as an estimate of the expenses necessary to complete the treatment. Her current medical plan does not cover orthodontic expenses. Mr. Rhyno said it would be impossible for him to contribute proportionately to these expenses, as he only receives salary that meets his necessities of life. am satisfied that this expenditure is necessary but have strong concerns as to whether Mr. Rhyno can contribute. [17] As to the school expenses, these were borne by Ms. Guy in 2002 and 2003. The figure of $1460.36 was incurred in 2003. am satisfied that this was legitimate expense for the children’s clothing and supplies, and am satisfied that this expense was in fact incurred. Given the ages of the children, this will be recurring expense. [18] Ms. Guy presented series of invoices for childcare expenses in 2003, amounting to total of nearly $4,500.00. She said she needs child care services for three days per week while she is working when the children are home from school, as well as one night when she is required to work, and during the summer holidays when the children are not in school. She does not require childcare on Friday evenings, when the children are with Mr. Rhyno, and there is question of how much child care she would require if the children were with their father more often. However, due to the demands of his work, and apart from periods when he is laid off, Mr. Rhyno’s only chances to be with the children are overnight on Wednesdays and Fridays. He said he is likely to be laid off in March, and would be prepared to have the children with him during the day. He agreed to return the children to their mother’s home at determined hour. Mr. Rhyno suggested that the day care expenses were exaggerated, but did not substantiate this claim other than by second-hand statements upon which the Court cannot rely. Without evidence to the contrary, must conclude that the child care expenses are legitimate. Though the expenses may seem high, Ms. Guy explained the need for the expense and the basis upon which it was paid. Further, this expense covers three children. [19] Ms. Guy provided written confirmation from her employer that the dependent health and dental coverage for herself and the four children with Great West Life cost approximately $450.00 per year ($453.54 in 2003 and an estimated $440.82 in 2004). She did not provide the cost for single coverage. will provisionally treat the amount for the children as about two-thirds of this amount, about $300.00 per year. [20] In determining the appropriate level of special and extraordinary expenses, must also consider any tax benefits or credits. Subsection 7(3) of the federal Child Support Guidelines states: In determining the amount of an expense referred to in subsection (1), the court must take into account any subsidies, benefits or income tax deductions or credits relating to the expense, and any eligibility to claim subsidy, benefit or income tax deduction or credit relating to the expense. [21] Ms. Guy confirmed that she was receiving child tax credit payments of between $7,500.00 and $8,000.00 annually. Mr. Rhyno said he is not credited with any of this payment despite the fact that he has care and custody of Nicholas. am satisfied that Ms. Guy receives Child Tax Credit amounting to $7,500.00. This is adequate to cover the cost of Cubs, child care, back-to-school expenses and medical expenses (including extra medical coverage), with small amount left over to go towards orthodontic expenses. [22] also find that Mr. Rhyno does not have the means to meet all of the ongoing special and extraordinary expenses that are not covered by the Child Tax Credit. have examined his budget carefully and conclude that his expenses are reasonable. He is meeting basic expenses. It would be imprudent on my part to order Mr. Rhyno to pay extraordinary expenses that he simply cannot meet. Mr. Rhyno said that when the couple was living together and relying entirely on his income there was no possibility that they could afford the orthodontic treatment. However, am satisfied that the payment for orthodontic treatment, to the extent that it is not met by the Child Tax Credit, can be paid from the “children’s fund”, and direct Mr. Rhyno to provide his consent in writing to the withdrawal from this account sufficient funds to meet the payment for orthodontic expenses. am also satisfied that he should contribute to the costs of preparing the children for the school year in an appropriate amount, namely 43 per cent of such expenses on an annual basis. [23] All child support payments will be made to the Maintenance Enforcement Program. The parties will exchange income tax returns and notices of assessment each year no later than June 1, commencing June 1, 2004. PROPERTY DIVISION [24] The parties have the following matrimonial assets and debts: Assets matrimonial home $105,000.00 RRSP (Guy) $11,799.62 (as of beginning of 2003) RRSP (Rhyno) $12,936.14 (as of March 31, 2003; $14,022.74 at beginning of 2003) Trust fund $7,625.81 (as of March 31, 2003) Debts Line of credit $35,733.37 (as of November 30, 2003) [25] Ms. Guy is living in the matrimonial home in Hubbards, Nova Scotia, with the three younger children. Mr. Rhyno lives in mobile home about seven kilometres away, with Nicholas in his care. The parties agree on the value of the matrimonial home. Mr. Rhyno does not claim any adjustment for the value of the furnishings in the matrimonial home, as he has retained tools and skidoos. [26] The matrimonial home is paid for, with the exception of the outstanding line of credit. Since the separation, Ms. Guy has paid all the monthly payments on the common line of credit, which is secured by first mortgage on the matrimonial home, except for couple of payments made by Mr. Rhyno. [27] Each party will keep their own vehicle. One vehicle was purchased at the time of an attempted reconciliation, with money supplied from line of credit. There is still money owing on the vehicle. Mr. Rhyno claims that Ms. Guy should pay $4000.00 more on the line of credit loan by virtue of the fact that the vehicle she retained is worth twice the amount of the vehicle he retained. [28] Mr. Rhyno has line of credit, which he incurred in order to buy trailer to live in. The balance was $10,011.51 on May 27, 2003. He was paying $250.00 per month to retire this debt. [29] The parties will each retain their own RRSPs. [30] At the hearing Mr. Rhyno indicated that he was prepared to stay his interest in the matrimonial home until the youngest child turns 21 years of age. Ms. Guy indicated an interest in moving to new area where the children would be eligible for scholarships under the “Shatford Trust Fund.” This move would require her to sell the matrimonial home and buy (or build) new house. The cost would be substantial, approximately $235,000.00. The Court was not provided with any written estimates of the expenditure. There would also be some risk, as there would be first mortgage of not less than $70,000. This amount would have to be paid out or new mortgage registered against the property with funds flowing to Mr. Rhyno. But there is presently line of credit secured by mortgage on the matrimonial home in the amount of about $34,000.00. This represents substantial differential with new mortgage that would be required to provide new home for Ms. Guy and the three children. [31] I am prepared to order that Mr. Rhyno’s interest in the matrimonial home be postponed until the youngest child is 21 years old if that child is attending university. However, will not order that his interest be postponed in order to permit Ms. Guy to acquire new house at new location, thereby reducing his equity in the matrimonial home. Admittedly, new home would probably have significantly greater value than the existing one, but at the present time there is net value in the existing home of approximately $70,000.00, while there would be net value of about $55,000.00 in new home after accounting for the $70,000.00 mortgage. [32] acknowledge that the children might lose the opportunity to obtain certain university scholarships if they continue to live in the present location, but there is no certainty that they will either attend university or qualify for scholarships even if they do move. The approach suggested by Ms. Guy would require crystal ball-gazing and would put Mr. Rhyno’s equity at risk. Given Ms. Guy’s income, mortgage of $70,000.00 would be substantial payment, even at current mortgage rates. The indebtedness in respect of the matrimonial home would be in excess of $70,000.00, and when the youngest child is 21 years old it will likely still be in the range of $60-$65,000.00. Ms. Guy’s response that she would be able to negotiate the amount and pay out Mr. Rhyno’s equity at that time would mean that she would require mortgage of more $100,000.00 in order to have sufficient funds with which to pay out Mr. Rhyno’s equity. [33] Therefore am not prepared to grant Ms. Guy’s request to postpone Mr. Rhyno’s interest in the matrimonial home so that she can buy new home. Put another way, it would not be practical to require Mr. Rhyno to wait for his equity on the precarious condition that Ms. Guy would be able to raise an additional $35,000.00 through mortgage renewal, when she is ten years older and may or may not be employed. agree with the position taken by Mr. Rhyno on this issue. OPTIONS PROPOSED BY MS. [34] In her final submissions, Ms. Guy proposed several options. One suggestion required Mr. Rhyno to sign over the children’s trust account to be used to pay special or extraordinary expenses until that fund is dissipated. Then the parties would pay for these expenses in proportion to their respective incomes. second option would have Mr. Rhyno sign over his equity in the matrimonial home, and Ms. Guy would release him from any claim for spousal support, extraordinary expenses and matrimonial debts. He would continue to pay child support. third option would have Ms. Guy pay the expenses and Mr. Rhyno’s share of the matrimonial home would come off the equalization payments upon termination of exclusive possession of the home. [35] Ms. Guy suggests there should be an unequal division of the equity in the matrimonial home in lieu of spousal support, to which she argues she is entitled because she stayed home and cared for the children throughout the marriage. She claimed that she lost her opportunity to enter the work force earlier and that she should therefore be compensated. She said she has agreed to waive any claim for spousal support in exchange for Mr. Rhyno postponing his equity in the matrimonial home in lieu of spousal support. If that is not possible, she wants spousal support of $25,000.00 to be paid from his equity in the matrimonial home. She maintains that living in the matrimonial home is cost-prohibitive. She says there is no full basement that can be accessed from inside the house, that the pipes freeze and that the house needs various repairs. She states in her submissions that she recently had to replace the oil tank at cost of $1,400.00, and expects to replace the septic system. [36] Ms. Guy appears to be arguing that Mr. Rhyno should be punished for the apparent cause of the separation. In assessing the issues of child and spousal support and division of property must not consider alleged misconduct of the parties; in fact am precluded from doing so by section 15.2(5) of the Divorce Act. [37] It appears that the parties maintained lifestyle prior to separation that was based on Mr. Rhyno’s earnings at that time. have no indication that those earnings were great deal more than what he is earning now, although they may have been more in the range of $30,000.00 than $22,000.00. Even at the higher level, it would have been difficult to maintain the same lifestyle. am not prepared to penalize Mr. Rhyno by confiscating his equity in the home. It is sufficient to postpone his equity until the youngest child is 21 years old. If Ms. Guy wishes to avail herself of a home in the area covered by the Shatford Trust Fund, she may do so, but she would be required to pay out Mr. Rhyno’s equity in the matrimonial home. [38] I conclude that the best solution is to freeze Mr. Rhyno’s equity in the matrimonial home at the amount owing on the line of credit when the parties separated, less $4,000.00 for the differential in the value of the vehicles retained by the parties. Ms. Guy would get the benefit of any principal reduction. [39] Ms. Guy will also have control of the trust fund, for which she will be required to account to Mr. Rhyno. [40] As result, no costs are awarded to either party.",d_2004nssf61.txt,"The wife sought a divorce, custody, child support, a division of matrimonial assets and an order directing that the husband's equity in the matrimonial home be postponed until the youngest child reached 19 years of age.

Applicant/Appellant- and -HER MAJESTY THE QUEEN RespondentM. Joseph Rizzetto for the appellantRobert C. Hagell for the respondentApplication Heard: October 20, 1995Decision Delivered: October 20, 1995BEFORE THE HONOURABLE JUSTICE ELIZABETH A. ROSCOE, IN CHAMBERSROSCOE, J.A.
: (orally, in Chambers)This is an application for bail pending appeal pursuant to s. 679(3) of the Criminal Code.
The hearing of the appeal from conviction is scheduled for March 20, 1996.
The Crown opposes the application for release.
The appellant was convicted by a jury of two counts of sexual assault against his teenaged nieces.
The trial judge remanded the appellant until his sentencing which is scheduled for December 4, 1995.
The grounds of appeal are:1.
That the learned trial judge erred in law in failing to permit the testimony of a school teacher, who had been falsely accused of making sexual comments to the complainant [S.L.]
by the complainant, [S.L.].
2.
That the learned trial judge erred in law in refusing to permit cross­- examination of the complainant, [A.L.
], on an earlier contradictory statement on audio/video cassette, without even having heard the contradictory statement.","The accused was convicted after trial of trafficking cocaine and breach of probation.
The issue was whether the accused could be sentenced to a custodial disposition under s. 39(1)(d) of the Youth Criminal Justice Act.
HELD: The youth was sentenced to deferred custody.
The amount of cocaine was significant, the accused was the only person involved in the offence, it was a fairly unsophisticated operation, the impact on the small northern community where the offence occurred was huge, it is aggravating that the drug being trafficked was cocaine, the accused has a previous criminal record for trafficking, the place where the offence was committed is a friendship centre and a popular gathering spot for youth in the area and the offence was committed for financial gain.
The Court held that the most aggravating factor on sentence was that the accused was less than one month into a probation order imposed for trafficking cocaine and was to stay out of the province.
The Court held that it was impossible to conclude that the probation order the accused had previously been placed on had in any way achieved its goal of rehabilitation and reintegration of the offender.","[0, 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 9, 7, 8, 11, 3, 12, 10, 13, 14]",628,"K.

JUDGMENT R. J. LANE, [1] B. L. was convicted after a trial held in La Ronge on February 21, 2013, of:Information Y379568: Possess a substance included in Schedule I, to wit, cocaine for the purpose of trafficking contrary to s. 5(2) of the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act, as well as,Information Y379569: Count 1- While bound by a youth probation order made by the Honourable Judge W. K. Tucker, of Saskatchewan Youth Court on the 20th day of August, 2012, did wilfully fail to comply with such order, to wit, keep the peace and be of good behaviour, contrary to s. 137 of the Youth Criminal Justice Act, andCount 2- While bound by a youth probation order made by the Honourable Judge W. K. Tucker, of Saskatchewan Youth Court on the 20th day of August, 2012, did wilfully fail to comply with such order, to wit, not attend within the Province of Saskatchewan unless with the prior permission of the Court, contrary to s. 137 the Youth Criminal Justice Act. [2] The issue before the Court is whether Mr. L. can be sentenced to a custodial disposition pursuant to s. 39(1)(d) of the Youth Criminal Justice Act. It has been conceded by the Crown, and have found that with this not being violent offence, and with his limited criminal record, Mr. L. is not subject to custody under either sections 39(1)(a), (b), or (c). The Ontario Court of Appeal in R. v. R.E.W., provided some guiding principles on the use of s. 39(1)(d) in the following quote:[1] The theme that runs through use of the term “exceptional” in both criminal case law and legislation, is that it is intended to describe the clearest of cases. Such cases include those where applying the normal rules would undermine the purpose of the legislation, where the exercise of the unusual power is necessary or required, and where the exercise of the unusual jurisdiction is capable of explanation. The wording of s. 39(1)(d) is consistent with this approach. The exceptional power to commit young person to custody is reserved for those circumstances where, in effect, any other order would undermine the purpose and principles of sentencing set out in s. 38. The analysis of s. 39(1)(d) must be set against the background of s. 38, which stresses the importance of interfering with young person’s liberty as little as possible. [3] That decision went on to summarize that the section must be narrowly interpreted because sections 39(1)(a), (b) and (c) already encompass most cases where custody would be expected. In addition, section 39(1)(d) is focussed solely on the circumstances of the offence, not the character or history of the offender. The circumstances of the offence must be so aggravating that nothing less than custody will satisfy the principles of sentencing contained in s. 38. The scheme of the YCJA suggests that the circumstances must be so extreme that, “anything less than custody would fail to reflect societal values”. An example would be when circumstances of the offence are shocking to the community. [4] Also the Supreme Court of Canada in R. v. B.W.P.,[2] clearly states that general deterrence is not sentencing factor to be considered by Court when dealing with charge under the YJCA. [5] There are numerous decisions from across Canada that deal with the application of s. 39(1)(d) of the YCJA, particularly in cases that involve conviction for possession for the purposes of trafficking or actual trafficking contrary to s. 5(1) of the CDSA, such as the case we have with Mr. L. [6] R. v. T. (C.S.), was case where larger quantities of more dangerous drugs were involved, more money was seized, and evidence existed of more structured drug trafficking operation than in the present case. The Court held in that case at paragraph 20 that:[3] While am obliged to the Crown for calling Officer Novak to provide insight in regard to this particular drug, its derivative and impact on our community, it seems to me that what we are dealing with in this case would equate to ordinary trafficking for lack of better description. don’t wish to minimize crack cocaine’s destructive nature and the dangers associated with its presence, use and distribution. But there is nothing am able to glean from these facts that would place this particular offence within the category of an exceptional case. [7] Also, the 2004 decision out of Ontario of R. v. F. (J.),[4] granted conditional discharge to youth who sold 83.32 grams of cocaine to undercover officers for $4,250.00. [8] On the other side of the coin we have number of cases where s. 39(1)(d) of the YCJA was applied, resulting in custodial dispositions for youth. [9] R. v. L. B.,[5] involved youth convicted of possession for the purposes of trafficking of cocaine. That youth had no prior record. He was part of “Dial-a-Dope” drug trafficking scheme that was large and well organized. The quantity of the cocaine involved in this case was about 3.8 grams of crack cocaine as well as 0.35 grams of cocaine powder. The street value was approximately $480.00. This youth was sentenced to six month deferred custody order. This case differs from Mr. L.’s case in that this case involves larger, more well organized operation than the evidence that was presented to describe Mr. L.’s operation. [10] R. v. J. B.,[6] involved youth trafficking in heroin. He had served nine months pre-trial custody. He had sold in excess of $10,000.00 worth of heroin on 13 different occasions. He had no prior criminal record and was sentenced to three month deferred custody order. [11] The decision of R. v. M. Q.,[7] was case of youth trafficking in heroin and cocaine. This youth had no record. The youth concentrated his sales mostly on geographic area that was frequented by youth. The Court found that the very existence of cocaine and heroin in the trafficking operation was itself an aggravating factor. Of greater significance though, is how strongly the Court viewed trafficking cocaine in areas frequented by youth. Judge K. Skilnick stated “I am satisfied that the trafficking in hard drugs in this community in location frequented by so many vulnerable youth, ought never be considered to be routine or usual.” This youth was sentenced to six month deferred custody order followed by 12 months probation. [12] It seems then that the following are factors the courts look at when considering sentence on s. 5(1) of the CDSA: 1) Quantity in this case Mr. L. had 76 grams of cocaine. According to Cst. Cam Graves, who was qualified as an expert to testify on the characteristics of drug operation as well as street values, the value of this much cocaine would depend on the quantities sold at particular time. He indicated that if it was sold by the ounce, the value would be between $3,800.00 and $5,050.00. He indicated that if it was sold at the 3.5 gram level, the street value would be between $5,500.00 and $6,600.00. He indicated that if the cocaine was sold by the gram, the street value would be between $6,080.00 and $7,600.00. Suffice to say that the amount of cocaine that Mr. L. had possession of was significant. 2) The role of the accused in the trafficking operation - in this case the evidence would seem to indicate that Mr. L. was the one and only person involved, although one would certainly suspect the driver of the motor vehicle knew what was going on. 3) Sophistication and size of the operation - the evidence seemed to indicate a fairly unsophisticated operation being conducted out of the back seat of a vehicle. 4) The impact on the community - cocaine has a huge impact on small northern communities. Over my 34 years as defence lawyer, Crown prosecutor and judge, the most violent crimes ever saw almost always involved ingestion of cocaine together with alcohol. 5) Type of drug involved - this was cocaine, and as indicated in the decision of R. v. M.Q., the fact that cocaine is the drug being trafficked, is in itself an aggravating factor. 6) The presence of weapons there were no weapons in this case. 7) Previous criminal record - in this situation the accused had one prior conviction of possession for the purpose of trafficking in cocaine, although under s. 39(1)(d) the criminal record of the accused is in general, not to be considered. 8) Is the area of the drug trafficking activity frequented by young people - in my years of living in the Town of La Ronge, Saskatchewan, I easily conclude that Kikinaahk Friendship Centre is the most popular gathering place for older children and adolescents in the district. It is here that the accused was cruising around in his vehicle with the cocaine in the back seat. 9) Was the accused motivated by financial gain or the need to feed an addiction while the accused was found with one package of cocaine on his person, he also had $660.00 cash. There was no evidence that this activity of the accused was designed in order to feed an addiction to cocaine. That being said, I am convinced beyond a reasonable doubt that the prime motivation behind the drug trafficking was financial gain. [13] So, the issue here is whether there is something about the circumstances of this offence, as opposed to the character or the history of the offender, that are so aggravating that nothing less than custody will satisfy the principles of sentencing set out in s. 38 of the YCJA. In other words, is this case where anything less than custody would fail to reflect societal values, or would non-custodial disposition shock the community of La Ronge and district in particular, and the people of Saskatchewan in general. [14] Section 38(1) sets out the purpose of sentencing options under s. 42 as follows: (1) The purpose of sentencing under section 42 (youth sentences) is to hold young person accountable for an offence through the imposition of just sanctions that have meaningful consequences for the young person and that promote his or her rehabilitation and reintegration into society, thereby contributing to the long‑term protection of the public. [15] Sections 38(2)(a) to (d) give general guidance to sentencing Court as follows: (2) youth justice court that imposes youth sentence on young person shall determine the sentence in accordance with the principles set out in section and the following principles: (a) the sentence must not result in punishment that is greater than the punishment that would be appropriate for an adult who has been convicted of the same offence committed in similar circumstances; (b) the sentence must be similar to the sentences imposed in the region on similar young persons found guilty of the same offence committed in similar circumstances; (c) the sentence must be proportionate to the seriousness of the offence and the degree of responsibility of the young person for that offence; (d) all available sanctions other than custody that are reasonable in the circumstances should be considered for all young persons, with particular attention to the circumstances of aboriginal young persons. [16] Then s. 38(2)(e) sets out what sentence MUST be: (e) subject to paragraph (c), the sentence must (i) be the least restrictive sentence that is capable of achieving the purpose set out in subsection (1), (ii) be the one that is most likely to rehabilitate the young person and reintegrate him or her into society, and (iii) promote sense of responsibility in the young person, and an acknowledgement of the harm done to victims and the community. [17] Section 38(3) sets out just what youth justice court shall take into account: (3) In determining youth sentence, the youth justice court shall take into account (a) the degree of participation by the young person in the commission of the offence; (in this case it looks like Mr. L. is the only player, other than perhaps the involvement of his driver.) (b) the harm done to victims and whether it was intentional or reasonably foreseeable; (as previously indicated in this decision have practiced criminal defence work in northern Saskatchewan for over 33 years and substances such as cocaine have inflicted upon users, their families and others, devastating effect. Mr. L. should have been able to foresee that effect.) (c) any reparation made by the young person to the victim or the community; (the accused was on probation order for conviction for possession for the purposes of trafficking in cocaine that said conviction having been entered only month before this particular incident. Rather than reparation, the accused has re-offended in the same way.) (d) the time spent in detention by the young person as result of the offence; (Mr. L. has been in remand for approximately one month.) (e) the previous findings of guilt of the young person; (in my opinion this is not relevant to sentencing under s. 39(1)(d)); and (f) any other aggravating and mitigating circumstances related to the young person or the offence that are relevant to the purpose and principles set out in this section: 1. Northern Saskatchewan communities are generally small communities and are plagued with drug problems resulting in much property damage, loss and violent crime. 2. This is cocaine as referred to in the case previously referred to as R. v. M.Q., cocaine itself is an aggravating factor. 3. Mr. L. was cruising around Kikinaahk Friendship Centre which is the main gathering place for older children and adolescents in La Ronge. 4. There is little to no evidence that the motivation behind the drug trafficking operation for Mr. L. was anything but for financial gain. [18] To me however, the most aggravating factor that has the potential to move this offence into the exceptional case category is the fact that Mr. L. was only one month into a probation order after having been convicted of possession for the purposes of trafficking cocaine on August 20, 2012. One of the terms of that probation order was that he was to stay out of the Province of Saskatchewan unless he had the permission of the Court. assume Provincial Court Judge Tucker did not want this Alberta resident coming back to La Ronge in particular and Saskatchewan in general to sell narcotics. Not only did Mr. L. return to La Ronge, Saskatchewan, but he did so to continue selling cocaine. How could conclude that this probation order has in any way achieved the goal set out in s. 38(2)(e)(i), that is, be the sentence that is most likely to rehabilitate Mr. L. and reintegrate him into society. Further, how could possibly conclude that this probation order has promoted sense of responsibility in Mr. L. and how do we see his acknowledgment of the harm done to the community of La Ronge by his actions, when, within one month, he is back in La Ronge, Saskatchewan, selling cocaine. [19] As referred to in R. v. R.E.W.,[8] cannot imagine the citizens of La Ronge and district, in particular, and the citizens of Saskatchewan in general experiencing anything but shock at this turn of events shock that threatens widely shared community values. [20] Clearly, his previous sentence of probation as imposed by Judge Tucker on August 20, 2012, based on a conviction of possession for the purposes of trafficking in cocaine, has failed to promote his rehabilitation or his reintegration into society. [21] In summary the aggravating factors that, in my view, trigger the application of s. 39(1)(d) are as follows: 1) The fact that northern Saskatchewan is plagued by drug problems resulting in significant property damage, loss and violent crime; 2) The drug being possessed for the purpose of trafficking in this case is cocaine an aggravating factor in and of itself. Cocaine is highly addictive and very often results in horrifying violence; 3) Mr. L. was cruising around Kikinaahk Friendship Centre which is the main gathering place for older children and adolescents in La Ronge; 4) There is little to no evidence that the motivation behind the drug trafficking operation for Mr. L. was anything but for financial gain; and 5) The fact that Mr. L. was only one month into probation order after having been convicted of possession for the purposes of trafficking in cocaine, one of the terms of which was to stay out of the Province of Saskatchewan. Notwithstanding that probation order, the accused is back in La Ronge, Saskatchewan, possessing cocaine for the purposes of trafficking. [22] Thus find Mr. L. is subject to custody. What sentence is appropriate? He has served approximately thirty days in remand. don’t feel he would benefit by any more time in actual custody. do feel that deferred custody and supervision order is appropriate. I therefore place the accused on a six month deferred custody and supervision order on all three counts that he has been convicted on. The terms are the following: a) Keep the peace and be of good behaviour; b) Appear before the Youth Justice Court when required by the Court to do so; c) Report to the Youth Worker at La Ronge Youth Workers immediately upon release and thereafter be under the supervision of the Youth Court Worker, or person designated by the Youth Justice Court; d) Inform the Court Worker immediately upon being arrested by the police; e) Report to the police or any named individual as instructed by the Youth Worker; f) Inform the clerk of the Youth Justice Court or the Youth Worker of your residential address on release, and after release, report immediately to the Youth Worker any: i) Change in that address; ii) Change in your normal occupation, including employment, vocational or educational training and volunteer work; iii) Change in your family and financial situation; iv) Change that may reasonably be expected to affect your ability to comply with the conditions of the Order; g) Must not own, possess, or have the control of any weapon, ammunition, prohibited ammunition, prohibited device, or explosive substance; h) Comply with such reasonable instructions as the Youth Worker considers necessary in respect of any condition of the conditional supervision order to prevent breach of that condition or order, protect society and in addition: i) Report to the Youth Worker forthwith and be under the supervision of the Youth Worker; ii) Reside at residence specified of and in writing by the Youth Worker and do not change that residence without the prior written permission of the Youth Worker or the Court; iii) Not possess or consume any controlled substances as defined by the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act, except as prescribed by medical doctor; and iv) Not possess cell phone during the period of your deferred custody. [23] In addition, authorize the taking of bodily substance for forensic DNA analysis pursuant to s. 487.051(3) of the Criminal Code. In addition, make mandatory prohibition order under s. 51(1) of the Youth Criminal Justice Act where the offender is prohibited from having in his possession any firearm, crossbow, prohibited weapon, restricted weapon, prohibited device, ammunition, prohibited ammunition, or explosive substance, for period of two years from the date of this order, pursuant to s. 51(1) of the Youth Criminal Justice Act.

In assessing all of the evidence the judge recognized that the ultimate issue was not credibility, but proof to a criminal standard.

Counsel: Luke A. Craggs, for the appellant Jennifer A. MacLellan, for the respondent Reasons for judgment: (Orally)[1] After a short trial before Nova Scotia Supreme Court Justice Peter M.S.
Bryson (as he then was), the appellant was convicted of robbery and sentenced to four years’ imprisonment.
[3] The crime took place in a room with only three persons present.","HELD: The accused was not guilty of either charge.
Although the accused was lawfully stopped, the roadside demand was valid and the accused declined to exercise his right to counsel on two occasions following his arrest, the observation period at the detachment was not conducted properly.
The officer was sometimes focused on other things.
As the observation period comprised part and parcel of a breath test, the breathalyzer test was not properly administered and the Crown could not rely on the accuracy of the readings.","[1, 2, 5, 3, 4, 6, 7, 9, 10, 8, 11, 12, 15, 18, 16, 21, 14, 17]",72,"IN THE PROVINCIAL COURT OF SASKATCHEWAN Citation: 2017 SKPC 077 Date: September 12, 2017 Information: 90130120 Location: Rosetown Between: Her Majesty the Queen and Brayden Lee Weese Appearing: Robin Ritter For the Crown Ron Piche For the Accused JUDGMENT M.M. BANIAK, [1] The accused, Brayden Lee Weese, was charged as follows: 1) while his ability to operate motor vehicle was impaired by alcohol did operate motor vehicle, contrary to s. 255(1) and s. 253(1)(a) of the Criminal Code; and 2) having consumed alcohol in such quantity that the concentration thereof in his blood exceeded eighty milligrams of alcohol in one hundred millilitres of blood did operate motor vehicle, contrary to s. 255(1) and s. 253(1)(b) of the Criminal Code. [2] The Crown’s first witness was Constable Blair De Bruin, an eight year member with the RCMP stationed in Rosetown. [3] On December 18, 2016, he was doing traffic enforcement on highway #31 near Herschel, Saskatchewan, village some thirty kilometres from Rosetown. Around 00:47 hours he noticed vehicle travelling on the main road towards them. When the oncoming vehicle was about 100 150 metres from the police vehicle it veered off the main road and down what Constable De Bruin called “goat trail”. This action triggered response from the police officer: “I stopped the vehicle because it went down the trail.” He also testified that he stopped the vehicle for the purpose of checking for driver’s licence, registration and sobriety. [4] Once he pulled the vehicle over, he noticed an open case of beer in the backseat. The accused, who was the driver, had blood shot eyes. His speech was slurred. He advised Constable De Bruin that he drank three beer. [5] At this point, Constable De Bruin testified “I formed the grounds to suspect that he had alcohol in his body he said his last drink was about five minutes before stopped him. had to wait fifteen minutes before could take sample into the ASD.” [6] The relevant time frame is: formulated grounds at 00:51 hours; ASD demand at 00:56 hours; ASD test administered at 01:06; accused place under arrest at 01:07 hours; breath test 01:08 hours; and right to counsel 01:09 hours. [7] The accused indicated that he understood his right to counsel, but that he did not wish to call lawyer. [8] Constable De Bruin departed the village of Herschel at 1:13 a.m. and arrived at the Rosetown detachment at 1:35 a.m. [9] Once at the detachment, the accused was asked once again if he wanted to call lawyer and he again declined to do so. [10] The area where the accused was held during the observation periods was monitored by surveillance cameras. Constable De Bruin testified that he did not see or hear the accused vomit or do anything that might have compromised or elevated the readings by mouth alcohol. He was also of the view that since both readings were 100 milligrams of alcohol in 100 millilitres of blood this was indicative of no mouth alcohol. [11] During cross-examination, Constable De Bruin acknowledged that the main reason he stopped the accused is because he went down goat trail”, but not that he was also checking for licence, registration and sobriety. He also testified that he would not give the accused his Charter rights to counsel prior to the first ASD test. [12] Constable De Bruin testified that he conducted the observation of the accused and that he did not hear any burps or belches. He also agreed with defence counsel that burp could be silent. He also acknowledged that he left the accused alone for short period of time and that he would not be able to see what happened during his absence. [13] Defence Exhibit D-2, which is video of the Rosetown Detachment hallway (the location where the accused was being observed) show that for period of time Constable De Bruin was attending to some paperwork at the counter. His back was to the accused. At one point he left the hallway location altogether and went into another room. In total, the accused was not observed for approximately two and one-half minutes. [14] During examination-in-chief, Constable De Bruin testified that the detection system on the breathalyzer instrument would indicate if there was mouth alcohol present at the time the test was being administered. [15] During cross-examination, he acknowledged that he is not sure if the detector is 100% accurate. Defence Exhibit D-3 is manual for the INTOX EC/IR 11 it is dated July 11, 2011 and that was the same manual that Constable De Bruin was familiar with: “this is the manual was trained on”. [16] Chapter of this manual deals with the observation period. Page of Chapter states in part as follows: While most breath testing instruments have methods to detect the presence of mouth alcohol in breath sample, they are not 100% effective. As such, it is important that continuous 15 minute observation period be conducted prior to the analysis of each breath sample to allow any alcohol which may be present in the mouth to dissipate [17] Immediately following this paragraph, is directive as to how proper observation period should be conducted: 1. Search the subject to ensure they do not have products containing alcohol on their person. Check the mouth of the subject and ensure it contains no foreign objects such as tobacco, gum, food or other unusual objects that may retain alcohol or present choking hazard. 2. Place the subject in the observer’s field of view and within close proximity where clues of consumption, burps or vomiting can be detected. 3. Observe the subject for at least 15 continuous minutes prior to each breath test, ensuring the subject does not drink any alcoholic beverages or other liquids, and does not place anything in their mouth, burp or vomit. 4. Restart the observation period if the subject is not maintained within close proximity and in the field of view of the observer or if the subject places anything in their mouth, burps or vomits. Position of the Parties [18] The Crown submits that the stop of the accused was proper and lawful. The police officer was checking for licence, registration and sobriety. Defence did not establish on balance of probabilities that this was not so. [19] Secondly, Crown argues that the accused was not deprived of his right to counsel during the time he was waiting to provide sample into the approved screening device as the fifteen minute wait was justified because the accused admitted to just having consumed an alcoholic beverage five minutes before being stopped. Moreover, the accused declined the opportunity to call a lawyer on two occasions after he was advised of his rights to counsel. [20] Finally, with respect to the observation period at the detachment, the Crown takes the position that it was conducted properly. The police officer never saw the accused put anything in his mouth; he never heard the accused burp or belch; and he was in close proximity to the accused. Further, both samples were 100 milligrams of alcohol in 100 millilitres of blood, and the breathalyzer instrument did not detect any mouth alcohol. [21] Defence, for its part, argues that the stop and subsequent detention of the accused was not lawful. Stopping someone “because he drove down goat trail” is not good reason, and the officer’s notes do not provide any other reasons for the stop. Defence further submits the accused’s s. 10(b) Charter rights were violated and relies on Saskatchewan (Attorney General) An[1]. [22] Thirdly, defence takes the position that the observation at the detachment was not properly conducted. The police officer had his back turned to the accused for some two and one half minutes; he actually went to another room for brief time leaving the accused unattended; and, accordingly, having regard to the Court of Queen’s Bench decision in By[2] [By], the Crown cannot rely on the presumption of accuracy in s. 258(1)(c) of the Criminal Code. Analysis 1) On the issue of whether the stop of the accused was lawful I find that it was. [23] The evidence from Constable De Bruin was that he essentially stopped the accused because he had turned off the street he was driving on to what appeared to be “goat trail”. He also testified that he wanted to check for licence, registration and sobriety. [24] Had the only evidence been that the accused was stopped because he turned off to road that resembled “goat trail”, and nothing more, defence’s position would have been stronger. Here, however, we also have evidence that Constable De Bruin wished to check for licence, registration and sobriety. [25] Section 209.1(1) of The Traffic Safety Act, SS 2004, T-18.1 [Act], authorized Constable De Bruin to stop Mr. Weese. Section 209.1(2) imposed an obligation on the driver to answer police officer’s questions with respect to the driver’s identity, address, birth date and whether the driver consumed any alcohol or drug which could affect the driver’s ability to safely operate motor vehicle. [26] Therefore, even if the “random stop” aspect of the Act violates s. of the Charter, it, nonetheless, is justified as reasonable limit pursuant to s. of the Charter.[3] [27] Orbanski[4] [Orbanski] gives police the authority to question driver about his alcohol consumption within the context of random stop authorised by the provisions of the Act. [28] On the issue of whether the accused was deprived of his s. 10(b) Charter rights while awaiting to provide sample into the approved screening device, find that he was not. [29] For while it is true that when roadside demand is made the driver is detained and as such his s. 10 Charter rights would be triggered, it does not follow that breach occurs when valid demand is made pursuant to s. 254(2) of the Criminal Code, as that is viewed as reasonable limit prescribed by law and justified under s. of the Charter.[5] [30] In Orbanski, supra, the Supreme Court held that if the demand is made forthwith, the right to counsel is suspended not only after, but before the demand. In paragraph 52 of Orbanski Charron J. states as follows: In my view, it logically follows from Thomsen that limit on the right to counsel is also prescribed during the roadside screening techniques utilized in these cases. If limit on the right to counsel is prescribed during compliance with s. 254(2) demand for sample for analysis in the roadside screening device, then the limit must necessarily be prescribed during the screening measures preceding the demand, conducted with the very objective of determining whether there is reasonable suspicion justifying the demand. [31] Defence relied on our Court of Queen’s Bench decision in An to support its argument that the accused’s s. 10(b) rights were violated. [32] In my view, An does not stand for the proposition that an accused’s s. 10(b) Charter rights must be implemented at roadside during the screening techniques in every instance. The facts in An are materially different from the facts in this case and are clearly distinguishable. [33] In An the police officer did not have the ASD with him and it was unclear when it would arrive. During this detention period, Mr. An used his cell phone to call his workplace. He also wanted to call his sister who was lawyer, but was not allowed to do so. In An the police officer was not in position to take the breath sample forthwith and could not know when the ASD would become available. Throughout, the police officer in An did not act with any sense of purpose or urgency. [34] This was not the case here. Constable De Bruin had the ASD with him and was ready to administer it forthwith and the reason he waited was because the accused advised him that he had just drank his last beer five minutes before the was stopped. Our Court of Queen’s Bench just recently held that it was incumbent on police officer to ask when the accused had his last drink and to delay the ASD test to ensure that 15 minutes had elapsed.[6] [35] Further, the accused in this case did not attempt to call anyone nor did he ask permission to do so. When he was advised of his rights to counsel after his arrest and demand for breath sample he declined to do so on two occasions. [36] Justice Barrington-Foote in An canvassed various decision of other courts on this issue and concluded at paragraph 45 as follows: These cases demonstrate that the question of whether the police must implement detainee’s s. 10(b) right at the roadside turns on the facts. non‑exhaustive list of the factors that courts have referred to includes the following: Did the police officer reasonably expect that the ASD would arrive before the detainee had reasonable opportunity to exercise his or her rights? Was phone readily available, and if so, did the officer know? Was it possible to provide the accused with privacy? What was the time of day? How much time actually elapsed between the time of the demand and the arrival of the ASD, the arrival of the ASD and the administration of the test? Did the detainee say he or she did not wish to call counsel at the roadside: Veikle, 2016 SKQB 173 (CanLII)? [37] Based on the above, find that the accused’s s. 10(b) Charter rights were not violated. However, even if they were, am of the view that following the Grant Analysis, the breach was of such minor nature as not to favour exclusion pursuant to s. 24(2) of the Charter. 2) Was the observation period at the detachment conducted properly? [38] The Crown takes the position that the observation was conducted properly. The police officer was in close proximity to the accused, and, further, did not hear the accused burp or belch at any time during the time he was observed. As such the Crown is entitled to the presumption of accuracy as per s. 258(1)(c) of the Criminal Code. [39] Defence relies on the By decision and submits that since the observation period was not properly conducted the Crown cannot rely on the presumption. [40] Defence Exhibit D-2, the Rosetown detachment cell block video, shows that the police officer had his back turned to the accused for approximately 2½ minutes. During that time he was attending to some paperwork on the counter and did not appear to be paying much attention to the accused. At one point he actually left the hallway where the accused was sitting to go to another room. The video had no audio component to it, and Constable De Bruin agreed during cross-examination that burp could be silent. [41] While it is true that is not necessary that the police officer look “eyeball to eyeball” at the accused for the entire duration of the observation period, it is necessary that he pay careful attention to the accused and closely observe his behaviour. Close proximity, without more, is not sufficient to constitute proper observation. [42] There is sufficient factual similarity between By and this case that it cannot be distinguished on the facts. In both cases the police officer was attending to other tasks and not focussing on the accused. In both cases the police officer was actually absent for period of time from the accused’s presence. [43] Based on the above, I find that the observation period was not conducted properly. According to By, if it is established that the observation period was not properly conducted, then that constitutes evidence that the breathalyzer test was not properly administered, for By holds that the observation period comprises part and parcel of the breath test itself. [44] Being bound by the decision in By, I find that the Crown cannot rely on the presumption of accuracy and rely on the accuracy of the readings on the Certificate of Qualified Technician. [45] Accordingly, I find the accused not guilty of count 2, over .08. The evidence does not support a finding of guilt on count #1. M.M.

No. 02702 IN THE SUPREME COURT OF NOVA SCOTIA APPEAL DIVISION Clarke, C.J.N.S.; Hallett and Chipman, JJ.A. BETWEEN: GLENN BRIAN BOURGEOIS and HER MAJESTY THE QUEEN Respondent The Appellant in Person Gordon S. Gale, Q.C. for the Respondent Appeal Heard: November 24, 1992 Judgment Delivered: November 26, 1992 THE COURT: Appeal dismissed from sentences to be served consecutively of four years (armed robbery) and one year (weapons) per reasons for judgment of Clarke, C.J.N.S., Hallett and Chipman, JJ.A. concurring. CLARKE, C.J.N.S.; The appellant, Mr. Bourgeois, was charged with two offences. The first, generally known as armed robbery, was contrary to s. 343(d) of the Criminal Code which reads: 343. Every one commits robbery who ... (d) steals from any person while armed with an offensive weapon or imitation thereof. The maximum penalty is imprisonment for life (s. 344). The second offence, generally called unlawful use and possession of firearm, was contrary to s. 85(1)(a) of the Code which provides: (1) Every one who uses firearm (a) while committing or attempting to commit an indictable offence, ... whether or not he causes or means to cause bodily harm to any person as result thereof, is guilty of an indictable offence and liable to imprisonment... The minimum penalty in the case of first offence is not less than one year and the maximum is not more than fourteen years (s. 85(1)(c)). The circumstances arose from an armed robbery at store at Halifax. Both counsel for the Crown and the defence informed the trial judge that around 4:30 o'clock in the afternoon of the day of the robbery, Mr. Bourgeois was involved in conversation about the use of gun in the robbery of store in concert with another person. Mr. Bourgeois was in the store when the armed robbery occurred about 6:00 o'clock in the same afternoon, by another person, known to Mr. Bourgeois, entering the store masked and carrying hand gun. Later the hand gun used in the robbery and kit bag containing the clothes of the masked robber were found in Mr. Bourgeois' possession. Mr. Bourgeois pled guilty to each of the two offences with which he was charged. He was represented by lawyer who spoke on his behalf. He was sentenced to four years imprisonment for the armed robbery and one year for the weapons offence, to be served consecutively. Thus the total period of imprisonment is five years. In addition the trial judge imposed an order prohibiting Mr. Bourgeois from having possession of firearms, ammunition and explosives for ten years from the date of his release, as is provided by s. 100(1) of the Criminal Code. Mr. Bourgeois was 21 years old and the parent of one child when these offences were committed. He had prior record of several convictions, including dispositions entered by the Youth Court. He was on probation when the present offences occurred. This is an appeal against the sentences imposed by the trial judge. Although Mr. Bourgeois submits there were extenuating circumstances in his favour that should have detracted from his conviction, there is nothing that this court can do about that. He was represented by counsel. He pled guilty. After hearing the submissions made by Mr. Bourgeois' lawyer, and before he was sentenced, the trial judge gave Mr. Bourgeois an opportunity to make any further representations he wished. The record indicates none were made. That his counsel understood the law that made Mr. Bourgeois party to the offences is evidenced by his observation to the trial judge when he said: ""... Mr. Bourgeois is technically guilty of the two charges even though he was not actually the person who was holding the gun."" (Transcript, p. 9) The court has carefully reviewed the record in this matter and considered the submissions that have been made by both Mr. Bourgeois and counsel of the Crown. The trial judge considered the serious nature of the offences and the necessity of deterring this kind of criminal conduct. He took into account, as mitigating factor, that Mr. Bourgeois had pled guilty at ""virtually the first opportunity"". The lawyers for both Mr. Bourgeois and the Crown jointly recommended that the court impose sentences of three to four years for the armed robbery and one year for the weapons offence. Section 85(2) of the Criminal Code mandates the sentence for the weapons offence ""shall be served consecutively"". The trial judge, after reviewing the circumstances of the offences and the principles of sentencing applicable to them, accepted the recommendations advanced to the court and imposed the sentences which are now under appeal. In doing so, he committed no error. The sentences are consistent with the range that this court has approved in many of its judgments where armed robbery and weapons violations have occurred. These are crimes of violence where strongly deterrent sentences must be imposed. While granting leave to appeal, I would dismiss the appeal for the reasons given. C.J.N.S. Concurred in: Hallett, J.A.

LTD., body corporate, HER MAJESTY THE QUEEN, IN RIGHT OF THE PROVINCE OF NOVA SCOTIA and GUARDIAN INSURANCE COMPANY OF CANADA Respondent Ross H. Haynes for the Appellants Carman G. McCormick, Q.C. and David Farrar for the Respondent Appeal Heard: December 4, 1992 Judgment Delivered: December 4, 1992 THE COURT: Appeal dismissed with costs to the respondent to be taxed per reasons for judgment of Hallett, J.A.; Matthews and Freeman, JJ.A. concurring. The reasons for judgment of the Court were delivered orally by: HALLETT, J.A. This is an appeal from a decision of Richard, J. declaring that the respondent Guardian was not liable to contribute to payment of a fire loss that was insured against by the appellant Hartford. The Province of Nova Scotia had entered into contract with Fraser‑Brace for the construction of hospital. The contract allocated the risk for fire loss to Fraser‑Brace and required Fraser‑Brace to obtain fire insurance to protect the parties against fire loss. Hartford issued builder's risk policy to Fraser‑Brace; such policy includes coverage for loss caused by fire. The cover was just over $27,000,000.00. Fraser‑Brace contracted the electrical work to Delta; there was no requirement that Delta obtain fire insurance but due to misunderstanding by Delta it obtained builder's risk policy from Guardian. The coverage was just under $4,000,000.00. The named insured was Delta with loss, if any, payable to the Province. There was fire. Hartford sought contribution from Delta's insurer, Guardian. Without acknowledging liability Guardian paid some $400,000.00 to Hartford to facilitate progress payments to Delta by Fraser‑Brace. Guardian sued to recover its money with interest from Hartford on the basis that it was not liable to contribute. The learned trial judge found the Guardian policy had been issued under the mistaken belief by Delta that it was required to carry builder's risk insurance. The learned trial judge found that the building was never at the insured's risk; that the policy was void and that Guardian was not liable to contribute to the fire loss. He ordered Hartford to repay Guardian the advances with compound interest. Several issues have been raised on appeal. The appeal on the main issue ought to be dismissed. There is no evidence nor even suggestion that Delta caused the fire. Guardian had no obligation to Delta to pay the fire loss as Delta, under its subcontract with Fraser‑Brace, was never at risk for fire loss to the Province's property. The obligation to insure the risk had been allocated to Fraser‑Brace by the contract with the Province. As Delta did not cause the fire loss it had no liability to the Province or Fraser‑Brace for causing the fire loss. Delta was not at risk for the fire loss of the Province's property as there was no allocation of the fire risk to Delta by the contract documents. In summary, there was no tortious or contractual liability of Delta for which Guardian was required to respond as Delta's insurer. The Guardian policy provided that the insurance attached when the property became at the risk of the insured. In this case it never did. On these facts Guardian had no obligation to respond to under the terms of the policy issued to Delta. Furthermore, there was no contractual relationship between Guardian and the Province, nor between Guardian and Hartford which could give rise to any obligation on Guardian's part to contribute towards the fire loss suffered by the Province and insured by Hartford. We reject Hartford's argument that there should not be an award of pre‑judgment interest; Hartford had the use of Guardian's money pursuant to an agreement that implied the money would be repaid if Hartford was wrong in its assertion that Guardian was required to contribute to the fire loss. In our opinion the money owing was in the nature of debt; therefore, the trial judge had jurisdiction to award pre judgment interest. Hartford is required to reimburse Guardian for the amount paid by Guardian to Hartford with pre judgment interest as fixed by the trial judge but not compounded as there was no evidence to support finding that compound interest should be paid. Evidence on this issue is required. (606327 Ontario Limited and The Polar‑Freez Limited Partnership v. ACA Cooperative Association Limited et al; Associated Freezers of Canada Inc. v. ACA Cooperative Associate Limited et al. (N.S.S.C.) A.D., unreported June 5, 1992). We will not interfere with the exercise of the trial judge's discretion on the award of costs at trial. The appellant has been unsuccessful other than with respect to the minor issue of compound interest. The respondent shall have its costs to be taxed. J.A. Concurred in: Matthews, J.A.

QUEEN’S BENCH FOR SASKATCHEWAN Citation: 2009 SKQB 475 Date: 2009 12 08 Docket: QBCNJ No.
[2] After the plea was entered on September 14, 2009 a pre-sentence report was ordered and prepared in relation to each of the accused.
A written victim impact statement was filed by the Crown on behalf of Mr.
Flood.
At the time of sentencing a letter was filed on behalf of each of the accused from their employer, Flynn Canada Ltd.
In addition a Certificate of Achievement from Metis Addictions Council and a personal letter of reference was filed on behalf of Ryan Cameron.
Neither accused took any issue with the record as alleged.
In addition the Crown filed as an exhibit on the sentencing some photographs taken of Mr.
Flood following the incident in question.
[3] Submissions were made on behalf of the Crown and by each of the accused through their counsel.
Some aspects of the assault are described in the pre-sentence reports and in Mr. Flood’s victim impact statement.
These references to the events leading up to and comprising the assault have been obtained from both Mr.
Flood and from the accused persons.
The facts presented by Mr.
In the documents filed, Mr.","FIAT: A previous interim order detailed specific access in the period leading up to pre-trial or trial, however more than a year has passed and the matter has not even been set down for pre-trial.
The petitioner seeks to increase access to the two children of the relationship and an order to address holiday periods not covered in the previous order.
HELD: There shall be no change in the previously ordered access schedule.
 The Court found no change in the material circumstances that would warrant a change in the petitioner's regular access schedule.
Because of the petitioner's work schedule, the increased access is unlikely to result in any meaningful time with the children.
The holiday access requested was in the nature of an extrapolation of the previous order and the Court ordered holiday access in such a fashion as to continue that order.","[1, 6, 0, 5, 11, 7, 13, 12, 8, 17, 19, 18, 2, 21, 14, 16, 9]",139,"nan GAVELIN V. PATEMAN QB08179 Date of Judgment: April 30, 2008 Number of Pages: QUEEN'S BENCH FOR SASKATCHEWAN Date: 2008 04 30 Citation: 2008 SKQB 192 Docket: F.L.D. No. 330 of 2005 Judicial Centre: Saskatoon, Family Law Division BETWEEN: EVAN GAVELIN and NEVADA PATEMAN Counsel: N. Turcotte for the petitioner T. Hackl for the respondent FIAT DUFOUR J. April 30, 2008 1) The parties, who were never married, have two children: Kayden Marie Gavelin, born February 28, 2003 and Nolan Evan Gavelin, born December 28, 2004. The respondent is now married and the petitioner is engaged to be married on May 31, 2008. 2) The petitioner seeks an order that would enable him to exerciseincreased access to the two young children born of his relationship with therespondent. 3) This is the second time access issues have come before the Court. On February 1, 2007 Ryan-Froslie J. issued fiat that specified custody and access. At that time, the petitioner was employed by drilling company, working every day for two weeks followed by one week off. The respondent worked as hotel supervisor Tuesdays through Saturdays from 4:45 p.m. to 11:30 p.m. 4) The petitioner and respondent were awarded joint custody, with primary residence to be with the respondent. 5) Madam Justice Ryan-Froslie also detailed very specific accessprovisions, setting out the exact dates and times for the petitioner's access fromFebruary 2, 2007 to April 10, 2007. For the period subsequent to April 10, she ordered that the petitioner have access: (xiv) Commencing Saturday, April 28, 2007, every third Saturday from 10:00 a.m., overnight to Tuesday at 4:00 p.m.; (xv) During July and August, 2007, the petitioner shall be entitled to take the children for up to two non-consecutive periods consisting of no more than five overnights each; 6) The fiat did not address access for the Christmas, 2007 period or the 2008 summer holiday period. With good reason. The fiat was meant only to cover the gap between the application and pre-trial or trial, which certainly ought to have occurred before Christmas, 2007. Ryan-Froslie J. wrote: [6].. The purpose of interim orders is to establish temporary parenting arrangement pending trial or final resolution of the matter. In making such orders, Courts try to disrupt the lives of the children as little as possible and, for that purpose, often adopt the ""status quo"" subject always to that arrangement being in the best interests of the children. The status quo in this case is represented by the verbal agreement which the parties entered into following their separation, that is, that Mr. Gavelin would have the children during his week off from Saturday to Tuesday. Given the age and circumstances of the children, this appears reasonable on an interim basis. The verbal agreement, however, did not address the fact that Mr. Gavelin would be laid off for two months in the spring. It is reasonable that, during this period, his contact with the children should be increased. 7) Unfortunately, more than a year has passed and the matter has noteven been set down for pre-trial. This Application 8) The petitioner seeks the following: (a) Interim access every weekend from Friday at 4:00 p.m. to Sunday at 4:00 p.m. and every third weekend from Friday at 4:00 p.m. to Tuesday at 10:00 a.m.; (b) Access to the Children during the period of May 28, 2008 to June 4, 2008; (c) Access to the Children from 12:00 noon on July 11, 2008 to 12:00 noon on July 17, 2008; (d) Access to the Children from 12:00 noon on July 24, 2008 to 12:00 noon on July 31, 2008; (e) Access to the Children from 12:00 noon on August 2, 2008 to 12:00 noon on August 8, 2008; (f) Access to the Children during the period of August 15-20, 2008; (g) Access to the Children from 12:00 noon on August 21, 2008 to 12:00 noon on August 28, 2008; (h) Access to the Children from 12:00 noon on December 24, 2008 to 12:00 noon on December 27, 2008; (i) Such further access as this Honourable Court deems appropriate for extended parenting times during Spring (February) Break, Easter and the Summer Holidays. 9) There are two natures of relief sought. The first is in the nature of anapplication to vary the regular access from every third weekend to everyweekend. The second is more in the nature of an application, not to vary, but toaddress holiday periods not contemplated or addressed in the February 1, 2007fiat. Variation of regular access 10) The respondent resists any order that would increase or supplementthe petitioner's regular access. 11) Section 6(3) of The Children's Law Act, 1997, S.S. 1997, c. C-8.2 gives this Court authority to vary an order relating to access where there has been material change in circumstance since the date of the order. The order in issue here is an interim one. 12) I find no evidence of any material change in circumstances thatwould warrant a change in the petitioner's regular access schedule. 13) The petitioner's work schedule has not changed. He still works two weeks of 12 hour days (8:00 a.m. 8:00 p.m.) followed by week off. 14) Further, because the petitioner works 12-hour days, the increasedaccess he seeks during the weeks that he works are unlikely to result in anymeaningful time with the children either before he goes to work in the morning orafter his return from work in the evening. The children are five and four years old. Although there is no evidence of their bedtimes, it is most likely that the petitioner would be at work for virtually all of the children's waking hours. Contact with the father would be increased only marginally, if at all, during these periods and contact with the respondent would be significantly reduced. 15) True, the respondent's employment schedule has changed. She no longer works evenings Tuesdays through Saturdays. She works out of her home, five days week. This change does not mitigate in favour of varying the petitioner's regular access. 16) Under these circumstances, am unable to find that there has been material change in circumstances or that altering the existing regular access schedule would be in the best interests of the children. The regular accessschedule as detailed by Ryan-Froslie J. shall remain unchanged. Spring access 17) At the time the February 1, 2007 fiat was issued there was evidence that there would be road ban in effect during the spring thaw, making it likely that the petitioner would be temporarily laid off for the months of April and May, 2007. In paragraph [9](xvii), Ryan-Froslie J. ordered: Should Mr. Gavelin not work for the months of April and May, 2007, he shall have additional parenting time with the children every week (other than the weekend he exercises regular access), from Thursday at 4:00 p.m., overnight to Saturday at 10:00 a.m. 18) The petitioner's request that this access provision apply to this yearis not so much in the nature of a variation as an extrapolation of the previousorder. 19) The petitioner does not indicate that he will be laid off this spring, although, given that his employment has not changed, this will likely be the case. The respondent avers that the petitioner may be laid off for ""3 to weeks in May 20) As April is now behind us, order that the access provisions in paragraph [9](xvii) of the February 1, 2007 fiat be followed in May, 2008, but only for the weeks that the petitioner is not working at all. Summer, 2008 21) The request to specify access this summer is also in the nature of an extrapolation of the previous order. 22) For the summer of 2007, the petitioner was granted access for up to two non-consecutive periods consisting of no more than five overnights each during July and August. He seeks to increase summer access to two non- consecutive seven-day access periods in each of July and August. 23) The children are now one year older and some increase in summer access is reasonable, but not to the extent requested by the petitioner. When coupled with his regular access, the increase the petitioner seeks would result in his having the children for 21 of 31 days in July and 27 of 31 days in August. 24) The respondent has booked holidays from July 25 to August 10, which complicates the scheduling of the petitioner's summer access. Making the best of difficult situation, order that the access the petitioner shall have with the children in July and August, 2008, shall be as follows: July July 11; July 18 July 23; August 11 August 17; and August 24 August 30. For clarity, the petitioner shall not have the regularly scheduled access with the children during July and August. The only access he shall have with the children in those two months is as set out immediately above. Access for the petitioner's wedding 25) The petitioner is to be married on May 31, 2008. He seeks access to the children for the period of May 28, 2008 to June 4, 2008. He, very understandably, wants his children in attendance at his wedding. The respondent's stepbrother is getting married that same day and she wants the children to attend. 26) There will be disappointment no matter how rule. Although the wedding of the respondent's stepbrother is no doubt significant event for the children, consider the petitioner's wedding to be of greater importance. Further, the petitioner and his fiancTe planned their wedding to coincide with one of the petitioner's scheduled access periods. 27) The petitioner shall have access with the children from May 28, 2008 to June 4, 2008. Request that access be enforced by peace officer 28) The petitioner requests an order that provides that access be enforced by the RCMP or other peace officer. He deposes that the respondent and her husband threaten to withhold the children from him and swear and yell at him when the children are picked up and dropped off. The respondent disputes this and says that she is fully aware of the orders that are in place. 29) will not grant the order that the petitioner requests. In the event there are problems with access, the petitioner is granted leave to bring the matter before the Court on three days' notice. Christmas 2008 and holiday periods beyond 30) will not specify access for the 2008 Christmas period or for any of the holiday periods subsequent to that, as requested by the petitioner. The affidavits filed show significant amount of animosity between the parties. It appears unlikely that they will be able to agree on much, if anything. Granting specific access for holiday periods in the distant future acts as disincentive for the parties to resolve matters within reasonable time period of time. 31) Applications to alter interim access orders are not the answer. Moving the matter quickly to pre-trial and/or trial is. 32) Costs of this application shall be in the cause. J. G. D.

1048,"Background [1] Although Gordon Joseph Fiddler was originally charged with second degree murder with regard to the death of his cousin Tommy Fiddler, on November 3, 2017, the Court found him not guilty of second degree murder but guilty of manslaughter.
[2] Earlier at the commencement of the trial on July 13, 2017, Gordon Joseph Fiddler pled guilty to possession of a firearm while prohibited from doing so.
That firearm was the weapon used by Gordon when he fatally shot Tommy once in the head on February 25, 2016, at the Waterhen Lake First Nation.
[4] Since the Court’s November 3, 2017, decision both Crown and defence counsel have changed.
The Court received the very thorough Gladue Report completed by Christine Goodwin on June 1, 2018, and counsel provided the Court with their sentencing submissions on June 8, 2018 referring to multiple, meaningful case law for the consideration of the Court.
During the sentencing submissions the Crown presented six victim impact statements of the siblings of the victim Tommy Fiddler; two of his sisters and four of his brothers; collectively marked as Exhibit P12.
This matter was adjourned until today’s date for formal sentencing.
The Crown suggested that in the specific circumstances of this case a one year concurrent sentence should be imposed for the possession of a firearm while prohibited from doing so.","HELD: The application was allowed in part and the balance of images found on the computer were excluded from the evidence at trial pursuant to s. 24(2) of the Charter.

The police had no authority to search the computer generally.
They were only authorized to look at the Internet history.
The search of the non-Internet history was a serious infringement of the accused’s s. 8 Charter right.

QUEEN’S BENCH FOR SASKATCHEWAN Citation: 2017 SKQB 99 Date: 2017 04 10 Docket: CRM 100 of 2016 Judicial Centre: Regina BETWEEN: HER MAJESTY THE QUEEN and DEAN FRANKLIN LOMMERSE Counsel: Maura Landry for the Crown Brian Smith for the accused JUDGMENT MEGAW J. APRIL 10, 2017 Introduction [1] The accused has applied to exclude certain evidence discovered by the police during the execution of search of the accused’s computer and cellular phone. The initial determination of whether there had been violation of the accused’s s. Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms [Charter] right occurred by the judgment dated January 3, 2017. The issue of exclusion of evidence pursuant to s. 24(2) of the Charter was not determined at that time. At the initial voir dire, there had been no evidence presented of either the nature of the evidence seized nor the location from which it was seized. Accordingly, it was not possible, at that time, to enter into s. 24(2) consideration. [2] Following the judgment of January 3, 2017, it was proposed by counsel, and agreed by the court, the Crown would proceed with its case, calling all of its evidence, following which s. 24(2) determination would be made. As result, the trial resumed on February 6, 2017 with the Crown presenting all of its evidence. The results of the seizure were marked as exhibits for identification. The determination of their ultimate admissibility was to await completion of argument on s. 24(2) analysis. [3] That argument has now been completed. This is the judgment determining the admissibility of the exhibits tendered by the Crown. Following this determination, the accused will then present his case. [4] The background to the Regina Police Service obtaining search warrant [warrant] is contained in the judgment dated January 3, 2017. For the purposes of this decision, that background determined Cst. Howell, the investigating officer, had obtained warrant which authorized search of the accused’s computer devices. The Information to Obtain [ITO] in support of the warrant sought only search of the “search history on the computer.” The Crown and the accused presented the case on the basis that this was the limit set forth in the warrant, and, it was on that basis the earlier judgment was determined. [5] Cst. Howell testified on the voir dire that after the complainant’s statement was completed, she told the officer the accused had also taken picture of her while she was naked and in the shower. This information was not included in the ITO. Accordingly, there was no request made in the warrant to search for pictures on the accused’s computer devices. The Crown sought to introduce this further information of the complainant as amplification evidence to expand the scope of the warrant. That application was dismissed in the earlier judgment. [6] At the voir dire, Cst. Howell testified he delivered the seized material, for these purposes consisting of laptop computer and cell phone, to Sgt. Kuan, computer forensic specialist with the Royal Canadian Mounted Police. He testified he gave Sgt. Kuan instructions to search for the following: 1. General search of the internet history; 2. Pictures of the complainant; and 3. Messages between the complainant and the accused. [7] An assistance request was completed by Cst. Howell and provided to Sgt. Kuan. This assistance request was not marked as an exhibit on the voir dire or the trial. As result, that document does not form part of the evidence before the court. However, Cst. Howell testified that it was he who delivered the computer and the assistance request to Sgt. Kuan. The Crown applied to have the evidence given by Cst. Howell on the voir dire admitted on the trial proper. That application was granted. [8] The Request for Assistance said to be completed by Cst. Howell was read into the record at the voir dire. The wording of that Request for Assistance is different than the Assistance Request marked as Exhibit P11 at the trial. [9] Cst. Logan testified at the trial. At the time of this matter, he was member of the ICE Unit within the Regina Police Service. He and Cst. Howell worked together in this unit. He was qualified as an expert in the field of internet child exploitation including the categorization of images and videos depicting such. He has much experience dealing with child exploitation matters. [10] Cst. Logan testified he became involved in this investigation through Cst. Howell. He indicated it was he who sent the Assistance Request, Exhibit P11, to the Tech Crime Unit. He testified, he reviewed the warrant that was received. He remembers little from reviewing that warrant and was not asked to refresh his memory on it during his testimony. He testified “he based his review on the past experience that they must ask for things in the application for the warrant”. [11] It is fair to say, immediately upon Cst. Logan obtaining the laptop computer, he commenced search for child pornography. The first thing he did was run program called “OS Triage” on the computer. This software reviews the images on the computer through an evaluation tool called “hash values”. These hash values are understood to be an algorithm that determines whether child porn is accessible on the computer. The application of the OS Triage did not reveal any accessible child porn. Cst. Logan then went directly to the “Recycle Bin” on the laptop and discovered an image of child porn. [12] Cst. Logan testified he then delivered the laptop to the Tech Crimes Unit to have it forensically analyzed. As result of the immediacy of this matter, due to the approaching court appearance date, the Assistance Request was assigned to Sgt. Kuan to perform the forensic analysis. He received the assignment on July 4, 2013. Apparently, the court date was July 22, 2013. [13] Sgt. Kuan was qualified as an expert in the field of forensic computer and computer device examination, peer to peer file sharing software and computer device applications. His evidence from the voir dire was also applied to the trial proper. This was done on application by the Crown and consented to by counsel for the accused. [14] When Sgt. Kuan received the computer, he did not have copy of either the ITO or the warrant. He did not subsequently obtain those documents. While Cst. Howell testified at the voir dire that he directed the Tech Unit to look for evidence of child pornography, that evidence is not borne out by the testimony of Sgt. Kuan. It appears, according to him, Sgt. Kuan did not have any discussions with any other officers prior to completing his analysis of the computer. While protocol has since changed, in July 2013, he was not required to review the warrant or ITO as part of his analysis. Rather, he relied upon the Assistance Request completed by Cst. Logan. Indeed, Sgt. Kuan testified he did not even know Cst. Logan had operated the computer or run the OS Triage program prior to delivery to Sgt. Kuan. [15] Upon receipt of the computer, Sgt. Kuan began his full forensic analysis. His analysis consisted of three steps. First, he must complete forensic acquisition of the device. This involves him obtaining mirror image of the hard drive of the device. Second, he must authenticate the information obtained through the mirror image. Third, he must obtain all files, including deleted files. [16] Once Sgt. Kuan has obtained the files, he then utilizes forensic program called “C4All” into which images (“C4P”) and videos (“C4M”) are placed. At this stage, the information, if anything is found, is then returned to Cst. Logan to complete categorization of the images or movies. This categorization determines whether the images or videos are considered to be child pornography. [17] The computer storage consists of allocated and unallocated space. Allocated space is that part of the hard drive which is active space. Unallocated space is that part of the hard drive that is free space. This free space is simply overwritten again and again by the computer. [18] It is understood the particular operating system of this computer, Windows XP, keeps track of everything that is being done by the computer user. Although not explicitly stated, it is understood other operating systems do not have this relentless tracking feature. As result of this peculiarity in the Windows XP program, internet history is saved in the allocated space. Sgt. Kuan testified this occurs so the computer can speedily recover the internet page if the user goes on the internet to search it again. This cached information is not available to the user and is an automatic function of the computer. [19] As result of the completion of the C4All program, total of 403 images of either child nudity or child pornography were found. Of these, 373 were unique images. Presumably, the remaining 30 images were duplicates of certain of the unique images. Tab in Exhibit shows the location of the various images. The vast majority were found in “Temporary Internet Files”. Approximately 18 were found in specific locations on the computer: “My Documents/My Pictures”; “Lost Files”; “Recycler”. [20] Sgt. Kuan testified it was possible to utilize different forensic tools to restrict an analysis to specific area of the computer. This would allow him to search for both specific date ranges and specific data. He testified he could use one of these specific forensic tools to obtain only the internet history without extracting any images from the balance of the computer storage locations. [21] According to Cst. Howell’s testimony, the warrant was originally sought to obtain the internet search history of this accused with respect to specific website called Plenty of Fish and also websites generally dealing with massage pornography. Sgt. Kuan obtained the internet search history. Interestingly, here, while Sgt. Kuan testified he found on the internet search history the presence of both the Plenty of Fish website and massage porn type websites, this information never found its way into his report. [22] In fact, Sgt. Kuan was never asked by the investigating officers to provide the results of his analysis of the internet search history. Further, he fairly admitted that while the titles to certain internet search histories found on the computer were indicative of something called massage porn, he did not actually go to those internet sites to confirm that is what they were. [23] It is recalled the very reason for obtaining the warrant was to find corroborative evidence of the statements of the complainant to the effect when she was in the accused’s apartment, he was on his computer looking at Plenty of Fish and massage porn websites. It is further noted the complainant was not asked, either in her statement or in her testimony at trial, for specific dates or times which might coincide with the internet traffic of the accused at the indicated websites. [24] The images found by Sgt. Kuan, and placed in the C4All program, were forwarded to Cst. Logan for review and determination of whether they were child pornography. As indicated, Cst. Logan has expertise in the determination of whether images can be considered to be child pornography. He concluded the various images referred to previously fell into that category. Counsel for the accused acknowledged this classification work was accurate. The court was invited to conclude this was the case without actually reviewing any of the images. While it is certainly possible to form such conclusion without an actual review of the material, that is not course which endorse. As result, Cst. Logan had prepared sample of 12 such images for review by the court. He presented those images in court. There is no question but that those images constitute child pornography. As result, am able to conclude all of the images obtained constitute child pornography. [25] The accused seeks to exclude all of the images of child pornography located on his computer. In the alternative, he seeks to exclude those images not automatically cached by web browser during an internet search. [26] The Charter provides as follows: 24(2) Where, in proceedings under subsection (1), court concludes that evidence was obtained in manner that infringed or denied any rights or freedoms guaranteed by this Charter, the evidence shall be excluded if it is established that, having regard to all the circumstances, the admission of it in the proceedings would bring the administration of justice into disrepute. [27] The test for exclusion of evidence is set forth in Grant, 2009 SCC 32 (CanLII), [2009] SCR 353 [Grant] as follows: (a) Seriousness of the Charter-Infringing State Conduct 72 The first line of inquiry relevant to the s. 24(2) analysis requires court to assess whether the admission of the evidence would bring the administration of justice into disrepute by sending message to the public that the courts, as institutions responsible for the administration of justice, effectively condone state deviation from the rule of law by failing to dissociate themselves from the fruits of that unlawful conduct. The more severe or deliberate the state conduct that led to the Charter violation, the greater the need for the courts to dissociate themselves from that conduct, by excluding evidence linked to that conduct, in order to preserve public confidence in and ensure state adherence to the rule of law. 73 This inquiry therefore necessitates an evaluation of the seriousness of the state conduct that led [page395] to the breach. The concern of this inquiry is not to punish the police or to deter Charter breaches, although deterrence of Charter breaches may be happy consequence. The main concern is to preserve public confidence in the rule of law and its processes. In order to determine the effect of admission of the evidence on public confidence in the justice system, the court on s. 24(2) application must consider the seriousness of the violation, viewed in terms of the gravity of the offending conduct by state authorities whom the rule of law requires to uphold the rights guaranteed by the Charter. 74 State conduct resulting in Charter violations varies in seriousness. At one end of the spectrum, admission of evidence obtained through inadvertent or minor violations of the Charter may minimally undermine public confidence in the rule of law. At the other end of the spectrum, admitting evidence obtained through wilful or reckless disregard of Charter rights will inevitably have negative effect on the public confidence in the rule of law, and risk bringing the administration of justice into disrepute. nan (b)Impact on the Charter-Protected Interests of the Accused 76 This inquiry focusses on the seriousness of the impact of the Charter breach on the Charter-protected interests of the accused. It calls for an evaluation of the extent to which the breach actually undermined the interests protected by the right infringed. The impact of Charter breach may range from fleeting and technical to profoundly intrusive. The more serious the impact on the accused's protected interests, the greater the risk that admission of the evidence may signal to the public that Charter rights, however high-sounding, are of little actual avail to the citizen, breeding public cynicism and bringing the administration of justice into disrepute. nan 78 Similarly, an unreasonable search contrary to s. of the Charter may impact on the protected [page397] interests of privacy, and more broadly, human dignity. An unreasonable search that intrudes on an area in which the individual reasonably enjoys high expectation of privacy, or that demeans his or her dignity, is more serious than one that does not. (c) Society's Interest in an Adjudication on the Merits 79 Society generally expects that criminal allegation will be adjudicated on its merits. Accordingly, the third line of inquiry relevant to the s. 24(2) analysis asks whether the truth-seeking function of the criminal trial process would be better served by admission of the evidence, or by its exclusion. This inquiry reflects society's ""collective interest in ensuring that those who transgress the law are brought to trial and dealt with according to the law"": R. v. Askov, 1990 CanLII 45 (SCC), [1990] S.C.R. 1199, at pp. 1219-20. Thus the Court suggested in Collins that judge on s. 24(2) application should consider not only the negative impact of admission of the evidence on the repute of the administration of justice, but the impact of failing to admit the evidence. 80 The concern for truth-seeking is only one of the considerations under s. 24(2) application. The view that reliable evidence is admissible regardless of how it was obtained (see R. v. Wray, 1970 CanLII (SCC), [1971] S.C.R. 272 is inconsistent with the Charter's affirmation of rights. More specifically, it is inconsistent with the wording of s. 24(2), which mandates broad inquiry into all the circumstances, not just the reliability of the evidence. 83 The importance of the evidence to the prosecution's case is another factor that may be considered in this line of inquiry. Like Deschamps J., we view this factor as corollary to the inquiry into reliability, in the following limited sense. The admission of evidence of questionable reliability is more likely to bring the administration of justice into disrepute where it forms the entirety of the case against the accused. Conversely, the exclusion of highly reliable evidence may impact more negatively on the repute of the administration of justice where the remedy effectively guts the prosecution. nan 85 To review, the three lines of inquiry identified above the seriousness of the Charter-infringing state conduct, the impact of the breach on the Charter-protected interests of the accused, and the societal interest in an adjudication on the merits reflect what the s. 24(2) judge must consider in assessing the effect of admission of the evidence on the repute of the administration of justice. Having made these inquiries, which encapsulate consideration of ""all the circumstances"" of the case, the judge must then determine whether, on balance, the admission of the evidence obtained by Charter breach would bring the administration of justice into disrepute. 86 In all cases, it is the task of the trial judge to weigh the various indications. No overarching rule governs how the balance is to be struck. Mathematical precision is obviously not possible. However, the preceding analysis creates decision tree, albeit more flexible than the Stillman self-incrimination test. We believe this to be required by the words of s. 24(2). We also take comfort in the fact that patterns emerge with respect to [page400] particular types of evidence. These patterns serve as guides to judges faced with s. 24(2) applications in future cases. In this way, measure of certainty is achieved. Where the trial judge has considered the proper factors, appellate courts should accord considerable deference to his or her ultimate determination. [28] There are number of authorities which have directly considered the issue of excluding child pornography evidence as result of Charter violation. While the application of s. 24(2) is difficult in all proceedings, it is particularly weighty in matters involving child pornography. That is so, obviously, because of the very evidence itself. The images are haunting and sickening and cause instant revulsion. [29] In reviewing this matter, it is important to start with what this matter was not, according to the evidence of Cst. Howell, the lead investigating officer. This matter was not, at the start, an investigation into child pornography. It was an investigation into complaint of sexual assault of minor and sexual exploitation of that minor. The warrant was obtained to determine if there was corroborating evidence to be found on the accused’s computer which would support the statements being made by the complainant. [30] At the voir dire, Cst. Howell testified the complainant told him, following the conclusion of her video and audio taped statement, that the accused had taken pictures of her in the shower. It was this statement, according to Cst. Howell, that caused him to ask of Sgt. Kuan that he also look for pictures of the complainant when completing his forensic review of the computer. While this evidence of Cst. Howell was not permitted as amplification evidence, am permitted to consider it on the s. 24(2) analysis: Wonitowy, 2010 SKQB 346 (CanLII), 358 Sask 303. [31] There are several problems with this evidence. Firstly, the complainant did not testify as to the accused taking any pictures of her. She was not asked about this. This absence of evidence is significant in assessing what is to be made of Cst. Howell’s assertion. [32] Secondly, neither Sgt. Kuan, nor Cst. Logan, knew what the complainant looked like, nor did they receive description or picture of her. This is so, apparently, despite the assertion Sgt. Kuan was specifically advised by Cst. Howell of the possible presence of picture of the complainant on the accused’s computer files. [33] Thirdly, there is absolutely no evidence to suggest either Sgt. Kuan or Cst. Logan looked for, or even considered looking for, picture or pictures of someone who might be the complainant. They simply did not look for specific picture to attempt to either provide independent evidence or to provide evidence to further corroborate the complainant’s allegations. [34] All of this leads, inexorably, to the conclusion this investigation was to obtain child pornography. In saying that, do not intend to suggest any ill motives to the investigating officers. Rather, it appears, from the weight of all of the evidence that what they intended to do, in the case of both Sgt. Kuan and Cst. Logan, was to search for and obtain, if available, evidence of the accused’s computer having on it child pornography. [35] This is apparent particularly from the testimony of Cst. Logan. Upon receipt of the computer, he immediately ran the OS Triage software looking for “hash values” which would be evidence of the presence of child pornography. There is no indication in the evidence that picture or pictures of the complainant would contain those “hash values”. Following that search (which did not turn up any indication of the presence of such material), he then immediately went to the Recycle Bin to look for the presence of child pornography images. [36] Then, the very reason for obtaining the warrant is, apparently, abandoned right from the start of the search. There is no evidence on this trial of what the accused’s computer’s search history shows with respect to the two areas of prime importance in the ITO. Evidently, no one asked Sgt. Kuan for the information which he had acquired in this regard. [37] When these issues were discussed during argument, counsel for the Crown indicated the investigation took decidedly different turn with the obtaining of statement from the witness, That witness testified as to being with the complainant in the accused’s apartment. She further testified to corroborating events that took place in the apartment. The submission was therefore that the presence of this potential corroboration evidence obviated the need for the search history information. [38] This explanation may very well apply once the trial itself was underway, but, it cannot apply to the work of either Sgt. Kuan or Cst. Logan. The evidence of was not received until she gave statement on January 4, 2014. The computer was seized in June 2013 and the forensic analysis was completed in early July, to accommodate the pending court date of July 27, 2013. Accordingly, the necessity of the search history could not have been obviated at the time the forensic analysis of the computer was being completed. [39] As have indicated, there is no suggestion here the police had any ill-motives. Quite the contrary, they appeared all to be persons dedicated to their positions with the police force. They each gave their evidence genuinely and without hesitation on the steps they had each taken with the investigation. The difficulty lies not with their motives, rather it lies with their failure to abide by that most basic of requirements: the warrant. No one thought to get one that allowed the extent of intrusion into the accused’s privacy. No one questioned what was obtained to ensure they were each acting on solid ground with respect to their search entitlements. [40] This is not something that can be considered technical breach. Cst. Howell asserts he had information from the complainant that nude pictures of her were taken. This information was not provided to the justice in the form of the ITO. The complainant did not provide this evidence when giving her testimony. The information is apparently not to be found in the notes of Cst. Howell, nor in the video or audio statement given by the complainant. It was not remembered until, apparently, the preliminary inquiry in this matter. [41] In light of this, it is possible the justice would have refused to grant more intrusive search. It is possible the justice would not have been satisfied more intrusive search was warranted on the basis of the uncertain nature of the evidence in support of such more intrusive search. [42] In Morelli, 2010 SCC (CanLII), [2010] SCR 253 [Morelli] Fish J. stated: 105 As mentioned at the outset, it is difficult to imagine more intrusive invasion of privacy than the search of one's home and personal computer. Computers often contain our most intimate correspondence. They contain the details of our financial, medical, and personal situations. They even reveal our specific interests, likes, and propensities, recording in the browsing history and cache files the information we seek out and read, watch, or listen to on the Internet. 106 It is therefore difficult to conceive s. breach with greater impact on the Charter-protected privacy interests of the accused than occurred in this case. 107 turn, finally, to the third factor to be weighed under s. 24(2) of the Charter society's interest in adjudication of the case on its merits. Here, exclusion of the evidence obtained in the search would leave the prosecution with essentially no case against the accused. It would thus seriously undermine the truth-seeking function of the trial, [page291] factor that weighs against exclusion (Grant, at paras. 79-83). [43] The personal nature of all of the information on the computer was emphasized by the Supreme Court of Canada in Cole, 2012 SCC 53 (CanLII), [2012] SCR 34 [Cole]: 47 Computers that are used for personal purposes, regardless of where they are found or to whom they belong, ""contain the details of our financial, [page49] medical, and personal situations"" (Morelli, at para. 105). This is particularly the case where, as here, the computer is used to browse the Web. Internet-connected devices ""reveal our specific interests, likes, and propensities, recording in the browsing history and cache files the information we seek out and read, watch, or listen to on the Internet"" (ibid.). [44] With respect specifically to cases involving child pornography, Fish J. in Morelli stated: nan To be sure, offences involving child pornography are particularly insidious. They breed demand for images that exploit vulnerable children, both economically and morally. Understandably, offences of this sort evoke strong emotional response. They generate widespread condemnation and intense feelings of disapprobation, if not revulsion. nan It is for this very reason that the police, in enforcing the law, must avoid any temptation to resort to stereotypical, inflammatory, or misleading allegations. And where they yield to that temptation, courts must be particularly vigilant to issue process, or subsequently validate the issuance of process, only where reasonable and probable grounds for search or an arrest are in fact made out. While the law must be relentlessly enforced, legal requirements must be respected, and constitutional safeguards preserved. [45] turn now to the consideration to be applied when considering the application of s. 24(2). While it has been stated in many cases, quote from Justice Fish’s decision in Cole: 80 With the Charter breach established, the inquiry shifts to s. 24(2). 81 Unconstitutionally obtained evidence should be excluded under s. 24(2) if, considering all of the circumstances, its admission would bring the administration of justice into disrepute. This determination requires balancing assessment involving three broad inquiries: (1) the seriousness of the Charter-infringing state conduct; (2) the impact of the breach on the Charter-protected interests of the accused; and (3) society's interest in the adjudication of the case on its merits (R. v. Grant, 2009 SCC 32 (CanLII), [2009] S.C.R. 353, at para. 71). 82 The standard of review is deferential: ""Where trial judge has considered the proper factors and has not made any unreasonable finding, his or her determination is owed considerable deference on appellate review"" (R. v. Côté, 2011 SCC 46 (CanLII), [2011] S.C.R. 215, at para. 44). But where the relevant factors have been overlooked or disregarded, fresh Grant analysis is both necessary and appropriate. a. The seriousness of Charter-infringing state conduct [46] As with consideration of the other two inquiries, the evidence here must be divided into two broad categories. The evidence found on the computer, other than through the temporary internet sites, is one broad category of evidence. The evidence found on the computer through the temporary internet sites is second category of evidence. While these are broad categories, they define the nature of the evidence in dispute. [47] The court in Morelli, and confirmed in Cole, identified the intrusiveness of search into one’s personal computer. repeat those comments here from Morelli: nan It is difficult to imagine search more intrusive, extensive, or invasive of one's privacy [page263] than the search and seizure of personal computer. nan First, police officers enter your home, take possession of your computer, and carry it off for examination in place unknown and inaccessible to you. There, without supervision or constraint, they scour the entire contents of your hard drive: your emails sent and received; accompanying attachments; your personal notes and correspondence; your meetings and appointments; your medical and financial records; and all other saved documents that you have downloaded, copied, scanned, or created. The police scrutinize as well the electronic roadmap of your cybernetic peregrinations, where you have been and what you appear to have seen on the Internet generally by design, but sometimes by accident. [48] The Crown in the course of submissions, here, suggested the decision of Fish J. in this first part was impacted significantly by the police officer’s lack of candour and lack of diligence and integrity. There is no doubt that is the case and Fish J. was quite pointed in his comments concerning the police officer’s behaviour, there. [49] Here, the police did nothing to attempt to obtain warrant allowing them to search for child pornography. Rather, they took it upon themselves to search without judicial authority or oversight. That this was done without malice or misconduct, while noticed, does not ultimately affect the nature of the impact on the accused’s Charter right. [50] Really what is being sought here is general acceptance that the failure to obtain search warrant authorizing such search is of little to no consequence. The police did not engage in misconduct, so the argument goes, and accordingly, their failure to obtain warrant can be easily excused. [51] do not see things that way. The investigating officers just did not, apparently, think it necessary to obtain warrant. This is wrong thinking and shows little concern for the Charter rights of those being investigated. In Morelli, there was trial finding of “no deliberate misconduct” by the officer. Despite this, Fish J. stated: 103 We are bound to accept the trial judge's finding that there was no deliberate misconduct on the part of the officer who swore the Information. The repute of the administration of justice would nonetheless be significantly eroded, particularly in the long term, if such unacceptable police conduct were permitted to form the basis for so intrusive an invasion of privacy as the search of our homes and the seizure and scrutiny of our personal computers. [52] The police had no authority to search the computer generally. They were only authorized to look at the internet history. The search of the non-internet history is a serious infringement of the accused’s Charter right. The search of the temporary internet files is less of serious infringement, in these circumstances. b. Impact on the Charter-protected interests of the accused [53] On the second factor in Grant, repeat the words of Fish J. in Morelli: 105 As mentioned at the outset, it is difficult to imagine more intrusive invasion of privacy than the search of one's home and personal computer. Computers often contain our most intimate correspondence. They contain the details of our financial, medical, and personal situations. They even reveal our specific interests, likes, and propensities, recording in the browsing history and cache files the information we seek out and read, watch, or listen to on the Internet. 106 It is therefore difficult to conceive s. breach with greater impact on the Charter-protected privacy interests of the accused than occurred in this case. [54] That is precisely the situation in this case. echo Fish J.’s comments. [55] Again, the general search of the computer significantly impacts the accused’s Charter interests. This is precisely what Fish J. was referring to. The search of the temporary internet files is less so as the police were authorized to look at the internet history. c. Society’s interest in an adjudication on the merits [56] This then leads me to the third factor. Exclusion of all of the evidence of child pornography found here would leave the Crown with no case on this count of the Indictment. This is real evidence, not conscripted. [57] As indicated, there is difference between that found on the computer in the pictures or recycle bin and those found in the temporary internet files. There may be no justification on the face of the ITO or the warrant for obtaining materials from the computer other than temporary internet files. This was search conducted as straight out child pornography search, quite unconnected with the charges then being investigated by the police. [58] The images found in the temporary internet files are another matter. The warrant authorized obtaining the search history from this computer. There are software tools available that would do solely that. Those tools were not used here. [59] The police had no authority to look generally at the computer. They could have obtained further warrant. It did not occur that this should take place. They did have authority to look at the internet history. [60] While the nature of the offence would suggest society demands complete adjudication on the merits, the nature of the search here suggests otherwise. It is not open season on whatever is found by the authorities. There are limits as to what will be acceptable. After the fact justification is not something the court will support in these circumstances. [61] The police were looking for internet history. While not explained well in the evidence, the temporary internet files are created as a result of visits on the internet. This is the evidence of internet history. Because of its connection, I determine society would have an interest in seeing this evidence determined on its merits. CONCLUSION [62] As a result of all of the foregoing, I determine the materials found through the temporary internet files are not excluded from evidence pursuant to s. 24(2) of the Charter. However, I determine the balance of the images found on the computer are excluded from the evidence at trial pursuant tos. 24(2). Accordingly, I determine as follows:1. Exhibit P6, Tab 1 is admissible;2. Exhibit P6, Tab 2 – the items not found in Temporary Internet files are to be excluded from the evidence at this trial. That is the items in the first row and the last three rows;3. Exhibit P6, Tab 3 is admissible;4. Exhibit P6, Tab 4 relating to Temporary Internet files is admissible; and5. Exhibit P8 with the exception of the indicated excluded pages. M.T. MEGAW nan",e_2017skqb99.txt,"HELD: The application was allowed in part and the balance of images found on the computer were excluded from the evidence at trial pursuant to s. 24(2) of the Charter.
