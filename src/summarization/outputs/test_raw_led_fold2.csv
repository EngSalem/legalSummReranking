The original mortgage executed by the plaintiff was for $191,000 of which $176,000 was advanced to purchase her condominium and $15,000, eight per cent of the total, was advanced for other purchases. The property sold for $156,000 pursuant to a judicial sale. The sale proceeds were distributed to pay outstanding property taxes, commission, and the principal and interest due under the mortgage in the amount of $141,945 and the net sale proceeds were to be distributed pro rata. As at November 1, 2017, the principal and interest owing on the non-purchase money portion of the mortgage was $21,250. The plaintiff requested judgment for the deficiency in the amount of $9,900 with interest to the date of judgment. It claimed it was entitled to solicitor-client costs and other costs accrued by it under the mortgage. The issue was whether such costs should be subject to the pro rata calculation for the nonpurchase portion of the mortgage, that is, 8 percent of the total costs incurred.  HELD: The application was granted. The court found that the plaintiff was entitled to a deficiency judgment for principal and interest owed under the mortgage in the amount requested. It was also entitled to judgment against the mortgagee for eight percent of the solicitor-client costs, condominium fees and property management charges.","FIAT: The issue is whether the pro rata distribution of purchase money proceeds and non-purchase money proceeds in any deficiency judgment pursuant to a judicial sale extends to the total outstanding amount of the mortgage. RBC applies to have its lawyers' costs assessed on a solicitor-client basis. The judicial sale by real estate listing was previously confirmed by the order of Danyliuk J. of October 27, 2017. HELD: RBC is entitled to a deficiency judgment for principal and interest owed under the mortgage in the amount requested.  1) The solicitor's costs assessed are assessments levied against the condominium owner's unit for unpaid contributions to the common expense fund or the reserve fund. These are charges that are allowable pursuant to s. 11 of The Limitation of Civil Rights Act, RSS 1978, L16 [LCRA]. 2) RBC also claims two other charges pursuant to its mortgage. First, RBC has paid $2,528.90 for arrears of condominium fees. Pursuant to ss. 63 of The Condominium Property Act, 1993, SS 1993, C26.1, a condominium corporation may register a lien against the title of the owner’s unit or reserve fund for unpaid contribution to common expense, reserve fund, and the applicable GST and PST. These charges are permitted by s. 8(1) of the LCRA. Any inspections and administration fees have not been claimed by RBC.  3) As at November 1, 2017, the total assessed solicitor‑client costs, condominium fee and property management charges ought to be added to the deficiency judgment, along with the prorated principal, interest due. Counsel argues that it was required to incur the extra legal costs to proceed by judicial sale in order to pursue recovery of the deficiency against Partridge."
e_2016skca29.txt,"HELD: The majority of the court granted leave to appeal and restored the conviction entered by the trial judge. The parties and court agreed that the provisions of s. 34(1) as they read prior to May 2012 were applicable. The issues were determined as follows: 1) the appeal court judge erred by misunderstanding the applicable test and inappropriately focusing on the respondent’s belief. The appeal court judge reviewed cases that led him to focus on the doctrine of mistake of fact, which was not argued by the respondent at trial and were not part of his grounds of appeal; 2) the trial judge accepted some but not all of the expert’s evidence, as he was entitled to do. The trial judge also reinterpreted the video evidence, which was found to be an error by the Court of Appeal. The trial judge considered the factors without weighing the use of force to a nicety. He was determining the objective reasonableness of the force based on the factors; and 3) the appeal court judge properly instructed himself on the standard of review but failed to analyze the decision of the trial judge based on that standard, namely, whether the evidence was reasonably capable of supporting the trial judge’s conclusion based on the evidence as a whole. The dissenting judge would have granted leave to appeal but then would have dismissed the appeal. The dissenting judge of the Court of Appeal found that the appeal court judge erred in his approach but reached the right conclusion that the trial judge erred. The trial judge ignored the fact that the encounter was only three seconds long and he mischaracterized the thrust-kick as extreme force. The respondent had to react quickly. The trial judge also erred in questioning whether the respondent honestly believed he was in danger of harm.","The Crown appealed the decision of the summary conviction appeal court, which determined that the trial judge had erred in finding the respondent guilty, set aside the conviction and entered an acquittal. The Crown applied for leave to appeal the decision pursuant to s. 839 of the Criminal Code. HELD: The appeal was allowed and the conviction of the respondent entered in the Provincial Court was reinstated.  1) The Court reviewed the jurisprudence regarding s. 25(1) and s. 34(1), and found it was fundamentally the same for both provisions. The Court found that the force used by the respondent in the execution of his duty was excessive on an objective basis. The trial judge failed to take into account certain factors in his analysis of whether the force was necessary, whether the level of force was reasonable in all of the circumstances, and whether the respondent's response to the assault was reckless. The appeal court judge erred by applying the wrong standard of appellate review.  2) In assessing whether there is an air of reality to the proportionality requirement, that is whether the responsive force was no more than necessary, the Court should not expect an accused person to weigh that force to nicety. 3) The court found that it was common ground that the principles set out in the Code govern the use of force for defensive purposes or the exercise of powers of arrest and they apply to police officers. The court also held that the provisions in effect at the time of the offence were inapplicable."
8_2012skpc79.txt,"The accused's neighbour disliked the accused and alleged that the accused drove his vehicle into hers. The police arrested the accused and found a fob that operated the locks on the doors of the vehicle and the engine hood of the accused's vehicle was warm. The accused was charged with hit and run and impaired driving. HELD: The Court found the accused not guilty of both charges. The Court found that the police breaches of the accused's Charter rights were numerous. The approximate 11 minutes of investigative detention was not an infringement of his rights but the combination of the officers' failing to inform the accused of the reason for his arrest and not giving his rights to counsel without delay, coupled with the illegal search and seizure of the fob and keys were in total breaches serious enough to bring the administration of justice into disrepute. The Court excluded the evidence of the fob and keys which further weakened the circumstantial case against the accused to the extent that the Crown failed to prove the accused was the operator of the motor vehicle.","HELD: The Court found that the police conducted an unreasonable search and that the accused breached his rights for about 11 minutes, by not informing the officer of the reason for his detention and by not giving him his right to contact counsel. The Court excluded the evidence of the fob and keys which was significant part of the circumstantial case against the accused. The accused was asked by the police officer if he had any further dealings with him. The police officer told the accused that he was being detained for a possible hit and run or impaired driving charge because he was sure the accused was the driver of the vehicle. The defence argued that the search of the accused's vehicle and the retrieval of evidence from his pocket were in total breaches of his rights under s. 24(2) and breached s. of the Charter. HELD: 1) The Court concluded that the detention was not arbitrary, the police had the requisite subjective and objective grounds to detain the accused for further investigation. However, an officer who detains for investigative purposes must inform the accused of the reasons for detention and must also give to him his rights to counsel without delay. 2) The exclusion of the evidence from the search and seizure was a breach of the Accused's right to be free from an unreasonable seizure. It was a warrantless search and it was unjustified, unreasonable and illegal."
d_2013skqb90.txt,"The appellants appealed a small claims judgment. The judgment had found the appellants liable for damages after the respondent, who had purchased a house from the appellants, discovered that water was entering his basement. When the respondent investigated the source of the water, he removed the interior wall of the basement and discovered that there was a second wall behind the first one. He also discovered that a large chunk of the concrete footing and concrete grade beam were broken and had slid into the space between the interior basement wall. The respondent obtained a professional opinion that suggested that the problem had been there for a significant period of time and that the wooden beam that sat on the concrete grade beam was rotten and would have to be replaced. The respondent was awarded judgment in the amount of the repair. The appellant appealed on the basis that the trial judge should not have considered the respondent's expert's opinion about the age of the defect, that the trial judge had crossed a line in assisting the self-represented plaintiff at the trial and that the trial judge erred in calculating damages. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. The respondent's expert was qualified as an expert concerning foundation repair and had the necessary experience to give expert evidence on the type of structural repair and the need for structural repair. Once qualified as an expert in the area of foundations and structural repair, he could testify on the nature of the foundation's problems, including the wooden beam. The witness was also the person who actually carried out the repair to the foundation and was entitled to give evidence on what he saw and did. The witness was properly qualified by virtue of his years of experience and the trial judge was entitled to accept his evidence as to the state of the foundation and how long it had been in such a state. The trial judge's intervention and comments to the appellant's lawyer at the trial did not go beyond the nature of a legitimate attempt to ensure that all of the evidence regarding the matters at issue was before the Court with sufficient clarity to allow the trial judge to understand it. The cause of action in this case was negligent misrepresentation. The trial judge found that the appellants were aware of the structural defect and had covered it up. The proper measure of damages is the amount of money required to put the plaintiff in the position he would have occupied if the negligent misrepresentation had not been made. In this case, the judge made no palpable or overriding error in calculating damages at the amount it cost to fix the foundation.","HELD: This was an appeal from a Small Claims Court judgment dated August 20, 2012. The grounds of appeal were that the trial judge erred in weighing necessity and qualification before determining the admissibility of certain opinion evidence tendered on behalf of the plaintiff. The trial judge made no palpable and overriding error in interpretation of the evidence and calculation of damages. There was no evidence that the amount of work done was not necessary to repair the damage done when the foundation caved in and water entered the basement. The appellant had proven liability with respect to a damaged triple-ply beam, the cost of which was small part of the claim. The Learned Trial Judge then awarded damages for repair of broken concrete grade beam and for other repairs in an amount much higher than damages would have been for the double-ply. HELD: The appeal was dismissed with costs of the appeal to the respondent. 1) There is a strong presumption of impartiality on the part of a trial judge. The law should not carelessly evoke the possibility of bias in a judge, whose authority depends upon that presumption. 2) While the test for judicial impartiality is stringent, the Court should not err in the admission of expert evidence. It is clear from the case law that trial judges do not rest mute. They are entitled to seek appropriate clarification and give direction and, in certain cases, disclose tentative conclusions as means of ensuring proper understanding of the case. The decisions concerning the manner in which individual proceedings are conducted are best left to the judge. 3) In the classic case of R. v. Mohan, [2007] SCC 33 (CanLII), the Court reviewed the law regarding trial unfairness in the civil context. 4) In this case, the appellant had the necessary experience in respect to foundation and structural repair that he could give expert evidence as to not only the type of foundation repair but also the need for structural repair."
4_1994canlii4625.txt,"At trial in Provincial Court, the accuseds called no evidence and were convicted. They appealed on the basis that the Crown's evidence was so insufficient that a verdict of guilty was unreasonable or was one which could not reasonably be supported on the evidence. HELD: Appeal dismissed. 1)No medical evidence was necessary to establish that the victim's injuries were caused by an assault, given the photographs admitted into evidence, the evidence of the police officer who was called to the scene of the assault and the evidence of the 7-11 clerk who was first approached by the victim for assistance. 2)Evidence of exclusive opportunity was unnecessary to sustain a conviction where there was other circumstantial evidence pointing to the identity of the accuseds. 3)Although a failure to permit an accused who calls no evidence to argue last in a jury trial might be a good ground of appeal, the failure to be permitted to argue last before a judge alone was merely a procedural error which could be cured under the curative provision contained in S.686(1)(b)(iv) of the Criminal Code.","The appellants alleged two insufficiencies in the evidence: (i) the absence of any expert evidence that the injuries sustained by the victim-complainant resulted from any blows such as kicks or punches and as such were the result of an assault; and (ii) the Crown failed to prove that an offence of assault, or indeed an offence, of any kind, had been committed. HELD: Appeal dismissed. 1) The evidence adduced by the Crown was insufficient to such a degree that the trial judge's verdict of guilty ought to be found by this Courteither unreasonable or one that cannot be supported by the evidence and, on the basis of Yebes v. The Queen, the Court of Appeal held that the evidence did not yield up any other reasonable inferences. 2) The procedural point raised by the appellants had no merit. They relied on s. 651(3) of the Code which provides that the question of identity was readily resolved by examining the circumstances immediately preceding the infliction of the injuries, by the description of the victim's injuries by the witness (the counterman at the 7-Eleven), by the opinions of both the police and the investigating officer who saw the victim shortly after the injuries were inflicted. The testimony in that respect was highly tentative and could not form an evidentiary base for reasonable inference. 3) The appellants failed on the procedural point. 4) The Circumstantial evidence of opportunity is sufficient tosustain a finding of identity beyond a reasonable doubt without resorting to medical opinion."
c_1993canlii4474.txt,"The parties lived together for 14 years and had three children, aged eight, 13 and 14. The petitioner always worked and eventually became a successful stockbroker. The respondent was employed part-time doing minimum wage jobs and was responsible for the household duties and raising their children. The petitioner's annual income was $50,000 at the time of separation, but escalated to $200,000 in 1992 and was prone to great fluctuation. The respondent was to have custody of the children. She sought spousal and child support and an unequal division of assets. Ordering support and an unequal division of assets. The court extensively reviewed the case of Moge v. Moge (1992), 43 R.F.L.(3d) 345 (S.C.C.) and found that marriage and child care responsibilities hinder a wife's role in the workplace. The court awarded $4500 per month as spousal and child support, plus an additional $500 while the wife retrained. The court considered this an appropriate case for an unequal division of matrimonial assets in the respondent's favour. Finding that the awards were still not sufficient to satisfy the respondent's needs, a lump sum award of $18,000 was ordered. On appeal.","The parties were married for seven years and had two children. The wife sought spousal and child support of $16,868. She also sought an unequal division of matrimonial assets and a lump sum award. HELD: The Court granted the petition for divorce. 1)The Court found that the Court had jurisdiction to order the wife to work more than she had agreed to do in the Partial Minutes of Settlement and that it had the jurisdiction to force the husband to find an optional security to satisfy the bank on the 'Treats' loan. 2)The court found that there was no possibility of reconciliation between the parties. The Court reviewed the numerous financial consequences to custodial parent not reflected in the direct costs of supporting a child and found that it was necessary that the wife continue to supplement her income to the extent necessary to meet that standard."
9_2011skqb49.txt,The applicant was a student at the University of Saskatchewan in the College of Medicine. He was required to discontinue his studies for failure to meet academic standards for promotion. The applicant appealed his dismissal and was unsuccessful throughout. He applied to the Court for an order of certiorari to quash the decision of the Academic Appeals Committee and the University Bylaws Committee Council and an order reinstating him as a student at the College of Medicine pending resolution of his appeal. HELD: The Court found that the Bylaws Committee Council exceeded its jurisdiction by reviewing the previous decisions made and drawing the conclusion that they were made fairly and properly. The Bylaw Committee determined the merits of the applicant's appeal and determined that it was not necessary to convene a full appeal board. There is nothing in the University policy to suggest that the Bylaws Committee has that power. The Bylaws Committee has exceeded its jurisdiction in this regard and its decision is quashed. The matter is returned to the Bylaws Committee to determine whether the applicant's appeal falls within the policy on student appeals and academic matters. The portion of the application requesting reinstatement of the applicant as a student pending the resolution of his appeal is dismissed. The applicant has a marginal academic record and there are a limited number of placements in the College of Medicine. It does not make sense to displace another student or require the College of Medicine to train a marginal student on a potentially temporary basis.,"The applicant was an undergraduate medical student who was required to discontinue his studies for failure to meet academic standards for promotion. He brought this certiorari application to quash a decision of the Academic Appeals Committee of the College of Medicine and of the University Bylaws Committee of Council. On the assumption that his applications will be successful, he seeks an order reinstating him as a student here pending resolution of his appeal. HELD: The appeal was quashed. 1) The Court was not able to interfere in the applicant's academic assessment and that the applicant can only obtain relief from the court if the proper procedures were followed. The University submits they were. 2) There is nothing in the policy to suggest the Committee has such power. In fact, if the power existed in the Committee to determine the appeals on the merits, there would be no need for it to operate as a vetting step and of course no need to establish an appeal board. There is a limit on the Committee's jurisdiction to determine whether an appeal will be heard, and that limit is prescribed in para.1(a). 3) The applicant has marginal academic record. The Committee obtained all relevant information as it related to the nature of the appeal by the applicant. It held hearing on March 31, 2010 at which the applicant gave evidence regarding previous decisions made. In the process contained in Part V(b), it was to be an informal investigation of the allegations made.

8_1994canlii4691.txt,"The landlord applied for possession of residential premises after his tenants refused to vacate in response to a written notice to vacate. The deputy rentalsman ordered that the landlord should have possession, but also ordered that the last two months rent would abate in order to assist the tenants with their moving costs. The landlord appealed the abatement of rent and a chambers judge reversed the deputy rentalsman. The tenants sought and were granted leave to appeal the chambers judge and this appeal resulted. HELD: Appeal allowed. 1)The chambers judge could only reverse the deputy rentalsman if he exceeded his jurisdiction or erred in law. 2)The deputy rentalsman had jurisdiction to order an abatement of rent pursuant to S.47(4) of the Act. 3)The jurisdiction is a discretionary one. The court will therefore show some deference to a decision of the rentalsman involving this jurisdiction. In this case the deputy rentalsman made no reversible error.","The issues in this case began long before the notice of termination of tenancy (which ultimately prompted this Court's involvement) and stem from a number of complaints made by both the tenants and the landlord. The landlord began leasing his premises to the tenants in August 1993. The tenants applied first to the Rentalsman's Office for an order directing the landlord to do certain repairs and maintenance. On March 21, 1994, the landlord served the tenants with a notice of the termination notice. On June and July, the deputy rentalsman reviewed the tenants' complaints and issued a decision. He did not provide a legal reason which would preclude him from making the decision. The Deputy rentalsman's decision on the landlord's claim for possession was rendered May 13, 1994. HELD: The appeal was allowed and the decision of the rentalsman restored. As neither the landlord nor the tenant was represented by counsel, there was no order as to costs.  1)It is my interpretation of the deputy rentalman's order that he was exercising jurisdiction under s.47(4), and it was possible for him to so exercise that jurisdiction. This obviates the necessity of deciding whether he also had the jurisdiction to abate rent under s47(2).  2)The issue was whether the landlord and tenant had the same right to a share of the rent in a rented premises. The differences between the landlords and tenants did not solely arise from reasonable complaints by tenants."
c_1993canlii5621.txt,"The appellant was convicted of sexually touching a young girl who was under the age of 14. He contended the trial judge erred by permitting the complainant to testify behind a screen without first conducting a voir dire and by relying on Crown's submission the girl would be uncomfortable without the screen. As well, he argued the judge improperly permitted the complainant to read a statement given to the police, to refresh her memory during cross-examination. Dismissing the appeal, that the fairness of the trial was in no way impaired by use of the screen, and no miscarriage of justice occurred. The statement was given the complainant by defence counsel, who suggested she read v.

Allowing the appeal and ordering an appeal, that the trial judge erred in permitting the complainant to testify behind a screen without first conducting a voir dire and by relying solely upon the representations of Crown counsel to the effect that she would be uncomfortable without a screen. HELD: The appeal was dismissed and the sentence was abandoned. 1)The trial judge was the trier of fact and in many incidents it was necessary for him to obtain explanations of the evidence that had not been made clear during the direct and cross-examination of counsel.

c_2014skqb284.txt,HELD: The court dismissed both applications. The respondent’s voluntary decision to significantly reduce his income was insufficient grounds to vary his child support application. The court found that there had not been a material change in the circumstances with regard to the petitioner’s application.,"The respondent father applied to reduce his child support obligation and to extinguish arrears of child support as a result of him quitting his job and embarking on an apprenticeship program to become an electrician. Both parties sought to vary the existing court order regarding support and parenting. HELD: The application to vary child support was granted. The respondent father was found to be earning $75,000 per year and was in excess of $10,000 in arrear. The petitioner mother applied to become the sole custodian parent of the parties' two daughters. The father was to take immediate steps to put himself back into position to provide for child support payments. The court was unable to find that there had been a material change in circumstances as required by the previous order, and the petitioner's application in this regard was dismissed.  1) While there was an application brought by each party, the application was not made in the Petition pursuant to s. 10 of The Family Maintenance Act, 1997. 2) The petitioner was unsuccessful in opposing this application and was entitled to costs which fix in the amount of $200,000. 3) The father's voluntary decision to significantly reduce his income was found by the court to be insufficient grounds to vary his childsupport obligation. It was apparent he was capable of earning considerably higher income and had taken no steps to test the job market. The Court considered Tice like suspension of payments to allow the respondent to obtain appropriate remunerative employment. However, this does not appear to be an appropriate case for the court's discretion in this way."

HELD: Appeal dismissed. 1)The legislation provides for an appeal to the Court of Queen's Bench and for no further appeal. Such an appeal can be taken on the following grounds: (a)the committee exceeded its jurisdiction; (b)it failed to observe the rules of natural justice; (c)it made an error of law; (d)its findings can not be reasonably supported by the evidence which it was entitled to consider. 2) The Court found no error of jurisdiction or failure to observe the rules of natural justice. 3)The Court found no palpable or overriding error in the facts as determined by the Committee based on the evidence.","An amedical doctor was reassessed and ordered to repay money for billings already received as a result of services provided to patients. The Committee did not have jurisdiction to enter into the investigation of the physician. There was insufficient evidence before the Committee to constitute proof that the physician was paid by the Minister by reason of departure from pattern of medical practice acceptable to the Committee. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. 1)With respect to the factual findings of the committee, the court must critically examine the evidence and ask whether, taken as whole, it reasonably supports the findings of fact, and examine the reasons by the committee carefully to see whether its ultimate decision is based on reasonable findings. 2)There was no evidence to support the Committee's decision on the merits. 3)The Committee misinterpreted the Act. The evidence, all of which was provided by the cardiologist, should lead the committee to the inevitable conclusion that he is a competent cardiologist and that his practice follows more closely that of other cardiologists rather than a family physician. 4)The committee exceeded its jurisdiction by basing its decision on irrelevant considerations and thereby abused its discretion and further acted on inadequate materials."
9_2010skqb122.txt,"FIAT: This is an application for an order pursuant to s. 63(2) of The Personal Property Security Act requiring the respondents or those in possession to deliver to the applicant four pieces of construction equipment. The four pieces of equipment were rented by applicant, Inland, to respondents, Mike Dery Holdings Ltd. and Giants Head Excavating Ltd. pursuant to an equipment rental contract entered into at Penticton, British Columbia, between April 21, 2008 and August 6, 2008. Inland did not register any security interest in the equipment in British Columbia or Saskatchewan until October 20, 2009. In the fall of 2008, the equipment was transported to Saskatchewan by Mike Dery Holdings Ltd. and/or Giants Head. In February of 2009, respondent 101138096 purchased the equipment from Mike Dery Holdings Ltd. and Giants Head for valuable consideration. Searches were completed to establish no registrations against the equipment. In April of 2009, the equipment was leased to Giants Head and a security agreement registered in Saskatchewan on May 5, 2009 listing the equipment as general property but not specifically registering the equipment by serial number. The security agreement was taken by 101138096 to secure the rental payments owed to it under the lease by Giants Head who had possession of the equipment. Mike Dery Holdings Ltd. and Giants Head defaulted under their payments to Inland and Giants Head defaulted in its payments to 101138096. September 18, 2009, 101138096 seized the equipment leaving it in the possession of Giants Head. The equipment was subsequently removed from Giants Head's possession and stored at the farm of Bruce Bakken. On October 19, 2009, 101138096 forwarded a letter to Giants Head confirming that 101138096 had elected to retain the equipment as payment for the outstanding indebtedness. As of this date a Personal Property Security registry search in Saskatchewan disclosed no security interest other than that of 101138096 in the equipment. Inland subsequently registered both a British Columbia and Saskatchewan Personal Property registry interest by serial number respecting the equipment and its original agreements of 2008. The issue before the Court is whether Inland by virtue of its Personal Property Security registration by serial number on October 20, 2009 has priority over the interest of 101138096 which registered earlier as general security without serial numbers but who alleges to have taken possession of the equipment and elected to retain the equipment seized in satisfaction of Giants Head's indebtedness October 19, 2009. This occurred one day prior to the registration of the security interest by serial number of Inland. HELD: The application is dismissed with costs to the respondents. The respondent 101138096 had a general security registered and had actual possession of the equipment in early October 2009 which therefore perfected its security while it retained possession. As of October 19, 2009 when 101138096 elected to take the collateral as satisfaction of the debt the only party to whom notice was required was the debtor Giants Head and his notice is in compliance with s. 61(1) and s. 61(3) of the Act. When the applicant completed its registration on October 20, 2009 the collateral was no longer available because of 101138096's election on October 19, 2009. The respondent perfected its security interest in the equipment which is subject to this application by taking possession thereof. Electing to take the collateral as satisfaction of the obligation secured and providing the required notices prior to registration by the applicant, transferred title to the equipment to the respondent 101138096 free and clear of the claim of the applicant.","FIAT.

HELD: The applicant's application was dismissed with costs to the respondent. The registration under the Act made by Inland as registration number 300516894 was discharged.  1)The respondent perfected its security interest by taking possession of equipment which was subject to this application. Electing to take the collateral as satisfaction of the obligation secured and providing the required notices prior to registration by the applicant, transferred title to the equipment free and clear of the claim of the applicant.  2)The applicant was ordered to register both British Columbia and Saskatchewan personal property registry interest by serial number as well as SPSA.  3)The registration of the security agreement made by the respondent in 2009 had priority over that of the interest of the respondent who registered earlier as general security without serial numbers but who alleges to have taken possession in satisfaction of Giants Head’s indebtedness October 19, 2009."

He declared bankruptcy in July 1994 and is still financially dependent on Sandra. 3) The children have significant student loans. The husband earned $48,000. By 1993, the first year in which he was required to pay a total of $4,200 his income was only 42% of his 1992 income. However, he actually paid little in excess of his required payment that year. 4) The wife has been paying child support since the agreement was signed and the husband has not paid any ongoing maintenance for the children."
b_1996canlii6818.txt,"At issue was the determination of the quantum of spousal and child support and division of matrimonial property. HELD: 1)The respondent's supplementary allowances were taken into consideration in finding a gross salary of $53,000.00 per annum. Due to an injury he was no longer able to work overtime but was working full-time. Should a medical discharge become necessary an application to vary can be brought at that time. 2)The petitioner suffered a substantial economic disadvantage. The frequent moves due to the husband's employment had disrupted the petitioner's employment and university education. However, the court must also take into consideration the economic advantage enjoyed as a result of the marriage including the pension plan of the spouse. 3)If the petitioner did receive the greater share of the household goods it can be attributed to partial compensation for her economic disadvantage. Shares in joint names were divided equally. Other assets were divided equally. 4)Upon the granting of the divorce the petitioner will be disqualified from receiving the pension survivorship benefits. The fair solution was to use the enhanced value of the 'With Survivorship Benefits' column and the date of adjudication was used as the valuation date. The combination method of valuation was used in view of the 15 year marriage and given the economic disadvantage suffered by the petitioner. 5)The parties agreed that child support should be set in accordance with the Federal/Provincial/Territorial guidelines based on the respondent's gross yearly income. $600.00 per month per child was awarded.  6)The court must seek to promote the economic self-sufficiency of each spouse. The petitioner's future plans were realistic. $800 per month until June 1, 2001 was awarded for spousal support.  7)Costs including one-half of the cost of preparing reports and pension valuations were awarded to the petitioner.","The petitioner commenced this divorce action against the respondent in 1990. She claimed custody of the children, support for both herself and the children and an equal division of matrimonial property and costs. HELD: 1)The Court held that the reasonable and realistic figure to use for the determination of maintenance for the children was a gross salary of $53,000 per annum. The Court also held that spousal and child support should be based on the Federal/Provincial/Territorial Family Law Committee's report and Recommendations on Child Support. 2)The respondent was granted custody with reasonable access to the petitioner upon reasonable notice. There was no issue of a medical discharge. The court valued the respondent's pension at $56,000. The respondent's income was $52,000, which was in excess of the amount recommended by the court. 3)The court found that the respondent should retain the goods in her or his possession without further adjustment. Given the length of the marriage and the options open to the respondent to enhance the value of his pension for his personal benefit and, more importantly, the significant economic disadvantage suffered by the petitioner, the Court awarded him the sum of $5,340."

The applicant sought an order pursuant to s63 of the Personal Property Security Act (PPSA) declaring that the agreement between the parties was a security agreement within the definition of the Personal Property Security Act rather than a lease and that the respondent was limited to a lien pursuant to s18 of the Limitation of Civil Rights Act; and an order that funds paid into court pursuant to a pre-judgment garnishee summons be returned to the applicant. The respondent seized the vehicle and issued a statement of claim for $5,330.81 as arrears of lease payments. The applicant had made payments for several months and acknowledged that she was in default on the payments for the tractor-trailer unit but contended the agreement was not a lease and that the respondent, having repossessed the collateral, was not now entitled to claim any additional payments. HELD: The application was dismissed. Costs in the cause. 1)The relief sought did not fall within any of the wording of s63(2) of the Personal Property Security Act and therefore there was no jurisdiction to grant the relief requested. The application was simply an attempt to end run the action commenced by the respondent. 2)The applicant was not seeking to remedy a wrong with respect to the seizure or preservation of the collateral but was seeking a remedy pursuant to the Limitations of Civil Rights Act.

HELD: The application was dismissed. Costs of this application were in the cause. 1)The applicant did not take issue with the repossession effected by the respondent but rather was seeking a ruling that the respondent, having repossessed the collateral, is not now entitled to claim any additional payments owing from the applicant. 2)The application was misconceived.

3_1999canlii12362.txt,"The appellant appeals his conviction of sexual assault causing bodily harm on the ground the trial judge erred in preventing cross-examination of the complainant. The trial judge prevented the cross-examination of the complainant in relation to a previous allegation she had made relating to this sexual assault. The offence is alleged to have taken place at home of the appellant's brother. The appellant was asked by his brother and sister-in-law to babysit their daughter. The allegation was that the appellant had entered her parent's bedroom where she was sleeping and sexually assaulted her. The appellant, who has no previous record, was convicted of the charge and sentenced to three years imprisonment. The appellant during cross-examination of the complainant attempted to question her regarding a previous allegation regarding the same sexual assault against another person. The trial judge did not permit this line of questioning as he held it pertained to her past sexual history. HELD: Appeal allowed. The failure of the trial judge to allow this cross-examination has prevented the appellant from having a fair trial as he has been denied the opportunity to make full answer and defence. It seems the question that should have been put to the trial judge on this occasion was whether this section was applicable to a situation involving non-consensual sex. The complainant was not being questioned about her consensual sexual activities but rather a previous complainant of a sexual assault. It is understood the intent was to indicate the complainant had implicated someone else as the assailant and after investigation the complaint had not been acted upon. That evidence could have placed in doubt the reliability of the complainant's identification of the person who assaulted her since the room was dark when the assault was alleged to have occurred. The relevance of such a question pertaining to the existence of another complaint made by the complainant in respect of the same assault is obvious. That question has a direct bearing on her credibility.",The appellant was found guilty of having sexually assaulted the complainant contrary to s. 272(c) of the Criminal Code. He appealed the conviction on the ground that the trial judge erroneously interpreted s. 276 of the Code to prevent proper cross-examination of the complainant in relation to a previous allegation she had made relating to this sexual assault. HELD: The appeal was allowed and a new trial ordered. 1)The Crown contends that the intent of the section is to protect the privacy of any sexual activity of a complainant and that right should just as appropriately extend to instances where that person is the victim of an assault. 2)The failure to permit the appellant to cross-examine the complainant regarding another complaint she made about sexual assault prevented the appellant from having a fair trial as he has been denied the opportunity to make full answer and defence.

HELD: Appeal dismissed. Section 228 has no application to payment of chronic pain benefit for injuries during the window period.

6_2001canlii365.txt,"The accused was charged with impaired driving (Criminal Code ss.255(1) and 253(a)) and with operating a motor vehicle while having a blood alcohol concentration exceeding .08 (Criminal Code ss.253(b) and 255(1)). Issues included whether the Court should enter a stay of proceedings and award costs, given the failure of the Crown to produce a standard alcohol solution (SAS); could mouth alcohol have invalidated the roadside screening test; did the arresting officer have reasonable and probable grounds to demand a breath sample; was the accused denied his right to counsel; was the breathalyzer test administered as soon as practicable; was there evidence to the contrary? HELD: The accused was found not guilty on count #2 (exceeding .08). Count #1 (impaired driving) was dismissed during the trial.  1)The court was cognizant of the burden of proof and had reviewed the decision of R. v. Lifchus concerning reasonable doubt. 2)The accused's testimony was rejected as not being credible. 3)The burden lies with the applicant on an application pursuant to ss.7 and 24(1) of the Charter in which the defence alleges the accused's right to make full answer and defence has been infringed. The question remained whether once the defence established it sought the SAS but it was not provided for whatever reason, had it discharged its burden or must it prove the failure to produce the SAS solution could have a meaningful outcome on the trial. 4)The accused's s.7 Charter right to make full answer and defence was infringed by the failure of the Crown to produce a sample of the SAS solution in this case. In light of the Bourget and Kalafut decisions, the Crown has had ample opportunity to establish a system for routinely saving the solution until after a case has been concluded. It would bring the administration of justice into disrepute were the Certificate of Analysis admitted into evidence. It was more appropriate to exclude the Certificate of Analysis than to grant a stay of proceedings.  5)Costs are rarely awarded in criminal proceedings. Given the evidence presented concerning the usefulness of testing a representative SAS ampule had it been produced, the court was not persuaded costs should be awarded. 6)There was no evidence that created a reasonable doubt as to the time that elapsed or that there may have been mouth alcohol which may have invalidated the roadside screening test. Both the subjective and objective tests were met. The arresting officer, who has no reason to believe an accused has consumed alcohol in the last 15 minutes, may administer the roadside screening test without delay, but to do so carries with it a certain risk that there may be subsequently evidence which will invalidate the results (affecting the objective element of the test). Further, the officer has no duty to routinely wait 15 minutes before administering the test nor to ask the accused whether or not alcohol has been consumed in the preceding 15 minutes. However, if there are circumstances which suggest the officer should have waited or inquired about alcohol consumption, this may affect the reasonableness of the officer's belief (the subjective test). 7)There was nothing in the evidence to support the submission that the speedometers need to be checked to support the officer's evidence. The officer was acting in the lawful execution of his duty in stopping the accused's vehicle. While doing so he detected an odour of alcohol on the accused's breath which gave rise to the demand for a roadside screening. 8)The informational component of the right to counsel was satisfied. There was no evidence the accused misunderstood his right nor that he was not given sufficient opportunity to contact counsel. He declined twice, giving a clear and unequivocal waiver. Absent special circumstance, the police cannot be expected to draw information out of the accused. 9)The samples were taken as soon as practicable. It was accepted that there was typically no one available at the detachment in the small community and was sufficient reason to not consider attending there given the proximity of the city. The officer tried the closest detachment but found no one there. It may have been more important to question the judgment of the officer to return to the Saskatoon detachment if the delay had been more significant. On the face of it, the delay of 27 minutes did not seem unreasonable. 10)The statutory presumption applied. There was no evidence to the contrary as the accused's evidence was rejected. The court reviewed R. v. Gibson and considered s.258(1)(c) and (d.1) of the Criminal Code.","The accused was charged with impaired driving contrary to s. 255(1) and 253(a) of the Criminal Code and operating a motor vehicle while under the influence of alcohol. At 1:42 a.m., a roadside screening was performed and the accused failed the roadside breathalyser test. The officer made a demand that the accused provide a breath sample for analysis. The accused refused and the officer read from his 'card' when making the demand and again when making a breath analysis demand; he read those demands from that card when giving his evidence. HELD: The accused's Charter rights were breached and the only appropriate remedy was stay of proceedings and costs.  1) The accused was qualified to give expert testimony concerning the operation of the breathalyzer machine used, the quality of the solution, its reliability and the effect of alcohol on human brain function. 2) There was no issue to determine until the Certificate of Analyses was filed and the pertinent evidence was heard. 3) It was not necessary that this be a 'live issue' or does the defence have an absolute right to this disclosure and does it follow that failure to produce the standard alcohol solution calls for a judicial stay or costs? 4) It is the duty of the Crown to make timely disclosure to the defence of all evidence supporting innocence or mitigating the offence. The Crown plays an essential role in the truth-finding function of our system. The need to develop all the relevant facts in the adversary system is both fundamental and comprehensive. The ends of criminal justice would be defeated if judgments or verdicts were to be fashioned on partial or speculative presentation of the facts. The very integrity of the judicial system and public confidence it must depend upon full disclosure of all the facts, within the framework of the rules of evidence. Accordingly, our approach with respect to the production and discovery of objects or material for independent testing must comport with that fundamental notion.  5) The Court was not impressed with the testimony of the accused and reject it. There is never any one reason for rejecting the evidence of a witness. The evidence of the Accused was straightforward and reliable."
3_1991canlii4569.txt,"The appellant appealed his conviction for sexual assault using a weapon and his sentence of eight years. The appellant contended that his counsel had failed to call the complainant's boyfriend as a witness even though he was in the courthouse under a defence subpoena. The appellant also raised on appeal the fact that he had lost his right to a jury trial. He had failed to appear at the jury trial scheduled and a bench warrant had been issued. The Crown had then applied for an order that the appellant was no longer entitled to a jury trial and the record showed that his counsel had agreed to forfeit the right to a jury trial. The appellant contended that his counsel and the Crown both advised him he had lost his right by failing to appear and that he was not told that he could avoid losing his right if he had a legitimate excuse for failing to appear. He put forth the excuse of having had no counsel at the time of the trial. Dismissing the appeal, (1) that there was nothing to show that the witness would have given relevant evidence bearing on a decisive issue in the trial and the appellant failed to meet the burden of showing that the evidence, if believed, could reasonably have been expected to affect the result of the trial when considered with all the other evidence; counsel's decision not to call the witness where the witness was hostile and counsel did not know what he would say was not inappropriate, and, the court noted, in the circumstances, seemed to have been the right decision; (2) the excuse of failing to appear because he did not have counsel was not a legitimate excuse within the meaning of s. 598(1)(a) of the Criminal Code; moreover, the appellant only raised this issue in his oral submissions and gave no notice to the Crown respecting this issue nor did he provide any supporting evidence by way of affidavit; it was seen by the Court as another unsupported and unjustified criticism of counsel and the Court concluded that the record showed that the appellant had agreed to forfeit his right to a jury trial; and (3) that an eight year sentence, although at the high end of the scale for sexual assault, was not manifestly excessive, having regard to deterrence, the circumstances of the offence, and the appellant's record which included three minor offences.","The appellant was convicted of sexual assault. He applied for leave to appeal against the sentence of 8 years imprisonment. Dismissing the appeal, that although he had intercourse with the complainant, such was with her consent. The firearms prohibition order made by Chief Justice Glube under s.100(1) of the Code will, of course, remain in force and effect. HELD: Appeal dismissed. 1)It is an accepted constitutional principle in the United States that the right of an accused to 'have the assistance of counsel for his defence' guaranteed by the Sixth Amendment. 2)The respondent must show in addition to the lack of competence on the part of defence counsel that there is a reasonable probability that, but for counsel's unprofessional errors, the result of the trial would have been different."
b_1995canlii6027.txt,"The accused appealed her conviction on a charge of impaired driving. The grounds of her appeal were that the trial judge erred in determining that she was impaired, and that the trial judge otherwise misconstrued and misapplied the evidence. HELD: Appeal dismissed.  1)Both grounds of appeal raised questions of fact. Findings of fact are not to be reversed on appeal unless it can be established that the trial judge has made some palpable and overriding error which affected her assessment of the facts. 2)The Court's task is not to retry the case or substitute its own decision. A trial judge's findings of fact can only be overturned if they are so clearly wrong as to make the decision unreasonable. 3)The Court was unable to say that an error of that kind was made by the trial judge in this case.","The appellant appeals from the conviction of driving while impaired contrary to s. 253(a) of the Criminal Code. The grounds for appeal are that the conviction was contrary to the law, the evidence and weight of the evidence;(b)That the learned trial judge made an error in law in determining the degree of impairment by alcohol or drug required before aconviction can be entered; (c)Such further and other grounds as counsel may advise and this court may allow. The appellant has not shown an error by the trial judge on any of these grounds."
4_2009skca44.txt,"The respondent Homeowners sued the respondents Sebastian and the TWC alleging negligence or breach of contract for failing to obtain the coverage for insurance as instructed by the Homeowners. Sebastian and TWC issued a third party claim against the appellant SGI and claimed SGI was negligent or in breach of contract or contributory negligence pursuant to the Contributory Negligence Act for failing to issue a policy of insurance in accordance with the application submitted to SGI by Sebastian on behalf of the Homeowners. The trial judge concluded Sebastian and TWC were negligent and liable for the loss suffered by the Homeowners. Further, the trial judge concluded that the insurer, SGI, owed a duty of care to both Sebastian and TWC and the Homeowners to properly underwrite and deal with the application for insurance. The trial judge concluded SGI contributed equally to the Homeowners' loss by 'their negligent acts' and was responsible to pay 50% of the judgment. The negligence of Sebastian and TWC is not disputed in this appeal. The Homeowners have been paid the amount owed under the judgment and advised they have no interest in the matter and did not participate in the appeal. SGI appeals and submits the trial judge erred in determining that SGI: (a) owed a duty of care to the insureds, Homeowners, and to the broker when it received an application for insurance in 'all the circumstances'; and (b) breached its duty of care. HELD: That portion of the judgment finding that SGI is liable for 50% of the damages payable to the Homeowners is set aside and the Third Party Claim is dismissed. Accordingly, the appeal is allowed with costs to the Appellant. The trial judge correctly placed the duty of care on the intermediary, Sebastian. It is clear the insurer relies on the broker to apply for the coverage in accordance with his clients' (i.e., the insureds') wishes and needs. There was no other evidence before the Court to establish the standard of care, the basis for imposing a duty at law where none has previously existed, or the subsequent breach of that duty by the insurer, SGI, in connection to the application for insurance submitted by Sebastian. The Court concluded there was nothing in this transaction which warrants the creation of a duty of care owed by the insurer to a broker applying for insurance on behalf of his clients.","The appellant, a licensed insurance agent, prepared a HomePak Application on behalf of the Homeowners for the purpose of obtaining policy of insurance for their Swarovski crystal collection. The appellant prepared a form which cancelled the prior home insurance policy issued by SGI, which had been placed by McCallum Hill in 1992. SGI denied coverage on the basis of the exclusion in the policy; the loss was due to an accidental breakage which did not constitute a 'listed peril' as defined by the policy. HELD: The appeal was allowed. The trial judge correctly placed the duty of care on the appellant. He gathered the information from the homeowners, reviewed the existing coverage, and completed the application. He did not ask to see the policy nor did he contribute to the amount of the judgment payable to the Homeowner. Although the appellant was negligent and liable for the loss, the trial judge concluded the appellant contributed 50%/50% by their negligent acts, to the loss sustained by the Draders. There is no general duty on the insurer to provide coverage beyond what is understood by the broker."
8_2010skqb467.txt,"Employees were entitled to wage adjustments under the collective bargaining agreement. The plaintiff union brought an application for an interlocutory injunction requiring the defendant to pay employees who were retiring in 2010 their wage adjustments in the current calendar year. This was an issue because it would affect pensions and retirement dates. In the alternative, the union argued the employer should pay the entitlements before the year end on a 'best approximation' basis or be required to proceed to an expedited arbitration. The defendant brought a motion to strike or dismiss the plaintiff's motion under Queen's Bench Rules 99 and 173 on the basis that the issues raised were terms and conditions of the employment contract and outside the jurisdiction of the Court according to the terms of the collective bargaining agreement. HELD: The defendant's application was dismissed because the Court has residual discretionary jurisdiction to grant relief not available under a statutory arbitration scheme. The plaintiff's application for an injunction was also dismissed. While there may be a serious issue to be tried, the pleadings do not set forth a strong prima facie case. While there might be some irreparable harm to some employees, in general terms the losses can be dealt with through damages. It would be impossible for the defendant to meet a deadline two weeks away because of the complexity of the calculations. It is not appropriate to grant an injunction requiring the defendant to make payment before the end of 2010 and it is not reasonable to make payments based on best approximation. The Court has no jurisdiction to force arbitration on the parties.","The plaintiff union, SEIU-West, represents approximately 11,000 health care workers employed by the four defendant regional health authorities and their affiliates. The plaintiff union represents approximately 10,000 Health Care Workers. The current collective bargaining agreement covers the period April 1, 2008 to March 31, 2012. The tentative agreement was reached on August 13, 2010 and ratified by the union membership on September 16, 2010. However the formal CBA, very lengthy and complex document, was not signed until October 2010. The plaintiffs concede that the court is without jurisdiction to determine the issue based on the CBA and the Weber principle. They contend however that the statement of claim, while it does not assert a viable cause of action, can nevertheless serve as a platform for the present application for mandatory injunctive relief. HELD: The motion to strike was dismissed.  1) It is not appropriate for the court to grant an injunction requiring the defendants to make retroactive adjustment payments before the end of 2010. Neither do I see any reasonable prospect of a solution to the problem by making payments on a 'best approximation' of entitlement. That is a viable solution. The results of such solution are likely to be troublesome and chaotic. 2) As to the alternative of directing an expedited arbitration and appointing an arbitrator it can nevertheless subsist if only to provide a platform of pleading to support an application for interlocutory relief. More particularly, if the court were to encroach on the arbitration process in the way that has been proposed by the plaintiffs the result would be inconsistent with the determination of the Supreme Court in the Weber case that the model of overlapping jurisdiction is no longer to be followed."
7_2010skqb33.txt,"The accused was convicted of common assault, break and enter and commit assault and assault causing bodily harm and his former common law spouse was the complainant in each instance. The accused also entered guilty pleas to three charges stemming from breaches of no-contact conditions with the same complainant plus two charges of obstruction of justice by attempting to dissuade the same complainant from giving evidence. The RCMP had to execute a Feeney warrant to locate the complainant in the accused basement. The Crown sought an order declaring the accused a dangerous offender. HELD: The accused was designated a dangerous offender and was sentenced to imprisonment in a penitentiary for an indeterminate period on the conviction pursuant to s. 267(b) of the Criminal Code and received time served on the remaining eight charges. The evidence is conclusive that the offence for which the accused was convicted was a serious personal injury offence. The evidence was conclusive that the accused constitutes a threat to other persons because of his pattern of repetitive behaviour and persistent aggressive behaviour. The accused's First Nation would provide support for the accused but its support system is presently non-existent. The Court rejected the expert opinions recommending a long term offender order as being appropriate.","The accused was convicted of assault causing bodily harm contrary to s. 267(b) of the Criminal Code and from obstructing justice by dissuading or attempting to dissuade a witness from testifying against him. The Crown applied for an order that the accused be declared a dangerous offender. HELD: The accused was found to be neither dangerous nor long-term offender. The Court of Appeal addressed the requisite factual underpinnings to assist the sentencing judge in determining whether the sentencing sanctions under s. 753.1 are sufficient to reduce the threat of public harm to an acceptable level. 1)The accused had a pattern of repetitive behaviour showing failure to restrain his behaviour and likelihood of causing death or injury to other persons. The Gladue factors must be considered in determining his sentence. 2)If the Crown has failed to prove that J.R.S. qualifies as a long term offender, the court is required to impose a sentence on the accused for the convictions. The court is of the view that if the accused has proven both patterns of behaviour, it does not have to prove both. The pattern does not depend upon the number of offences but on the repetitive nature of the offender's behaviour. 3)The sentencing principles articulated in R. v. Lemaigre (2004) were often referred to as the 'Gladue factors'. 4)The Crown was only required to prove the pattern of behaviour as defined by s.753(a)(i) and/or (ii). 5)The court was of the opinion that it could not rely on the RCMP to provide whatever evidence would assist the court in determining that a long- term offender designation could be imposed."

He claimed for pain and suffering, loss of income and loss of earning capacity. Plaintiff was found 60% responsible for injuries and defendant 40% responsible. Damages were assessed as follows: $8,500.00 for general damages, $5,000.00 as damages for loss of income and $1,000.00 for loss of ability to perform household tasks. The dolly cart out of view behind the counter was an 'unusual danger' which the defendant knew or ought to have known of and reasonable care was not used to prevent injury. However, the plaintiff failed to look at the floor as his attention was focused on the door. He assumed nothing had changed in the area from the time he entered the premises a few minutes previously. The plaintiff was in commercial premises and should have taken greater care to observe and avoid anything in his path. The plaintiff suffered an injury which restricted his activities for the first five months, to a lesser extent for the following year and to a very limited extent to the time of trial. There was no evidence to support a claim for diminishment of earning capacity.","The plaintiff injured his right knee when he tripped over a 'dolly-cart' while attending at the premises of the defendant. The plaintiff was attending to pick up lumber and other materials for a job on which he was working. He was unable to fully participate in the business and, as a result, suffered loss in that he was required to hire other persons to carry out some of his tasks. The court awarded the plaintiff $5,000.00 by way of general damages. HELD: The plaintiff had suffered an injury; the injury restricted his activities during the remainder of 1995 and to lesser extent the following year and to very limited extent, continues to the present.

c_1993canlii4476.txt,"The solicitor for the plaintiff union had been a partner of the law firm which incorporated the defendant company and was under a general retainer to them. Several of the defendants made application to have the plaintiff s solicitor removed as solicitor of record claiming this was a conflict of interest. Dismissing the application, that the test in such circumstances is whether the public represented by the reasonably informed person would be satisfied that no use of confidential information would occur. To do so it must be shown that a solicitor client relationship existed. There must not be a danger of the confidential information coming back to haunt the client. The court found that such a relationship did not exist in this instance. In addition, the applicant must demonstrate that the solicitor received information which is relevant to the matter at hand. The court found no such evidence of this possibility. It is no bar to representation by a solicitor that some former partners at a previous firm will be examined for discovery or called to testify.","HELD: The Court found that there was no conflict of interest and that Pink Breen would be permitted to continue to act. The applicants should show by fact or even by reasonable inference that the substance of the current action was broached during the plaintiff's tenure at the plaintiff, that the seeds of the alleged scheme were sown during their tenure. There was no evidence before the court that a solicitor and client relationship existed between the applicants and the plaintiff. The court found that the confidences were relevant and that they were shared amongst the lawyers of the plaintiff firm. The Court also concluded that the plaintiff had not breached its fiduciary duty to the plaintiff by disclosing confidential information to the defendant. The decision was based on the strong inference that lawyers who work together share confidences cannot, without waiver, come back to haunt him inadvertently or otherwise."

The defendant proposed to open a pharmacy on the premises. Another tenant in the shopping centre already operated a drug store and their lease provided that no other tenant would operate a drug store in any part of their premises. The other tenant brought an application for a interim injunction against the defendant. The receiver of the shopping centre also brought an application for a declaration that the defendant could not operate a pharmacy on its premises. The defendant objected to the receiver's application on the basis that it involved controverted issues of fact requiring a trial. Application for interim injunction dismissed on the basis that the applicant had not established irreparable harm; the receiver's application could proceed as an application as the potential for a factual dispute was insubstantial; defendant provided with the option of either accepting an adjournment to allow time for further investigation, the conduct of discoveries and the presenting of any further evidence or moving for the court's further consideration.",HELD: The application was dismissed. There was no factual dispute concerning the legal formation of the Sobeys lease. It was to be enforced according to its terms as amended. The essential aspects of the conduct alleged to constitute breach were known and uncontraverted. The plaintiffs relied upon Miller v. Toews and Canada v. LeBlanc for the proposition that the enquiry into irreparable harm is less vigorous or less telling in cases of breach of negative covenants. The receiver applied for a permanent injunction and the application for permanent injunction were dismissed. The court found that it would not automatically engage in a prolonged examination of the merits just because a breach was alleged.
d_2000skca131.txt,"The Crown sought leave to appeal the sentence of 2.5 years for manslaughter on the grounds it was not proportionate to the gravity of the offence and failed to meet the requirements of deterrence and denunciation. HELD: A sentence of 5 years of imprisonment was imposed. The sentence was set aside because it did not comply with the fundamental principle of sentencing that it be proportionate to the gravity of the offence nor achieved the objective of denunciation of crimes of this nature. The manslaughter resulted from a common criminal enterprise, planned in advance, and was expected to be violent. The accused pled guilty, had no criminal record, did not participate in the actual physical beating and stabbing of the victim who died from the wounds or of the other victim; she intervened to stop the beating although only after being satisfied the alleged the drug dealer had nothing to give the robbers.  The accused appeared to be doing well in the prison programs. The sentence of the co-accused who had a record of 40 previous convictions had been increased to the equivalent of more than 10 years imprisonment.","The 18 year old single mother of one child and three months pregnant with a second child, pleaded guilty to a charge of manslaughter and was sentenced to 2½ years imprisonment.

5_2010nspc18.txt,"The on-site supervisor was convicted of two offences under the Fall Protection and Scaffolding Regulations (failing to ensure a guardrail was installed at the perimeter of the work area and failing to ensure that an intermediate or 'mid' guardrail was installed) after a mason was killed when he fell from scaffolding on the job site. Prior to the mason beginning work for the day and the supervisor temporarily leaving the site, he had told another employee to install a 'mid' guardrail but no such rail was in place when the mason fell. The court found that having decided to use guardrails, the defendant was required to make certain that those guardrails were, in fact, constructed in the manner prescribed in the regulations and to supervise and inspect the scaffolding before work was undertaken, no matter the experience level of his crew. In regard to the first count, what the supervisor thought might be a substitute for part of a proper guardrail system did not comply with the regulations. The defendant will donate $2,000 to the Public Education Trust Fund and make 18 presentations at various venues over the next 18 months; he will appear in court on a specified date to provide a status report on his progress in this regard. This was not a case of reckless disregard or deliberate indifference to the legislated safety measures and the defendant's degree of moral blameworthiness was at the lower end of the continuum as he neither created nor negligently left in place a hidden hazard. Both the actions of another workman and the deceased's own actions had contributed to the fall.","The defendant was found guilty of two counts in the Information alleging contraventions of the Fall Protection and Scaffolding Regulations. He was working on a work platform supported by scaffolding that was approximately 13 feet above the concrete sidewalk. As he stepped out and reached to secure his block or level line, he placed one foot on the open edge of a false ceiling suspended by wires under the roof overhang. When he placed his weight on that false ceiling, it gave way and the defendant fell off the work platform. He suffered serious injuries and died as a result of his fall. The defendant had the greatest degree of control and authority and he had the ability to create and maintain a safe and healthy workplace. However, the defendant bore a very high degree of moral blameworthiness and the appropriate range of fine and creative sentencing options was significantly lower than the range recommended by the Crown."
b_2018skca65.txt,"HELD: The appeal was allowed and a new trial ordered. In this case, the court found that the judge had not erred in his decisions regarding the first and the third requests for adjournment but had in the second request by failing to provide sufficient reasons for his denial. Amongst many factors it considered, the court found that most importantly, the appellant had not caused his counsel to withdraw for the purpose of delaying trial. It concluded that the error resulted in a miscarriage of justice based upon the appellant’s poor conduct of his own defence and lack of understanding of trial process.","HELD: The appeal was allowed and a new trial ordered. The court found that the judge's refusal to grant an adjournment was based on reasons not well-founded in law and whether the decision affected the accused's right to make full answer and defence or his right to fair trial. The issues in this appeal were whether the trial judge's decision to grant the adjournments was based upon reasons that were not well founded in law, whether the court's decision affected whether the accused retained counsel to represent him at trial, and whether it affected whether he had a right to a fair trial or a writ of certiorari under s. 686(1)(a) of the Criminal Code."
5_2005nssc172.txt,"The parents applied for leave to apply to terminate a permanent care and custody order respecting their three children. Proposed Notices of Adoption were filed for two of the children after the parents' application was filed but before it was heard. The order had been made due to, inter alia, issues of poor hygiene and nutrition; lack of supervision; domestic disputes; physical risk to the children due to inappropriate discipline; the mother's explosive temper and mental health; the father's anger; lack of insight, desire or inability to improve by the parents; inability to control themselves during access or exercise access meaningfully and an all-consuming anger and preoccupation with the Agency. Since the order was made, the mother was diagnosed with and now receiving medication for bipolar and obsessive compulsive disorders. Application for leave granted; access not ordered at the present time; supplemental affidavits and viva voce evidence were considered given that the parents had only obtained counsel after the application was filed and the nature of the issue at stake; the application could not be arrested simply because the Agency had taken steps to have the children adopted after the application was filed. Some of the factors leading to the permanent care order were being addressed by the parents, although they had not been fully dealt with; the main achievements so far appeared to be an improvement in the parents' relationship, the courses of counselling and parenting instruction they had embarked upon, an expressed willingness by the mother to undertake psychotherapy, the mother's diagnosis and medication and the parents' changed attitude towards cooperation with the Agency; these are significant building blocks on which to anchor intense parental counselling","The applicants applied for leave to terminate an order for permanent care and custody respecting their three children. The applicant had been diagnosed with bipolar disorder and obsessive compulsive disorder. Prior to January 2005 prospective adoptive parents for the children gave notice of proposed adoption. Counsel for the applicants indicated that they intended to proceed with the application for leave rather than the application to terminate. HELD: The application was granted. The Court found that the applicant had made significant improvements in the cleanliness of their home and that they were prepared to cooperate with the Agency to have the children returned to their parents. The court found that there was no new evidence of parenting courses, marriage counselling, parenting counselling or parenting counselling before the appeal was heard. The Agency opposed the application on the basis that the applicants had not made sufficient progress sufficient to justify granting leave to apply to terminate the order."

The defendant did not file affidavit evidence but opposed the application solely on the basis that recent amendments to the Queen's Bench Act precludes reference to minutes of settlement. HELD: The plaintiff was entitled to enter judgment for $15,000 plus costs of this application. A settlement agreement reduced to writing in no way offends the confidentiality required under s.28.1. The plaintiff is entitled to rely on the minutes of settlement and must be permitted to refer to them in his affidavit. Section 28.1 is not meant to apply to this situation. If a party to an action is unable to enforce a concluded settlement, the pre-trial process becomes meaningless. The legislation never intended such a result. There was no suggestion that there was non-disclosure, misrepresentation, duress or fraud in the execution of the minutes of settlement. Nor was it suggested the minutes were unclear or ambiguous. The defendant did not allege the settlement was amended or altered or that the balance of $15,000 does not remain owing.","This was an application by the plaintiff for summary judgment pursuant to Queen's Bench Act, 1998, s. 29 and/or s. 1 in accordance with minutes of settlement agreed to by the parties following a pre-trial conference on July 16, 2002.

c_2003skqb46.txt,"The Attorney General applied to strike out the plaintiff's claims on the grounds they are statute-barred by virtue of the LAA s.3 and that all the claims except for trespass to person are not exempted by s.3(3.1); by POPA s.2; alternatively, the Court has no jurisdiction over any cause of action relating to intentional torts committed by a Crown servant or employee prior to May 14, 1953; all claims arising from the conduct of two deceased Sisters who died in 1988 and 1993 are barred by the TA and SAA. The plaintiff claimed he was physically assaulted by employees and staff and suffered the loss of his traditional language and culture between 1944 and 1952 while attending the Qu'Appelle Residential School. The AG acknowledged the plaintiff attended the school from 1946 until 1949. The AG in a previous application was granted leave to amend its statement of defence and third party claim to plead and rely upon the Crown Liability and Proceedings Act; Limitations of Actions Act ss.31(d),(h) and (j); Public Officers' Protection Act; Trustee Act s.59, or its predecessor legislation Survival of Actions Act s.10; Crown Liability Act s.3(1)(a) and the Exchequer Court Act s.19. A third party claim against the Oblats alleging they controlled and operated the residential school at all material times, was not relevant on this application. HELD: 1)The claim based on physical assault by the Sisters was struck. The Court has no jurisdiction over any cause of action relating to intentional torts committed by a Crown servant or employee prior to May 14, 1953. The Crown remains immune from claims for trespass, assault and battery committed by servants and officers before the enactment of the Crown Liability Act in 1953 (renamed the Crown Liability and Proceedings Act in 1990), which did not operate retroactively. The LAA s.3(3.1) does not create a cause of action but simply removes statutory time limitation periods barring otherwise existing actions. Before May 14, 1953 the Crown was subject to claims for negligence pursuant to the Exchequer Court Act s.19(c). The Dyson procedure is available in Canada in every jurisdiction except New Brunswick and Nova Scotia. 2)The claim based on negligence is subject to the two year time limitation prescribed by LAA s.3(1)(d) which must calculated having regard to the principles of discoverability. 3)The claims of breach of trust and breach of fiduciary duty are equitable claims subject to the six year time limitation in LAA ss.3(1)(h) which explicitly begins to run from the discovery of the cause of action (PG v. AG Canada). Relevant factual issues are to be dealt with at trial. 4)Even though the claim in trespass is based on acts alleged to have occurred over 50 years ago, it clearly falls within the class of actions contemplated by LAA s.3(3.1)(b)(ii). As such it is also exempted from any limitation period against others liable for the conduct. 5)The argument that the 12 month limitation period in POPA s.2(1)(a) should be applied in priority to the more general provisions of the LAAA was rejected in RJG v. AG Canada. 6)Claims based on direct liability of the Crown for negligence, breach of trust and fiduciary duty are not affected by time limitation periods applicable to the deceased Sister Greyeyes and her estate. The time limitation periods are abrogated by LAA s.3(3.2). Since there is no limitation period barring an action against the Sister or her estate, there can be no provincial limitation period available to the Federal Crown under CLPA s.24. 7)The other claims made directly against the Federal Crown are not affected by limitation periods applicable to Sister Elle or her estate. SAA ss.5 and 10(1),(3) and (4) do not bar the claims against her.  LAA s.3(3.2) abrogates the time limitation in SAA s.10(3)(b).","The plaintiff claims that he was physically assaulted and that he lost his aboriginal language and culture approximately 50 years ago, when he was attending the Qu'Appelle Residential School. The Attorney General applies to strike out the plaintiff's claims on the grounds that they are barred by certain statutes or alternatively that the Court has no jurisdiction over any cause of action relating to an alleged intentional tort committed by a Crown servant or employee prior to May 14, 1953. HELD: The plaintiff's claim for negligence is subject to the two year time limitation period in s. 3(1)(d)(i) of the LAA. Even though the claim is based on events said to have occurred over 50 years, the 2 year limitation period must be calculated having regard to the principles of discoverability. It may well be impossible from practical standpoint for the plaintiff to establish, by balance of probabilities, that he did not discover, or should not with reasonable diligence have discovered, the wrongful nature of the Federal Crown's acts and the nexus between those acts and his injuries. As such, the 12 month time limitation in the POPA does not apply.  1) The language of s. 24(1) is clear and its meaning unambiguous. Even if the time limitation is removed, time begins to run under s. 2(1(a) of The Exchequer Court Act only when the alleged injury or damage ceases. There is no agreement as to when that alleged injury and damage ceased. 2) Any claims arising from acts or omissions that fall within the scope of s3(3.1) cannot succeed in this court under the Crown Liability and Proceedings Act. The law is clear that the plaintiff cannot pursue a claim against the Crown for the intentional tort of trespass, assault and battery of its officers and servants occurring prior to June 1953. The only vehicle available for bringing proceedings against the Attorney General of Canada in provincial court is the Provincial Court. 3) Although the plaintiffs purport to bring this action for the negligence, breach of trust, and breach of fiduciary duty, they have failed to plead cause that this court has jurisdiction to entertain with respect to anything that occurred before May 14."
c_1996canlii6986.txt,"A Director was charged with professional misconduct for coercing the resignation of two principals in his school division. The Discipline Committee found the appellant guilty of misrepresenting the school process report involving the first principal and of threatening the other principal that if he did not apply for a transfer and resign the matter would be dealt with at the board table and that 'it could get ugly'. The Executive Committee of LEADS issued a reprimand to be placed on his file for five years and a fine of $2,500. At issue was whether the Discipline Committee erred in its findings of fact and the burden of proof, whether the facts, if true, constituted professional misconduct and whether the penalty imposed was excessive. HELD: Appeal dismissed.  1)The legislation does not appear to call for a change in the traditional approach. The fact that an appellate judge can substitute his or her decision for that of the Discipline Committee or order of an executive does not mean that the appellate court's view of the facts and credibility of witnesses supercedes in any way the role of the Discipline Committee unless it finds there were inappropriate inferences drawn, conclusions reached which were not supported by the evidence, or a misdirection on a point of law. None were found in either case. The Discipline Committee did not err in its interpretation of 'professional misconduct' or its application to the facts.  2)Section 52 of the LEADS Act and s62 of the Medical Profession Act, 1981 are virtually the same except for minor changes in wording and format. The jurisprudence under the Medical Profession Act was applicable to the standard of review in this case. 3)The penalty imposed was not wrong or unjustified. Section 47 of the LEADS Act gives the Executive Committee wide latitude in the nature of punishment that it may impose upon a person found guilty of professional misconduct. The Executive is not bound by the recommendations of the Discipline Committee. They are only guidelines. 4)The Act is silent as to who shall bear costs of providing the documents filed pursuant to s51(2) of the Act. If the legislature had intended the statutorily mandated costs to be costs in the cause it would have said so. LEADS should bear the costs in this case. In any event pursuant to the court's inherent jurisdiction and pursuant to s52 of the Act the costs of providing the materials were to be borne by the respondent. 5)Subject to the above the respondent was entitled to costs of and incidental to the appeal.ADDENDUM to TWL QB96220. The concluding paragraph was amended to read: Subject to what has been stated in the immediately preceding paragraph hereof, the respondent will be entitled to recover its costs of, and incidental to this appeal, from the appellant, to be taxed on Column 3.","This was an appeal pursuant to s. 51 of the League of Educational Administrators, Directors and Superintendents Act from the decisions of the Discipline Committee, and Executive Committee, which found the appellant guilty of professional misconduct. The Discipline Committee chose to accept the evidence of the appellant over the appellant. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. 1)The Discipline Committee did not err in its determination that the Appellant intentionally caused the principal of the school to believe that he was conveying the substance of the written report to the principal. 2)The discipline committee did err in applying the onus of proof as defined by the Saskatchewan Court of Appeal in Camgoz v. College of Physicians and Surgeons, 1989 CanLII 4432 (SK CA), 74 Sask. R. 73. 3)The disciplinary committee did not erred in its finding that the appellant committed professional misconduct by misrepresenting the school improvement process report, which was critical of the principal's leadership and recommended that he be transferred. The Committee was satisfied that in doing so, Mr. Paquin intentionally misrepresented the contents and recommendations set out in the report as indicated in this charge."
3_1996canlii4959.txt,"The Crown appealed two sentences of two years less a day each, to be served concurrently for armed robbery. The 32 year old appellant had 32 previous convictions including two armed robberies and seven convictions relating to possession of weapons. HELD: The Crown appeal was allowed and the sentence for each offence was increased to three years imprisonment to be served concurrently. 1)The judge made an error in calculating the time on remand that should have been credited to the sentence. Only six months rather than the whole year should have been counted. 2)Given the appellant's record these offences demanded more than the three year minimum generally imposed.","This was a Crown appeal against two sentences of two years less a day each, to be served concurrently. The sentences were imposed in respect of two convictions for armed robbery. The respondent agreed that the facts of the case were accurately set out in the Crown factum as follows: On September 10, 1994 the respondent negotiated a sale of hash oil to be supplied by the complainant. The complainant was angry that he had been ripped off and returned to the complainant's apartment to confront him and get his money back. At that point the respondent pulled out a knife and threatened the complainant, who was frightened by the threatening behaviour with the knife. The appellant was arrested on the charge and was held on Remand until the date of sentencing. In the proceedings before the trial court, it was considered that the entire time being one year. The Crown gave credit of 2 years for the one year he believed the Respondent had spent on remand and therefore imposed a sentence of 2.5 years less 1 day concurrent on each charge."
c_2012nssc46.txt,"The parties agreed on discovery dates and the order in which witnesses would be discovered. As a result of an honest error, the defendant wasn't able to attend the original dates. The plaintiff became frustrated and concerned about further delays. While the defendant was making good faith efforts to resolve the discovery issues (including whether its witnesses should be excluded from attending discovery of the plaintiff's witnesses), the plaintiff's lawyer issued discovery subpoenas to compel the defendant's witnesses to appear, making the exclusion issue moot. The defendant moved to have the subpoenas dismissed, and sought solicitor and client costs on the motion. The defendant argued the subpoenas were improper and an abuse of process, and accused the plaintiff's lawyer of making unwarranted attacks against the defendant's lawyer in his pre-hearing brief. The motion was heard over approximately one-half day. Motion granted. The plaintiff will pay total costs of $2,550 (plus disbursements) to the defendant, consisting of $1,500 in party and party costs under Tariff C and $1,050 in solicitor and client costs. The tariff amount of $1,000 is increased by $500 to reflect the fact the issuance of the subpoenas was an improper step, albeit one falling short of an abuse of process. It required the defendant to bring this motion to strike. The plaintiff was given a chance to withdraw the subpoenas and chose not to. Solicitor and client costs were warranted especially in light of the defendant's lawyer's language, which was unduly harsh and unnecessarily strong. His allegations added a layer of complexity and seriousness to the case, which caused the defendant to spend extra time preparing a response. Lawyers are officers of the court and the court must encourage them to use courtesy, respect and professionalism.","The defendant brought a motion to dismiss discovery subpoenas issued to the plaintiff's witnesses. The motion was allowed and the order granted included a direction as to the manner of discovery. The defendant argued that the issuance of the subpoenas was inappropriate and in non-compliance with the Civil Procedure Rules. The plaintiff sought an award of costs on a solicitor/client basis. HELD: The Court awarded costs in the amount of $3,500 to the defendant.  1)There was no evidence presented which warranted special consideration as to credibility issues as compared to other cases or situations. 2)The circumstances and factual findings justified an increase in the tariff for party/party costs. Further the circumstances warranted an award for Solicitor/client costs in a limited amount. 3)The Defendant's pre-motion brief was relevant in regard to the determination of costs. On the merits of the case, whether there was an implicit agreement regarding the discovery in July including the order of witnesses, as was suggested by the Plaintiff during negotiations to reach an agreement on Discovery. 4)The plaintiff did not have any authority for the proposition to exclude the defendant's representative from the discovery of the plaintiff’s witnesses.  5)The court reviewed the circumstances of the motion and found that the plaintiff had made an improper use of the subpoena. 6)Rule 77.03(2) and Rule 77.12(1) were applicable. 7)The Court was of the view that the comments in the Defendants pre-trial motion were unduly harsh and unnecessarily strong. The Court had the discretion to increase the tariff depending upon the circumstances. 8)The costs awarded were in keeping with the length of the hearing."
4_2016skqb136.txt,"Family Law – Custody and Access – InterimThe petitioner and the respondent had four children during the course of their marriage. They separated in 2010 and the petitioner applied for interim orders, including arrangements for the parenting of the children. The court made an interim order that the parties would have joint custody with the primary residence of the children to be with the petitioner. The respondent would have access at reasonable times and on every other weekend. The parties reconciled for two years but then separated again. In 2012 the petitioner applied for an order enforcing the 2010 interim custody order. At that application, the court found that both parents were capable of parenting, but in the short term it confirmed terms of the 2010 order. A number of pre-trial conferences were held without resolving matters, and during that time, the parenting arrangements changed substantially. The oldest child began residing with the respondent in December 2014. In December 2015, the second oldest child began residing with the respondent. They stayed with the petitioner on alternate weekends. The applicant then brought this application for an order pursuant to ss. 23(1)(a) and (e) of The Children’s Law Act and pursuant to the 2012 court order, confirming the original interim order that the four children of the marriage have their interim primary residence with her and that the respondent have specified parenting time on one day each week and alternating weekends. The petitioner alleged that the respondent was attempting to influence the two youngest children to reside with him. HELD: The court ordered that the status quo parenting arrangement should remain in place until trial. In this case, the status quo was not the arrangements as they had been in 2010 and in 2012. The court found that the arrangements had evolved since the 2010 order by agreement of the parties and the changes had not occurred because the respondent was attempting to alienate the children from the petitioner.","The parties separated in July 2010. Since then they have had ongoing disputes about a variety of matters including, but not limited to, the parenting of the children, child and spousal support, exclusive possession of the family home, and the division of family property. HELD: The application was granted. The court found that the application was not in any way intended to fetter a different conclusion based on evidence that may be available at trial. The Court found that it was an error in principle, and reversible error, to vary interim custody arrangements pending trial in the absence of an order of the Court. It was also inconsistent with the purpose and intention of the foundational Queen's Bench Rules."

Dismissing the appeal, that the police officers were not acting arbitrarily or in a random fashion when they detained the appellant, and had a reasonable basis for stopping his vehicle. The appellant's contention he consumed only two small bottles (1-1/2 ounces each) of rum, plus some cough syrup and mints, did not constitute evidence to the contrary to rebut the presumption of the breathalyzer offence.

HELD: The appeal was dismissed. It was clear from the trial judge's acceptance of the evidence of the two paramedics who had noted the car parked in an unusual place and police officer who came along later, that he rejected the theory advanced by the appellant's counsel. The location of the ignition key was not relevant. The appellant's memory of the events was far from clear given the level of his intoxication.

HELD: The appeal was dismissed. 1)The learned trial judge was entitled to accept and rely on the evidence of the Crown witnesses to support the conviction.  2)The evidence outlined by the learned judge did not justify the conclusion that the Crown had established proof of 'care and control' beyond a reasonable doubt. The appellant had much different story. Primarily he realized that he was so impaired that he performed some acts which involved the use of it or its use. For example, he thought the vehicle was running when he woke up. He attacked the evidence that the two ambulance attendants (paramedics) were mistaken about his wanting to start the vehicle.

c_2009skca53.txt,"The three respondents pled guilty to three offences: trafficking in cocaine for the benefit of, or at the direction of, or in association with a criminal organization contrary to s. 467.12 of the Criminal Code; conspiring together and with others to traffic in cocaine contrary to s. 5(1) of the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act and s. 465(1)(c) of the Criminal Code; and trafficking in cocaine contrary to s. 5(1) of the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act. On the last two counts, each was sentenced to 1 year less a day to be served in the community on each count, to be served concurrently, plus a 10 year fire arms prohibition. On the first count, each was sentenced to serve 1 year, in the community, consecutive to the sentences for the other counts. They were also subjected to DNA orders and there was an order of forfeiture of a vehicle belonging to a third party. The Crown appealed these sentences on the grounds that the sentencing judge failed to give proper effect to the gravity of these offences. The Court weighed all the evidence and circumstances of the accused, and found the sentencing judge was clearly moved by the personal circumstances of the accused and while they are mitigating and would normally justify a sentence at the low end of the range, it was the Court's view that the sentencing judge gave them undue weight in comparison to the principles of denunciation and general deterrence, which must play a significant role in offences of this nature. The Court further stated the 1 year sentence for the trafficking offence, to be served in the community, was demonstrably unfit given the range of sentences established in other cases of trafficking offences, even after taking into account the mitigating personal circumstances of these offenders. The Court found the sentences must be set aside. The Court found that an appropriate sentence for each of the respondents, taking into account the seriousness of the offences, the personal circumstances of the respondents, and the aggravating nature of the offences pursuant to s. 467.12, would be 18 months, concurrent, for each of the last two counts, and 1 year consecutive for the criminal organization offence, for a total of 30 months imprisonment. HELD: The total sentence in each case is 30 months, 5 months having already been served.","The three respondents pled guilty to three offences: trafficking in cocaine for the benefit of, at the direction of, or in association with a criminal organization, to be served concurrently, plus a 10 year fire arms prohibition; conspiring together and with others to traffick in cocaine contrary to s. 5(1) of the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act and s. 465(1)(c) for the other counts; and trafficking for the use of a motor vehicle for the purposes of trafficking. The Crown appealed the sentences on the grounds that the sentencing judge failed to give proper effect to the gravity of the offences, particularly in light of the volume of trafficking and lengthy period of time over which it had taken place, the highly dangerous nature of the substances sold, the fact that their motivation was financial gain, and the motivation was motivation. HELD: The total sentence in each case was 30 months, 5 months having already been served. 1) The respondents had already served 5 months of the conditional sentence imposed by the sentencing officer for which they should be given credit. 2) They were trained in their techniques by the criminal organization. The noted high volume of sales was made possible by practices defined by the organization and established to ensure they worked as an efficient team to ensure delivery of cocaine on a 24 hour day basis while reducing the risk of discovery. It was clear that if the sentence imposed for the predicate offence was reduced to take into account the mandatory consecutive penalty for the aggravating offence, the effect was to frustrate the will of parliament through the failure to recognize and impose the mandatory minimum penalty required by law for the separate, distinct and serious offence.  3) The sentences imposed in these cases must be set aside. In each case, an appropriate sentence for each of the respondents would be 18 months, concurrent, for the last two counts, 1 year consecutive for the Criminal organization offence, for a total of 30 months imprisonment."
d_1995canlii5746.txt,"When Davidson, Sr. sold his farm to his son he retained the right to continue receiving the rentals arising from four surface leases which he had previously granted to oil companies in respect to producing oil wells. The son granted an option to purchase to the plaintiff which was exercised and a fee simple title was issued in 1973 subject to encumbrances including caveats protecting the surface leases. There was no reference to the rent charge reserved or excluded by the option agreement. The plaintiff asserted that whatever rights arose from the option agreement were merged in the transfer and effectively disappeared upon the registration of the transfer and the issuance of a new unencumbered title. HELD: Declaration denied. Plaintiff's action dismissed with costs. 1)The absence of a caveat protecting the rent charge has had no affect because of the plaintiff's continued ownership of the property.  2)Rarely, if ever, has there been a case where, as here, a purchaser has contracted to obtain the property under an instrument clearly accepting the unregistered equitable interest, then has obtained a fee simple title, then has permitted the unregistered interest to continue unimpeded for 15 years and then, perhaps tiring of the inconvenience of the lease and thinking that the money would be useful, has decided to seek an order of this Court terminating the other interest and directing that it be paid to him. His counsel made no suggestion that the plaintiff had a moral claim, it was purely an attempt to secure by legal means that which he had previously agreed to forego. This is a court of equity as well as a court of law and as such it is repugnant that the court be called upon to vest in an applicant an interest which he has heretofore freely recognized to be the property of another, both before and after receiving his transfer under The Land Titles Act. 3)It was apparent that there was no intention that the rent charge would be merged since it was recognized and allowed to continue for 15 years.","The plaintiff was granted an option to continue receiving rentals arising from four surface leases he had granted to oil companies in respect to producing oil. The option was exercised in 1973 and a fee simple title was issued to the plaintiff in 1973. The title was encumbered by,inter alia, caveats protecting the surface leases but there was no reference to the rent charge reserved or excluded by the option agreement. The action was based upon s. 237 of The Land Titles Act which provides that a person employed to buy land for another takes the title in his own name, his certificate of title is no defence against the rightful owner. He is merely trustee for him, and the Court will enforce the trusts unless the rights of the bona fide purchaser in the meantime intervene. This and similar cases were summarized in V. Di Castri, Q.C., in the following way: In any event, it was never intended that a registered owner, merely by exhibiting a title, should be able to escape the performance of contracts he had entered into prior to, contemporaneously with or subsequent to the registration of his interest, or to deny trusteeship which may be fastened upon him by law. On its face it appears that the section has the effect of enabling a purchaser to take advantage of the owner of known but unregistered interest in land even in the face of contrary contractual obligation as between the purchaser and his vendor. It affords no protection to registered owner against equitable rights which he himself has created and is not a defence when his title is attacked by person rightfully entitled to the land."
d_1995canlii3966.txt,The accused pleaded guilty to a charge of assaulting his 8 year old stepdaughter by slapping her and striking her with a small paddle. The Crown and counsel for the accused agreed that a fine and probation would be appropriate. The trial judge sentenced him to 1 year in prison and 1 year's probation. He appealed his sentence. HELD: Appeal allowed. 1)The force applied was minimal and the child was not injured physically. 2)The sentence imposed would result in the accused losing his employment which would harm his dependents. 3)The Court reduced his sentence to 60 days intermittent.,"The appellant pleaded guilty to the following charge:That Kevin Eugene McGuigan of Regina did commit numerous assaults on Ashley Bjornson by slapping and striking her with miscellaneous objects contrary to s. 266 of the Criminal Codeand was sentenced to one year imprisonment and one year's probation. HELD: The appeal was allowed and a sentence of 60 days intermittent was substituted for the sentence of one year. The probation order was to remain unchanged except to substitute the word 'approved' for'supervised' in the first condition. The sentence of 1 year under these circumstances, even with the record of the appellant, is excessive. In addition, it will no doubt mean the appellant would lose his current employment upon which the family relies."
6_1997canlii9876.txt,"The respondent was hired as an account manager by the appellant. She did not reach her planned sales goals during her employment, and became depressed. She took six weeks off work on the advice of her doctor. When she returned from sick leave she was dismissed by the appellant, who had already decided to terminate her employment after concluding that she was not able to handle the job. She claimed damages for mental distress for the sudden and callous manner in which she had been dismissed. The jury awarded the respondent $20,000 in lieu of notice and $60,000 damages for mental distress. The appellant appealed the award for mental distress. Per Hallett, J.A., Roscoe, J.A., concurring, allowing the appeal, that the suddenness and callousness of a dismissal does not constitute conduct that gives rise to an actionable wrong separate and apart from the cause of action for the dismissal without notice. Per Freeman, J.A., dissenting, dismissing the appeal, that a degree of mental distress is always likely to accompany the termination of employment. However, when the employer's conduct aggravates the mental distress beyond the degree which can be remedied by agreement or reasonable notice, a right to further damages arises.","The appellant Healthvision Corporation, which sells computer systems including hardware and software to hospitals and other health care facilities, appealed a jury award of $60,000 for mental distress in a wrongful dismissal action brought by the respondent. The appellant employee had been hired as account manager with a sales territory consisting of the four Atlantic provinces and it was expected that she would be away for three or four years to develop the territory. Her responsibilities included not only making sales contacts but co-ordinating the activities of the specialists within the company who had to design and build the system required by the customer. The conduct of the appellant prior to the dismissal was offensive and unjustified, any injury it may have caused the appellant cannot be said to have aggravated the damage incurred as result of the dismissal. HELD: Appeal allowed. 1)The court found that mental suffering would not have been in the reasonable contemplation of the parties at the time the employment contract was entered into as flowing from the appellant's unjust dismissal. 2)The Court found that the conduct advanced in support of a claim for damages for mental suffering must constitute a separate 'actionable wrong' from the breach itself. 3)There was no evidence of damage of this type to the plaintiff."
e_1999skqb268.txt,"The defendant manufactured solarium in Saskatoon which it sold to the plaintiffs in Minnesota. The plaintiffs alleged the solarium was defective, sued and obtained judgment in the Minnesota Court which it now sought to enforce in Saskatchewan. The defendant argued the Minnesota court did not have jurisdiction because at the time the action was commenced he was not 'ordinarily resident' in the state of Minnesota. The defendant was served in Saskatoon with notice of the claim but did not appear or defend the action or surrender to its jurisdiction. HELD: The action was dismissed with costs to be taxed. 1)The defences available to defendant in Saskatchewan where an action is brought to enforce foreign judgment are set out in s.6 of the Foreign Judgments Act. 2)While there may be evidence supporting the conclusion that the defendant was carrying on business in Minnesota, that same evidence does not support the conclusion the defendant was ordinarily resident there. The defendant advertised its business in Minnesota and elsewhere in the United States and employed agents there to sell its product. The logical conclusion was that the address in the city of Minneapolis was a business address. It could be argued that the defendant carried on business in the state of Minnesota but the question was whether the defendant was ordinarily resident in that state. The Foreign Judgments Act reflects real difference in the meaning of 'ordinarily resident' and 'carrying on business'.","In Saskatchewan the law governing the enforcement of foreign judgments in this jurisdiction is set out in The Foreign Judgments Act. In this action the plaintiffs seek to enforce payment by the defendant of judgment for $23,396.03 in US currency awarded them by Carver County District Court in the State of Minnesota. The action is defended on the basis that the defendant was not ordinarily resident in the state of Minnesota and, though served with notice of the action, did not appear before the Minnesota court or in any way submit to its jurisdiction. HELD: The plaintiff's action was dismissed with costs to be taxed.  1)The Act reflects that difference. While there may be evidence supporting the conclusion that the plaintiff was, at the time the action was commenced, ordinarily resident, in Minnesota, that same evidence does not support that conclusion. It is quite impossible to give a precise and inclusive definition of the term'residing' which is highly flexible and its many shades of meaning vary not only in the contexts of the United States but also in the jurisdictions of the foreign country. The time question raised in subsection 3(a) needs no further explication. 2)The term 'ordinarily resident' is not defined in the Act so turn to case law for assistance."
4_2000canlii3136.txt,"In a trial of liability only, jury found defendants to be entirely responsible for causing motor vehicle accident. Plaintiff was found contributorily negligent and liability was apportioned 57.5% to defendant and 42.5% to plaintiff. Plaintiff suffered significant injuries and plaintiff and spouse applied for interim payment of damages. Application allowed in part; plaintiff awarded $250,000.00 as interim payment; spouse's application denied. Once court is satisfied plaintiff has met threshold requirement of a judgment or admission of liability, it must strive with evidence before it to determine what damages are likely to be recovered by plaintiff and may then order interim payment if it thinks just, within limitation that it not exceed a reasonable proportion of the projected amount. The greater the certainty of the final outcome of liability and the greater the strength of the evidence supporting the damages claim, the higher the proportion of damages that will be advanced. There is nothing which precludes interim payment from being substantial amount in a proper case but court must be cautious to avoid any influence on eventual outcome of damage assessment. Although there had not yet been discovery of plaintiff's doctors or an independent medical exam obtained, the plaintiff's injuries were largely demonstrated by clinically objective medical evidence and there was no evidence of any pre-existing condition. In such circumstances, a substantial sum could be ordered. Neither pre-judgment interest nor costs are to be considered by the court in such an application. The evidence in support of the spouse's application was far too incomplete and had yet to be tested by defendants in discovery. Court could not form opinion on what damages spouse was likely to recover.","The plaintiff was seriously injured in a 1994 motor vehicle head-on collision. He brought an action for recovery of damages from his employer, Schneider National Carriers. The issue of liability was severed following a civil jury trial in April 2000 as result of which it was found that the accident was caused by the negligence of the defendants. The plaintiff sought an interim payment of $250,000.00 plus taxable disbursements. HELD: 1)Civil Procedure Rule 33.01(A) is not a substitute for an assessment of damages nor is it a mini-trial of any sort. Rather, it is likely that the plaintiff will recover a substantial amount of non-pecuniary damages which are acknowledged to be nearing the $300,000 mark subject, of course, to the reduction for contributory negligence and any arguments of failure to mitigate that might arise. 2)The plaintiff's claim for loss of future earnings on behalf of the plaintiff does not yet even form part of the pleadings. The court is unable to form an opinion of what damages are likely to be recovered by the plaintiff at a final assessment. It is not appropriate to order an interim payments be made for her benefit."
2003skqb248.txt,"An appeal from conviction and sentence for theft of an electricity generator valued at under $5,000 contrary to Criminal Code s.334(b). On the first appearance in October, 2001, the Crown advised it would proceed by summary conviction. The appellant pled not guilty. Defence argued that, in the absence of evidence to the contrary, it should be inferred that the accused acquiesced or implicitly consented to proceeding by way of summary conviction. Counsel agreed pursuant to s.786(2) to proceed by way of summary conviction and invited the court to treat the agreement as having been in place when the trial began. Both preferred the appeal to be heard in this Court or in the Court of Appeal. The appellant sought to have the conviction set aside on the grounds the verdict was unreasonable and not supported by the evidence; the trial judge failed to properly apply the doctrine of recent possession and did not provide adequate reasons for his decision. HELD: The conviction appeal was dismissed.  1)This Court had jurisdiction to entertain the appeal. The Provincial Court judge had jurisdiction as the trial proceedings did not violate s.786(2). 2)The trial judge did not misconstrue nor misapplied the doctrine of recent possession. The unexplained recent possession of stolen goods standing alone will permit, but not necessarily require, an inference that the possessor was the person who stole the goods. The elements of recent possession must be strictly proven if possession is the only evidence connecting the accused with the theft. Otherwise possession should be considered circumstantial evidence and weighed accordingly. There was no palpable and manifest or overriding error made by the trial judge in weighing the evidence.  3)Criminal Code s.687 appears to permit this Court to set aside the 9 month suspended sentence and to grant a conditional or absolute discharge. However, there was no transcript of the sentencing proceedings except for a few lines. If the transcript is not available, this Court may be reconvened to address the applicability of s.687 and whether it would be appropriate to vacate the sentence and embark on the sentencing process afresh.","This is an appeal from a sentence imposed on the charge of theft where the value of what was alleged to have been stolen did not exceed $5,000. The substantive distinction in the proceedings is limited to the range of sentencing upon conviction. Counsel argued on the appeal the question of the jurisdiction of the learned Provincial Court judge to proceed with the trial. On the first appearance of the appellant in the Provincial Court on October 15, 2001, the Court was advised that the Crown was proceeding by summary conviction. On subsequent appearance, the appellant entered a plea of not guilty and the case was set over for trial. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. The time limitation on summary conviction proceedings imposed by s. 786(2) became relevant. The appellant also appealed the sentence of his sentence. Counsel for the appellant argued that in the absence of evidence to the contrary, it should be inferred that the accused acquiesced in or implicitly consented to the Crown proceeding by way of summary conviction by agreement. Counsel did not agree with that position and sought the appeal from the learned judge. The appeal should be heard in this Court now or alternatively in the Court of Appeal based on the present trial record.  1)There was no transcript of the sentencing proceedings except for a couple of lines and without being able to examine the sentencing judge's reasons it is impossible to determine whether the trial judge applied correct principles or whether the sentence is excessive or otherwise unreasonable or demonstrably unfit. The procedural irregularity is not subject to the provisions of s. 822(7) pertaining to defect to which the accused has not objected. 2)The appellant's arguments were entirely self-serving and quite correctly accorded no weight by the learned trial judge."

The father sought a declaration declining jurisdiction, or an order for joint custody. HELD: The children had a real and substantial connection with British Columbia and evidence of their best interests was available there. They were not habitually resident in Saskatchewan and had been here only 3 months. They were not living with their mother with the implied consent or acquiescence of their father. The uncontradicted evidence that the mother never had any intention to return to the matrimonial home was accepted. The Court would have declined to exercise jurisdiction in any event pursuant to s.16 since it was more appropriate for jurisdiction to be exercised in BC. The father was directed to forthwith file an undertaking to not disturb the status quo until court authorization has been obtained.","The petitioner seeks interim custody, or primary residence of the children, pursuant to s. 6 of The Children's Law Act, 1997. The respondent seeks a declaration declining jurisdiction or an order of joint custody pursuant to the Act. The parties were married in 1994. They were university graduates and teachers. The petitioner was employed as a substitute teacher until the birth of their son when she became a full-time homemaker. The mother continues to be employed as full time homemaker in Richmond. HELD: 1)The forum of convenience is where evidence will be most easily accessible concerning the routine, habits and proclivities of children, being necessary considerations to determine the best interests of all the children.  2)If the court had jurisdiction for purposes of making a decision regarding custody, it would have declined jurisdiction."

Before filing a defence the appellants demanded particulars of the alleged lost profits. The plaintiff refused to provide particulars and the chambers judge dismissed the appellants' application for an order compelling particulars. ,appeal dismissed; the appellants had not challenged the sufficiency of the pleadings; no case was made out that the appellants required the particulars in order to file a proper defence to the action.  There were other rules available to the appellants which could be utilized to discover the underlying details of the damage claim.","This was an appeal from an interlocutory order dismissing the appellants' demand for particulars of general damage. The appellants had alleged that the respondent 'negligently or fraudulently' misrepresented the boundaries of a parcel of property that they sold to them. Alternatively, the respondent claimed breach of contract. Twin Mountain Construction (the appellants) claimed that because the property was materially less than the size it was represented to be, its plans to extract sand or develop the property were negatively affected. HELD: The appeal was dismissed with costs to the respondent of $1500 inclusive of disbursements. 1)Civil Procedure Rule 14.24 provides that particulars of damages need only be pleaded where the demand is liquidated. An expectation claim which depends upon variable factors (here, factors such as the state of the economy, the price of sand, the cost of excavation) need not be particularized in the pleadings. 2)The appellants were entitled to know the amount of the claim for general damages based upon expected profit from the development of property and/or the excavation of the sand. They could not file a defence until such information was provided. It was difficult to conceive of what additional information they need at this stage. The respondent has specified the type of damages that it seeks. 3)The necessity for particulars must be evaluated taking into account the nature of the action and the timing of demand in the context of the Civil Procedure Rules as whole. There are other Rules (for example Rules 18, 19 and 20) which can be utilized by the respondents to discover the underlying details of the damage claim.  4)The matter on appeal is an inter-locutory decision of a Chambers judge. The standard of review is simple but stringent one. This Court will not interfere unless wrong principles of law have been applied or patent injustice would result. 5)The Chambers judge erred at law by ordering better particulars of the general damage claim, which were generally not ordered unless necessary to enable the defendant to plead."
d_2000nsca117.txt,"Liability was admitted for a very mild rear end collision. The trial judge found the plaintiff's evidence to be lacking in credibility and found that the collision did not contribute materially to the plaintiff's poor health. It only caused a mild aggravation of her pre-existing and major back problem. The trial judge assessed general damages at $25,000. The plaintiff's costs were reduced on the basis that she refused a formal offer to settle for slightly less than what she was awarded and refused a second offer which was increased before trial to an amount in excess of what she was awarded. The plaintiff appealed and the defendant cross-appealed. Appeal and cross-appeal dismissed. No strong and cogent reasons were advanced to warrant interference with the trial judge's findings on credibility. There was ample evidence to support the conclusion that the accident only caused a mild aggravation of the pre-existing condition and thus no basis upon which court could interfere with that conclusion or adjust upwards general damage assessment. Trial judge applied no wrong principle in exercising discretion to reduce plaintiff's costs. Award of $25,000 was not so far outside range of damages for like cases as to be considered wholly erroneous estimate of damages.","The respondent admitted liability for driving his truck into the appellant's vehicle. The trial judge described the accident as a very mild rear end collision. At the heart of this appeal is the finding of the trial judge that the accident did not contribute materially to the appellant’s present poor health, and that it caused only a mild aggravation of his pre-existing, and major, back problem. The appeal and cross appeal are both dismissed. There will be no order for costs. The appellant is essentially, asking this court to set aside the trial's credibility findings against him, to take a different view of the medical evidence, and to attribute larger percentage of his present health problems to the accident in question, with correspondingly higher assessment of damages against the respondent. HELD: 1) There is no basis in law upon which we should adjust, upwards or downwards, the appellant judge's assessment of general damages for general pain and suffering. No such reasons are advanced by the appellant in this case.  2) The appeal is dismissed and the cross appeal is both dismissed without costs. It would take strong and cogent reasons for a court to interfere with a trial judge's findings as to the credibility of a witness who testified before that trial judge.

TFPG sought an interim mandatory injunction requiring the respondent to return all materials and files respecting TFPG's clients, to cease any contact with its clients, and to make no attempt to solicit any current or prospective client. HELD: The respondent was ordered to immediately cease all contact with TFPG clients whose account the respondent, or anyone associated with him, had administered with a view to soliciting or directing a client, affiliate or associate away from TFPG. The restriction would not prevent a client or prospective client from engaging in any business with the respondent nor was he prevented from advertising his services. 1)It was agreed that the respondent should return all of TFPG's files and materials with a right to make and keep a copy.  2)TFPG abandoned the relief sought respecting solicitation of any business of any nature similar to that of TFPG from any TFPG client or prospective client. 3)The agreement merely set out the terms both parties agreed to for valuable consideration. It was not unconscionable nor against public policy. The respondent had warranted that he had an opportunity to seek independent legal advice prior to signing the agreement. The applicant met the test for injunctive relief but the relief as set out in the draft order was too restrictive and denied others freedom of choice as to which party they wished to deal with. 4)A contractual right to injunctive relief is only one factor. The applicant must establish that the right to interlocutory injunction is clear; there is a serious question to be tried and a strong prima facie case; that irreparable harm will result; if there is a doubt as to whether there is an adequate remedy in damages there must be a determination, on a balance of convenience, which party is likely to suffer a greater harm.","FIAT. The plaintiff sought an interim mandatory injunction requiring the defendant to deliver up to TFPG, forthwith deliver all files, documents, statements of account, records, plans, software or other material respecting clients of the plaintiff. HELD: The application was dismissed. In addition to numerous clauses in the agreement setting out the rights and obligations of the parties, the respondent agreed that breach by him of any of the provisions of the agreement may cause the company great and irreparable injury and damage which cannot be reasonably compensated in damages in any action in law and the contractor hereby expressly agrees that the company shall be entitled to the remedies of injunction, specific performance and other equitable relief to prevent breach or recurrence of breach.  1) In order to succeed the applicant must also satisfy the Court that the right to an interlocutory injunction is clear; (1) there is a serious question to be tried and there is strong prima facie case; (2) that irreparable harm will result in the absence of the injunction; (3) if there is doubt as to the possibility of an adequate remedy in damages, there must be a determination as to which party, on balance of convenience, is likely to suffer greater harm from the granting or refusal of injunctive relief.  4) The respondent was registered representative of the applicant and entered into a Shareholder Advisor Agreement whereby the respondent would sell and represent only the applicant's financial products and services which the applicant approved. In exchange for this the respondent received commissions from the applicant. It is alleged the respondent sold unapproved investments of a competitor and as result he was terminated pursuant to the agreement. As well, the applicant claims the respondent has and continues to breach the 'non-solicitation' clause by carrying on the same business on his own.

b_2011nssc75.txt,"After a piece of family property was divided into two parcels, one of the brothers continued to use a driveway and maintain a garden on the other parcel. When this brother died, his son continued to use the driveway and garden, even after the second property changed hands many times. When the current owners of the second property refused to allow the continued use of their property, the son claimed that his use of the driveway was of right on the basis of expressed reservation or prescription. He argued that his uncle was incompetent when he executed a statutory declaration stating that the use of both the driveway and the garden had been with his express permission. Judgment for the defendants; there was no express reservation of the driveway in the deed to the second property and the plaintiff did not have a prescriptive right to use the driveway. Although the plaintiff and his father had used the driveway in a continuous, uninterrupted and peaceful manner for well in excess of 20 years, the statutory declaration showed that this use had been with the uncle's permission.","The plaintiff sought to continue to garden on the plaintiff's property and use the Borden driveway. HELD: The plaintiff was satisfied on the basis of the Statutory Declaration and on the totality of the evidence that the Longard brothers in combination used a 'Borden driveway' in a continuous, uninterrupted, open and peaceful manner for many years prior to it being blocked off by the Defendants. This use continued uninterrupted after Roy Longard received the portion of Eldred's land and as long as Borden remained on his property and continued when the property was transferred to the Church and then to the Mills family. There is no expressed reservation shown by the plaintiff herein. Prescription or 'Lost Modern Grant' The plaintiff's claim to the use of both the Gardener's and Borden's driveway was formalized by a letter dated August 20, 1996 to the Plaintiff. It is telling that this reservation does not say that the road in question provides access to Eldred Longard's property. It would seem that if it were a right-of-way as significant as roadway running proximate to the defendant's property, it would have been referenced in these subsequent deeds."

The accused was charged as the owner of the vehicle, not necessarily the driver. The offence was the result of a speed monitoring camera and the Act allows the Crown to complete their case without calling any witnesses. The accused testified that he did not speed past any highway workers or equipment. He said that he was following a pilot vehicle when he passed the workers and equipment and only sped up after the pilot vehicle turned around when there were no more workers or equipment. The picture of the accused’s vehicle from the speed monitoring camera did not show any highway workers or equipment. HELD: The person who tested and deployed the speed monitoring camera provided affidavit evidence that the picture was taken within a marked construction area but it did not say that the accused was speeding as he was passing highway workers or occupied highway equipment. Section 203(1) specifies that there is only an offence for travelling at a speed greater than 60 km/h when passing highway workers or operating equipment. The accused was found not guilty.","The accused was charged with the offence of driving faster than 60 km per hour when passing highway workers or occupied highway equipment within a work zone. The offence was alleged to have occurred on September 5, 2013, on Highway 55 near Peerless. The accused was not charged as the driver of the vehicle but as its registered owner. Section 273 of The Traffic Safety Act makes the registered owner liable for the driver's misconduct when the vehicle is driven by anyone who has the owner's actual or implied consent to do so. HELD: The Crown found the accused not guilty. The Crown submits that the offence under s. 203(1) of The Traffice Safety Act is a strict liability offence and its documentary evidence proves every element of the offence. The only aspect of the Crown's case that Mr. Dallyn disputes is that he passed highway workers when he was travelling fast than 60 kilometres per hour. No workers or highway equipment can be seen in the photograph of the accused's vehicle. Bradley George Christensen, the person who tested, deployed, and operated the speed monitoring device, testified that he did not speed past any highway workers, nor did he record the vehicle's speed immediately after it passed the workers or equipment, or did he say that there were highway workers and other highway equipment in the speed monitored zone. None of the documents proved that the vehicle did anything of the kind."
d_2003nssc223.txt,"The testator had prepared his own Will on a pre-printed form and left his assets to his children, whom he then proceeded to name. One of the children predeceased the testator and an application was made for an interpretation of the Will. the gift to the deceased child did not lapse; her estate is entitled to it. The general rule that a lapsed gift falls into the residue is expressly subject to any contrary intention appearing in the will; a class gift always expresses such a contrary intention. Where the gift is to a class of close relatives (e.g. to children), if this is a class gift it does not fall under this statutory exception. In such a case, the gift falls to the surviving members of the class. This case satisfied two of the exceptions to the class rule, namely, that the number of beneficiaries was given and that the names of such were given. The gift was not a class gift but rather a separate bequest to each individual child and no contrary intention was discernible in the Will.","This was an application for the interpretation of the Last Will and Testament of the testator and specifically to determine the entitlement of the Estate of Jane Mitchell under the Will pursuant to s. 31 of the Wills Act. The testator left all of his real and personal estate to his children and grandchildren, except for jewellry and personal clothing, to be divided among them. He effectively stated that he was leaving his assets to'my child Jane, my child Nancy, and my child Richard'. HELD: 1)The testator intended to make a separate bequest to each individual child rather than a class gift. The Court was unable to discern a 'contrary intention' in J.D.'s Will. Counsel have urged the Court to find that Clause 11 does describe a contrary intention. In that clause, the judge underlined the words'solely and absolutely'. The underlining of the two words solely and absolutely and the direction that such inheritances 'is not to form part of matrimonial assets' shows that he has included or excluded members of the class by name. 2)The Court must be careful in determining what is relevant to be considered if it becomes necessary to put itself into the 'armchair' of a testator.  3)Section 31(d) of the Act provides for a general rule that a person's gift falls into the residue expressly subject to contrary intention, i.e. to be shared by all persons falling within the general or generic description and to exclude anyone not then alive. It appears that the Court has found for or against the characterization of gift as class gift depending on the effect such finding will have. In this case, the Court may find gift is class gift to prevent lapse should one or more members of a class predecease him."

The defendant had indeed yielded properly but could have been more prudent in insuring that other motorist were aware that she yielded. The plaintiff should have taken more appropriate measures to avoid the accident","The plaintiff, who was travelling west on Highway 306 near Grey, Saskatchewan, saw a car driven by a woman approach from his right, stop at the stop sign, and then proceed forward toward the highway. He applied his brakes with such force that his truck entered skid, left the highway, and struck the side of the car. The damages to both the plaintiff's truck and the car exceeded the $500 insurance deductible. The plaintiff brought this action against the car's owner, Vernon Henry, and the defendant's counterclaim for the same. HELD: The plaintiff was awarded judgment against the Henrys for his $500.00 deductible, the defendant for his counterclaim and the Henry counterclaim. 1)The Highway Traffic Act places an additional duty upon such drivers. Although Henry complied with the rules of the road, a prudent driver in this situation would come to a stop further back from the highway to ensure that oncoming drivers would know that they had been seen and yielded to. 2)The circumstances at this intersection were somewhat unusual, in that the vehicle was 39 feet back from its edge of the pavement, which itself approximately two feet from the driving portion of the highway and the plaintiff complied with a requirement to stop. However, there was no other traffic. Even if Schmidt concluded that Henry was going to proceed into his path, he had more appropriate alternatives than locking his brakes and turning to the right. There was no one traffic. He could apply his brakes, maintained control of his vehicle and moved into the oncoming lane."
b_2007skqb1.txt,"This is an appeal pursuant to s. 39 of The Small Claims Act, 1997. The appellant asserts a palpable and overriding error by the learned trial judge in accepting, and finding as fact, part of the testimony of a witness but not accepting the further testimony of the witness that an amount was also owing to the appellant by the respondent. HELD: The appeal is dismissed. The trial judge was not required to accept the entirety of the witness's testimony, despite having accepted most of it, particularly in light of the contradictory evidence of the respondent denying the sum claimed by the appellant. The denial by the respondent of the appellant's claim, accepted by the trial judge, was fatal to the appellant's onus of proving a mutual understanding and absolute acknowledgement of the alleged debt between the parties.","This was an appeal pursuant to s. 39 of The Small Claims Act from judgment given January 19, 2006. The appellant asserts a palpable and overriding error by the learned trial judge in accepting, and finding as fact, part of the testimony of a witness (that an amount was owing by the appellant to the respondent) but not accepting the further testimony of the witness that an amount also owing to the appellant. There is no order as to costs. HELD: The appeal is dismissed. 1)There was no palpable or overriding error in the trial judge's judgment. The trial judge had an immense advantage in assessing evidence and arriving at findings of fact. The court of appeal must extend a substantial deference to the findings of a trial judge. 2)The trial judge accepted most of the evidence including her evidence as it related to an implied admission by the respondent of some existing indebtedness owing to him. Nor did he expressly reject her testimony as to the amount, $1,900. However, there was other testimony, contradictory, before the court on that point. The transcript clearly showed that the respondent unequivocally denied any loan made to him by him. 3)The appellant was not persuaded that the judgment was not reasonably supported by the evidence or that there was an overriding error of law nor unreasonable finding of fact in the judgment. There was no order for costs. The appeal was dismissed."
d_1999canlii12581.txt,"In issue was whether the Bank breached its lending contract, its fiduciary duty or duty of confidentiality; and if so, what damages, if any, should be awarded. The defendant's bank loans fell into default after SGI disability benefits were terminated. The Bank reported the particulars of the loan defaults to a credit reporting agency (Equifax). The defendant declined to give an assignment of any accident injury settlement he might receive from SGI and requested the bank direct Equifax to eliminate any references to his default or delinquency upon the bank loans. The bank offered to put an explanatory note on their credit report confirming the arrears were the result of the defendant's automobile accident and that he had undertaken to pay the bank from the proceeds of the accident settlement. The bank commenced this action for payment. The Compains sought general, punitive, exemplary and aggravated damages in a counterclaim for breach of the bank's duty of good faith, duty of confidentiality and breach of contract. HELD: The counterclaims were dismissed with taxed costs to the bank for both the claim and counterclaims. The bank's claim was admitted at trial. 1)Compain expressly waived any contractual rights which he had to confidentiality of his credit information by the provisions of paragraph 8 of the Personal Credit Line Agreement. The principles outlined by the English Court of appeal in Tournier enumerated four exceptions to a bank's confidentiality obligation to its customers. 2)The analogy between the insurance cases and a bank and borrowing customer was not complete or appropriate. Assuming, without deciding, that banks do have a duty of good faith and fair dealing towards their customers, the bank did not breach such duties in their dealings in this case. 3)The characterization of the accounts as collection accounts was fair, reasonable and accurate in the circumstances and were not out of the normal course of business.","The plaintiff banked with the defendant and at the time of the accident the Compain's were indebted to the Royal Bank under Royal Bank Credit Line and Visa credit card account (the ""Bank Loans""). The Royal Bank was the source of the credit report for the plaintiff and the Bank Loans fell into default as a result of the plaintiff's failure to report to Equifax the borrower's default or delinquency upon the Bank's credit report. The plaintiff Bank commenced this legal action for payment. The defendant defended and counter-claimed against the bank for breach of the bank's duty of good faith, duty of confidentiality and by an amendment application made at trial and allowed by this judgment, breach of contract. HELD: The plaintiff bank's costs against the defendant were taxed. 1)The Royal Bank acted fairly and reasonably throughout consistent with its obligations to the plaintiff, including its obligation to pay the loans from the proceeds of his accident settlement. The counter-claimant's claims were upheld and they were dismissed in total. 2)There was no evidence lead to suggest that an agreement other than the one referred to and marked as Exhibit P-3 existed. The court concluded that it was this credit line agreement which formed the basis of the agreement between the plaintiff Bank and Royal Bank. 3)Although there was some argument as to whether or not this or some other credit agreement formed the foundation for the credit and loan presently sued upon, there was no other evidence upon which an allegation of breach by either party of its contractual obligation, duty, duty or fair dealings occurred with respect to the nature and manner of the loan reports it issued to the credit agencies and which were reflected in the Equifax credit report issued. 4)The plaintiff Bank was awarded costs of the action against the defendants (the Royal Bank and the plaintiff bank) in the amount of $1,000,000.00."
2_2011skpc5.txt,"The accused was charged with impaired driving and driving over. 08. The sole issue to be determined was whether the accused was the person operating the vehicle at the time of the stop. The police testified that they had walked through the bar before closing time and then returned to the bar at closing time. The evidence was that the accused had been seen playing drinking games in the bar. The police observed the people they had seen in the bar get into a truck and back up. The police activated their emergency equipment and approached the vehicle. The accused was sitting in the driver's seat when the police approached the vehicle. The defence suggested that another individual had been driving the truck when it backed up but had gone inside the bar to purchase off sale before the police approached the truck. HELD: The accused was convicted of both counts and a judicial stay was entered on the impaired driving count. The Court found that the evidence of the accused was unreliable as a result of her alcohol consumption on the offence date. The evidence of the person that the defence suggested was the driver was inconsistent and caused the Court concern about its reliability. The Court found that at the time the individuals got into the truck, the accused was behind the wheel and that she was the one who backed the vehicle up and pulled it forward. The keys were in the vehicle and it was running when the police came to the driver's door. The accused's blood alcohol content at the time of driving as shown by the Certificate of Analysis was 150 milligrams of alcohol in 100 millilitres of blood.","The accused was charged with impaired driving and driving over.08, as the charges are more formally particularized in the Information. The defence admitted all of the essential elements of each charge; the only issue was the factual one of whether or not the accused was the person operating the vehicle. HELD: The accused was found guilty of impaired driving. 1) Based on the events of December 5, 2009, at Carrot River, the police officers were directed to drop in while on routine patrol. The accused tended to answer questions by resorting to what he normally does and was not able to state what he specifically did on the morning in question. 2) The defence evidence lacks reliability. The evidence does not accept that evidence nor does it leave me in a state of reasonable doubt. The difference between the demeanour he exhibited during his testimony, based on who was asking him questions, caused me to have considerable concern."
b_2006skqb218.txt,"The respondent applies to vary the consent joint custody order granted in October 2004. His application was prompted by the relocation of the petitioner with one of their two children, Tyson. The sole issue on this variation application is the determination of the primary residence of Tyson. HELD: 1) The petitioner wants to move Tyson 5.5 hours away from the respondent. This also requires a change in access arrangements. These are changes in circumstances that are material.  2) The petitioner has developed a strong bond with Tyson. The respondent has developed a close relationship with the parties' other child Kailey. After Kailey went to live with the respondent, neither parent did much to facilitate the access of either child. Before the petitioner and Tyson moved, although a short distance apart, neither Kailey nor Tyson saw his or her non-custodial parent and sibling on a regular basis. Even telephone access has been sporadic. Both parents have established homes that accommodate only one child. 3) The petitioner's move must be considered in light of the circumstances that existed before the petitioner's relocation. The parties had already adopted a split custody arrangement without formalizing access or adjusting child support. 4) Permitting the petitioner to relocate is in the best interests of Tyson. It is important that Tyson continue to live in the home of the parent whose constant presence he has become accustomed to. The petitioner has always been Tyson's primary caregiver. The petitioner is the psychological parent.",HELD: The application was granted. The court found that the only viable options were to permit Shauna to relocate Tyson to the Archerwill district or to change the primary residence of Tyson by placing him in the home of Rocky. There were negative consequences to the relocation of Tyson from Kindersley to Coleville. The move was to an entirely new and different community. The special needs of Tyson require that he have the assistance and support of someone to whom he is closely bonded.

b_2016skqb162.txt,"HELD: The application was dismissed. The court held that pursuant to s. 39(9), it ordered that the transcript should be allowed to be filed and the appeal to proceed. The appellant had done everything required of it pursuant to the Act. The provisions of s. 39 did not require the appellant to follow up with the local registrar’s office to see if the transcript had been filed. In a case such as this, s. 39(9) of the Act provides the court with the ability to exercise its discretion to remedy the problem and ensure that justice is achieved where a transcript could not be filed within the six-month period.","The respondent argued the appeal must be dismissed based on s. 39(5) of The Small Claims Act. The transcript was not filed within the six month period set forth in ss.39(5). The appellant argued it did nothing wrong here and it would be an affront to the administration of justice to simply determine the appeal to be dismissed. HELD: The appeal was allowed to proceed. 1) The transcript may now be filed and this appeal shall proceed to be argued and determined on its merits. The setting of the appeal date is confirmed.  2) The appellant did not see the letter from Transcript Services. It would require conclusion the appellant must go behind both the practice of Transcript Services and the correspondence from the appellant. The appellant must check that the interoffice mail system has not malfunctioned. 3) In interpreting s. 123(1), the ordinary meaning of the words of that provision must be read in the context of the Act as whole and in the Context of Part VIII in particular. It is important to keep in mind the purpose of the act and the legislature's intention in enacting the provision. The provision is benefit conferring and accordingly must be given a broad and purposive interpretation. It must also be interpreted in a manner that will not lead to absurdities.  4) The appeal is to be struck without the appellant having done anything incorrectly. This necessarily means it cannot sit on its hands and allow delay to build without any consequence. Rather, by putting the onus on the appellant to do what it is required to do, the Legislature is assured of speedy small claims process. This achieves one of the principle goals of the entire small claims system of administering justice. 5) In those cases where a flaw occurs through no fault of the appellant, the legislation provides this Court with the ability to exercise a discretionary remedy to fix that flaw and ensure justice is done as between the parties. This discretionary remedy is set out in ss39(9). That subsection provides for remedy in the event a transcript cannot be provided for the appeal. This is part of s39 and therefore must refer both to the absence of transcript and the failure to file within the 6 month provision. In that case, the court may make 'any other order that the judge considers appropriate.  6) To allow an appeal only to have the appellant do anything incorrectly leads to an absurd result. Were it to be allowed, the appellant would lose right of appeal, and judicial determination of the claim, without fault."

Steps were not taken to ensure that no disclosure of information would occur for a month after the firm was put on notice. At issue was whether the screening measures taken ensured that no disclosure would occur and satisfied the evidentiary burden imposed on the law firm. HELD: The solicitor and the law firm were disqualified from acting for the petitioner in the action. Because two years had lapsed further examinations were appropriate and an order issued for the petitioner to attend a further examination. If the updated information is not necessary for trial the petitioner may request costs at that time. The application for an order with respect to without prejudice offers of settlement was dismissed as matters of evidence were to be determined by the trial judge.  1)Since the decision in Martin v. Gray the Law Society amended the code of conduct to provide for rules where a member transfers from one law firm to another. 2)The difficulty in this case was that no measures were taken prior to or at the time the solicitor joined the firm to ensure confidentiality. The time period before taking appropriate steps was completely inadequate.  3)The second question, whether there was a risk that the confidential information will be used to the prejudice of the client, Martin v.

Bruce Gillis, a barrister and solicitor practising in Middleton, Nova Scotia. It was a claim in professional negligence for the losses sustained by FCC as a result of the alleged negligence of Gillis. HELD: The action was dismissed with costs to the defendant to be taxed. 1)The defendant had been engaged by the Langilles over the years as their solicitor and he continued to act for them on their behalf in this transaction. 2)There were other circumstances which militated against FCC in this case. Between the time the mortgage deal was made in 1979 and the foreclosure action several things occurred. FCC renegotiated new security for the mortgage and gave up the original security. There is serious question that some of the surrendered security was of substantially greater value than that taken up.

7_2014skqb116.txt,"Tax Law – Contract for Services – Payment of PST The plaintiff has the onus of proving it is not liable for the payment of PST on a balance of probabilities. Parties are entitled to structure their legal relationships as they see fit. The Court must determine whether the tax is payable based on the agreements as constructed between Husky and the third parties. There was no evidence that Saskatchewan Finance and the third party contractors entered into an agreement to alter the nature of the contracts so that Husky paid PST when it would not otherwise have been obligated to pay. The evidence established that Husky determined the way in which bids were submitted and the way Husky was invoiced. In each contract, Husky required that the bid include a price for service and price for materials. In each case, it was contemplated that PST was in addition to the price bid for the materials provided. The contracts between Husky and the third parties all contain provisions and terms that provide for the sale of materials to Husky. On the basis of the contracts, there was a sale of tangible property under the PST Act. Husky was the user or consumer of the cement. The third parties were providing materials and services to assist in the construction of the oil well. Husky has failed to establish that the contracts were supply and install contracts. Husky was the ultimate user and consumer of the tangible personal property. Husky is not entitled to rely on mistake of law. Husky has failed to establish on a balance of probabilities that it is entitled to a refund of the PST it paid on well cementing contracts between itself and third parties. The claim is dismissed.","HELD: The plaintiff was awarded $419,964.69 plus interest on well cementing contracts it had with third party contractors for the period 1996 to 2001 on materials supplied and installed by the contractors. The Government of Saskatchewan, pursuant to s. 50(2) of The Revenue and Financial Services Act, is entitled to payment of PST from third parties in undetermined amounts on the basis that the third parties were liable under the Act to pay PST on the materials they consumed in the performance of their contracts with the plaintiff. The plaintiff also seeks interest on the amount claimed from the date of payment of the Sales Tax to the Government at the rate prescribed by the regulations. The third parties brought an application to the court to be allowed to defend the liability of the government of Saskatchewan at trial. An order was made, and the third party parties were permitted to defend against the government at the trial. At trial, the matters to be adjudicated on the pleadings are whether Husky is awarded the refund of the PST from the Saskatchewan Government, whether the amount to be refunded is to be reduced by virtue of the limitation period set forth in s. 56 of the Department of National Revenue Act. The Saskatchewan Government has joined the cementing contractors as third parties. HELD: Even if Husky was not liable to pay the PST in the amount of $393,289.73 it was entitled to refund of PST on materials consumed by third parties pursuant to the Saskatchewan Provincial Sales Tax Act. 1) Even if the Government was not responsible for the PST paid by Husky, the Government properly levied and collected tax from the plaintiff on the sale of the tangible personal property pursuant to section of The Provincial Sales tax Act and Regulations thereto. 2) There was no mistake of law in the payments of PST made by the parties to Husky. 3) Husky's amended statement of claim is without merit because the plaintiff was the final user and consumer of the materials provided pursuant to its contracts between the second party contractors and Husky Oil.  4) The third party contractor denies the allegations contained in the plaintiff's Statement of Claim dated March 26, 2002, the Defendant's Reply to the Demand for Particulars dated May 9, 2003 and the Plaintiff's Amended Statement of claim amended July 20, 2005. 5) The plaintiff is not entitled to judgment against the Defendant.

The Crown appealed. HELD: Appeal allowed. The sentence neither reflected the seriousness of the offences nor provided adequate deterrence.

The Crown appealed on the ground the two terms of closed custody, having been ordered to be served concurrently with the remainder of the previous term, did not constitute a fit sentence. An additionalsix month period of secure custody for the armed robberies did not meet either the interests of rehabilitation or the requirements of deterrence.

HELD: 1)Section 258(7) has been judicially amended to mean 'true copy' which presumably, though not logically, means something more than 'copy'. It has grown to the point that an affidavit may be disregarded if the police do not provide supplemental evidence when challenged as to the manner in which they assured the accuracy of the copy. 2)The trial judge further advanced the law to a point where, even when not challenged, there is an obligation to provide supplemental evidence of comparison in order to buttress the evidence of the affidavit. This is an error of law. A challenge under s258(7) should be based upon a discovered difference as between the copy and the original.

B-3, as a result of the sheriff's return of nulla bona to the respondent's writ of execution against the debtor.

[4] As for the first, the debtor did not satisfy Justice Koch that he was able to pay his debts or that there existed other sufficient cause to dismiss the petition. Based on the evidence adduced by the debtor, we are of the view there is no basis to conclude that Mr. Justice Koch should have been satisfied of these matters. [5] As for second, concerning ss. 43(11), we note that the subsection contains discretionary power to stay proceedings. That, of course, serves to narrow the basis for intervention on appeal. We cannot say Justice Koch erred in any requisite respect in the exercise of this discretionary power.

3_1999canlii12358.txt,"Two female employees filed complaints with the Saskatchewan Human Rights Commission alleging sexual harassment and discrimination contrary to the Saskatchewan Human Rights Code. The unionized employer applied for judicial review in the nature of prohibition contending the provisions of the Code were superseded by the collective agreement and s.25 of the Trade Union with the result that the Board of Inquiry lacked jurisdiction to hear the complaint. The chambers judge found the Act took precedence over the Code on the basis that the Act dealt specifically with the employment relationship and granted an order prohibiting the Board of Inquiry from hearing and determining the matter. Sub-questions to be determined included: what are the statutory schemes of the Trade Union Act and the Saskatchewan Human Rights Code; what has the Supreme of Canada decided about the exclusive jurisdiction of an arbitrator to resolve disputes in the context of labour law; the essential character of the dispute and ambit of the collective agreement; whether either the Code or the Act has exclusive jurisdiction to decide the dispute and if not, which statute takes priority or is paramount. HELD: The order of the Court of Queen's Bench was set aside and the matter was remitted to the Board of Inquiry appointed under the provisions of the Code. 1)The chambers judge correctly decided that the issue in this case is confined to a determination of the correct forum in which to bring the complaint of sexual harassment. 2)Human rights are fundamental, quasi-constitutional rights which embody fundamental values and public policy. Because human rights are not private rights, but public rights which constitute fundamental public policy, parties are not able to contract out of, alter, amend, or repeal or create exceptions to human rights provisions. To do otherwise would permit the denigration of the rights and obviate the protection of the rights the statute seeks to protect. 3)The mere fact that a collective agreement includes an article or clause which complies with the Code or a provision which covenants not to discriminate on the basis of the grounds set out in the Code, does not in and of itself transform the nature of the dispute from a human rights violation to a breach of the collective agreement. The ambit of the collective agreement does not affect the finding that the essential nature of the dispute is a human rights violation particularly when the public interest component and wide powers granted under the Code to redress a violation are taken into account. It is not in its essential character a complaint arising out of the employment relationship under the collective agreement.  4)The Commission was awarded its costs on double column V in this Court and on the appropriate Court of Queen's Bench tariff. No costs were requested by the intervenor.ADDENDUM: Paragraphs number 25 and 31 are substituted as follows: [25] This position was reinforced by Weber v. Ontario Hydro and New Brunswick v. O'Leary. The policy driving such decisions is that the dispute resolution process, established by the various labour statutes, should not be duplicated or undermined by concurrent common law actions in the courts. This also conforms to the theory of deference that courts accord decisions of specialized tribunals. For a complete discussion of the issue see Parr and Prince Albert District Health Board v. Saskatchewan Federation of Labour released concurrently with this judgment. The Ambit of the Collective Agreement [31] One must not lose sight of the fact that the terms of the collective agreement itself can play an important role in the determination of whether the jurisdiction of the court has been ousted in favour of an arbitrator. The fact that parties have included an anti-discrimination clause in the collective agreement does not alter the fundamental nature of the dispute or have the effect of extending the scope of the arbitrator's jurisdiction. It may play a role in determining whether the statutory tribunal would decide to hear the complaint, but it cannot affect the determination of the essential nature of the dispute or the question of jurisdiction. The essential issue is whether this complaint is a dispute between the parties with respect to the meaning, application or alleged violation of the collective agreement. To find that it is, with the result that the dispute must be arbitrated, would permit the parties to contract out of the Code, something they cannot do.","HELD: The appeal was allowed and the matter remitted to the Board of Inquiry established under the Trade Union Act. The parties agreed there would be no discrimination against anyone because of their sex. The mere fact that the parties had included an anti-discrimination clause in the collective agreement does not alter the fundamental nature of the dispute or have the effect of extending the scope of the arbitrator's jurisdiction. The only method of enforcement available to the parties was the complaint procedure set out in the Code. The policy driving such decisions is that the dispute resolution process, established by the various labour statutes, should not be duplicated or undermined by concurrent common law actions in the courts. This also conforms to the theory of deference that courts accord decisions of specialized tribunals. The Ambit of the Collective Agreement [31] One must not lose sight of the fact the terms of the agreement itself can play an important role in the determination of whether the court has been ousted in favour of an arbitrator."
e_2005skqb51.txt,"The plaintiff seeks damages for unlawful arrest and assault, including aggravated or punitive damages arising out of events which resulted in his arrest and a charge of obstruction. During the course of his arrest, the plaintiff received cut to his scalp. He remained in custody until released at approximately 7:30 a.m. that morning. The three named defendants are members of the Saskatoon Police Service. The City of Saskatoon is their employer. HELD: The action for wrongful arrest is dismissed. The plaintiff was assaulted when his head was driven onto the hood of the vehicle. The plaintiff is awarded $2,500 in general damages and pre-judgment interest on that amount. It is not an appropriate case to award punitive damages, but the Court awarded solicitor client costs to the plaintiff in the amount of $6,000 plus taxable disbursements. 1) The Court accepted the plaintiff's evidence that he did not physically interfere with the police officers outside of the lounge. The police officers that attended at the lounge and became involved in the arrest of Mr. Sampson were in the execution of their duty. The plaintiff does not dispute that he possessed the general intent to make the comments that he did throughout the proceedings and that he did so wilfully. The issue is whether or not his actions obstructed the police officers, who were in the execution of their duty. 2) The combined actions of the plaintiff and Ms. Krupa clearly interfered with the police officers' arrest of Mr. Sampson, to the point that Constable Pura called for back-up help. Once the back-up officers arrived, one of them was required to expend time and effort restricting the movements of the plaintiff and Ms. Krupa. Once on the street, they again confronted the police officers. Their combined actions clearly affected the work of the police officers in the execution of their duty. There were reasonable and probable grounds to believe the plaintiff was obstructing the police officers in the course of their duty. 3) On the facts in this matter, the same conclusion is arrived at based solely on the plaintiff's individual actions. The plaintiff's officious interference consisted of verbal abuse, excessive criticism and undue pertinacity in his discussion and questioning and provided reasonable and probable grounds to believe he was obstructing police officers in the execution of their duty. The action for wrongful arrest is dismissed. 4) The cut to the plaintiff's head is a minor one, not requiring stitches or immediate medical attention. The plaintiff experienced headaches for several weeks. He also had stiff neck and sleep disturbance. There were no long term effects. Corrigendum received January 25, 2005 and added to fulltext.","The plaintiff sought damages for unlawful arrest and assault, including aggravated or punitive damages, arising out of events which resulted in his arrest and a charge of obstruction in the early morning of May 16, 2001 During the course of his arrest, the plaintiff received a cut to his scalp just inside the hairline above his left eye. He remained in custody until 7:30 a.m. that morning. The plaintiff was convicted of remaining in licensed premises after being required to leave contrary to s. 122(2)(a) of The Alcohol and Gaming Regulation Act. The position of the defendants is that the plaintiff was lawfully arrested for obstruction and that the cut he received on his head was by-product of his resistance during arrest and did not involve any more force than was reasonably necessary to arrest him. The actions of the plaintiff outside of the lounge are not largely in dispute and vary in minor detail only."
c_2004nssc248.txt,"In a divorce proceeding, the wife claimed lump sum spousal support in the amount of $20,000 to allow her to return to her native country. She also claimed that periodic maintenance was not appropriate because of the difficulty of enforcement when she is living abroad and referenced two occasions when the husband was paying periodic support that she had to seek the assistance of Maintenance Enforcement. The husband opposed paying any more spousal support but expressed a preference for lump sum support if he was required to pay more, as it would allow him to move on with his life with his new family. Husband ordered to pay a lump sum award of $10,000 to wife; when the parties moved to Nova Scotia, the husband was able to improve his financial situation, while the wife's position deteriorated.","The parties were married in 1996 having previously been married in Sweden. There were no children of their relationship and the only contested issue on this hearing was the respondent's claim for lump sum spousal support. The parties agreed that all property had been divided to their mutual satisfaction and an outstanding debt of approximately 34,000 krona was their joint responsibility. HELD: The respondent was to pay $10,000.00 to the respondent.  1)The respondent's evidence was far from satisfactory. It was only in view of her stated intention to return to Sweden that she consented to the Court dealing with the issue. 2)The amount suggested by the respondent did not, even with the support she had already received, equal the amount of the need. The respondent's economic prospects, particularly on the move to Nova Scotia, had been impaired by the marriage. The Court was satisfied having regard to his education and obvious skills in computer programming that he would be able to obtain the funds necessary to make lump sum support payment to the Respondent."

e_1998canlii13440.txt,"The applicants sought an order under s.11 of the Landlord and Tenant Act vesting the whole term of their sub-lease with either VIP Business Centre (VIP) or 598710 Saskatchewan Ltd (SaskLtd). Bennett, owner of an office building (the Plaza), leased space to VIP for five years ending in 1997. Issues included (i)whether there had been a valid renewal of the head lease; (ii)whether there had been valid renewals of sub-leases; (iii)assuming valid renewals, did s4 of the Statute of Frauds bar enforcement against Bennett; (iv)whether the Court had jurisdiction to hear an application for relief under s11 brought solely by notice of motion; (v)are the applicants entitled to such relief; (vi)whether Bennett was bound by the sub-leases by virtue of taking the assignment from VIP. HELD: The application was dismissed. 1)It was assumed that the evidence led by the applicants was true in order to determine issues (iii) and (iv) which dispose of the application. Issues (i), (ii) and (vi) could not be dealt with summarily because of the conflicting affidavits. 2)Notwithstanding Queen's Bench Rule 13(1), the term action in s11 includes summary application by way of notice of motion. There is no reason for landlords to have better access to this Court than the tenants concerning possession of demised premises. The words 'or otherwise' include extrajudicial actions by landlords, including re-entry. Had it been concluded that it was necessry to proceed by statement of claim, such error would have been procedural one, curable under Rule without affecting the jurisdiction of the Court. 3)The Court should exercise its discretion within the guidelines outlined in Golden Griddle. grant of relief requested by the applicant would constitute an improper exercise of such discretion. They were not the sole tenant in stand alone building of the kind in Chatham Empire Theatre. The relief sought would unfairly affect the landlord. As the applicants expressed no interest in taking over the whole head lease premises on the terms of the head lease, there was no need for a conditional order of the nature of London Bridge. 4)The only memoranda consisted of the original head lease and subleases and the unsigned fax messages. The fax messages did not meet the essential requirements for a valid lease. The actions and performance by VIP and the applicant fell short of constituting part performance for the purposes of s.4 regardless of a narrow or broad interpretation of the doctrine. In any case the Court would not have exercised its discretion by binding Bennett with leases which comprised less than 15% of the head premises in the absence of evidence that clearly demonstrated the owner's ability to rent out the balance of the head lease premises was not impaired economically or physically. The applciants could obtain other office space including that offered by Bennett. General and punitive damages would provide an adequate remedy.","The applicants sought an order under s.11 of The Landlord and Tenant Act vesting the whole term of their sub-leases with either V.I.P. Business Centre Inc. (""VIP"") or 598710 Saskatchewan Ltd. on such conditions as the Court deems proper. The applicants had entered into written sub-lease of office space with VIP for term of 50 months and an optional renewal term of 1 year upon 3 months' notice. The latter had sub-leased portions thereof to several sub-lessees. HELD: The application was dismissed. 1)The applicants were not entitled to relief from forfeiture but, rather, on what terms such relief might properly be granted. The terms on which relief may be granted are obviously important to the head lessor and, as the cases demonstrate, the court must have regard to the effect the grant will have on the headlessor's interests.  2)The applicant had proceeded by notice of motion in circumstances where no 'action' existed. Since neither the applicants nor the applicants had initiated an action, the Court should be satisfied that the granting of the relief will not unfairly prejudice or adversely affect the Head lessor.  3)The actions and performance by the applicants fell short of constituting partperformance for the purposes of s. 4. In the alternative, the applicants are bound by their subleases as consequence of taking an assignment of VIP's leases. In this case the applicants have established the essential requirements for valid renewals of the head lease and their sub leases, and that they had met the requirements of the Statute of Frauds. In other words, they are not the sole tenant in a'stand alone building' of the kind in Saskatoon."
5_2009nspc10.txt,"The accused was arrested for possession of drugs and a weapon, and for breaching his probation. Police testified they saw him walking down the street at 10am and noticed a strong smell of marijuana. When approached, he was smoking a cigarette in front of the provincial courthouse. He said he had smoked marijuana on the street, but did not have any other drugs on him. After they spoke, he asked to leave, saying he was late for a court appointment. The police asked him to deal with this matter first, ran a CPIC check and discovered the accused was on probation and required to keep the peace and be of good behaviour. He was not cautioned/advised of his right to counsel until he was arrested on the basis of what the Crown claimed was a reasonable belief the accused possessed drugs. Police conducted a 'pat-down' search, and found drugs (marijuana and cocaine) and a weapon. The accused argued his Charter rights were violated (s. 8, 9 and 10(b)) and asked the court to exclude the evidence obtained in the search. He also argued his admission/statement was not voluntary and should be excluded on the basis that it was given in the context of a violation of his Charter rights. Motions to exclude the statement and evidence obtained in the search denied. The accused's s. 8 and 9 rights were not breached. While his s. 10(b) rights were violated when he asked to leave and the officers asked him to deal with this first (which amounted to detention), his admission/statement was made before the detention and was voluntary. Further, no evidence was obtained as a result of the breach since the search only took place after the arrest/cautioning. After reviewing the relevant jurisprudence, the court concluded: the Crown must prove the arresting officer subjectively believed they found an offence apparently being committed; that subjective belief must be objectively reasonable; police may rely on an inference in forming their belief (such as the inference that marijuana smokers typically carry a supply with them); and that inference must be objectively reasonable in light of the circumstances and facts of the case. Here, the officer's subjective belief that the accused was in possession of drugs was objectively reasonable. The court accepted her evidence that she had special training in identifying the smell of marijuana and distinguishing between a strong and faint smell of marijuana. The CPIC check showed he was on probation in relation to a drug charge. Since the officer had the authority to arrest under s. 495(1)(b) of the Criminal Code, the arrest was lawful. The search taking place incidental to the arrest was reasonable. In obiter, the court went on to say that, even if the accused's s. 8 and 9 Charter rights had been breached, an analysis under s. 24 would lead to a decision not to exclude the evidence: it was not conscriptive; the offence was serious; there was no bad faith on the part of police; and the accused could have lawfully been arrested for admitting to what was a breach of his probation.","The accused was charged with possession of cocaine for the purpose of trafficking and possession of cannabis marijuana for the purposes of trafficking. The arrest was found to be unlawful and the cannabis marijuana was excluded from the search. The accused argued that his statement to the police was voluntary and the police had not proven that the officer had reasonable grounds for the search of his person. HELD: The Court of Appeal held that the accused was not detained and, therefore, no police duty under the Charter was triggered prior to arrest. There was no evidence of what he was thinking prior to his arrest. The Court also held that there was no breach of the accused's s. 8 and s. 9 Charter rights. The court found that the police officer's stated reason for arrest was based upon an inference based upon observation (i.e., smell) the smell of burned marijuana, which was not sufficient to support a reasonable inference that more, un-smoked marijuana was present."
9_1994canlii4283.txt,"The respondent had undertaken the residential development of certain lands bordering the appellant's property and constructed roadways which it proposed to convey to the Department of Transportation, who agreed to accept with the consent of owners of property where water would drain from the road. When the appellant refused to consent, the respondent applied to the municipality for proceedings under the Ditches and Water Courses Act, which failed to achieve agreement. The respondent then filed a requisition with the county clerk pursuant to s. 7(1) of the Act which allows for the appointment of a municipal engineer. The engineer filed a report in which he concluded the respondent was entitled to open a ditch on the appellant's land, subject to certain conditions. In this action, the appellant appealed pursuant to s. 12 of the Act. Allowing the appeal, that the Act appears to assume that landowners will agree that a ditch benefits their land and provides a mechanism for apportioning cost. However, it does not give an engineer authority to expropriate land or take any interest in it, nor does it provide a means by which the appellant is forced to accept the ditch. Further, the common law prohibits the use of another's property to solve one's drainage problems.","The applicant developer, Armoyan, sought to have its roadways delivered to the Department of Transportation and Communications. The applicant had failed to obtain the required consent of the owners of the land where water will drain from the road. The developer had proposed to construct a ditch or drain across the land of the Haverstock Estate, but the estate refused to consent to the drainage. The respondent's application was refused and the court awarded costs in the amount of $3,000 to the appellant as against the respondent's costs. HELD: The application was dismissed. The scope of appeal was limited to the construction of a ditch and drain and the award of costs to the respondent was appropriate."
b_2001skca85.txt,"The Court of Appeal was required to determine the limits of its authority to change the application of the Rule against Perpetuities, an established common law principle, to a particular type of oil and gas lease. In 1950 Taylor entered a 'top' (head) lease for mineral rights with Freeholders Oil, effective upon the expiry of Imperial's interest in 1959. The new owner of the land recognized the assignment of the 1961 top lease sold to Tarragon in 1993. After reaching an agreement in 1993 in principle for a 'farmout' arrangement whereby Maxx agreed to drill the lands for Tarragon, Maxx concluded the top lease offended the Rule against Perpetuities and entered its own lease with the landowner. The trial judge held the 1950 Freeholders lease was void because it contravened the Rule against Perpetuities; although top leases do not offend the policy behind the rule, any modification of the rule is best left to the legislature; there was a breach of confidence. HELD: The appeal was allowed with costs on double column V. The action for a declaration that the top lease is void was dismissed with costs in Queen's Bench. 1)The top lease in question was not void as it did not offend the object and purpose of the Rule. The reasoning and approach of the Supreme Court of Canada in Salituro, Tolofson and Morguard was persuasive. The decision of the House of Lords in Arthur J S Hall demonstrates the need to re-examine archaic rules of common law which cannot be justified in modern society. The genius of the common law lies in its adaptiveness to changing times. Its basic principles are not meant to become rigid formulae. Common law rules may be tweaked to do justice between the parties when a rigid and mechanistic application of the rule would run counter to the object and purpose of the rule. Since the socio-economic and political conditions which gave rise to the creation of the Rule no longer exist, it was open to the Court to consider the application of the rule in the context of a commercial instrument such as the top lease in question.  2)Although top leases have been attacked on other grounds, this was the first case before the Saskatchewan Courts in which the Rule against Perpetuities has been advanced to void such a lease. The historical background and object and purpose of the rule were reviewed. The general purpose is to prevent the tying up of property to the detriment of society in general. The common law rule against perpetuities prevails over intention because it is not a rule of construction, but a rule of property. A mere possibility, or even a probability that the estate or interest may vest within the time is not enough. The 'wait and see' doctrine has been adopted by statute in some jurisdictions.DISSENT: The Court should not modify the Rule in the face of the significance of such a modification, the efforts of the legislature to legislate and the inability to deal with such issues as the retrospective operation of such a decision. The Rule against Perpetuities applies to this top lease. As there is no life in being in this case, the interest must vest within 21 years of its creation which would have been 1971. The Rule is not concerned with the duration of an interest but only that an interest may vest at a remote time in the future. The rule invalidates interests in land that vest too remotely.","The trial judge held that the lease was void because it breached the rule against perpetuities. He allowed the counterclaim by the appellant Tarragon against the respondent Maxx Petroleum Ltd. for breach of confidence with consequent directions for an accounting and assessment of damages. The principal question on this appeal is whether the appellants' oil and gas 'top lease' with the late Harry Herbert Taylor should be rendered void. HELD: The appeal is allowed.  1) The principle question is whether this 1950 Freeholders agreement is void under the common law rule. It is only after the time of vesting has been ascertained that a determination can be made about whether that time is too remote and therefore in contravention of the rule.  2) Although the lease has been held to be void by the rule, it was never intended to provide information to the public interest whereby it could undermine the interest of the company. However, neither party had ever before experienced a situation where it was suggested the lease creating the interest was void. For whatever reason, it chose not to do so. 3) Although these 'top leases' have been attacked on other grounds, it is this situation which has come to be known as the modern era."

HELD: A trial of the issue was directed, as it could not be decided on the material filed whether he was intentionally unemployed or underemployed. The father's circumstances had changed since the consent order. The fact he no longer resided with a girlfriend and was making payments on a truck did not justify any reduction.

The father applies to vary a consent order dated April 5, 2001, by reducing his required child support payments from $236 per month to $19.00 per month. The consent order was granted one month after the respondent had quit his employment at Lilydale Foods. Although he remained unemployed, the respondent agreed to pay child support based upon an imputed annual income of $17,386, which is what he had been earning.

The material indicates that the respondent's circumstances have changed since April of 2001. First, he is now employed as tow truck driver and says that he is earning an annualized income of only $7,510.

c_2012nsca78.txt,", motion denied. While the province has an arguable appeal, it does not concern a summary judgment motion that would result in the claims being dismissed outright. If the certification order is struck, the province will still face individual claims. The AG has not shown that defending individual actions will cost less than defending one class proceeding. There is no evidence to estimate how it may incur significantly higher expenses as a result of how the points at issue in the appeal are resolved. The matter has been ongoing for some time and it is reasonable to expect the province has already spent time and money to prepare the defence they will eventually file. To succeed on this basis, the court would require a reliable indication of what remains to be done during the stay period, what component of that residue would be wasted if the appeal is allowed, and some estimate of that cost.","The plaintiffs sought a stay pending the Attorney General's appeal of a certification order in a class action. They alleged that the Steel Works' facilities emitted lead, arsenic, PAH's and other toxins. They sued in tort and for breach of fiduciary duty and sought damages for their own exposure and for injury to their property and their value. The defendants had not filed notice of defence until 45 days after the certification order was issued. HELD: The motion was dismissed with costs of $1,000 to be payable in the cause of the appeal.  1)The Court of Appeal did not decide whether the motion for stay should be granted. 2)There was no evidence on the point that establishing how defending individual actions would cost the Province less than defending common issues trial in class proceeding did not establish the prerequisites for stay of an enforceable order of the Supreme Court.  3)The court was not in a position to assess whether the proposed stay would cause irreparable harm. 4)It is reasonable to assume that, over the ensuing eight years up to today, the Province has made significant progress toward drafting its Defence and accumulating documents. The court has struck out claims for negligence in relation to regulation of the steel plant and the plaintiffs have decided to narrow the claims, including by reducing the scope of negligence alleged and abandoning pursuit of some remedies, such as compensation for diminution of property value and for personal injuries. 5)If there is no stay and if the province's appeal succeeds, the course of the class proceedings in the SCC will be a par for the course in the course for the rest of the litigation. 6)There is no evidence that the Province's grounds of appeal are arguable on their face. Vague and conclusory statements of counsel, without evidence, do not establish that pre-conditions for a stay of this type of litigation. 7)The judge sensibly intends that there will be only one Notice, published after the Court's decision, not as a side effect of stay from the Court."

The appellant appealed. Allowing the appeal and setting aside the order to quash, that s.37 of the Act was not a section limiting the Board's jurisdiction and that, considering s.37 and s.53 of the Act, the decision of the Board was not patently erroneous.","This was an appeal from a decision in the Supreme Court allowing an application for certiorari to quash a decision of the Workers' Compensation Board and remitting the matter to the Board to determine the rate of compensation payable to the respondent.

b_1999canlii12407.txt,"The defendant, who was to install sewer and water lines on four lots for the hamlet, was charged with seven violations of the Occupational Health and Safety Act and Regulations. It had been agreed that the offences were strict liability. The principle issue was whether the defendant had an obligation imposed by law with respect to the workers and if so whether he discharged it by exercising due diligence in the circumstances. The essential facts were not in dispute. HELD: The defendant was found guilty on all offences.  1)There is a legal duty on an employer under the Act to take steps to supervise and oversee excavations to ensure the usual protocols for safety are met. This requires at a minimum the presence of an experienced person on site. Any reasonable person with some knowledge of worksite safety would insist that the walls be properly sloped, that there be at a ladder or other method to get out of the trench and that first aid supplies were readily available. Supervision is essential particularly when the worker is inexperienced. The deceased had had no experience in sewer and water trenching. No inexperienced person should be allowed to work on such a potentially dangerous site without proper training and specific guidance and supervision. The Law is specific on the requirements to be met for safety of the workers on excavation and sewer and water hookups. 2)The remedial progress report was ruled inadmissible. There was no formal comment on the issue of admissibility. 3)The Act does not define due diligence but well established case authority defines it as taking reasonable care to avoid causing harm which is prohibited by law. 4)The Act does not apply to a contractor. The relationship had all the ordinary indicia of an employer/employee relationship. The defendant controlled the project, tools and materials and bore the risk of loss or profit, had the ultimate responsibility for the worksite, completion of the project and the payment of wages.","The defendant was charged with seven violations of the Occupational Health and Safety Act, 1993 being Chapter 0-1.1 of the Statutes of Saskatchewan and Regulations made pursuant to the Act. The defendant had complete control of the two workers but that he chose not to supervise the work site because he was extremely busy with other business matters. He also failed to take any reasonable precautions to prevent death or injury to the workers whom he was responsible for on the worksite. HELD: The defendant was found guilty of seven offences. The essential facts of the case are not in dispute and they are fairly straight-forward. The defense objected to the admission into evidence of remedial progress report that was simply marked for identification pending the ruling of the court. Because the uncontestedfacts of this case are quite sufficient for the purpose of reaching a final judgement on themerits, the Court found the report inadmissible without addressing the technical aspects of the ruling and without making a formal comment on the legal arguments put forth pro and con regarding the issue of admissibility."

The client contended that there was obvious overbilling and that the solicitor was negligent in failing to specify in an interim Order the actual time at which she had to leave the matrimonial home. Accounts as presented are certified; there was no indication whatsoever of overbilling, whether with respect to legal fees or disbursements, and there was no negligence on the part of the solicitor as she had acted reasonably in relying on the representations of the husband's lawyer as to when the Order would be enforced. It is not always necessary to examine every single entry in detail on a line-by-line basis; an overall view of the entries contained in an account can be taken when assessing reasonableness. The temporal limitation of cross-examination is within the Small Claims Court's scope of discretion in special circumstances.","The applicant, Wickwire Holm, requested a taxation of the accounts that it issued to the respondent in connection with the respondent's divorce proceedings. The respondent, who represented herself at the taxation hearing, objected to the applicant's cross-examination, arguing that it was an obvious overbilling.

They contended that they instructed the solicitor who was acting for them at the time of the trial (and who is not the solicitor on the appeal) to call certain expert evidence dealing with the causation of the fire. The solicitor called no expert evidence concerning either the proper construction of the chimney, which was alleged to be faultily constructed, or the cause. The appellants argued that the expert evidence which he wished to tender was relevant, credible and if accepted would permit the trial judge to make the findings of fact that he did and to award the damages based on those findings. HELD: 1)The application was denied. The Court of Appeal held that the tests for the admission of fresh evidence in this case were well known and were set out in R. v. Lensen, 1987 CanLII 65 (SCC), [1987] S.C.R. 672. We were not persuaded in the circumstances of this case that either misapprehended or failed to take into account evidence which was before him in arriving at his conclusion concerning the cause of the Fire. There was evidence which could have been adduced at the trial. It was the appellant's contention that in the interests of justice require that the rule of due diligence should not be strictly applied. 2)The applicant was not persuaded that the application was allowed."
1996canlii6900.txt,"A decree nisi and an order granting custody to the mother was made in 1995. Upon appeal the Court of Appeal directed a new trial. Changes in circumstances included the fact that the child was developmentally delayed and required a special program. A pediatrician testified that inconsistency in parenting approaches would further delay the child's development. HELD: Custody was awarded to the father. 1)Each parent was a capable caregiver. However, the father was available to provide full-time care due to an employment disability and exhibited a strong desire to do so. The past physical abuse of his former spouse was not considered relevant as it did not affect his ability to parent the child. 2)The mother was to have weekly access on two non-consecutive days for eight hours and two hours on a third day. The child was to sleep in the same bed every night.","The mother sought the custody of her daughter on the basis that he or she was best able to meet her needs. The father, who suffered from injuries sustained in a motor vehicle accident, was unable to work and was dependent on disability payments received from an insurer. HELD: 1)The issues before the Court were the custody issue and the central issue was what custody arrangement would be in Sophie's best interests.  2)The father was 33 years old and suffers from injuries he sustained in 1991. As result of his injuries, he is unable to earn a living, work and receive consistent instruction from his parents and other caregivers. 3)There was no convincing evidence to suggest that the past physical abuse of Tracy by Lorne diminished his ability to act as custodial parent for the child. 4)The court reviewed all of the evidence presented during the five-day trial and concluded that it was of paramount importance that the child have as much contact with her or his parents as was consistent with the child's best interest. 5)The Court had consistently applied the principles outlined by Lord Simonds in McKee v. McKee, 1951 CanLII 305 (UK JCPC), [1951] D.L.R. 657 (P.C.) at p. 666. To review all of such evidence presented at the five day trial would be unproductive and lead to prolix judgment. 6)It was necessary to deal with the distant past conduct of the parties only to the extent the same is relevant to her or her ability to care for the children."
2006skqb189.txt,"FIAT: The issues on this application are with respect to extraordinary expenses and the quantum of spousal support. HELD: 1) The petitioner's income is $73,000 versus $29,000 for the respondent. The parties cannot agree if any of the expenses fall into s. 7 of the Guidelines as being extraordinary: $975 for child care, $500 for dance, $350 for school activities, and $1,140 for asthma medication. 2) The court does not believe that the 'reasonable coverage' definition contained in the May 1, 2006 amendment is new law. At best, it is a single test now enunciated in legislative form which should provide for more consistency and predictability as opposed to the many attempts to articulate a definition of extraordinary which is found in the case law. What items claimed are necessary to attain the child's best interests and yet are reasonable given the economic circumstances of the child and her parents? Which items might be reasonably covered by the sum of the parent's income plus child support? 2) The child care costs and asthma medication costs are of sufficient amount and peculiar to this child as to be extraordinary or not expected to be reasonably covered from the table amount of child support and the respondent's income.  3) With respect to spousal support, neither counsel referred to the spousal support guidelines and the formula for spouses with children which measures the difference between the individual net disposable incomes of each former spouse. These guidelines suggest that an award of between 40% to 46% of that difference in individual net disposable income be paid by the spouse with the higher INDI to the former spouse with the lower INDI. These guidelines create a rough ballpark of $900 to $1,100 per month in this particular case. However, the petitioner is bearing the full responsibility for family debt repayment in the interim. In order to pay creditors in a timely fashion, the petitioner has taken this responsibility onto his shoulders. In the circumstances, it is ordered that the petitioner pay to the respondent interim spousal support of $700. The consequent reduction of family debt is therefore a factor of this particular interim spousal support order and should not cause confusion when addressing any property issue in the future.","FIAT: The respondent moves for an order granting to her, (1) joint custody and primary care (residence) of the child with access to her former spouse and (2) interim spousal support in the amount of $750 per month retroactive to January 1, 2006. HELD: The Court finds that the childcare costs and asthma medication costs are of sufficient amount and peculiar to the child as to be extraordinary and falls into s. which requires the said cost to be paid pro rata to the parents' respective incomes bear to the sum. In the circumstances, it is ordered that the petitioner pay to the respondent, 71% of those costs which is monthly sum of $125, and that the respondent shall bear 72% of special or extraordinary expenses as hereafter described.  1) The parties agreed on custody, access, basic child support and entitlement. The petitioner's input reduces the cost of daycare to both the petitioner and respondent and is not an offset.  2) The evidence upon the issue of retroactivity is minimal and the positions are conflicting. However, the petitioner suggests that $200 is sufficient amount to overcome any shortfall in the respondent's present budget or needs. On the other hand, the respondent urges that the economic disparity in household incomes and post-separation lifestyles leaves her with a need for $750."
9_2001canlii390.txt,"The accused was charged with operating a motor vehicle while his ability to do so was impaired and while over .08 (breath sample readings were 160 and 150 mg) contrary to s. 253(a) and s.253(b) of the Criminal Code, respectively. Issues arising during the trial included whether there was a breach of his s.8 and s.9 Charter rights to be secure against unreasonable search or seizure, and not to be arbitrarily detained; if there was a breach, was there a remedy under s.24(2); whether the evidence was sufficient to prove the offence of impaired driving beyond a reasonable doubt. The police officer concluded that he had reasonable and probable grounds for the breath demand based upon the accused sleeping through two green traffic lights, a strong smell of alcohol, and his somewhat bloodshot or glassy eyes. HELD: The accused was acquitted of both charges. 1)The evidence was sufficient to establish breaches of s.8 and s.9 of the Charter. The Certificate of Analysis constituted conscriptive evidence which, on balance, would not have been discovered by alternative means. Its admission into evidence might render the trial unfair and bring the administration of justice into disrepute. In the absence of the Certificate of Analysis, the evidence was not sufficient to prove the offence under s.253(b) beyond a reasonable doubt. 2)The strong smell of alcohol and somewhat bloodshot or glassy eyes were not sufficient to conclude there were reasonable and probable grounds for the demand. The court is required to examine the evidence as a whole. Every case will depend a great deal on its individual circumstances. It was not reasonable for the officer to assume that the vehicle not moving at the lights was a reliable indicator of impairment for these purposes. The evidence of slurred speech was not reliable as there was nothing in the officer's notes regarding slurred speech, nor had it been included in the investigation documents. The accused did not have any problems with balance or manner of walk, was cooperative throughout, and did not have any difficulty understanding his rights and the breath demand read to him from a printed card. The officer did not ask the accused whether he had been drinking. 3)The nature and quality of the evidence of a strong smell of alcohol, and eyes which were somewhat glassy or bloodshot, in the context of Stellato, was so frail as to leave a reasonable doubt as to impairment. The 'classic' signs of impairment (erratic driving, strong odour of alcoholic beverage, glassy and bloodshot eyes, slurred speech and unsteadiness on one's feet) was not intended to be an all-encompassing list, and its application will very much depend on the circumstances of a given case.","The accused was charged with impaired driving contrary to s. 253(a) and 253(b) of the Criminal Code. HELD: The accused was found not guilty of the offence. The Court held that the evidence of his ability to operate a motor vehicle while impaired was not sufficient to prove beyond a reasonable doubt the offence of impaired driving and that his eyes were glassy or glassy. The court also held that there was a breach of the accused's rights under s. 8 and s. 9 of the Charter to be secure against unreasonable search or seizure and not to be arbitrarily detained in regard to the issue of reasonable and probable grounds for the demand.  1)In the absence of the Certificate of Analysis, the accused was not found guilty. 2)The evidence of a strong smell of alcohol and eyes which were somewhat glassy were not reliable indicators of impairment. 3)The officer observed the accused sleeping through the two green traffic lights. However, thereafter, he responded immediately and awoke when he took hold of his wrist. The officer noted that the accused appeared to be asleep when he grabbed him by the wrist. This latter-mentioned reaction should have caused him to consider that perhaps he was overtired rather than being impaired by alcohol or drug. 4)The Court found that the officer's observations did not provide sufficient evidence for the breath demand. 5)In all criminal cases the trial judge must be satisfied as to a person's guilt beyond reasonable doubt before a conviction can be registered. Accordingly, before convicting an accused of the impaired driving, the trial must be sure that he's able to operate the motor vehicle. Therefore, the evidence must be sufficient to establish reasonable or probable grounds. 6)The accused is not guilty."
6_2005nssc128.txt,"Pursuant to the Corollary Relief Judgment, the parents had been equally sharing the parenting time of their two children for four years. The father now applied for interim sole custody, alleging that the ongoing extreme conflict between the parties was adversely affecting the children. An assessment recommended that the children live with the father and have access with the mother. Father granted interim sole care, custody and control of the children. The serious concerns raised by the assessment satisfied the threshold requirement of a material change in circumstances; the urgency of the concerns required immediate action.","This was an interim application to vary the terms of a 2001 Corollary Relief Judgment respecting parenting arrangements.

Both parents have shared, joint custody, care and control of the Children of the Marriage. The children have been placed in the primary care and custody of their father, Greg Patterson. The assessment report was completed in 2005 and there were thirteen recommendations, most fundamental being that the children be placed in their father's custody. All other recommendations were to be implemented at the very earliest opportunity. The mother wishes to continue with the shared parenting arrangement, but prefers that the three days on-four days off arrangement be the practice."
b_2018skca27.txt,"HELD: The appeal from conviction was dismissed and sentence appeal allowed. The sentence was varied to 12 months of probation. The court found with respect to each issue that: 1) the presumption of competent trial representation had not been displaced. The trial lawyer’s decision not to cross-examine the complainant was a tactical one. She was very young and had difficulty expressing herself in the courtroom whereas she had given clear, coherent statements to the police shortly after the offence. The lawyer determined that it was not beneficial to the appellant’s position to highlight those statements by raising certain inconsistences between them and the complainant’s testimony;  2) the trial judge’s assessment of credibility was entitled to deference. He correctly identified R v W.(D.) as the guiding legal principle in the circumstances and his credibility findings were supportable on the evidence; and 3) the sentence was unfit because denunciation and deterrence are secondary factors in sentencing young offenders and are to be considered in a fashion consistent with the principle of “diminished moral blameworthiness” described in s. 3 the YCJA. The court acknowledged that this offence, committed against an 11-year-old and causing her serious psychological harm, might warrant a custodial sentence but for the appellant’s exemplary conduct since the offence and the almost four years that had elapsed between the offence in 2012 and his sentencing in 2016. Under s. 3(1)(b)(iv) and (v) of the YCJA, the delay in this case offended the concept of timely justice. To impose a custodial sentence on the appellant in this case would be contrary to the purposes of the YCJA as it would impede the appellant’s rehabilitation and reintegration into society. The court decided that a fit sentence in this case would be 12 months of probation.","The appellant appeals both his conviction and sentence. The appellant contends the trial judge made errors in assessing the credibility of the witnesses and that he received ineffective trial representation. HELD: The appeal is dismissed. The conviction appeal is allowed and the sentence imposed is varied to 12 months of probation. 1) The trial judge correctly identified R v W.(D.) as the guiding legal principle in such circumstances. The focus of sentencing under the Youth Criminal Justice Act is balancing conflicting principles to arrive at a sentence tailored to the individual circumstances. Given the circumstances, the appellant has the onus of establishing that his counsel's professional judgment was unreasonable in the circumstances and that this unreasonable professional judgment caused a miscarriage of justice.  2) The appellant has failed to establish there is any reasonable basis upon which to question the appellant's credibility assessment of the former babysitter, which is in fact corroborated by other evidence leading up to the critical event, including the events afterwards when she's seen leaving the house by the accused's siblings. 3) Given the seriousness of the offence and the fact that denunciation and deterrence must take paramount importance, an appellate court may only interfere with a sentence simply because it would have imposed a different sentence. 4) The evidence satisfies the threshold for admission as set out in Worm. The evidence must meet the criteria for the admission of fresh evidence as set forth in Palmer (1979), 1979 CanLII (SCC), [1979] SCR 759 at 414 Sask 184. 5) The Court reviewed the circumstances of the case and found the sentencing judge committed an error in principle when he rejected the evidence of the complainant's parents and siblings that the complainant was only at the house for five or ten minutes and that she never went into the bedroom. The Court was of the opinion his minimal reliance on the ex-babysitter's evidence to assess her condition after the offence had no meaningful impact on the verdict."
1997canlii11078.txt,"The applicant sought to be appointed as property guardian for his uncle pursuant to s19 of the Dependent Adults Act. The proposed dependent adult resisted the application and attributed his previous difficulty managing his affairs to a severe drinking problem but indicated that he had not been drinking for six years. The uncle had never been declared incompetent to manage his affairs. He voluntarily transferred the land left to him by his father and had allowed the trust arrangement to continue since 1951. Over the years, the land was transferred from the original trustees to various other family members and was presently registered in the name of the applicant nephew. There was no dispute that the uncle was the beneficial owner.HELD: The land was vested directly in the name of Selwyn Hand. The conditional stay in place pending the resolution of this application for the appointment of a property guardian was lifted. 1)The proposed dependent adult was capable of managing a significant portion of his business affairs and matters relating to his estate and property. However he required significant independent assistance in the management of the land held for his benefit. His suggestions and proposal to sell the land and travel were reasonable and financially modest. 2)The criteria set forth in s18 for the appointment of a property guardian was met and the Public Trustee was appointed to administer the balance of the proceeds from the land sale remaining after the uncle pursued his financial commitments and his dreams.  3)Costs in the amount of $7,000 were to be paid to the applicant in the event the uncle chose to sell his land. 4)Any proposed sale would be subject to the approval of the Court upon application of Hand. One half of the proceeds were to be provided directly to Hand to be dealt with as he chooses and the remaining half were to be administered by the Public Trustee in his longer term best interests according to the normal powers and procedures of that office.","The applicant sought the appointment of the property guardian pursuant to s. 19 of The Dependent Adults Act. The applicant was a 76 year old gentleman who lived in the Biggar area of Saskatchewan and in 1994 moved to Estevan, where he established a relationship with Mrs. Essex Essex. HELD: The application was granted. 1)The applicant was of the opinion that the respondent was acting out of concern for the applicant. He was entitled to manage his property unless he was not competent to manage it. 2)The court found that the applicant met the criteria set forth in s. 18 for the appointment as property guardian. The court ordered that the application be made within 45 days. 3)The application was adjourned for 45 days to allow the respondent to bring an application backable within the 45 days prescribed by s. 34 of the Trustee Act. 4)The Court found that it was in the best interests of the applicant that the land be vested directly in his name.  5)The respondent was to appoint the applicant's property guardian as part of the vesting order.  6)The public trustee was to be appointed property guardian under s. 87 of the Land Titles Act."

Section 37 of The Wills Act permits the Court to order a document to be fully effective as a Will notwithstanding that it was not executed in compliance with all the formal requirements imposed by the Act.

The parties agreed to Gabrielson J. receiving the report and neither party sought to cross-examine the writer of the report. HELD: Leave denied. Even if there was a scintilla of merit to the argument, the Court would not grant leave to appeal on the basis that to grant leave to appeal on an extremely technical ground would cause delay that is manifestly not in the best interest of the child in the circumstances of this case. The issue is not of sufficient significance either to the parties or to the wider public to warrant an appeal.","The Minister of Social Services applied for leave to appeal an order of the Court of Appeal granting leave to the father to adduce fresh evidence in relation to his fitness to parent the child.

This order was granted by Meekma P.C.J. The father appealed the order. HELD: Leave was granted or withheld on considerations of merit and importance. There was no merit to either of the proposed grounds of appeal.

The result favoured joining the federation. The applicant applies under The Non-Profit Corporations Act, 1995 seeking sundry relief, the net result of which would set aside the outcome of the referendum. HELD: 1) The test emanating from the Controverted elections cases are not applicable. In debates of this type, the preferred guidance is from the test articulated in Walton (Litigation Guardian of) v. Saskatchewan Hockey Association and the related cases dealing with non-profit organizations. In those cases, the Court does not ask itself whether the results have been skewed, but rather has the organization acted in good faith and generally in accord with the concepts of natural justice? This does not mean that there must be an exacting legal process or an application of the full 'panoply' of procedural natural justice issues. The question is has the organization acted in a fashion that meets the legitimate expectations of a fair-minded observer? 2) No reasonable observer could conclude that the USC approached the post-vote process in good faith or in a fashion that is in harmony with the broad rules of natural justice. When faced with a result (rendered by a procedure which it had specifically established for the referendum) which was not consistent with its wishes, the USC simply ignored its own rules and imposed its own preordained outcome. Accordingly, the Court concluded that the USC breached its obligation to act in good faith and conducted itself in a fashion inconsistent with natural justice. The applicant is entitled to a portion of the relief he seeks. The referendum held by the USSU on the issue of whether it should join the CFS is of no force or effect.","FIAT The applicant applies under The Non-Profit Corporations Act, 1995, S.S. 1995, c.

The result favoured joining the federation.  2) The applicant was not a party to the referendum. He was a former director. 3) Although there is no definition of an 'election' in the Act, the respondents argue that a plain and usual reading of s. 135 would confine the ambit of the word 'election to that of an election of director or auditor. They suggest that it would be an error, and clear misreading of the section, to provide an expansive definition of election so as to encompass a referendum by a non-profit corporation seeking membership in a third party. 4) The respondent was given the task of ratifying the CFS membership referendum results.

6_1999skqb124.txt,"The plaintiff who had been employed by the defendant's predecessor for 23 years as office manager and bookkeeper until 1997, brought an action for damages against her new employers for dismissal without adequate notice. The plaintiff took stress leave and requested to be relieved of her duties as office manager in 1998. The action proceeded under the simplified procedure in Part Forty of the Queen's Bench Rules. HELD: 1)The conduct amounted to constructive dismissal entitling her to withdraw services without a reduction in the notice period. Although the defendant had numerous complaints the plaintiff was not dismissed for cause. Her termination of employment related only to her reduced position as bookkeeper which was for an indefinite period of time. Her employment had already been terminated by notice of nearly a year. She remained entitled to notice to March 31, 1999 at her salary at the time of termination and to medical expenses that would have been covered but without bonuses or extra payments for sick pay. 2)The defendant did not establish the plaintiff ought to have done more to mitigate her loss. There was no basis for punitive damages nor for an extension of the period of notice.  3)The net earnings between May 1998 and March 1999 were deducted after deducting $50 for the cost of qualifying for that employment. Amounts owing by the plaintiff to the defendant were to be deducted. 4)The plaintiff was entitled to interest in accordance with the Pre-judgment Interest Act. 5)The defendant could make no deduction for insurance benefit payments. Sections 45 and 46 of the Employment Insurance Act was drawn to their attention. 6)The plaintiff was awarded costs. Fees were to be taxed on column 2. 7)The plaintiff was to deliver a copy of the calculation of the judgment. Either could issue judgment with the other's consent as to form and content. An application for further directions could be made.","The plaintiff's action is for wrongful dismissal or, stating it more correctly, for damages for dismissal from her employment without adequate notice. The action was under the simplified procedure in Part Forty of Queen's Bench Rules. At trial, the affidavits-in-chief of the plaintiff's witnesses were marked as plaintiff exhibits and the witnesses were called for cross-examination by the defendant followed by redirect questions from plaintiff's counsel. At the conclusion of plaintiff's evidence, the defendant can deduct any such insurance payments made to the plaintiff. The cross-exam is to be deducted the amounts owing by the plaintiff to the defendant. This does not include the Saxby account which predated the transfer of the business. Equal latitude may be required in the plaintiff’s cross examination of the defendants’ witnesses.

The evidence was more impressionistic than probative of the facts alleged and the accused's evidence raised reasonable doubts in the court's mind.","The accused was charged with sexual assault and touching of the complainant. The complainant was a close friend of the accused's mother's ex-boyfriend. During the latter good relationship, the complainant would often sleep over with the accused and she would often report that the accused had touched her in her vaginal area. The accused testified that the complainant felt something inside her pyjamas and that she felt something touching her. HELD: The accused was not guilty as charged. The evidence was more impressionistic than probative of the facts alleged and the complainant appeared somewhat casual, impersonal, scripted and lacked background details such as bodily sensations as one might expect from someone who experienced the ordeal would know about. Although the complainant testified that she could feel something while asleep, she could not, without doubt, state that in reality, what she experienced was the accused actually touching her vagina with his hands.

The mother appealed., appeal dismissed; the chambers judge focused on the best interests of the child and did not fail to give appropriate consideration to the factors set out in the Act. He did not place too much emphasis on the child's loss of a potential relationship with and support from the father on the facts of this case.","The appellant appealed the November 2004 decision refusing to grant her the adoption she sought with respect to her four year old daughter. The appellant argued the chambers judge erred by placing too much emphasis on the child's loss of her possible relationship with and support from her father. The chambers judge agreed with the appellant that there had been no contact between the child and her father since November 2000 or whether he was or is presently able to provide financial support for her and whether the appellant ever sought child support. He agreed that the father was not entitled to notice and was not required to consent to the adoption as result of the interplay between s. 67(1)(f) and s. 74(3) of the Act because he had not had contact with the child or provided support to her. HELD: Appeal dismissed. 1)The facts were scant, as acknowledged by the appellant, because the only evidence before the judge was the usual documentation provided to court with an application for an uncontested adoption. The child's father had not consented. 2)The chambers judge did not err when he balanced the neutral impact the adoption would have on her relationship with her father against the loss to the child of possible relationship, support and inheritance. The Minister chose not to intervene or take any position on the appeal.  3)This type of balancing test for determining the best interests of the child in the context of adoption was approved by Wolfe v. Cherrett (1978), 1978 CanLII 2149 (28 N.S.R.

If the legislature had intended that consignees were not to be considered retail sellers, it would have listed them in the excluded group. Persons may be considered retail sellers even though they have no contractual relationship to the purchaser in s.55. 2)While the plaintiff did not pay a large sum of money, he could still expect this vehicle to be safe to drive. It was not safe and accordingly was not of acceptable quality. The retail seller bears the burden of establishing the exceptions enumerated in the statutory warranty and failed to do so. The vehicle was unsafe from the outset and could not be considered suitable for the purpose of providing transportation. It was unnecessary to make a finding with respect to warranty s. 48(g) (durable for a reasonable period of time). 3)This auto was substantially unfit for all the usual purposes for which, to the knowledge of the retail seller, it was being bought and accordingly the breach was of a substantial character. 4)The plaintiff rejected the goods within a reasonable period. The commencement of the present action was treated as the rejection of the product. The bulk of delay was caused by the defendant's failure to pick up and look at the vehicle (and implication this would involve repair) as agreed.","A consignee was engaged in consignment auto sales upon the business premises of Triple R, with Triple R's knowledge and consent. The sole financial benefit for this activity was to go to the plaintiff. The only benefit that Triple R received was the opportunity to perform repair work for reward upon the consigned vehicles. The vehicle was driven almost 5,000 kilometres. The plaintiff was not interested in having the vehicle repaired, even if it was possible, in that he had obtained a different vehicle for his daughter. He sought recovery of the purchase price and the costs that he incurred for repair and inspection. Triple R did not establish the exceptions enumerated in the statutory warranty. HELD: 1)The plaintiff was a retail seller within the meaning of the Act and accordingly Triple R was deemed to have given the plaintiff ceratin warranties to the extent that they were reasonable for the use of the product. 2)In the circumstances, the plaintiff did reject the goods within a reasonable period. 3)The court found support for the notion that persons may be considered retail sellers even though they have no contractual relationship to the purchaser. In the circumstances the actions of the plaintiff must be considered by Triple R. 4)The Court found that the plaintiff was entitled to recover $1600 plus foreseeable damages. The costs incurred for repairs and inspection, being $146.30 and $96.05, totalling $242, were properly recoverable."
c_2017skqb144.txt,"HELD: The application was granted. The court ordered that the property be sold and the proceeds of sale take into account the amount necessary to protect the respondent father’s claim. The Partition Act, 1868 applies in the province. It did not allow the equitable principles of unjust enrichment and constructive trust to operate to create a proprietary interest. The court found that s. 4 of the Act applied, which provides a monetary remedy so that if the respondent father could establish entitlement to some amount for his maintenance and improvement costs, he would be protected for that amount for his costs.","The sisters apply for a partition and sale of lake front recreational property owned by them together with their brother. Each of the parties owns an undivided one quarter interest as tenants in common in the property. The parties inherited the property from their mother after her death in 1996. They are now separated. The respondent, who no longer resides at the next door property, says that as result of the separation it may have to be sold. The Respondents acknowledge that the respondent, through the operation of the principle of unjust enrichment and resulting or constructive trusts, contribute approximately $40,000 in materials and $40k in time to maintain and improve the property and that these improvements have added to the value of the Property. HELD: The application will be allowed. 1) There is no reason in law or justice for the defendant's retention of the benefit conferred by the plaintiff, making its retention 'unjust' in the circumstances of the case. 2) There are numerous authorities for the proposition that a joint tenant has prima facie right to partition or sale at any time. The court has discretion to refuse partition, but this discretion is'severely limited': see Bergen v. Bergen (1969), 1969 CanLII 1071 (BC), 68 W.W.R. 196 (B.C.), and the cases therein referred to. The plaintiff must come into court 'with clean hands': McGeer v. Green (1960), 20 Gr. 221; Pascoe v. Swan (1859), 27 Beav. 508, at 779. 3) In seeking partition, the plaintiff must not be motivated by malice, or by desire to be vexatious or oppressive. In partition cases, the word 'oppressive' means 'oppressive economically'. 4) The Court must be able to look to all of the circumstances relating to the manner in which the parties organized their relationship and whether an injustice has arisen that without equity cannot be remedied. 5) When applying the Act the equities that might result in an unequal division of the sale proceeds are taken into account after the sale and are not used to determine the ownership interest of the title holder opposing partition and s. 6."
b_1996canlii6803.txt,"A claim for wrongful dismissal. The position of executive secretary was discontinued for economic reasons. HELD: The plaintiff was awarded $30,737.93 plus costs plus pre-judgment interest. 1)The plaintiff had taken all reasonable steps to mitigate her losses. The duty is to take such steps as a reasonable person would take in his own interests to maintain his income and position in his industry, trade or profession. The former employer has no right to expect that the former employee will accept a lower paying alternative employment with doubtful prospects. 2)Reasonable notice would have been ten months. She had been erroneously requested to take 19.871 days as annual leave and therefore actually received one months' notice. Nine months salary at $26,514.00 plus $1,325 for lost pension benefits and $564 for the Canada Pension Plan were awarded. She was to be compensated for 19.871 days of combined time in lieu and annual leave.","This was a claim for wrongful dismissal. The plaintiff was employed with the defendant, Gabriel Dumont Institute, from January 1983 to May 1993 at which time she was dismissed. She was the sole supporter of her family as her husband was unemployed. She took all reasonable steps to mitigate her damages, including turning down an offer from another company for a new and experimental position. She turned it down because the position was too risky and the duties were materially different from those at her previous employer. The defendant was not obligated to accept the offer for the position. For the period of 9 months, the court assessed her damages at $26,514.93 and awarded pre-judgment interest pursuant to the Pre-Judgment Interest Act."
e_2005skqb549.txt,"There is no dispute between the parties as to the nature of the plaintiff's investment in the defendant corporation. The real issue between the parties is whether the plaintiff is entitled to the summary relief, which she now seeks pursuant to Rules 129 and 133 of The Queen's Bench Rules. It is the position of the plaintiff that the cross- examination of the defendant on his affidavit discloses that the corporation is profitable company and that s. 34(2) of The Business Corporation Act does not provide any defence to the defendants against the requested relief sought. The parties are in disagreement over the issue of the amount of dividend payments that have been made by the corporation to the plaintiff pursuant to her investment in the corporation. HELD: 1) The plaintiff's application for summary judgment does not require the corporation to redeem any redeemable shares. Rather, the plaintiff's application is one seeking summary judgment. The corporate defendant is not making payment to redeem shares, but rather following judgment however and whenever obtained, it would be subject to the normal judgment process, including execution. Such execution or enforcement of judgment is not tantamount to redemption of shares. The plaintiff provided notice in writing to the corporation that she wished to redeem all her Class E preferred shares effective March 2005. The principal amount of her shares is $214,600. It is this amount that she seeks as the substance of her summary judgment. Section 34(2) of the Act does not serve to prevent the plaintiff seeking summary judgment from the court. The effect of granting judgment, if it is otherwise appropriate to do so, does not place the corporation in a position of breaching the prohibitions contained in s. 34(2) of the Act. 2) The defendants have not demonstrated that there is real insolvency on the part of the corporation. The defendants have failed to provide responses to the undertakings. Further, the defendants have not provided any professional analysis or evidence in support of their position that s. 34(2) is applicable. 3) The amount sought to be recovered by the plaintiff does represent debt or liquidated demand as contemplated by Rule 129. The plaintiff is entitled to summary judgment against the defendant corporation for the sum of $214,600 pursuant to Rule 129. Further the plaintiff is entitled to interest at the rate of 16% from March 2005 in accordance with the Share Agreement. 4) The plaintiff has not demonstrated an appropriate basis for summary judgment against the individual defendants. 5) The plaintiff is entitled to costs.","The plaintiff commenced an action against the defendants seeking various items of specific relief and costs on solicitor-client basis. Thereafter, the plaintiff brought notice of motion seeking an order that the defendants provide an accounting in relation to specified items. The defendants opposed each of the requests on the basis that they were inappropriate in light of the overall context of the litigation. HELD: 1)The plaintiff's motion does not require the defendants to'make any payment to purchase' or to'redeem any redeemable shares' nor does it allege that the defendant has any obligation to redeem the plaintiff's preferred shares. 2)The amount sought to be recovered by the plaintiff in the amount of $214,600 does not represent debt or liquidated demand as contemplated in s.34(2) of the Business Corporations Act. 3)The affidavit of the plaintiff deposed positively to the facts in question, verifies the cause of action and the amount claimed as due. 4)There was no evidence before the Court to suggest any grounds for believing that the corporation is insolvent as required by s. 34(2). 5)The affidavits of the defendants were examined and the court was of the view that s34(1) does not serve to prevent the plaintiff from seeking summary judgment from the Court. The effect of granting a judgment, if it is otherwise appropriate to do so, does not place the corporation in a position of breaching the prohibitions contained therein. 6)In the event that this interpretation is wrong, it is also necessary to examine the question of whether there are reasonable grounds to believe that the corporate defendant has a good defence to, or ought to be permitted to defend, but rather, following judgment however and whenever obtained, it would be subject to the normal judgment process, including execution. Such execution or enforcement of judgment is not tantamount to redemption of shares."
d_1997canlii14978.txt,"This was an appeal from an assessment of $5,454,000 in damages resulting from the appellant's liability to the respondent in tort for negligently prepared financial statements upon which the respondent relied in deciding to purchase the shares of a business. The appellants appealed. They argued that the trial judge, by measuring the respondent's loss on the basis that he should be put in the position he would have been if the financial statements had been accurate, had applied the wrong test. Allowing the appeal reducing the damage award to $2,745,600, that the trial judge erred in the test he applied to the award of damages. The proper test is to put the respondent as far as possible in the position he would have been in if he had not invested in the company. The damages are the amount by which the actual value of the company was less than what the respondent paid at the time of purchase.","This was an appeal from an assessment of damages flowing from the appellant's liability to the respondent in tort for negligently prepared financial statements. The appellant was a businessman living in Port Hawkesbury and the numbered company was owned by him and was the vehicle used by him to acquire the shares of Action Business Machines Limited (ABM). The trial judge awarded direct damages of $1,700,000 representing lost return on alternative investment of $2,000,000 at 10% per annum for seven years. This was the first time the trial judge had measured the loss on the footing that the appellant should be put in the position he would be had the financial statements of ABM been correct. This, being the test for measuring damages for breach of a contractual warranty, is not the correct test. The first approach was to be preferred as it looked at the company as going concern on the transaction date rather than assuming liquidation at future date. The second approach is to fix the damages so as to put the appellant as far as possible in his position as he would have been had he not invested in ABM. In particular, the damages are prima facie the amount by which the actual value of the ABM was less than what the appellant paid for it."

The lottery money was spent on household finances and lost in husband's small business venture. Husband 'spent more money on alcohol than he should have'.

Husband's mismanagement of the family's financial affairs was grounds for unequal division of the property:","The applicant sought a division of matrimonial property pursuant to the provisions of The Matrimonial Property Act and maintenance for the two youngest children pursuant to The Deserted Wives' and Children's Maintenance Act. HELD: 1)The respondent abused alcohol and spent more money on alcohol than he should have.

HELD: The evidence from the lawyer who prepared the Testator's last Will was that she was concerned that the testator was being influenced. The evidence from the executor of the Estate raises no such concerns. Based on the evidence, the conflict in the evidence and the law, the issue of undue influence cannot be resolved without a trial of the issue. A trial is ordered.","FIAT: The applicant sister of the deceased testator sought a hearing to prove his last will and testament in solemn form for the purpose of determining whether the will was brought about by the exertion of undue influence on the testator by the respondent. HELD: The application was dismissed.

The Court found that the offences fell on the low end of the sexual assault spectrum as there was no skin to skin contact, the contact was brief and without violence or threats. The aggravating factors were that the accused had two previous convictions for sexual offences and that one of the victims had some cognitive disability. The accused was sentenced to a term of one year imprisonment for each count, followed by a term of probation of two years. The sentences were to be served concurrently.",HELD: The Court found the accused guilty of two counts of sexual assault contrary to s. 271 of the Criminal Code. The accused was 61 years old and lived in Labrador. He had two prior convictions for assault and a persistent problem with alcohol. The only evidence in respect of the accused's relationship with the complainant was from the trial. There was no evidence that the accused abused the complainant's spouse or common-law partner. The Court of Appeal assessed the accused as a low risk to re-offend and imposed a sentence of 30 months imprisonment with a 10 year conditional sentence. The court found that the offender's record established a pattern of sexual assaults and that the sentence imposed was demonstrably unfit.
5_1994canlii5076.txt,"FIAT The accused, who was charged with two counts of sexual assault involving complainants 15 and 13 years of age, applied for a remedy under ss.24(1) of the Charter of Rights compelling the respondent to provide full disclosure to him, without trust conditions or undertakings of any sort. HELD: The imposition of trust conditions on the disclosure of victim's statements and videotaped statements in cases of sexual assault does not prevent the accused from exercising his right to make full answer and defence as guaranteed by ss. 7 and 11 of the Charter. The obligation to disclose is not absolute. The Corwn's obligation to protect the privacy of the complainants is fulfuilled by providing the statements and videotapes to counsel for the accused on trust condition that counsel retain them in his possession. The information contained therein is available to the accused and retained experts for use in preparing his defence. Since the accused knows the sustance of the complaints and, therefore, the case he has to meet, there is no danger to the fairness of the trial by virtue of the trust condition attached to disclosure. The public interest is served and the integrity of the criminal justice system is maintained when complainants are assured that staements and videotapes will not be reproduced. Application dismissed.","FIAT. The applicant applied for a remedy under s. 24(1) of the Charter and s. 650(3) of Criminal Code compelling the respondent to provide full and complete disclosure to him.

The Crown is doing what it can to prevent the improper use of sensitive material necessary to the prosecution of a sexual assault case. 2)The Court found that placing conditions on disclosure did not constitute failure to disclose and an infringement of s. s. of Charter rights. The Court of Appeal held that the trust conditions sought to be imposed by the Crown in this case were reasonable and strike a balance between the right to disclosure and the rights of alleged victims, it being recognized that the right of fair trial is paramount. 3)The applicant was able to review and study the complainant statements, written and videotaped, on his own and away from the office of counsel, and his right to utilize them as claimed, are not essential to provide disclosure and to provide a full answer and defence."
e_2013skqb434.txt,HELD: The Court granted the application. It held that: 1) a solicitor-client relationship was created between the applicants and the defendants based on the evidence; and 2) that the applicants had not rebutted the presumption that they had received confidential information during the meeting that was relevant to the plaintiff’s action against the defendants. That finding was sufficient to disqualify them for acting for the plaintiff.,"The sole issue presented by this application is whether the Phillips Co. lawyers should be disqualified from continuing to act for the plaintiff because of a conflict of interest. HELD: 1) The sole issue is whether Mervin C. Phillips and the lawyers with Phillips Co.'s law firm are ethically bound by the Rules of the Law Society of Saskatchewan to refrain from acting against a former client in the same or any related matter. At its core, the action between Pearce-Ell and the Holgates pertains to the terms of the agreement for sale, which is the same matter, or at the very least, a related matter to the original retainer. That alone is sufficient to justify their disqualification. The same result is achieved by applying the Martin principles and presumptions. As the Phillips & Co. law firm have failed to rebut that presumption, the court should infer that confidential information was imparted unless the solicitor satisfies the court that he or she is seeking to continue on with the client. 2) There is an obvious conflict of interests which requires court intervention in the interests of the broader administration of justice. 3) The court reviewed the Alberta case of Jeffers v. Calico Compression Systems, 2002 ABQB 72 where numerous indicia of solicitor-client relationship were discussed. It was hard to fathom that information imparted to the former client was purely procedural and benign in nature and not ultimately relevant to the suit commenced one year later by the defendant."

As a result the board was dominated by the original Precision group of shareholders and even though the Government of Saskatchewan and Bondco were entitled to enough votes to exercise control of the company, they could not change the board and did not have the usual ways of enforcing their wishes.

While there is no direct evidence to establish that the defendant set the fire himself, in the circumstances, I drawthe inference that he did or in the alternative, caused the fire by his deliberate act. The plaintiff showed no signs of the effects of heat, such as thermal burns on his skin or his hair having been singed. The defendant did not call evidence to rebut Mr. Yuen's findings and the plaintiff's own version of events. When the plaintiff returned from his grandmother's house to have them call the fire department, he was found not to have suffered any symptoms of heat or was suffering from heat related to the smoke inhalation.

HELD: The application was dismissed. 1)The defendant had not met the onus of establishing the plaintiff should have her prima facie entitlement to a jury trial denied. Any preliminary findings made by the plaintiff do not diminish or encroach on the jurisdiction of the trial judge to determine at any point of time whether the case or parts of it should be put to the jury. The failure to move to strike in timely fashion does not impact on the question of whether the jury notice should be struck. 2)The delay in filing the notice to strike was not sufficient to establish that the plaintiff was entitled to jury notice. There was a series of Ontario Superior Court decisions indicating such an issue was not 'appropriate' for jury trial. The trial judge may, in rare cases, take all or part of a trial from the jury after its commencement. Nevertheless, timely motions should be made and not left until the eve of trial where such could easily have been advanced for some considerable time. 3)The plaintiff failed to give any or sufficient weight to the vital factor of whether there was just cause for the appellant's dismissal.

The bankrupt's disability pension from Veterans' Affairs was not included in the calculation of surplus income as the public policy reason behind the exemption for proceeds received due to personal injury and a soldier's danger pay applied to this disability pension. The Trustee had no claim to the insurance proceeds received by the bankrupt following the loss of her home by fire as it was a modest sum used to replace lost personal exempt assets; the three horses were found to be owned by the bankrupt as opposed to her children, for whom she had purchased them as pets and were included in the value of her estate; the court exercised its discretion in determining the amount of surplus income, noting that the administration of the estate had been unusually hostile and it was important that the bankrupt be able to stabilize her family finances.","The applicant sought to be discharged from bankruptcy. She owned a ride-on lawnmower and horse trailer which were not declared assets. She claimed ownership and sought compensation for certain exempt personal property which had been taken from her.

Salsman had resigned and the opening was imminent. The plaintiff had not had sufficient time to gather all the evidence it wished to present on an interlocutory motion. HELD: The motion was granted. 1)There was a high potential for irreparable harm to the plaintiff company - the loss of customers, market share, though difficult to quantify, is real and is the type of harm contemplated by this branch of the test. The balance of convenience favored the plaintiff. 2)The hearing of the Interlocutory Injunction should be full and consider all of the evidence. The impending and imminent opening of the new business satisfies the requirement that of 41.04 2 (c) that urgency exists and cannot await the determination of the motion for a motion. It is obvious that once that new business opens, the effect upon the Plaintiff company will be profound and there is really no going back."

An execution order was issued and the defendant's wages were garnisheed. The defendant had not shown by his affidavit why his defence was not filed and delivered within the time limited by the Rules. HELD: The defendant's application was dismissed. The court found that the originating notice did not set out acts upon which in the words of Ives v. Dewar would clearly indicate he had good defence to the action on the merits; not necessarily defence which would succeed at trial because the action was not being tried on the application, but facts which would show beyond a question that there was a substantial issue between the parties to be tried."
e_2012skpc80.txt,The accused was charged with two counts being driving while impaired contrary to s. 253(1)(a) and refusal to provide a breath sample contrary to s. 254(5) of the Criminal Code. The Court had earlier acquitted the accused on the charge of driving while disqualified as there was no evidence regarding the status of the accused's driver's licence. At issue was whether the GiO cycle or moped which the accused was operating was a motor vehicle as defined by the Criminal Code. The accused asserted that his GiO bike was operated that night by pedaling it as the electric motor was not working and asserted that driver's licence was not required to operate the GiO bike nor was he required to put licence plate on it. HELD: The accused was found not guilty of the charges before the Court. There was no evidence that the electric motor on the GiO bike was operational that evening and the officer testified that he observed the accused dragging his feet while driving the moped.,"The accused was charged with impaired driving and failure to provide a breath sample contrary to s. 253(1)(a) of the Criminal Code. The issue before the court was whether the accused's GiO cycle was a motor vehicle as defined by the Code. HELD: The accused was found not guilty. 1) The Crown had failed to prove on February 26, 2010 that the accused was operating motor vehicle on the evening of February 26. However, acquitting him of the charges of operating a vehicle while impaired and driving while disqualified, the Court held that the Crown had not proven on all of the evidence that there were pedals on the accused’s bike and that the electric motor was operable. 2) The accused had not demonstrated that his bike was drawn, propelled or driven by any means other than muscular power. His breath registered a fail result on the breathalyser. 3) The court was unable to decide whom to believe as to whether the bikes were pedals, whether there were electric motors on the bike, whether the electric motors were operable and 4) Whether the accused had a licence to operate the bike. The Crown was also unable to prove that the motor vehicle was motor vehicle. The accused should be acquitted of the charge of impaired driving."
5_2005skqb219.txt,"The accused has been in custody since November 17, 2004. After show cause hearings, the court refused to release the accused from detention. The accused apply for a review of the detention orders. HELD: 1) A review of the detention orders would ordinarily be cursory and the applications dismissed. The reasons for the decisions to refuse to release the accused cannot seriously be questioned. 2) However, a factor that causes concern is that 6 months after their arrest, not only has a preliminary hearing not been conducted, no date for a preliminary hearing has been set. No preliminary hearing date will be set before May 2005. The preliminary hearing will take 2 to 3 weeks.  It seems unlikely that the trial of these individuals will take place within a year of the date of their arrest. 3) They are ordered released on terms and upon the filing of security in the amount of $1,000.","The accused were charged with a multitude of offences pursuant to the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act, S.S. 1996, c.19 and the Criminal Code, which include trafficking in cocaine and methamphetamine, conspiracy to do so with one another and several other individuals, and several Criminal Code offences, including possession of proceeds of crime. Both individuals have been in custody since November 17, 2004. HELD: The accused were released on a recognizance. The accused was ordered to remain in custody and, having regard to all the circumstances presented to her, the substantial likelihood that the accused would, if released from custody, commit a criminal offence.

e_2014skqb265.txt,The determination of whether the trial judge’s conclusion regarding the officer’s suspicion was reasonable was question of law subject to the correctness standard. The respondent conceded that the officer had the requisite subjective belief that he had alcohol in his body so the appeal centered on whether the objective test had been met. The appeal court did not find any basis to disturb the trial judge’s finding of fact as to the factors the officer based his suspicion of alcohol consumption on. The court noted the trouble with the fact that the respondent admitted to drinking alcohol that “evening” but the stop was at 5:00 am in the morning. The trial judge disregarded the respondent’s admission to drinking because there was no smell of alcohol and the trial judge said there should be if the consumption was recent. The court concluded that the trial judge erred in dismissing the alcohol consumption admission. A reasonable person would have assumed that the officer’s question was with respect to recent consumption of alcohol not an earlier irrelevant time. It was also found reasonable for the officer to believe the consumption was recent. The court concluded that a reasonable person standing in the officer’s place would reasonably suspect that the respondent had alcohol in his body. An answer by an accused person that they have been drinking was found to be stronger support for a suspicion than the smell of alcohol. Because the respondent’s Charter rights were not breached a new trial was ordered.,"The accused was charged with impaired driving contrary to s. 253(1)(a) of the Criminal Code and operating a motor vehicle when the concentration of alcohol in his blood exceeded 80 milligrams of alcohol per 100 millilitres of blood. The accused challenged the reasonableness of the investigating officer's suspicion upon which the officer based his ASD demand. The Crown appealed the acquittals of the accused and the accused was acquitted of both charges. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. 1)The trial judge found the accused's suspicion was not reasonable and there being no other reason for detaining him, there was a violation of his rights under s. and s. of the Charter. The trial judge excluded the Certificate of Qualified Technician from the appeal. 2)The Court reviewed the meaning of the s. 24(2) Charter remedy and found that the trial judge erred in determining there were not reasonable grounds for the officer to make an approved screening device demand on the accused. There was no basis for disturbing this finding of fact. The Court reviewed R. v. Gunn, 2012 SKCA 80 (CanLII), albeit in the context of a demand pursuant to s24(2)."

HELD: The sentence was varied by reducing the term of probation to 1 year and by deleting the provisions concerning possession and consumption of alcohol, entry into premises where alcohol is sold and consumed, and submission to breath or blood testing. A period of probation was appropriate but 3 years was out of proportion to the nature of the offence. The inclusion of a term prohibiting him from consuming alcohol was inappropriate since it had no relation to the purpose of the original recognizance.","The appellant was convicted of breach of a recognizance made under the authority of s. 810.1 of the Criminal Code, the purpose of which is to prevent further sexual offences against persons under the age of 14 years.

c_1998canlii14058.txt,"FIAT. An application pursuant to Rule 188 for a determination of whether the defendant was liable pursuant to s86(1) of the Highway Traffic Act for the personal injuries of the infant plaintiff or was immune from liability by virtue of s228 [now s232] of the Education Act. The second point of law to be determined was whether the co-defendant as car owner was liable if the driver was found to be immune from liability. The motor vehicle accident occurred while the infant plaintiff was being transported during a field trip, approved by the defendant school board, and the defendant was the teacher. HELD: 1)The teacher/driver was acting within the scope of her duties and was immune from liability by virtue of the Education Act. 2)The owner was only liable to the same extent as the driver. The reasoning in Neault was directly on point. Just as the Workers' Compensation Act and the Highway Traffic Act prevent the injured worker from suing the owner of the vehicle because he is prevented from suing the driver, the Education Act extends the same immunity to the owner as it does to the driver by operation of s86(1) of the Highway Traffic Act. 3)There was no apparent conflict between the statutes. When read together, the legislation provides that a negligent teacher is granted immunity from liability if the teacher has acted within the scope of the Education Act. The Traffic Act is the general statute, governing liability of all drivers. The Court did not agree with the School Board's analysis that the Education Act was the general statute. 4)The injured plaintiff was not denied a party to sue for negligent operation of a vehicle as he had recourse against the school board and its insurer. The immunity under the Education Act only applies to teachers and principals.","FIAT. An application pursuant to Rule 188 of The Queen's Bench Rules of Court for a determination of whether the defendant is liable for the personal injuriessustained by the infant plaintiff or whether the co-defendant is immune from liability by s. 228 of The Highway Traffic Act. HELD: 1)The Education Act is the general statute governing liability of all drivers of motor vehicles. The Education Act specifically provides an immunity to a teacher when acting within the scope of s.228 of the Education Act. The immunity only applies to teachers and principals. 2)In the event the teacher is not liable, the school board is only liable to the same extent as the driver. That is, Edith Larsen's immunity extends to the owner of the motor vehicle."
5_2004skqb417.txt,"Each party has applied for a variation of the judgment granted by Gunn J. in April 1999. The judgment incorporates the terms of an Interspousal Contract dated April 1999 that provides for basic child support to be paid by the petitioner in the amount of $1,411 per month. The calculation of child support in the Interspousal Contract was based on the petitioner earning $110,000. The petitioner seeks to have child support reduced for Kimberly and discontinued for Ashley. The petitioner has unilaterally terminated support for Ashley on the basis that she is over 18 years of age and not in full time attendance at school. The respondent seeks an upward variation of ongoing child support for Kimberly on the basis that the petitioner's income is significantly higher than $110,000. She also seeks a retroactive variation of support paid for both girls. HELD: 1) The parties agree that much of the petitioner's income since the separation has included significant amounts of non-recurring income in the form of capital gains, stock options and severance pay. In accordance with s. 16 of the Guidelines, a payor's income for child support purposes is determined based on total income, adjusted in accordance with Schedule III, as shown on his or her income tax return. The petitioner has provided no compelling reason to exclude any of his non-recurring income. To the contrary, it is the fairest way of proceeding. The petitioner's income since separation discloses that non-recurring income can realistically be anticipated in the future, as it has constituted a significant portion of his income in four of the last five years. The fairest way of determining the appropriate level of child support is by calculating it based on his income during the previous year. 2) The petitioner's line 150 income on his 2003 income tax return was $199,922. This includes $114,454 of non-recurring capital gain income from the sale of shares in Poplar Hill Resources. It does not include the non-taxable portion of that capital gain in the same amount. Pursuant to Clause 6 of Schedule III referred to in s. 16 of the Guidelines, this non-taxable amount is to be included as an adjustment to income. This results in the petitioner's 2003 income for child support purposes being $314,376. However, in examining documents provided by the petitioner regarding his previous year's income, it is apparent that he incurred net capital losses in 2002 of $65,424. The Court imputed $150,000 of income to the petitioner for the year 2002 despite this net capital loss and his line 150 income being only $2,410. It is therefore reasonable that this capital loss be deducted from the non-taxable portion of the capital gain he realized in 2003. This results in only $49,030 of the non-taxable portion of the 2003 capital gain being added to income for total income of $248,952. Based on the Guidelines, child support of $1,928 would be payable for Kimberly.  3) During the same year that the petitioner was enjoying income in excess of $248,000, the respondent's income for herself and the two children was only $24,345. It is self-evident that the petitioner has a substantially greater ability to provide financial support for Kimberly than does the respondent. In the circumstances it is appropriate that one-half of the Guideline amount for the petitioner's income in excess of $150,000 be payable as child support. Effective January 1, 2004, the petitioner shall pay monthly child support for Kimberly of $1,557.  4) Ashley did not complete grade 12 until June 2003. In the normal course, she would have graduated in June 2002, but she was short some classes. The required classes were not available in September 2002 so she did not return to school until the new semester in January 2003. Although Ashley was not in full time attendance in school during the last six months of 2002, she had not yet completed her basic education and had every intention of doing so. She was not in a position to withdraw from her parent's support. Considering the disparity in the ability of each of her parent to contribute to her support, it is appropriate that support for Ashley be the amount determined by applying the Guidelines as if she were a child under the age of majority.  5) A written request by the respondent for the petitioner to provide copies of his income tax returns is not required because the parties incorporated a positive obligation to exchange tax returns in their Interspousal Contract. Consistent with the objectives of the Guidelines and implicit in the Interspousal Contract the parties must have understood that the petitioner's child support obligation could change if his income changed. 6) This is clearly a case where a retroactive variation is warranted. No variation can be considered for 1999, the year of the Interspousal Contract and the judgment. Given the various sources of the petitioner's income and the significant annual fluctuations in his income, it is appropriate to use his previous year's income as the basis for calculation of his child support payable in the subsequent year. The Court went on to calculate the petitioner's income and the child support payable for each year. 7) In 2002 the petitioner's line 150 income was only $2,410. Given the pattern of the petitioner's income in the three preceding years, along with the fact that he disposed of capital assets in 2003 that generated undisclosed cash flow, and, some 2 years later, he nevertheless retains significant net assets, the Court imputed additional income to the petitioner of $150,000 for child support purposes. 8) The respondent was awarded costs set at $2,600.","The parties separated in 1997 and shortly thereafter the parties moved to Alberta. The 1999 judgment incorporates the terms of an Interspousal Contract which provides for basic child support to be paid by the respondent in the amount of $1,411 per month. The respondent commenced negotiations in November 2002 for retroactive upward variation of child support. Negotiations proceeded slowly and the respondent ultimately countered with an application for variation to this court in March 2004. She also sought a retroactive variation of support paid for both girls. Variation of On-going Support for Kimberly [1] This matter is largely because the parties cannot agree on the method of calculating the respondent's income for child support purposes. The parties agree that much of his income since separation has included significant amounts of non-recurring income in the form of capital gains, stock options and severance pay. However, given the unpredictable, variable and to some degree speculative aspect of much of Mr. Marzolf's post-separation income (including his 2003 income) it would be imprudent, even if the parties were together, to enhance Kimberley's standard of living on the basis of a percentage of her father's 2003 income."
d_1998canlii4665.txt,"The primary issue in this appeal was the standard of review to be applied on appeals from a Hearing Officer to the Workers' Compensation Appeals Tribunal. The appellant had his appeal denied on the grounds that the decision of the Hearing Officer was not patently unreasonable. Allowing the appeal and remitting the matter for re-hearing, that an appeal from a Hearing Officer to the Tribunal is a statutory appeal. It is not a judicial review, and the standard of review is therefore one of correctness not whether or not the Hearing Officer's decision was patently unreasonable. The deference that the Tribunal must show is only with respect to the advantages the Hearing Officer may have in the fact finding process of a particular case.","This was an appeal for which leave was granted from a decision of the Worker's Compensation Appeals Tribunal (the Board) dated October 25, 1996. It was limited to a question as to jurisdiction as to the jurisdiction of the Tribunal. The appeal was allowed and the matter was remitted to the Tribunal as per oral reasons for judgment of Chipman, J.A.; Roscoe and Cromwell, JJ.A., concurring.

3_1996canlii6732.txt,"The plaintiff sued his father's estate for breach of a farm lease and for the value of his farm labour. The estate counterclaimed for a mortgage debt incurred by the father on behalf of the plaintiff. The plaintiff was not included in his father's Will as a beneficiary and the Will contained no reference to the mortgage debt. The father's statement of assets filed in his divorce and matrimonial property action did not disclose it as an asset. HELD: 1)The unsigned handwritten memorandum evidenced a binding agreement for lease between the plaintiff and his father. He affirmed the lease in his discussions with a daughter. 2)The plaintiff neither repudiated the lease nor failed to complete his obligations under it.  The fact that he did not vigorously contest the right of his brother to farm the land on behalf of the estate did not estop him from suing for damages for his father's breach of the lease.  Damages of $6,500 were awarded. 3)The plaintiff failed to establish a quantum meruit claim. He did not produce any documents to show he had been reimbursed for his labour on the farm in prior years. Other family members helped with the farming from time to time. He did nothing while his father was alive to demand or obtain payment. 4)Even if the mortgage was considered a debt in 1989 it was subsequently forgiven. It was significant that the plaintiff was not included as a beneficiary and the amount of the mortgage was similar to the bequests to the other children. 5)The plaintiff was awarded his costs against the estate on a party and party basis for that portion of his claim on which he was successful and for defending the counterclaim. Solicitor and client costs against the estate were not appropriate as the issues raised by the claim and counterclaim were not typical estate issues. Judgment issued against the two executors in their representative capacity.","The plaintiff sues his father's estate for damages forbreach of a farm lease and for the value of his farm labour. The estate counterclaims for a mortgage debt incurred by the plaintiff on behalf of the deceased. HELD: 1)The plaintiff was only entitled to the net return he would have realized had he farmed the land in accordance with the lease in 1994. The quantum of his claim was accordingly dismissed.  2)The father's initial mortgage of his land to the Bank of Montreal was not to secure a loan to the plaintiff. Nor did the father redeem the bank mortgage to salvage his land nor remortgage it to raise the funds required to discharge a bank mortgage from his land. There was conflicting evidence as to most of the components making up the damage claim for what could reasonably have been realized in 1994 from Canola crop grown on the land, including yield, quality, sale price and the costs of putting the crop in and taking it off. However once he learned that he, unlike most of his brothers and sisters, were not included in his estate, he felt entitled to some compensation for his labour. His labour claim was quantum meruit. The fact that the father did not vigorouslycontest the right of his brother to farm the land on his behalf does not estop him from suing the estate fordamages for his breach of the lease. The issues raised by the claim and counterclaim are not typical 'estate' issues. Solicitor and client costs against the estate are accordingly not appropriate."

2_2006nsfc7.txt,"Although the mother initially had sole custody of the parties' two children, they were placed in the joint custody of both parents, with primary care and control with the father, when the mother was hospitalized due to mental health disturbances. When the children were not later returned to her care, the mother brought an application to vary the primary care arrangements, alleging that the children were not receiving suitable and appropriate parenting while in the father's care. The father, who lived close to the maternal grandparents and relied upon them extensively for the care of the children, questioned the mother's emotional and mental health and stability. The transfer of primary care of the children to the mother is conditional upon the fulfillment of several provisions and prohibitions, including the mother's disclosure to her mental health caregivers of any alcohol consumption and the recent harassing phone calls made by her; should the parents be unable or unwilling to cooperate with the court directives, the court will consider filing a report of neglect under the Children and Family Services Act; primary care and access will be reviewed by the court in six months time. The children were at considerable risk if placed in the primary care of either parent; the evidence showed that the father was unable to meet the children's needs on a daily basis; in addition to his questionable parenting judgment, his regular daily drug use in circumstances where the family lived in poverty and one child had an asthmatic medical condition showed that he placed a higher priority on his relationship with marijuana than his primary responsibility as protector of his children. Although the mother's parenting plan was well-conceived, the court questioned whether she could withstand the daily pressure of raising the children and noted her past habit of consuming alcohol while taking medication.","HELD: The Court found that the children were at risk if placed in the primary care and control of their father. The father was not presently providing the physical amenities of life for the children. His type of parenting fell very short of the expectations of the court. The mother had made numerous mistakes in her past as a parent and the father was unable to provide adequate support to the children, particularly in the face of ongoing problems with their mental health. The Court was of the opinion that the father had made a mistake in his drug use and that he was contributing to the deterioration of the children's short and long term care."

b_2002nsca30.txt,"A fifteen year old died in a motor vehicle accident. The estate brought a claim for loss of future income and lost earning capacity. The Chambers judge found that such a claim was not available and the estate appealed. Appeal dismissed; the context of the legislation, its purpose and text all support the conclusion that the deceased's loss of prospective earnings is not an actual pecuniary loss to the estate.","Where a person is killed due to the fault of another, the estate may sue the wrongdoer for certain damages which have resulted in an actual pecuniary loss to the estate. The main question to be decided in this case is whether the earnings which the deceased would have received had he not been killed are 'an actual peculiary loss' and are, therefore, recoverable by the estate in an action against the defendant. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. The court found that the Legislature had denied such a claim and provided the deceased's dependants with a statutory cause of action for the lost financial support and other losses resulting from the wrongful death. The deceased's estate was entitled to claim damages for the loss of his future earning capacity and were recoverable in the survival action. The appellants appealed. The Court held that the legislature had denied the appellants the right to sue for loss of expectation of life and that the only significant claim under the survival of actions legislation was under the Fatal Injuries Act, which excluded causes of action which would have entitled the injured party to sue had he been killed."

He successfully applied to have the wife's divorce petition set aside on the grounds that she had not been ordinarily resident in Nova Scotia for at least one year immediately prior to the commencement of the proceeding. The wife applied for a stay of execution pending her appeal of this decision. She argued irreparable harm to herself and the parties' child on the basis that if the stay was refused, she would be required to travel to take part in the Texas proceeding, leaving her law practice for an extended time and uprooting the child who was settled in school here. She also feared that she would be found in contempt for failing to obey the Texas custody orders and be imprisoned. Application for stay pending appeal dismissed; the irreparable harm claimed by the appellant was entirely speculative at this point as if the Texas court did grant custody to the father, under the Child Abduction Act, a Nova Scotia court would have jurisdiction to determine the child's habitual residence and whether the appellant was wrongfully detaining him here. Given that the Texas court would be free to continue its proceeding even if a stay was granted, until such time as the conflict of laws issue was resolved, it would be risky for the appellant not to participate in the process there. Furthermore, the order under appeal was not one that lent itself to being stayed under Rule 62.20.","The appellant appeals from and applies for a stay of execution of an order setting aside her petition for divorce. On an application by the respondent to set aside the divorce petition on the basis that Nova Scotia lacked jurisdiction, Justice Wilson determined that the appellant had not been ordinarily resident in Nova Scotia for at least one year prior to filing the petition, as required by s.3 of the Divorce Act. The order sets out the history of the relationship between the parties and made several findings of fact respecting the residence of the appellant during the marriage and for the year prior. Included in the interim orders were interim orders giving access, child support and spousal support. As well an order releasing the respondent's interest in the Nova Scotia matrimonial property, subject to accounting at a later date. HELD: The application for stay is dismissed. 1) While there is no comprehensive definition of what may constitute 'exceptional circumstances' which may justify a stay even if the applicant cannot meet the primary test, those exceptional circumstances must show that it is unjust to permit the immediate enforcement of such an order obtained after trial. This is not a case where issuing a stay would prevent an injustice. 2) With respect to the secondary test, it is submitted that there are exceptional circumstances making it just and fit that the stay be granted. The appellant says the jurisdictional uncertainties and the child's best interests present exceptional circumstances."

After calling the plaintiff several times to determine the market price for flax, the defendant agreed to sell the plaintiff 300 metric tonnes of flax of which 297.957 tonnes remain undelivered. HELD: 1) The defendant did not deliver the balance of the flax before August, 2001 or at anytime and he is in breach of the contract. 2) The verbal contract was in force from the time of the telephone conversation ended in June 2001. As the price rose, the plaintiff would have profited by $36.50 per tonne. That is the loss of profit that the plaintiff's claim is based on multiplied by 297.957 and totals $10,875.43. 3) The part performance involving the sale under the contract of 2.043 tonnes is sufficient to meet the requirements of The Sale of Goods Act.","The plaintiff farmer was in the business of buying and selling grain.

HELD: The plaintiff was awarded judgment for the sum of $10,875.43, together with pre-judgment interest from August 1, 2001, and costs of this action which was tried in summary way under Part 40 of the Rules of Court.  1)The Sale of Goods Act requires some writing to support a contract such as this, however, the part performance involving the sale under the contract of 2.043 tonnes is sufficient to meet the requirements of the Act. The document was created to record the sale but as it was never completed by the defendant who denies even receiving it, it has no effect on the contract. 2)A verbal contract was in force from the time the telephone conversation ended on June 25, 2001.

3_1996canlii6774.txt,"Two doctors filed in bankruptcy in 1995 and in each case the major unsecured creditor was Revenue Canada. Neither met the 50% threshold of ss.173(1)(a) of the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act and each likely committed one or more acts of bankruptcy under ss.(b) to (m). However there was no suggestion of dishonesty. The combined medical earnings in the four years prior to the bankruptcy averaged $18,000 per month and the after-tax family income averaged $10,200 per month. HELD: A consent judgment under ss.172(2)(c) was ordered such that if each doctor consented to the payment of $45,000 to be paid at a rate of $1,250.00 per month for 36 months without interest there would be an absolute discharge. 1)The payments proposed by Revenue Canada of $3,349.00 per month were unreasonably high in all the circumstances. 2)Their contributions to the community did not relieve either doctor from making reasonable payments to the trustee as a condition of their discharge from the bankruptcy.","The two doctors were both physicians and had been practicing medicine together in Wolseley since 1973. They had seven children, five of whom were 18 years of age or older and were studying for undergraduate or post-graduate university degrees. The trustee determined that as a condition of discharge, the doctors should make monthly payments of $1,250 per month for a total of 36 months. HELD: 1)The consent judgment option under ss.172(2)(c) of the Act was most appropriate, both for the doctors and the community they serve.  2)The doctors were 51 and 49 years old respectively. They were married for 12 years and had 7 children. Their combined medical earnings averaged about $18,000 per month and the expected after-tax family income averaged $10,200 per month. There was no reason why this income level could not be maintained. Based on Revenue Canada's Superintendents Guideline of Payments (which I take into account along with all other factors), this monthly family income after tax and reasonable living expenses should leave $3,349 for the benefit of creditors. 3)The trustee should apply the said payments firstly in payment of its reasonable fees and distribute the balance from time to time to the sole unsecured creditor, Revenue Canada."

The plaintiff felt greater entitlement to costs generally and double costs after trial. Both parties made a formal offer to settle on May 25, 2007 in the amount of $60,800 ($60,000 plus HST). This offer was not accepted by the plaintiff and she recovered $64,147.85 after trial; the defendant sought $10,045 in trial costs, $850 in disbursements and prejudgment interest of $5,643.24 for total of $26,630.81. HELD: 1) There was no clear winner in this case. In fact this is one of those cases where success and failure are shared almost equally. The in-floor radiant heating system was successful on deficiencies, aspects of the septic system, exterior wall insulation and various other smaller items. Additionally, the plaintiff was fully successful on the counterclaim. 2) There were problems associated with the construction of this home where the parties contributed materially. This was clearly the case with deficiencies. Force Construction Limited were often sloppy in their construction. Ms. Campbell refused to recognize proper deficiencies that should have been resolved pursuant to the building contract. There was also an element of this joint contribution in relation to septic."
2_2007nssc40.txt,"Following the collapse of the roofs of two buildings in Newfoundland, both of which were constructed with open web steel joists fabricated by the same company, the Nova Scotia government wrote to owners of buildings containing these joists, including the plaintiff mall owner, recommending that the joists be inspected by a qualified professional engineer. An inspection of the mall roof revealed that 10.5 per cent of the joists inspected had at least one panel point with a broken or missing weld and the same remediation scheme as that implemented by the Province for the government's own buildings was recommended. The plaintiff, concerned with safety issues arising from the report, followed the consultant's recommendations and undertook remediation of the mall and then claimed against the defendant, which was the parent company of the corporate entity which had fabricated the joists. The defendant's expert took the position that although the actual repairs to the welding and webs of the open steel joists was necessary, the reinforcing of the joists undertaken in the remediation was not required in order to mitigate the danger. Judgment for the plaintiff; there were defects in the open web steel joists at the mall which constituted a real and substantial danger to the occupants; this danger was caused by the defendant's negligence and the remediation program carried out at the mall was necessary to alleviate the real and substantial danger. There were internal problems with the welds which could not be discovered by non-destructive inspection and the lack of proper welding procedures and quality control issues at the company prevented one from having confidence in any welds fabricated by them, at least based on external observations.",HELD: The Court found that the defects in the open web steel joists manufactured by the defendant were real and substantial danger to the occupants of the Mayflower Mall. The repairs and remediation undertaken by Burnac were not sufficient to alleviate the danger.

This was an interlocutory, discretionary decision and the chambers judge did not apply a wrong principle of law or make a clearly erroneous finding of fact, nor has there been a patent injustice.

HELD: The applications were dismissed with each defendant to recover separate costs on the appropriate tariff. Although the defendants' pleading may delay but not defeat or prevent the plaintiff from proceeding with its foreclosure action, the defences were so closely connected with the plaintiff's demands that it would be manifestly unjust for the plaintiff to proceed without taking the defendant's defences into consideration.","FIAT. In early 2008, a major Saskatchewan hog producer came under creditor protection pursuant to the Companies Creditors' Arrangement Act. There may have been other sources of acquisition funding. FCC and National financing is secured by mortgages against the titles to the pig barns. Within a year both corporations were in default in their loan payments and the lenders took action. The applicant, Titan, each acquired several pig-barns formerly owned by Stomp Pork Farm Ltd. at various locations in Saskatchewan. These acquisitions were financed for the respective purchasers by Farm Credit Canada (FCC), as primary lender, and National Bank of Canada (National) as a third mortgagee. In issue was whether the defendant was entitled to plead equitable set-off. The court referred to Rule 104A(1)(c) relating to set-offs and dismissed the application on the basis that the defendant's cross-claim was so closely connected with the plaintiff's demand that it would be manifestly unjust for the plaintiff to proceed without taking into account National's defences. HELD: The application was dismissed. 1) The pleadings should only be struck pursuant to Rule 173 in cases where it is obvious that the claim or defence is devoid of all merit or cannot possibly succeed. Such jurisdiction should be exercised sparingly and only in very exceptional cases and where the court is satisfied the claim is devoid all merit. It follows that where an abuse of process has taken place, the intervention of the court by the stay or even dismissal of proceedings, although it should not be lightly done, may often be required by the very essence of justice to be done. 2) National has raised reasonable defences including: breach by FCC of collateral contracts which are clearly connected to the mortgages, together with equitable estoppel which precludes enforcement in circumstances such as the present; National has the right to defend the actions because of its interest in the equity of redemption; there is no basis to imply improper motives. 3) In the meantime FCC as first mortgagee has had to cover substantial ongoing expenses to maintain and attempt to preserve the value of the vacant barns"

The College's application was dismissed and the question of costs was left to the panel of the Court hearing the College's appeal. The Psychologists Act does not state that there is no appeal from a Queen’s Bench decision but rather that s. 7(3) provides that the legislature can take away the right of appeal conferred in s.7(2) in an enactment, but that does not limit the right by the member to appeal from this Court to this one.

2006skqb536.txt,"The primary issue is whether the plaintiff, the owner of certain farm equipment consigned for sale at unreserved auction, has indirectly allowed another individual to bid on its behalf, or for its own benefit. The plaintiff corporation agreed to sell its entire inventory of farm equipment at unreserved auction for a guaranteed return of $577,500. The guarantee was given by the defendant corporate auctioneers (Ritchie). The auction was to be conducted by the defendant corporate auctioneers (LeBlanc), a newly formed division of Ritchie. After the auction sale was concluded, the defendant refused to pay the plaintiff the guaranteed price. The defendant declared the guarantee unenforceable under provisions of the 'Contract to Auction' and ultimately charged the plaintiff a commission of 14% on the gross proceeds. The defendant alleges that the plaintiff indirectly allowed another individual to bid on its behalf or for its own benefit. HELD: 1) Clause 3.07 of the Contract to Auction prohibits an owner from bidding directly or indirectly, and from allowing any other person to bid on his behalf. The issue here is whether the plaintiff allowed a family member to bid for the plaintiff's benefit. A family member can be a bona fide purchaser as well as anyone else, but the nature of an unreserved auction dictate that such relationships be disclosed to the public. The essence of the problem and the underlying purpose behind clause 3.07 is to protect bona fide bidders, and to ensure that there be no surreptitious bidding by another for the owner's benefit. 2) The plaintiff allowed Mr. Caruk to bid at the sale for the plaintiff's benefit. It went beyond the passive act of allowing him to bid. It actively facilitated bidding. Mr. Caruk acknowledged he had no money to buy equipment. The plaintiff lent him up to $100,000 for that express purpose. It is immaterial that the loan came from Mr. Tkachuk personally rather than from the plaintiff company he controls and directs. The plaintiff corporation benefited. It has leased all its cattle to Mr. Caruk and the equipment will be of significant value to the fulfillment of that contract. 'For the benefit of the owner' does not have to mean for the exclusive benefit of the owner. 3) The undisclosed arrangement between Mr. Tkatchuk and Mr. Caruk gave the nephew a significant advantage at auction. That advantage was magnified by the fact that he possessed insider information. He knew his uncle had a guaranteed price from Ritchie's for the equipment, because that information had been imparted to him by his uncle. All one needs to add is that Mr. Tkachuk would have profited very significantly had his arrangement with the nephew gone undiscovered. He would have secured a guaranteed price, while procuring the commercial advantages of having his cattle lease fulfilled using equipment the nephew could not otherwise have afforded to purchase. 4) In an area such as this where bona fides are of fundamental importance, and particularly where an owner has the advantage of a guaranteed price from the auctioneer, a deliberate non-disclosure of material information can have an impact every bit as significant as a deliberate and obvious misrepresentation. The plaintiff should have disclosed the arrangement with Mr. Caruk to the defendants. In not doing so, and in allowing and enabling Mr. Caruk to bid at the auction, the plaintiff breached clause 3.07.  5) The provision for a 14% commission on the gross proceeds of sale as a consequence of breach of a fundamental term of the contract is not extravagant or unconscionable and, as the defendants pointed out, they did not elect to exercise their conjunctive right in clause 4.05 to additional amounts as liquidated damages. The concluding paragraph would have entitled them, in addition to all other rights and remedies, to re-sell the property acquired by Mr. Caruk and to retain an amount equal to 20% of the proceeds realized. The provision for a 14% commission on the gross proceeds of sale does not constitute a penalty. 6) The defendants' claim solicitor and client costs pursuant to clause 4.03 of the contract. The defendants are prima facie entitled to costs on a solicitor and client basis, but in the circumstances there are issues whether they should be restricted to one set of costs, and other issues relating to appropriate quantum. The issue of costs will be assessed by this Court pursuant to Rule 565, with the defendants serving and filing a draft bill in the form required for a solicitor and client bill, an affidavit of disbursements, and written argument. The plaintiff shall have 14 days to reply. 7) The plaintiff will have a judgment against the defendants in the amount of $1,316.64 representing the power washing bill wrongfully deducted from the auction sale proceeds payable to the plaintiff. In all other respects, the plaintiff's action is dismissed with costs.","The plaintiff agreed to sell its entire inventory of farm equipment at an unreserved auction for a guaranteed return of $577,500. The auction was to be conducted by LeBlanc Auction Services. The plaintiff had purchased the equipment from Ritchie Bros. for a commission of 14% on the gross proceeds of sale. After the auction sale was concluded, the defendants refused to pay the plaintiff the guaranteed price. HELD: 1) While a number of issues require exploration in the present case, the preeminent question is whether the plaintiff, the owner of certain farm equipment consigned for sale at unreserved auctions, has indirectly allowed another individual to bid on its behalf, or for its own benefit. 2) There are indications that the plaintiff did not feel inescapably bound to contract with the defendants at that point in time. The defendants advertised the auction as a farm dispersal auction, and the plaintiff's impending retirement was considered sufficiently noteworthy to merit special mention in the sale fliers under the heading 'Auctioneer's Note'. What constitutes bid indirectly on an owner's behalf or for his benefit is a far more elusive question. 3) The defendants were keen to hold an auction in the Melfort area and engage the competition head to head. They wanted to establish themselves as a presence in a regional market previously dominated by Hodgins Auctioneers Inc. (the plaintiff's former employer). 4) The plaintiff consigned his farm equipment for sale to the highest bidder at the auction. It was not known to the defendants that it was being offered by the plaintiff. 5) There was little in the way of communication between the plaintiff and the defendants after December 23, 2003 when the plaintiff first approached to become a potential customer. 6) There were also some issues of breach of contract, as the plaintiff had not been paid in full. The defendant's justification for proceeding in that fashion was that it had included the full sale price of the equipment when it calculated the gross sale, less 14% commission under clause 4.05. 7) In the meantime, the plaintiff was attempting to establish itself as a regional presence in the region. The court reviewed the contractual negotiations between the defendant and plaintiff and concluded that they were in breach of the contract. 8) The court was not satisfied with the defendant’s explanation of why the plaintiff bid on the equipment and the court was unable to determine whether it was offered directly or indirectly by the defendant."
7_1997canlii11172.txt,"An application pursuant to s232(4)(c) of the Income Tax Act for a determination of whether the applicants have solicitor-client privilege in respect of 25 documents for which Revenue Canada had sought disclosure. The applicants were husband and wife, their two sons and the companies in which they were principal shareholders and/or directors. The documents related to three separate occasions upon which the applicants sought the advice or assistance of a lawyer in relation to proposed transactions. The documents in issue were originally in the possession of their accounting firm. At issue was the extent to which solicitor-client privilege could be asserted in relation to communications with and documents prepared by third parties. HELD: 1)The privilege claimed in relation to all of the documents relating to the legal advice sought after January 1995 was upheld. 2)The claim was not upheld for copies of a letter setting out the proposal for the 1988 transaction. One letter appeared to be advice offered by the accountants to the applicants.  3)The applicants abandoned their claim for privilege with respect to handwritten notes summarizing share value and fair market value of assets which had been prepared by the accountants other than for the purpose of obtaining legal advice. The claim of privilege was abandoned for a declaration of gift and minutes of a director's meeting in 1991. 4)It has been clearly established in case law that even though a client may look to his/her accountant rather than a solicitor for advice in relation to the law of taxation, the applicants must show the documents were protected by solicitor-client privilege and not merely accountant-client privilege. 5)Although solicitor-client privilege is defined in s232(1)(e) of the ITA, the issue had to be resolved in light of the common law test for privilege. 6)Privilege may extend to accountant communications where the accountant is acting as agent or representative of the client for the purpose of seeking legal advice from a solicitor. Recent cases appear to diverge on the question of the circumstances necessary to found the requisite relationship of agency. 7)The accountants were clearly acting as agents for the applicants for the purpose of obtaining legal advice, as was found in Susan Hosiery. They were at all times acting in a confidential capacity on behalf of and on instructions of the applicants. 8)Solicitor-client privilege extended to items of accounting information obtained for the purpose of receiving legal advice. Notes prepared by the accountant and the interoffice communications summarizing discussions with the solicitor also fell within the scope of privilege.","This was an application pursuant to s. 232(4)(c) of the Income Tax Act for the determination of whether the applicants have solicitor-client privilege in respect of 25 documents for which Revenue Canada has sought disclosure. HELD: The application was dismissed. 1)The respondents did not rely for their claim of privilege exclusively upon the confidentiality of the professional relationship between the accountant and client. They were prepared to disclose those documents in the possession of the accounting firm, including those that were created in the context of the accountant's professional responsibility to the client. This role was not inconsistent with the client's personal presence or involvement in these communications. Whether or not he is personally present, the client relies upon the accountant to accurately convey certain information within his expertise about the clients' affairs to the solicitor and to receive and implement the solicitor's advice on behalf of the client, even absent the anticipated litigation. 2)The solicitor and client privilege extended to communications to or from third parties to the extent that the third party could be seen to be acting as a client's agent or representative for the purpose of seeking legal advice from the solicitor. The central issue in this application is whether and to what extent solicitor- client privilege applies to documents prepared by third parties in this case, the clients.  3)The accountant was one of the representatives of the appellant for obtaining legal advice that the appellant was privileged from production, or giving evidence as to the contents of a letter written by the accountant as part of the process of obtaining such advice. The solicitor was entitled to privilege against producing a memorandum of what occurred at that meeting. The same privilege extends to answering any questions as to what was or is contained in that memorandum."
4_2016skqb160.txt,"Criminal Law – Assault with a WeaponCriminal Law – Defences – Self-defence The accused was charged with assault by threatening to use a weapon, a butcher knife, contrary to s. 267(a) of the Criminal Code. The accused was panhandling outside a store when he and one of two security officers had a verbal confrontation. The accused walked towards the security officer with a butcher knife. The security officer ran to his vehicle and the accused followed him and slashed a tire on the security officer’s vehicle. The attending officer was directed to a yard where he located the accused. A knife was also located in the yard. A videotape from the store was entered as an exhibit and played for the court. The accused was considerably smaller than either of the security officers. The accused testified that he was homeless and had a lot to drink the day of the incident. He indicated that he “blacked out” and was in front of two security officers when he came to. He said that he offered them a cigarette for being in their personal space and one of the men told him that he would punch him out. The accused indicated that he got the knife out of the bag just to show the men that he was bigger than them. He said that he did not intend to stab them. At one point the accused admitted following the security officer to his vehicle and at another point said he did not. The accused said he then tried to get away from the area but was prevented from doing so by a large black vehicle. The accused said he eventually stabbed the vehicle’s tire because it was blocking his way and he went into panic mode. The accused raised the issue of self-defence. HELD: There was no question that the Crown established the offence beyond a reasonable doubt. The court found that the accused initiated the confrontation by walking up to the security officer and getting very close to him. The court found that the Crown witness’s evidence was preferred over the accused’s where it differed, namely the slashing of the vehicle tires. The court accepted the accused’s submission that the security officer told the accused to get out of his face or he would knock him out or something to that effect. The court considered the factors set out in s. 34(2) and concluded that the force or threat faced by the accused due to the size of the security officers and the words used by one of them did not warrant the action taken by the accused. The court offered numerous reasons for the conclusion: the accused initiated the confrontation; the security guard did not touch or further go after the accused; no physical force was used against the accused; and there was no history between the accused and security officer. The accused’s actions were out of proportion to any reasonable response to any threat. The court held that the Crown established, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the facts and circumstances of the case did not give rise to the defence of self-defence. The accused was found guilty as charged.","The accused was charged with assault with a weapon contrary to s. 267(a) of the Criminal Code. The accused had been panhandling with his companion when he was approached by the accused, who was intoxicated and had a knife in his hand. During the confrontation, the accused threw the knife at the complainant and the complainant. The complainant confronted the accused in the parking lot and chased him to his vehicle, where he slashed the complainant's tire on the complainant’s car and then ran away, leaving the complainant to fend for himself in the back alley. When the complainant ran, the complainant grabbed the knife and threw it at him, striking the complainant in the face and causing him to fall backwards into the alleyway. The victim was injured in the confrontation and the accused was arrested. The Crown called five witnesses who gave evidence at trial, including a security officer who testified that the accused threatened to apply force to him and that the complainant believed the accused had the present ability to use a weapon. HELD: The accused was found guilty of assault and the Crown had established that self-defence was not applicable in all of the circumstances established by the evidence given in this case.  1)The accused admitted to the fact that he walked up to the complainant, in close quarters, as the complainant did not touch him. 2)The complainant testified that he was frightened when the accused said something to him that caused him to become upset, go to his dufflebag, retrieve the knife in it (it was 15 inches long and the blade 10 inches), and pursue him as he left, could only lead to the reasonable conclusion that the defendant considered the matter over and he had no intention to use any force against him, nor was its use imminent within the meaning of s. 34(2)(b). 3)The Crown called the accused to give his evidence. The evidence of these witnesses, which will now review, provided the facts and circumstances applicable to reach the appropriate legal result."

He was fined $1200, with a surcharge of $120 and placed on probation for 12 months.An altercation took place after his spouse's former husband had threatened his spouse and her children. He was dismissed from his employment as a truck driver immediately after his conviction because he could not gain entry into the United States, because he now had a criminal record. HELD: Conviction set aside; absolute discharge granted.","The appellant appeals the sentence imposed by the trial judge after a trial where he was found guilty of assault contrary to s.267(1)(b) of the Code. He was fined $1200, with a surcharge of $120 and placed on probation for 12 months. The sole issue on the sentence appeal is whether the judge erred in not ordering an unconditional discharge in the circumstances of this essentially domestic altercation. The appellant is 38 years old and was employed as a long distance trucker by Westcan Bulk Transport. He had no criminal record. His employer advised him that because of the nature of their business and the uncertainty surrounding the appellant's ability to enter the United States as a driver of one of their trucks, they had no choice but to terminate his employment. He appealed the finding of guilt and made a request to substitute discharge for the conviction and although such orders should be made sparingly, they should not be reserved exclusively for trivial or unintentional offences. HELD: The appeal was allowed. 1)Where an accused, other than a corporation, pleads guilty to or is convicted of an offence other than an offence for which minimum punishment is prescribed by law or an offence punishable by life imprisonment, the court may, if it considers it to be in the best interests of the accused and not contrary to the public interest, instead of convicting the accused, by order direct that the accused be discharged absolutely or on the conditions prescribed in a probation order. Thus the issue here is whether it is in the interests of both parties and not against the Public Interest to order an absolute discharge. It is clear the appellant may appeal the finding in guilt and make the request for substitute discharge, but there is no evidence to support this. 2)The appellant is not a person requiring personal deterrence and rehabilitation through the use of correctional facilities or treatment centres is not factor. He is person of good character who made an error in judgment. The offence is not one that requires an element of general deterrence to deter others."
1998canlii13596.txt,"Administrative Law - Judicial Review - Bias/Institutional BiasAdministrative Law - Medical Care Insurance - Medical Fees - Repayment - AppealProfessions and Occupations - Physicians and Surgeons - Cardiologist - Medical Fees_____ A cardiologist appealed an order made against him by the Joint Medical Professional Review Committee for repayment of  $207,821.03 in medical fees he received over a fifteen month period from the Medical Care Insurance Branch (MCIB). Alleged errors of law included improperly placing the burden of proof on the doctor; failing to take into account all relevant factors including the doctor's statistical analysis; considering it beyond his mandate to provide cost effective services in keeping patients out of the hospital; by using and relying on the knowledge of the Committee in preference to the expert evidence; the orders made concerning various medical services were not reasonably supported by the evidence. The numerous grounds of appeal also included breach of the rules of natural justice by reason of a lack of institutional independence. The application under Part 52 of the Rules of Court for a judicial review was brought to determine whether there was a reasonable apprehension of bias raised by the statutory roles of the Committee and Director or lack of institutional impartiality of the Committee or its lack of independence from the Director or MCIB. _____ HELD: The judicial review application was dismissed. The appeal was allowed and the repayment orders were set aside except for the orders respecting surcharges. 1)Natural justice issues: A reasonable apprehension of bias or institutional bias were not proven. The Committee provided adequate written reasons for its decision. The chairman refuted the allegations that the Committee heard and relied on evidence outside the presence the appellant about which he was not advised. Neither the Director nor the Committee acted in a prosecutorial fashion. Examples included the adjournment granted when the appellant failed to attend and the concession to his request that no cardiologist be placed on the Committee. 2)Errors of law issues: The statistical evidence could be considered by the Committee as a prima facie case. It was then open for it to call on the doctor to rebut the presumed departure from an acceptable pattern of medical practice. This did not shift the overall burden of proof to the doctor nor did it require him to prove his pattern of medical practice was acceptable to the Committee. The Committee did not err in law in misconstruing its mandate or by ignoring the statistical analysis presented by the appellant whose definition of the mandate was much narrower than envisaged by the legislation. It was not agreed that the Committee is not bound to follow the rules of evidence and the proceedings were of an investigative nature. The phrase 'balance of probabilities' means 'more likely than not'. To hold otherwise would make nonsense of administrative law and would violate the rules of natural justice. The distinction between the pattern of the doctor's billings and the pattern of his medical practice was more a matter of semantics than substance. If economics were the only consideration the review process would be a useless exercise and the statistical comparative evidence would be conclusive of the issue. There was no credible evidence that the members of  the Committee misused their expertise and relied on it rather than determining the issues from the evidence presented. 3)The appellant established that for the most part the decision of the Committee was not reasonably supported by but was contrary to the evidence. The MCIB statistics were flawed as a reliable comparison tool and the appellant's adjusted statistics were more reliable even if based on estimates rather than substantiated data. The appellant's medical practice was unique in three respects. He did not have hospital privileges and  had staff and diagnostic equipment equivalent to a cardiac care unit in the hospital; he ordered more diagnostic tests and did more follow up than other cardiologists and had extended office hours. 4)The decision of the Committee was varied to quash all repayment orders except for $14,239.76. The appellant admitted that many of the surcharges had been billed because of his erroneous interpretation of the tariff.  5)Leave was granted to bring the issue of costs back for determination if necessary.","The cardiologist appealed an order made by the Joint Medical Professional Review Committee that he repay $207,821.03 in medical fees received over a fifteen month period from the Medical Care Insurance Branch. The appeal was brought under s. 49.21(1) of The Saskatchewan Medical Care insurance Act. The cardiologist had been previously the subject of a competency review ordered by the College of Physicians and Surgeons and was found to be competent to conduct cardiology practice. He had attempted to reduce the limits placed on cardiologists by developing a clinic with staff and diagnostic equipment that was equivalent to a cardiac care unit in the hospital. Many of the tests performed by the cardiologist in his clinic were not reflected in the comparative statistics. He challenged the reliability of these statistics as a fair and meaningful indicator of comparative patient costs. HELD: Appeal dismissed. 1) The Committee failed to provide adequate reasons for its decision. The Committee gave lengthy written comments to the appellant. Although the reasons contained in the decision may not have been approved by the Committee, they were not inadequate as alleged and do not constitute breach of natural justice. 2) There was a reasonable apprehension of bias in the Committee's decision-making process. It was necessary to deal with each of the four grounds identified by the case law.  3) The Court was restricted to considering only the record of the proceedings of the Committee."
5_2006nssc353.txt,"The claimant flooring dealer had supplied and installed a large amount of flooring in the defendant's new home. Although the defendant had visited the claimant's store and selected the flooring, the actual purchase was made by the defendant's contractor who did not pay the claimant and had now declared bankruptcy. The adjudicator found that although the three criteria for an unjust enrichment claim had been met, there was no special relationship between the parties and thus, denied the claim. The claimant appealed. Appeal allowed; the absence of a special relationship will not automatically defeat a claim of unjust enrichment; the Small Claims Court has the equitable jurisdiction to determine unjust enrichment claims.","Wacky's commenced proceedings against Maritime, Jollymore and Joseph. The issues were: 1) did Wacky's have a contract with Maritime; 2) were Jollymore or Maritime agents of Joseph; 3) was there a special relationship between the parties, frequently contractual at the outset, which would have made it unjust for the defendant to retain the benefit conferred on him by the plaintiff benefit, but not conferred 'officiously'. Wacky was not paid for flooring materials amounting to value of $18,601.55 that had been ordered from and provided by Jollymore; and 4) was Joseph unjustly enriched by the defendant's. The Adjudicator did find that the Small Claims Court has the equitable jurisdiction to determine unjust enrichment.

8_2005skca120.txt,"The deceased made a Will appointing her only son, the appellant, as executor. In her Will, she left her home to her son, and divided the rest and residue between her two daughters, the respondents. The deceased transferred title to her house to the names of herself and the appellant jointly. She also transferred some bank deposits totalling approximately $57,000 into the joint names of herself and the appellant and designated him as the person entitled to receive payments under a RRIF totalling approximately $29,000. After her death, the appellant took the position that the bank deposits and the proceeds of the RRIF did not pass under the Will but were given to him for the benefit of the deceased's grandchildren and himself. He paid out about $45,000 to the grandchildren and himself, but nothing to his sisters, the residuary beneficiaries under the Will. The sisters brought action against him, claiming the funds were part of the residue of the estate and obtained a judgment to that effect against him. He appeals against that judgment. HELD: Appeal dismissed with costs.  1) Section 75 of The Queen's Bench Act does not apply to this case. 2) The trial judge carefully reviewed the evidence and the law respecting the presumption of advancement and the presumption of resulting trust. The judge did not mention the possibility of and express trust in favour of the grandchildren. She must have considered whether an express trust existed because that was exactly what the appellant's evidence suggested and exactly what the trial judge rejected in her findings of fact. Since the funds in question were not given to the appellant as a gift, and were not given to him in trust for the grandchildren, they must of necessity revert to the estate. In the case of the bank deposits, the funds would revert to the estate on the basis of a resulting trust. In the case of the RRIF, the funds would revert to the estate on a different basis. Since there was no gift to the appellant, and no trust in favour of the grandchildren, the monies must revert to the estate. 3) While the appellant characterized this issue as being one of mixed law and fact, it was essentially one of fact alone, the issue was what the deceased intended when she transferred the bank deposits and designated the payee of the RRIF. The standard of review in respect of such an issue is palpable and overriding error. The judge made no such error.  4) The appellant asked for relief pursuant to s. 57 of The Trustee Act in respect of the money paid by him to the grandchildren. The appellant says he paid the monies to the grandchildren in the honest belief that he was carrying out the wishes of the deceased. The appellant knew from the outset that his sisters disagreed with his position and intended to take proceedings against him. The appellant's actions in distributing the funds without at least getting directions from the Court were imprudent for a trustee. The circumstances do not justify, on any equitable basis, compelling the innocent respondents to bear the loss to them occasioned by the trustee's imprudence","The appellant was awarded costs under Double Column V in the usual way. The issue was whether the trial judge erred in law in finding that the joint bank and investment accounts were subject to resulting trust in favour of the estate. HELD: Appeal dismissed. 1) The trial judge did not mention the possibility of an 'express trust' for the grandchildren and great-grandchildren. The evidence of the intentions of the deceased with respect to the funds in question was conflicting. Every single witness said something different about the intention of Ms. Little. There was also evidence as to gifts inter-vivos of money the deceased intended to make to the granddaughters but did not due to change of mind. The standard of review in respect of such an issue is palpable and overriding error. The judge made no such error. 2) The appellant was allowed to raise and argue issues one and three since they were not raised, argued, or dealt with in the court below. It is trite law that judge can accept part of the evidence of witness and reject another part. This is an issue of fact respecting the credibility of the court and this Court can interfere only in the presence of a palpable error. Section 75 does not speak to them."

HELD: The application to lift the stay was dismissed with costs to follow the result of the appeal. 1)If the order was not upheld on appeal it would be difficult to undo the results of the July meeting. 2)The current directors had the most to lose if their decisions did not reflect the best interests of the company and were not made in a sound and business-like fashion.,"This was an application of the Rosetown and District Community Bond Corporation to lift the stay which was the result of the appeal taken by the two present and long-time majority shareholders of Precision Metal Fabricating Ltd. from an order which was made pursuant to s. 234 of The Business Corporations Act as a result of a finding by the chambers judge that the conduct of the Board of Directors had been high-handed and oppressive entitling the corporation to relief. The relief that was provided may well have the effect of removing control of the said company from the Katzenberger and Katzenberggers who are its present and past majority shareholders.

2_2007nssc235.txt,"The parties, divorced, had children, aged 23, 19, and 14 years, respectively. The wife applied to vary the Corollary Relief Judgment (CRJ) following the termination of spousal support. The termination had occurred pursuant to the terms of the CRJ which provided that support would terminate either twelve months after her graduation from the M.B.A. program in which she was enrolled, six months after she withdrew from the program, or when she found employment. The wife had graduated from the program later than expected and a further six months after her course work was completed. Both parties applied to vary child support. The oldest child had completed his first university degree and was currently attending law school. Pursuant to the father's employment, until the completion of their first degree, the children qualified for a program which reimbursed the father for 75 per cent of the child's educational expenses. The CRJ had provided that the father's responsibility to pay all of the oldest child's educational expenses was conditional upon compliance and eligibility for the education reimbursement policies. The middle child was attending university and lived in the wife's home over the summer months. Spousal support application denied; given the family history of an emphasis on education and the oldest child's career plans and apparent aptitudes, he remained a child of the marriage; the father is to pay $10,000 per year directly to the oldest child for the next two years. The father will pay 25 per cent of the core university costs which are not covered by the plan for the middle child as well as the difference in the Table amount of support for two children versus one child; the father shall pay the Table amount of support for one child to the wife for the youngest child as well as that child's expenses for private school; the wife will be responsible for any extra-curricular activities or tutoring outside the private school; the youngest child will be entitled to the same post-secondary benefits in the same fashion as the two older children; the CRJ is amended to provide that the two oldest children are in the joint care of their parents and will not include any other reference to custody or access; the husband is entitled to specified block access with the youngest child; if flight arrangements are made for this child and she does not fly (and there is no medical reason confirmed in writing by a doctor for that failure), the husband's block access shall be expanded for one week at the next access period and the cost of any penalty from the missed flight will be deducted dollar for dollar from the child support payable by the husband.","The parties brought a variation application under the Divorce Act. They each brought variation applications under the Act relating primarily to the issues of spousal support, child support and access. The Corollary Relief Judgment provided that the parties would pay child support in the amount of $3,100 per month until the wife graduated from the M.B.A. program. The divorce took place in April 2004. The children have been drawn into ongoing legal proceedings between the parties. HELD: The application to vary child support was dismissed. 1)The parties have made a series of cross-applications concerning child support. There are three children: William, who is 23 years old, and April (who is approaching 14), who are both in the custody of the mother. The mother's current income is $12,759.73 US per month which is an annual income of $153,116.76 US or $203,706.74 Can. (On current conversion rate of 1.3304) based on the financial information before the court. 2)The mother has not met that onus. There is no change in circumstances related to the marriage that would, had it been known at the time of the original order, resulted in a different order of support. 3)There is no evidence of her seeking employment apart from her pursuing the establishment and funding for AWEDANS. However laudable this proposed organization may be there is no reason for Mr. Luke to fund its establishment. Ms. Luke is responsible for her own choices. 4)If the result is that he has underpaid he will pay the amount to whomever that top up is owed to within two months of February 15. If he has overpaid it will be 'clawed back' again, from whomever 'owes' him monies over 3 month payment period. 5)The father's income is based on current income which means his support is based upon current income. This is fair and as accurate as possible."
8_2013skqb403.txt,"HELD: The application was dismissed. With respect to the issues, the Court found: 1) that the board had not relied upon the clause in the Policy Statement but on the evidence before it. It was not necessary to decide then whether the Policy Statement was ultra vires; 2) that the board’s interpretation that the Act granted discretion to the board to refuse to reimburse a specific medical treatment was reasonable; 3) that the board’s conclusion was reasonable. The scientific studies did not definitively stated that medical marijuana was effective. In some situations where a patient’s only recourse would to be to use a non-clinically approved drug whose safety and efficacy was still questioned, a determination that the medical aid was not necessary or required might be unreasonable, but not in this case where the applicant declined to try Sativex; and 4) that there was no evidence that the board based its decision on irrelevant considerations such as the potential political ramifications of paying for medical marijuana.","The applicant suffers from chronic back pain and muscle spasms as result of work related injuries. The respondent concedes the applicant is entitled to compensation under the Workers' Compensation Act. The applicant argues that the Board improperly fettered its discretion by relying on the submissions of the Board's medical consultant and medical department. HELD: The application was dismissed. 1) The Board's interpretation that the Act granted the Board discretion to refuse to reimburse a specific medical treatment is reasonable. The Board did not rely on policy statement 5 or even mention it in its decision, but based its decision on the evidence before it. Therefore, even if Policy Statement is ultra vires, it does not decide this matter. It is not necessary to decide whether Policy Statement 5 is an appropriate standard of review for this matter as well. 2) There is no evidence the Board erred in determining that medical marijuana is a 'necessary' or'required' medical aid' under s. 106(1). The Board was required to interpret its own statute with which it is well familiar. 3) There was no evidence that the board made its decision based on considerations such as the potential political consequences of paying for medical marijuana. On the face of its reasons, the Board denied reimbursement specifically because medical marijuana was potentially unsafe and unproven. 4) Based on the wording of the Act and the context of the relevant provisions the Board is interpreting and applying the Act. There are no issues of general legal importance."
e_2009skpc9.txt,"The plaintiff claims against the defendant for water damage sustained to their belongings while in transit from Edmonton to Nipawin in a one ton, 17 foot cube van owned by the defendants. The issues are whether the plaintiffs are precluded from recovery against the defendant by virtue of the contractual term acknowledging the equipment to be water resistant only as well as the posted disclaimers to this effect. HELD: The plaintiff shall have judgment for $250 plus costs of issuing the claim and service. 1) Notwithstanding that the plaintiff signed the rental contract acknowledging that the equipment was not waterproof and only water resistant, it appears from the last three sentences of the inspection report that water was entering at the corners of the door by virtue of the door not sitting flat at the corners. This defect would have permitted excess water to enter prior to being cleaned. Perfection could not be expected since it was acknowledged that the rental unit was not waterproof and some seepage may be expected even after the door had been fixed. Nonetheless, the sealing problem would have taken it beyond the acknowledgment of the unit being only water resistant. 2) The plaintiff acknowledges that the truck remained parked outside in heavy rainfall for two days and nights prior to being unloaded. This exacerbated the scope of the damage claimed since the water would have continued to seep in unabated for roughly six times as long as the trip itself took. The Court concludes that the defendant is only 20% responsible for the damages sustained to the plaintiff's possessions.","The Plaintiffs claim $6,700.77 for water damage sustained while in transit from Edmonton to Nipawin, Saskatchewan in a one ton, 17 foot cube van owned by the Defendant. HELD: Whether the Plaintiffs are precluded from recovery against the Defendant by virtue of the contractual term acknowledging the equipment rented is water resistant and not water proof, as well as the posted disclaimers to this effect. 1) Quantum of damages and mitigation. The Court held that in all the circumstances the Defendant was only 20 responsible for the damages sustained to the plaintiffs' possessions.  2) Apportionment of damages. The Plaintiffs were awarded the sum of $7,500.00. The amount of damages awarded was reduced to $8,500 from $9,500 due to the defendant's failure to disclose that the equipment was water resistant. The quantum of damages was also reduced by the amount of mitigation awarded. The court also held that even if the goods were transported in heavy rain conditions as the evidence disclosed, the plaintiffs were nonetheless the authors of their own misfortune by permitting the loaded truck to sit for an additional two days after reaching their destination in steady rain prior to its unloading. The defendant was only 10% responsible for damages sustained."

9_2014skqb60.txt,Criminal Law – Home Invasion – Sentencing HELD: The Court sentenced Klemenz to 12 years imprisonment for breaking and entering and committing the offence of aggravated sexual assault. He was given credit for 22 months spent in custody. Matychuk was sentenced to 12 years in prison but was given credit for time in custody on a 1:1 basis because the Court had not found any circumstances to justify any greater amount of credit. Matychuk’s credit was for 19 months. The sentences were based on the circumstances of the offence: a home invasion and inflicting serious bodily harm on a young victim. The assault was violent and degrading and took place over a period of time. Weapons were used while the victim was bound and sexually assaulted and threatened.,"The accused were each found guilty, by jury, of breaking and entering the complainant's home and committing the indictable offence of aggravated sexual assault contrary to s. 348(1)(b) of the Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1985, c. C-46. HELD: The accused were convicted as charged as principal and/or as a party to the offence, that is, as person who aided in the commission of the offence. The jury found that the accused was not the perpetrator of the crime. The accused was sentenced to nine years incarceration because of parole violations. The court was also to be guided by the principles set out in s. 718.2 of the Code.  1) In a jury trial, the jury does not identify the facts that it found to support the conviction. The sentencing judge is required to make only those factual determinations necessary for the appropriate sentence in the case. 2) The accused has an extensive criminal record dating back to 1992 when he was youth. He has, by my count, 67 previous convictions. Most of his convictions relate to thefts and break and enters to commit theft. The offender was also found to be a principal or party in the aggravated assault on the complainant. The Court was to take into account the factors that the jury had identified as essential to convicting the accused. 3) The Court is to be bound by the express and implied factual implications of the jury's verdict. The principles of parity in sentencing are set out by the Supreme Court of Canada in R. v. Ferguson, 2008 SCC (CanLII), [2008] SCC 15, [2013] SKCA 27, 189 Sask. R. 190."

In so doing, it asked that its solicitor, Mr. Hesje, be appointed as selling officer to conduct the sale and report to the Court. The court expressed its concern to Mr. Hesje during the course of his submissions as to the propriety of the applicant solicitor serving in such a dual function. He informed the court that some members of our Court have allowed this to be done, others have declined. In the court's respectful view, it is not appropriate for the Court to appoint, as selling officer, the solicitor for the applicant creditor. There are obvious difficulties with conflict of interest. Who does the selling officer serve: the Court, from which his or her authority originates; or the client? The matter is of sufficient importance that the court concluded it should reduce its thoughts to a fiat and direct that it be distributed to other members of the Court. To be fair, Mr. Hesje indicated he was perfectly willing to have another member of the Law Society unconnected to the proceedings appointed as selling officer. The court understood that Grant Richards of Cuelenaere Kendall Katzman Watson &amp; Hagen will serve in this role as opposed to Mr. Hesje.","FIAT.

e_2016skpc157.txt,"HELD: The court found with respect to the following issues: 1) it would not permit the defence to argue the s. 8 violation at the conclusion of the trial because it had not mentioned it in its Charter notice. The Crown disclosed the video-taped interaction between the officer and the accused to the defence at the outset and it was clearly pertinent to the issue of reasonable suspicion, but the defence failed to raise it; and 2) there were two periods of delay and the court was satisfied that the 77 minutes between arrival at the station and the taking of the second sample was satisfactorily explained. However, the court found that first period of 35 minutes between the arrest to the time of departure was not satisfactorily explained. The officer did not act expeditiously and the delay may have prejudiced the accused because when, as here, the readings are slightly above the legal limit, the tests need to be taken as soon as practicable to ensure that the accused’s blood alcohol content at the time of driving is determined accurately. The Crown was not entitled to rely on the presumption in s. 259(1)(c) of the Code.","The accused was charged with impaired driving and care or control contrary to s. 255(1) and s. 253(1)(a) of the Criminal Code. The accused was arrested at 5:36 a.m. and the police officer did not leave the scene until approximately 36 minutes later. The delay in arriving at the police station was attributed to the following: dealing with two suspects at the scene; the need to immobilize the vehicles; and completion of paper work for SGI. The police officer's educated guess must not supplant the rigorous and independent scrutiny demanded by the reasonable suspicion standard. A rudimentary, or even a perfunctory, perusal of the disclosed material would have shown the accused's video-taped interaction with the accused at the outset. The issue, as it pertains to reasonable suspicion, was glaringly apparent."
d_2004nssf15.txt,"The parties were married for 10 years. Contrary to the wording of their separation agreement, the husband argued that they had agreed that spousal support would only be payable for one year as the wife needed extra income from a secure source in order to obtain a mortgage on a new home. Also at issue was the husband's obligation to provide the wife with an automobile pursuant to the separation agreement. Spousal support to continue at the rate set out in the separation agreement for a period of fifteen months from the date of the decision at which time all support shall terminate, unless, prior to the termination date, the wife commences an application which results in her showing cause why spousal support should continue; the husband has complied with his obligations with respect to the provision of an automobile. The wife's financial means and needs required support, the husband had made an agreement to provide such support and the evidence did not support a conclusion that it was agreed to be for only one year. Although the wife did not establish any disadvantage from the marriage, there were disadvantages relating to its breakdown and her lifestyle deteriorated as result of the marriage ending.",HELD: The Divorce Judgment was granted on the grounds that there had been a breakdown of the marriage and the spouses had lived separate and apart for more than a year. The issues were: 1) Spousal support; 2) Ms. Bemister's allegation that the husband failed to comply with the Separation Agreement requiring him to provide her with an automobile. There were disadvantages related to its breakdown. The Court concluded that the wife was entitled to spousal assistance at separation and that such entitlement continues. Her financial needs and needs require such support. Her circumstances clearly demonstrated her need for such support to continue.
d_2012skqb513.txt,"In the original judgment, the manner in which certain calculations should be made with respect to the amount owing to the plaintiff was left to the parties, with the provision that the judge remained seized if they could not reach an agreement. After judgment, the defendants appealed the judgment.  The plaintiffs then submitted detailed calculations of the final judgment for the trial judge's review. The defendants objected to the finalization of the judgment on the ground that, pursuant to Court of Appeal Rule 15, the notice of appeal had stayed the execution of the judgment until the disposition of the appeal. The plaintiff submitted that the calculation of the judgment was not acting on it. HELD: The defendant misconstrued the scope of Rule 15 as it does not stay proceedings. The appeal does not affect the ability of the Court to finalize the judgment. In fact, to do so will avoid costs and delay, and will hopefully be of some of assistance to the Court of Appeal.","The court granted judgment against the defendants in the amount of the Admin Fees charged and paid by SGI to the individual claimants. The parties had not been able to reach an agreement as to how to calculate the final judgment. The solicitors for Saskatchewan Government Insurance submitted detailed calculations for the Court's review. The respondents objected to the request that SGI finalize judgment as contemplated by the above paragraphs. HELD: The court reserved the matter of costs when it reserved its decision on the appeals of the judgment. 1)The Court of Appeal would have to have jurisdiction to prohibit a judge of the Court of Queen's Bench from making any change to his or her own judgment even though the judge is not functus officio. 2)Rule 15(1) in the present factual situation is of no moment and the parties appear to have attributed to the stay imposed by Rule 15 (1) that is totally unwarranted. All further proceedings in the action, other than the appeal, would require an exercise of such authority to be 'proceeding' in an action. 3)The court of appeal would have jurisdiction at the same time as the appeals that have been undertaken. 4)SGI's detailed tracking of charges by the defendants should permit this mathematical calculation to be made."

The parties were in a common law relationship and had two children, aged 9 and 12. After separation, the children resided with their mother, the respondent, in La Ronge and they had access with the petitioner on the weekends. In January 2011, the parties agreed to a weekly co-parenting arrangement. In April 2013 the petitioner was advised by the respondent that she and the children had moved to Melville. Up until that point the child had always resided in the La Ronge area and attended only one school. HELD: The Court found the co-parenting arrangement to be the de facto parenting arrangement and that there was no risk to the children with either parent. The Court ordered that the parties were joint custodians of the children and that preservation of the status quo was in their best interests. The Court ordered that the children primarily reside in La Ronge with the petitioner and attend school there.

Counsel were to explore the possibility of conducting exchanges through the supervised exchange program. Contempt must be proven beyond a reasonable doubt.

HELD: The father was granted custody and directed to complete the parent education program and file a certificate of completion within sixty days. Costs will remain in the cause. The mother's application was dismissed with prejudice to any subsequent reliance on these events in the event of a future application for contempt.  1) In circumstances such as have arisen here, it is not necessarily the child who needs to be investigated, but the parents. These parents demonstrate little understanding of the effects of conflict on child. The child is merely reacting to the unpleasant behaviour of his two primary role models. Many problems would disappear if he had his mother's full permission to go. 2) It is one reason both parents are often requested to share transportation of child for access when there is a geographical separation. By involving the mother, it offers concrete example to the child that she supports the father's access. No four-year-old enjoys confinement in vehicle and if the father is responsible for all of the transportation he may be perceived as the villain. Children of this age do not switch gears easily. This can be assisted by having the child draw pictures for Dad, helping him pack his favourite articles and giving the child easily understandable information about when he is returning (two sleeps, three sleeps, etc.). None of this occurs here."
d_2017skqb42.txt,"HELD: The action was allowed. The defendants had defamed the plaintiff and he was entitled to damages in the amount of $100,000. The court found the following with respect to each issue: 1) it would substitute Postmedia as a defendant pursuant to Queen’s Bench rule 3-84(2) as it was the successor to Canwest and was aware of the plaintiff’s claim when it purchased the Star Phoenix and it would not be prejudiced. It would not deprive Postmedia of a defence under s. 5 of The Limitations Act because the articles remained on Postmedia’s websites and were republished whenever they were viewed or downloaded; 2) after reviewing each of the articles and assessing the words complained of, it found that the words constituted defamation; 3) all of the defendants were found to be joint tortfeasors with Purdy because they participated in the publication of a libel and were jointly and severally liable in defamation to the plaintiff; and 3) an appropriate award for general damages was $50,000. The court allowed the claim for aggravated damages as the defendants were found to be motivated by actual or express malice because Purdy did not simply report the jury’s verdict in her articles but indicated that she believed that the jury had not reached the proper verdict in the trial. She deliberately chose to report the stories of people who had made complaints about the surgical care provided to them by the plaintiff without verifying it or seeking comment from the plaintiff. As she was acting in the course of her employment, Purdy’s malice was attributed to all the defendants. The plaintiff was awarded $50,000 in aggravated damages.","The plaintiff commenced a libel action against the defendants alleging that they, acting alone or in concert, published defamatory comments about the plaintiff in series of articles in the Star Phoenix newspaper and on websites owned and operated by the newspaper and Canwest Publishing Inc. (collectively the defendants). The plaintiff alleged that the defendants had published the words complained of in several articles and that the plaintiff had suffered loss and damage to his professional and civic reputation. The plaintiff sought an injunction requiring the defendants to remove certain content from websites under their control. The defendants opposed the request on the basis that the two-year limitation period set forth in The Limitations Act in force at the time of the alleged defamation had expired and there was no evidentiary basis upon which to conclude that no party would suffer actual prejudice as a result of the requested amendment. HELD: The plaintiff was found not negligent and exonerated. 1)The plaintiff was the successor to the plaintiff and was the owner of the StarPhoenix newspaper. 2)There was no evidence that any of the defendants, or any of them, were liable in defamation. 3)The defendants were aware of the existence of Dr. Graham's claim and were the current owners of the newspaper. 4)There were no errors in the statements of claim made by the plaintiff. The statement of claim was amended to add Postmedia Network Inc. as defendant. 5)The plaintiffs were not aware that the defendant was facing a defamation suit. 6)The court was not able to resolve the claim at mediation or pre-trial settlement conference and eventually the claim was set down for trial."
e_2014skqb344.txt,"The court gave leave to counsel for the plaintiff to file an amended draft order nisi. It made the following recommendations regarding the draft order: 1) the sale should be held under the direction of a solicitor other than the plaintiff’s solicitor; 2) that relying upon a partial appraisal and in the absence of information on the condition of the property, setting the reserve bid at $100,000 might not reflect the best price. Fairness demanded the reserve bid be set at $125,000 but the court set the bid at $115,000. If the property could not be sold at that price, the plaintiff was given leave to apply to the court for a lower reserve bid; and 3) Queen’s Bench rule 10-47(2) required that purchase monies are to be paid into court to the credit of the cause to be applied as directed by the court, including costs. Only after an application and service upon the defendant and after the court had assessed solicitor client costs could monies be disbursed to the plaintiff. Monies owed under the mortgage must be set out by the court on application. All of these matters may be addressed in one final proceeding, in the application to confirm the sale, if the judicial sale proved successful.","FIAT: The plaintiff applied for an order nisi for judicial sale of the property owned by the defendants. The Limitation of Civil Rights Act does not preclude the plaintiff from suing on the covenant because this is not a purchase-money mortgage. However, a judicial sale is required so that the plaintiff may apply to have the amount of deficiency in the judgment set by the court. Otherwise, as provided by s. of the LCRA, foreclosure of the mortgage operates as full satisfaction of that debt. HELD: The application for the reserve bid in judicial sale must also be brought by notice of application. This is the stage in the foreclosure proceeding to not only seek confirmation of the sale, but also to seek the court's direction on the payment of purchase monies, including costs.

8_2014skqb299.txt,"HELD: The application was dismissed. The court held that the standard of review of the arbitrator’s decision was one of reasonableness. Section 25 of The Trade Union Act states that the conclusions of arbitrators are final and therefore the court noted they should not be interfered with lightly. Further, the court noted that the decision of the arbitrator was not of significant importance to the general public. The court reviewed the history of collective bargaining at the university and found that tenure was not dependent on the president’s personal recommendation in the past. The court found that the arbitrator’s reasoning was transparent and intelligible throughout. To include the word tenure in the definition of appointment or promotion was not the only conclusion that could be drawn. The arbitrator’s decision was within the range of acceptable conclusions and was reasonable.","The university applied for judicial review of the Arbitrator's interpretation of s. 51 of the Act. The university's position was that the arbitrator exceeded his jurisdiction, made an unreasonable decision, or committed an otherwise reviewable error by misinterpreting sections of the University of Saskatchewan Act and in particular Section 51. 2. HELD: 1)The arbitrator was correct. The standard of review applicable was correctness. The Faculty Association's position is that the president has the authority to overrule the Renewals and Tenure Appeal Committee in s.51 of Act, which states the Board may act only on the president's recommendation. 2)The interpretation of the s.50 interpretation of S.51 by the arbitrators was correctness or reasonableness. 3)The parties agreed to lengthy statement of facts and the admissibility of number of documents. 4)The university's interpretation would be that an award of tenure is neither an appointment nor promotion as contemplated by the Act and the collective agreement can more readily be harmonized. It is easy to see that, in their common usage, these terms can overlap. However, this is statute creating and dividing up responsibilities within University and these terms should be given meaning consistent with that context."
9_2005skca89.txt,"This appeal arises from proceedings under The Family Property Act. The couple had lived together for several years. She sought judgment distributing their property. The property included a house in Vancouver, which he had acquired some years earlier with the financial assistance of his parents. The trial judge found that the respondent had acquired the house after the commencement of the spousal relationship and then went to hold that the petitioner was entitled to an equal share of its value with no reduction owing to the gifts or loans from his parents. The respondent appealed. HELD: Appeal allowed by the majority. Lane J.A. wrote in dissent. Majority: 1) The Vancouver property was acquired after commencement of the spousal relationship. The value of the property did not qualify for exemption under s. 23(1)(a) of the Act. There are a number of facts that merit emphasis. The respondent received $125,000 from his mother before the spousal relationship started. He still had that amount on hand when the relationship commenced. He used the money as a down payment on the purchase of the Vancouver house shortly after the relationship commenced. By establishing these facts, the respondent established the requisite conditions for the grant of an exemption of the value of the Vancouver property to the extent of the $125,000. 2) The trial judge erred in declining to take into account the loans of $100,000 the appellant received from each of his parents for the purpose of purchasing the Vancouver property. There was insufficient evidence before the trial judge to enable him to find that the mortgage debts were statute-barred and he did not make a firm finding on this point. The trial judge's finding that the respondent will not have to repay the loans was incomplete. He did not assess the loans in light of s. 21(3)(e) of the Act. On the whole of the circumstances concerning the Vancouver property and the length of the spousal relationship, there is no tenable basis for not giving effect to s. 21(3)(e) of the Act and the contributions made by the respondent's parents on his behalf to the acquisition of the property. The petitioner is entitled to share in the build up of the equity in consequence of the pay-down of the mortgage. Minority: 1) The Vancouver home ought to be distributed in accordance with s. 22 of the Act. The gift of $125,000 was made by the respondent's mother with the full knowledge that the parties were living together. In this case, the contribution by a third party on behalf of a spouse to the acquisition of family property is one of the usual factors outlined in s. 21 of the Act and it would be inequitable to exempt the gift from distribution. 2) The trial judge did not err in failing to deduct from the family property the loans given by the appellant's parents. He made a finding the loans were statute-barred. The trial judge clearly considered the legislation and his interpretation of the legislation was not challenged by the respondent. He also made the finding the loans would likely never be repaid. He simply used less than precise language.","HELD: The appeal was allowed. Whether the trial judge erred in concluding that the appellant had acquired the house after the commencement of the spousal relationship was best considered in light of the material facts, the relevant provisions of the Family Property Act and the distribution made by him."

The mother's three older children had been apprehended with two other older children placed with a person of sufficient interest and the third child was made a permanent ward of the Ministry. The Minister argued that given the extensive past history of the three older children, the Minister properly apprehended the infant and the permanency planning committee was of the opinion that there was no use putting off the inevitable permanent order for the child. The mother and the child's father had separated with the father supporting the mother having the child returned to her care and the father having access to the child.

The child shall be returned to the mother who is a person who has a right of custody of the child pursuant to s. 36(3) of the Child and Family Services Act. This shall be done on a transitional basis as determined by the Ministry with the child to be completely returned to the mother within 30 days of this order. There was no evidence presented at trial regarding attempts by the Ministry to pursue any less intrusive alternatives and instead proceeded directly to the most severe position being a permanent order.

The burden is on the Ministry to establish its case on the balance of probabilities being the civil burden of proof.  2) The Ministry has been down that road for six years with the child. It is not prepared to put this child at risk, in particular because of the parents' past history of domestic abuse and violence. 3) In making an assessment as to whether an order under s.37(1) is appropriate the court must do so on the basis of the evidence before it. The court must look at various factors including (without meaning to be exhaustive of the possibilities) any changes in circumstance or conduct of the parent that has occurred or is proposed, any plan of corrective action that is being advanced, the nature of any resources suggested and the time frames which may be involved."
1993canlii3174.txt,"This was an appeal from a decision varying the appellant's maintenance downwards. The parties had a traditional marriage, with the wife remaining at home and caring for their three children. Upon separation, they entered into a settlement agreement whereby maintenance was set al. $2000 monthly while the appellant remained in the matrimonial home. The agreement stipulated that the settlement was a full and final settlement on all corollary matters between the parties. The respondent subsequently remarried, underwent some difficult financial times and made the application which was the subject of this appeal. The appellant contended the terms of the agreement were final. Per Jones, J.A. and Chipman, J.A. (concurring for separate reasons), allowing the appeal and setting aside the lower court order, that while courts have ultimate jurisdiction in the matter of support, settlement agreements must be respected. There is no difference between an agreement which provides for long term maintenance and one that does not contain such a provision. The effect is to permanently settle the issue in both cases. To review the agreement, particularly after the lapse of a substantial period of time, could lead to grave injustices to one or both parties. Per Hallett, J.A., (dissenting), dismissing the appeal, that a settlement agreement which provides for periodic support payments indefinitely is very different than one which contains provisions for termination of support after a specified period. The causal connection test established in Pelech v. Pelech (1987), 38 D.L.R. (4th) 641, should not apply to payors of periodic support for an indefinite period. Such agreements do not have the degree of finality that was effected by the settlement agreement under consideration in the Pelech decision.","This was an appeal from a decision in Pelech v. Richardson which reduced the appellant's support from $2,000 to $1200 per month. The parties had entered into a settlement agreement in 1983 which provided for long term maintenance. The respondent had remarried and continued to reside in the matrimonial home. There had been defaults in making the maintenance payments. The appellant applied to vary the amount of support. Dismissing the appeal, that the appellant had established that there had been radical change in the wife's financial circumstances and that there was no link between the change in circumstances and the marriage. The court's jurisdiction was not ousted and may be exercised where there was a radical change of circumstances."

The court reviewed the transcript of the tribunal’s hearing and its written decision. With regard to the first two issues, it found that the tribunal had erred in law in the following ways: 1) by failing to conduct a de novo hearing as required. It did not refer to the expert opinion submitted by the appellant as new evidence at the hearing; and 2) by failing to explain its decision. It did not refer to the new evidence nor did it state how it had reconciled the conflicting expert opinion evidence offered by the appellant and the respondent. It merely accepted the evidence of the SMO’s experts.","HELD: The appeal was dismissed and the respondent physician was reinstated on an interim basis. The respondent physician had been suspended continuously since December 2014. He had been charged with failing to meet the standard of care outlined in the appellant's written reasons for his suspension and notice of Board meeting as required by s. 76(3) of the Public Inquiries Act. The s. 45 appeal to tribunal was not an appeal on the record. Rather, it was part of the Tribunal's process to determine if it made any of the numerous errors alleged by the appellant such that its decision was rendered unreasonable or incorrect. The suspension of the physician's privileges was upheld."
2_2007skqb378.txt,"The outstanding issue is child support, past and future. The dispute largely centered on what monies were owed from the past. Central to this was the determination of the respondent's income. HELD: 1) The respondent is a farmer. His income tax returns for the years 2004, 2005 and 2006 have been filed, but certain adjustments must be made. The purpose of the capital cost allowance is to provide money to purchase replacement equipment. However, not all of the money is needed and is not used for that purpose. It is that unused portion which should be allocated as part of the respondent's income. In this case, 40% of the allowance should be treated as income for the purpose of calculating child support. The personal portion of the utility costs should be included as part of his income, an appropriate percentage is 25%. An amount of the legal and accounting costs should be attributed to the respondent personally and added to his income, in 2004 $1,000 is added, in 2005 $5,000 is added and in 2006 $1,000 is added. The respondent has taken advantage of the optional inventory adjustment and that must be factored back into his income using the methodology set out in Tamke v. Tamke, 2001 SKQB 528. As the respondent's income has undergone serious fluctuation over the years, it is therefore appropriate that his income for calculating child support be based on the average of his income in the years 2004 and 2005. 2) The respondent will not have to pay half of the cost of Stacey joining a school trip to Europe. This is because Stacey paid half of the cost herself and because the respondent was asked to contribute at the time but refused. The petitioner knew the respondent had refused to contribute and, when she elected to pay the balance, she did so unilaterally. It would be inappropriate to compel the respondent to contribute now. 3) The school fees paid by the petitioner are not extraordinary and should be encompassed in the basis child support. The health costs in the form of orthodontic treatments are extraordinary and the parties shall contribute equally as their incomes are presently comparable. 3) On five occasions the respondent failed to attend at the agreed meeting spot with the result that the petitioner had to make the entire trip to deliver the children to the respondent so he could exercise access. She will be compensated for the actual lost wages and fuel costs that she incurred on the respondent's behalf, but not for costs she would have incurred in any event.  4) The respondent shall pay costs of $1,200.","The parties have three children: Carley, Stacey and Mandey. The parties separated in 2003 and the parties resided with their respective parents on alternate weeks. In 2004 the petitioner moved to Alberta and the three children moved with the respondent. In 2005 the petitioner paid child support of $300 per month but he made no payment for the month of June. In 2006 the respondent moved to Medicine Hat, Alberta. The petitioner moved back to the respondent, but there was no variation in the order dated June 29, 2004. It is fair and reasonable that an appropriate retroactive variation be effected."
c_2014skqb144.txt,The Court dismissed the application. It found that the accused was not capable of representing himself but that the accused had not shown that he was indigent.,"The accused was charged with possession of a controlled substance contrary to s. 5(2) of the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act. He had been committed to stand trial on the noted offence in Queen's Bench with Queen’s Bench justice sitting alone. At the preliminary inquiry, the accused failed to complete any of the steps outlined by the judge in her previous order and had not made any attempt to inquire into a loan or home equity line of credit. He applied for court appointed counsel in the event of the unavailability of Legal Aid as counsel for an accused. HELD: The application was dismissed. The accused was not persuaded that he had shown the requisite circumstance of being indigent. The court reviewed the financial situation of the accused and determined that he was probably not capable of conducting his own defence in light of the personal issues which he is facing and his methamphetamine addiction. The Court reviewed the factors that led to the conclusion that the accused was indigent and therefore not able to afford the costs of a court appointed lawyer. It was important to provide a reasonable window of time for the accused to start to make such arrangements."
4_1996canlii5334.txt,"Following three patient suicides at the Cape Breton Regional Hospital, the hospital, in response to concerns and questions from family members, retained two psychiatrists to review the cases, the roles and responsibilities of individuals involved in the cases, patient records and hospital policies and practices. At the end of the review they were to provide a written report to the hospital's Chief Executive Officer. The hospital staff participating in the investigation and review were advised that their information would be treated as part of a 'peer review' and therefore confidential. Upon receipt of the report the hospital, as a result, refused to disclose the report to the families. An application pursuant to the Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy Act was made by an M.L.A., who sought for the disclosure of the report and for a review of the hospital's decision to not release the report. The hospital decided to release the full report. The appellant employees appealed the decision of the hospital, claiming that they had been assured confidentiality. Allowing the appeal, that the disclosure of personal information consisting of personal recommendations or evaluations, character references, or personal evaluations by the appellants and other hospital staff are presumed under s. 20(3)(g) of the Act to be an unreasonable invasion of a third party's personal privacy. Under s. 20(1) the hospital is required to refuse to disclose this information. It necessarily follows that recommendations in the report founded upon such information is also presumed to be an unreasonable invasion of privacy and is likewise not to be disclosed. The remainder of the report is disclose able.","HELD: The Court found in favour of the appellants and ordered the release of the report. The court found that the report was to be confidential and to be used as an internal document only, thus ensuring the confidentiality of the physicians involved in the review. The appellants were to have their report reviewed by the Regional Hospital. The decision was made against the recommendations of senior management at the hospital and contrary to assurances given to the families that it would be an independent review."

8_2017skqb53.txt,"The accused was charged with the commission of sexual assault, sexual touching in relation to a 16-year-old and possession of child pornography. The accused came to police attention via a report by the complainant. She reported that the accused was often viewing a pornographic website while in her presence. The police prepared an information to obtain a search warrant (ITO). The ITO stated that the search would provide evidence of the accused’s viewing of pornography in the presence of the complainant, bolstering the complainant’s credibility. The ITO did not reference possession of child pornography. The ITO sought only a search of the “search history on the computer”. The issued warrant authorized a search of the accused’s computer and related devices and media, as well as documents pertaining to occupancy of the home and control of computer equipment. The complainant subsequently alleged that the accused had taken photos of her in the shower. The police did not amend the ITO to include a search for photos. The police executed the search and seized, inter alia, a laptop, an iPhone and CDs. The police delivered the material to a computer forensic specialist at the RCMP and requested a complete forensic search of the computer and phone to obtain a general search of the Internet history, pictures of the complainant and messages between the complainant and the accused. The police knew that the search of pictures was not included on the search warrant. The RCMP did not review the terms of the warrant prior to completing the examination and examined the entire contents of the laptop and phone. The accused submitted that his s. 8 Charter rights had been violated by the search and applied for exclusion of evidence pursuant to s. 24(2). The application proceeded by voir dire. The evidence was apparently located on either the accused’s laptop or cell phone, but the nature of the evidence obtained was not disclosed at the voir dire. The following issues were raised: 1) What is the correct procedure to be used to challenge evidence seized pursuant to a search warrant; 2) Was the Crown able to call amplification evidence and have it considered in support of the search and seizure conducted; 3) Did the ITO set forth reasonable and probable grounds that the items sought were evidence with respect to the commission of an offence; 4) Did the ITO use boiler plate clauses; 5) Did the ITO establish reasonable and probable grounds that the items were likely to be found in the place to be searched; and 6) What was the extent of a search of a computer or computer device. | HELD: Evidence of the accused’s search history was validly obtained. Other evidence was beyond the scope of the search warrant and obtained by violation of the accused’s s. 8 rights. The court held: 1) There is a two-step inquiry to be made when real evidence is seized during a search. The first step is an inquiry into constitutionality, and the second is reached only after a constitutional infringement has been established. Both inquiries impose an onus on the person claiming infringement. The standard of proof is the balance of probabilities. Challenges to constitutionality of warranted searches may involve either or both a facial and a sub-facial attack on the authorizing warrant. The record examined on facial review is fixed: it is the ITO, not an amplified or enlarged record;  2) In attempting to enter evidence of the complainant’s allegation that the accused took pictures of her in the shower, the Crown relied on an argument that the ends justified the means. This amplification evidence sought to allege a whole new offence and area of search. It was not admitted; 3) The point of this voir dire was not to determine admissibility of evidence outside of the search warrant context. There was no requirement that evidence sought in support of allegations made be directly connected to a complainant or the actual subject matter of a complainant; 4) The ITO did not use impermissible boiler plate clauses when read in its entirety. However, it did not set forth reasonable and probable grounds that text messages were evidence with respect to the commission of an offence; 5) The ITO provided sufficient description. It was reasonable to infer that search history meant search history of the accused with respect to the websites defined in the ITO. Further argument was required on whether text messages could be included; and  6) Police are not entitled to rummage through entire contents of a device searching for other evidence. The ITO sought only the search history.",The accused applied for relief pursuant to s.24(2) of the Charter to exclude evidence seized through the execution of a search warrant. The actual evidence seized was not disclosed at the hearing. HELD: The application proceeded by voir dire. The Crown called evidence to amplify the statements set forth in the Information to Obtain Warrant to Search (ITO). The admissibility of this evidence was in issue. The accused called no evidence. He disputed the facial validity of the search warrant and also argued his s.8 Charter rights had been violated. The Court reviewed the sufficiency of warrant application and concluded that the Crown could adduce evidence to establish the recency of the tip because that information was known to the police at the time it was obtained and subject to the requirement that unconstitutionally obtained evidence cannot be considered. There was no dispute taken by the Crown to the procedure employed by the accused in this regard.
e_1999skqb150.txt,"FIAT. It was held in an earlier fiat in June that the addition of the two proposed plaintiffs asserted new causes of action and amendments to the statement of claim could only be considered pursuant to an application under s.44(11) of the Queen's Bench Act. The defendant resisted the joinder of the new plaintiffs and amendments on the basis of undue delay and actual prejudice. The statement of claim alleged nuisance, and in the alternative, negligence against the City with respect to the design, construction and maintenance of the sewer system causing his basement to flood. The plaintiffs stated they only became aware of the damage to their home and possible health problems over period of time. Leave to appeal the June fiat was denied. The defendant plead limitation period defence to the amendment and argued that if the City had received notice of any ongoing problems it would have investigated and possibly taken steps to minimize any damage; that evidence had been lost; it may be too late to determine the causes. HELD: The amendments were allowed. 1)The limitation period in s.314(1) applies from the time damages were sustained, not from the date of the occurrence which led to the damage. The facts were uncertain. It was uncertain when the limitation period commenced. If the date the applicant should have discovered the additional damage was the date they received the geotechnical and structural engineering report, the amended claim was brought within the 1 year limitation period. 2)Inexcusable delay was not established. 3)It was not accepted that the defendant suffered actual prejudice. If it was prejudiced it was through its own inaction. No evidence had been lost. The basement was available for inspection. It had the benefit of the reports provided by the applicants. 4)The requirements of s.44(11) were met and judicial discretion was exercised to allow the amendments. The fact that the joint owner of the property was not included was due to inadvertence rather than any deliberate choice. It was also appropriate to join the new plaintiff. It appeared that the expanded claim alleged in the requested amendment was not apparent at the time the original claim was issued and arose out of the same occurrence. 4)Costs in the cause.","FIAT. The application was sequel to an earlier fiat rendered by the defendant on June 1, 1999 with respect to an application to set aside proposed amendments to the original statement of claim and the joinder of parties to that claim. In the end, the court found the proposed amendments did not require leave to amend and found that the infant could be joined as a plaintiff to the action on the basis she was an infant against whom the limitation period of one year had intervened. HELD: 1)The application was allowed. As there was no legal impediment to making the amendments requested, the Court considered it an appropriate exercise of judicial discretion to allow them.  2)The applicant was a joint owner of the property and should have been included in the original action. The fact that she was not appears to have arisen from inadvertence rather than any deliberate choice made at the time. Her joinder as a party in this fact situation is contemplated by the Rules (Rule 38(1)) and normally would not be contested. 3)The amendments were made to show that the claim asserted by the new parties or by or against the new party arose out of the same transaction or occurrence as the original claim. No evidence had been lost. The basement is available for inspection. Any consultant hired by the defendants is in an equally good position to investigate as was the applicants' consultant and offer an opinion on cause and remedy. 4)The applicants met the requirements of s.44(11) of The Queen's Bench Act. The defendant resisted and the amendments were allowed.  5)The defendant was now in a position to conduct an investigation and it had the benefit of the reports provided to it by the applicants. The applicant did not file a statement of defence nor did it file an intent to defend.  6)The limitation period in s.314(1) applies from the time when the damages were sustained, not from the date of the occurrence.

e_1996canlii6831.txt,"The petitioner sought a divorce, custody, spousal and child support and an unequal division of matrimonial property. The respondent counter-petitioned for similar relief, including divorce, joint custody and an equal division of the property. HELD: 1)Sole custody was awarded to the mother with access on the same terms as contained in the interim order. Two reasons for not awarding joint custody were the obvious acrimony between the parties and the respondent's reluctance to support his children. Three weeks after his application for sale of the home was rejected, he applied for a leave of absence from his job. It was inferred that he was trying to avoid complying with the order for interim support. 2)The mother re-entered the workforce after many years' absence. She suffered an economic disadvantage from the marriage and its breakdown. 3)The car owned by the petitioner when she married was exempt property. The motorcycle was disregarded as there had not been a significant increase in value. The list prepared by the respondent was used to divide household goods, tools and equipment. 4)The respondent was to assume one-half of the bank loan and it was agreed that the pension funds should be shared equally. 5)It would be unfair and inequitable to the custodial parent to order an equal division of the matrimonial property. The petitioner was granted possession of the matrimonial home until the younger child's 18th birthday or until she vacated the property. 6)The respondent cannot avoid his responsibility of providing an adequate level of support by turning his back on well-paid employment.

e_2016skpc106.txt,"HELD: The accused was found not guilty. The court found that the accused’s s. 8 Charter rights were breached. Pursuant to a Grant analysis, the court excluded the evidence obtained after the illegal entry of the accused’s home. The court found that the accused had not consented to the entry by the officer and the complainant and it was therefore a warrantless search. The officer did not have the lawful authority to enter the home on the basis of arresting the father as he was not in hot pursuit. The complainant had not obtained a warrant under s. 13.1 of The Child and Family Services Act to enter the accused’s home and therefore had no lawful authority to enter the home. There were no exigent circumstances to justify the search such as preventing the destruction of evidence as they already established that the person they sought was not in the house. The unlawful entry and search of the accused’s home was a severe breach of the accused’s Charter rights. The impact upon her was severe as the complainant gathered evidence and apprehended her children. The accused’s assault on the complainant was minor in nature and although not excusable, her offence was a reaction to a significant breach of her rights. The administration of justice was served by excluding the evidence.","The complainant was a child protection worker employed by the Saskatchewan Ministry of Social Services. She enlisted the assistance of Moose Jaw Police Service to enter the complainant's apartment to investigate whether the accused's children were in need of protection and if necessary to apprehend those children. The complainant kicked and hit the complainant. The accused was charged with assault contrary to s. 266 of The Child and Family Services Act. HELD: The Court held that the accused was not exercising criminal law power and his entrance to the complainant’s suite would be contrary to her section rights unless that entrance and search was determined to be lawful under some other legal authority. The Court concluded that the police officer did not have the legal authority to enter Ms. Bigsky‘s apartment and that he was not attempting to apprehend the children. Therefore, the Court concluded the officer had no lawful authority and his entry to her suite was contrary to his section rights.  1) The Court was of the view that the Parental Service Agreement could not give Ms. Buchanan an open ended authority to access her home without a warrant. The fact that the father had contact with her on this date did not alter that situation. 2) There was some debate as to the identity of the officer and the jurisdiction of the court. The Crown and the Ministry were in hot pursuit of an individual, and attempting to make the arrest. However, the fact that a worker had directed that the officer was not to have contact with the complainant does not alter the situation. 3) The court was also of the opinion that the parental service agreement gave the mother the right to enter her home and to search for the children, and that a warrant and judicial authorization to enter it would be required. 4) It was open to the Court to establish that the mother had a reasonable grounds to believe that the child was being harmful to the children and that apprehension was justified on that date merely by reason of her having contact with them."
e_2009nssm47.txt,"The claimants live on property abutting the defendant Burrow's property. The defendant Renouf is Burrows' friend. As favour, Renouf attended the property while Burrows was away and cut down some trees that he was asked to cut. He went on to cut down several others that he felt were diseased/damaged. eventually realizing he had crossed the property line and cut down more than 17 of the claimants' trees. The claimants sued for the cost of replacing the trees with a comparable number of mature trees, the cost of removing the felled trees and to recoup for anticipated damage to their septic field. At issue was: 1. whether Renouf trespassed; 2. whether Burrows was liable for Renouf's actions (for 'hiring' Renouf or because they were engaged in a joint enterprise); and 3. damages. The claimants did not want Burrows helping with the tree removal, even if doing so would save money. 1. Renouf trespassed on the claimants' land and is liable for damages. That it was an honest mistake is irrelevant since trespass does not require bad faith or improper purpose. 2. Burrows is not liable. He was not Renouf's employer, nor were Renouf's actions foreseeable. It was a favour and Renouf went way beyond the scope of what he was asked to do. Burrows is not responsible for everything that flowed from their limited enterprise. The case law requires a degree of blameworthiness (a neglectful or unlawful enterprise) which creates a foreseeable risk of harm. 3. Renouf to pay the claimants: $3,750 to replace the trees with young, native trees (half the amount sought by the claimants), $2,000 for tree removal (half the quote submitted by the claimants since they refused to mitigate the damage by allowing Burrows to help). While Burrows had counterclaimed for damages arising from a confrontation between the claimants and his son, he did not seriously pursue it and it was dismissed. Costs of $1,234 awarded to the claimants (including $960.77 for disbursements). While the amount seems high, the case was large one and the counterclaim, although not seriously pursued, hung over the claimants' heads as they prepared for trial.","HELD: The claim was dismissed. The Court found that the actions of the Defendant Renouf, who had cut down trees on the Claimants' property, were not criminal acts. The only issue was whether the Defendant Burrows became vicariously or jointly responsible when Mr. Renouf went on 'frolic of his own.' The Court allowed the costs as submitted on the basis that the case was a large one, and it had been met with a large Counterclaim which, though not seriously pursued, was nonetheless hanging over the heads of the claimants as they prepared for the trial. The Claimants were not content to limit their recovery to the Defendant. The claim against the Defendant was dismissed and the Court found the Defendant to be jointly liable."
e_2002skpc80.txt,"The accused was charged with owning a dog that without provocation attacked a person contrary to the Urban Municipality Act s.135.3(3). There were four separate incidents involving the dog in September 2001. At issue was whether the Crown had proven an attack on any of the four occasions. The accused agreed that the presumption of non-provocation set out in s.135.2(1) of the UMA applied and that presumption had not been displaced. HELD: 1)A $200 fine was imposed along with conditions. The dog must be kept within an enclosed continuous fence and chained to a post. There must be a gate preventing exiting except while on a leash and muzzled. The owner must display a sign stating Guard Dog on Duty. 2)If dog is territorial or protective, and the facts show the human has, by intruding, been in law provocative, the offence may not be proven beyond reasonable doubt. On the evidence there was no intrusion sufficient to justify an attack or which could be considered provocation. 3)There were seven specific pieces of evidence which supported the conclusion that the owner did not take reasonable steps to ensure his dog did not attack someone in the fashion prohibited by s.135.3(3). It is irrelevant at law that after dog attacks it responds to its owner's commands. The dog escaped the yard, was off leash and was not sufficiently restrained or enclosed. logging chain affixed to post is substantial way of tethering dog. One would not expect dog to be attached to logging chain if there were no concerns.","The accused was charged with assault contrary to s. 135.3(3) of the Urban Municipalities Act. The evidence indicated that the accused owned a dog, to wit, that without provocation attacks a person. The accused did not take reasonable steps to prevent the offence from occurring. The court imposed a fine of $200. HELD: The court accepted the accused's evidence as to the proximity of the dog and the actions of the animal to the complainant, but found that the presumption of non-provocation that's set out in s 135.2(1) applies. The Court also concluded that the Crown had established beyond a reasonable doubt that there was an attack on the complainant. The appropriate fine in the circumstances was $200 and that's the fine imposed.  1)On the definition of attack, as understand it, that the evidence is not appropriate nor accurate in the context of an attack by an animal. Dogs do not go into battle, not in the ordinary sense of that word and consider that word to be a voluntary intention to be involved in some physically violent act. 2)The accused did nothing to prevent a small person, a small child, or the dog from getting free itself. 3)The evidence was that the dog was in close proximity, and was snarling and barking, but in that case she was inside of her residence. In the Court's opinion, the dog's actions might have justified requiring a hearing under the other section of The Urban Munipalities Act, which provides for determination as to whether a dog is dangerous or not, but the Crown proved on that basis that the offence was committed. 4)The court found that there were seven specific pieces of evidence that supported the Crown's conclusion that the defendant did not have reasonable steps."
b_2010nssc387.txt,"The small claims adjudicator granted an order for substituted service after the respondent had trouble serving the appellant with notice of her claim. As per the order, she personally served the appellant's mother and notified the appellant of the hearing date by text message. He didn't appear and default judgement was granted against the appellant in the amount of $11,031.35. The appellant appealed, arguing the adjudicator failed to follow the natural requirements of justice. He denied being in contact with his mother. He admitted receiving the text message(s) but said he didn't believe the respondent, but didn't make any further inquiries. New evidence (a letter from his mother saying she was not in contact with her son) was allowed on the appeal. Appeal dismissed. The right to be heard is a fundamental right, and an appeal of a default judgment must be subject to the highest scrutiny. Here the respondent's claim was valid. The adjudicator had the jurisdiction/authority to make an order for substituted service and the respondent followed it. At the very least, the appellant was notified of the hearing dates by text message(s). While he may not have believed the messages, he should have taken some steps to confirm with the court if there was indeed a hearing set. He failed to prove he had a reasonable excuse for defaulting, chose to ignore the notice, and was mistaken only as to what would be the outcome if he failed to appear.","Appellant appeals decision of Smalls Claims Court. On May 18, 2010, the Adjudicator issued a decision against the Appellant in favour of the Respondent in the amount of $10,852 plus costs of $139.35 for a total of $11,031.35. The Court found little merit to his argument that he knew nothing of the hearing date, the finding of fact that service had been effected does not result in a failure of natural justice as the court had the jurisdiction and authority to grant such an order. It therefore follows, that the court was entitled to issue a default judgment against him. The Appellants must accept the consequences of his decision to ignore the notice. HELD: 1) In considering a person's right to be heard, it does not automatically follow that just because they were not present that their appeal will be allowed. 2) In this case the Court adopts the reasoning of Justice Warner and in particular that the Court must also view the respondent's actions and the courts record of events in determining whether due process was followed and whether the Rules and Regulations prescribed by the Court were adhered to. 3) In light of the increase in the monetary jurisdiction of the court, it is as relevant to nature justice in the Small Claims Court as it is in the Supreme Court. There is still a requirement that the applicant show sufficient bases for the court to exercise discretion to avoid abuse."

The accused denied the allegations, suggesting that, since the niece had not disclosed any of these matters until she was 17 years old, she had made up generalized allegation against him to stop her boyfriend from breaking up with her and then found it necessary to maintain the lie, tell her friends, her mother and the police and get more specific when pressed for details. He also argued that she was not credible because her testimony in court was inconsistent with that in the preliminary inquiry and although there were numerous persons she could have confided in at the time, she never told anybody about the alleged incidents but kept going back to visit her father. Accused found guilty of all counts. Although she was at times frustrated and unable to recall precisely, the niece's demeanour was consistent with a young person doing her best to be truthful and accurate in intimidating and embarrassing circumstances. Her evidence was both consistent with that of other witnesses and internally consistent and the inconsistencies with her previous statements were minor. The court found she had no motive to lie initially or during her trial testimony and the reality was that by making these allegations, she knew her father would be forced to move and would become estranged from his sister, her family would be fractured and the 'sister'-like relationship she had with the accused's daughter would end.","The accused was charged with four counts of sexual assault. The accused had been in a common-law relationship with the complainant, with whom he lived for several years. The complainant alleged that the accused touched her in a sexual manner and that he had fondled her and touched her on the genitals. The Crown argued that the relationship between the complainant and the accused was similar to that of a person under the age of 16 years. HELD: The accused was found guilty of four counts. 1)The accused's credibility was mixture of reliability and reliability (are they now accurately recalling matters they had proper opportunity to observe and commit to memory in the past?) and honesty (the accused was disinterested in the outcome of the case and did not favour any party over another). 2)The essential elements of the offence were comprehensively addressed by the Supreme Court of Canada in v. Ewanchuk 1999 CanLII 711 (SCC), [1999] SCR 330. 3)Criminal Code Section 151, ss 151, 152 265 and 271. Some of these sections changed over time. The wording was identical except that it was an offence in relation to 'a person under age 16 years'. 4)The Crown's position was that there was no direct evidence of the accused having anything to do with the placing of the camera in the bathroom. 5)There was no evidence beyond a reasonable doubt that he committed any of the offences."

Appeal allowed; adoption order set aside; matter remitted to the application court for a further hearing; application to admit fresh evidence granted in part; the portions of the appellant's affidavit addressing her efforts to secure counsel for the adoption hearing admitted into evidence. The appellant had a bona fide intention to appear or to be represented at the hearing and had made reasonable, although unsuccessful, efforts to do so. Allowing the appeal would be in the child's best interests as she had resided with the adoptive parents for the past three years and would continue to do so pending the further hearing.","HELD: The appeal was allowed and the adoption application was remitted to a judge of the Family Division. The court found that the appellant had a bona fide intention to appear or be represented and that she made reasonable, although unsuccessful, efforts to do so.

The caveat purported to be based upon a right to receive royalties from all gas, carbon and oil produced from the land. The applicant denied having ever received the notice to lapse. The applicant sought: 1) retroactive reinstatement of the caveat by order of the Court; and 2) an inquiry by the Court as to whether or not the caveat was removed improperly. The respondent companies that acquired an interest in the subject land subsequent to the caveat being removed opposed the application based, among other things, on the principle of indefeasibility of title, as did the Registrar of Land Titles. HELD: The application is dismissed with costs to the respondents. 1) Even if the caveat was removed improperly, the Court ought not to retroactively reinstate it, because to do so would defeat the fundamental principle of indefeasibility of title that has been continued in The Land Titles Act, 2000; and 2) it would not be appropriate to permit the applicants to attempt to access the assurance fund through the mechanism of a chambers application requesting declaratory relief. The process, if the applicants chose to pursue it, would be an action under Part XII of the Act.",HELD: The application was dismissed. The court found that the caveat was wrongfully removed by the Registrar of Land Titles and that it was appropriate to reinstate the caveat retroactively to the date of its removal. The respondents were entitled to declaratory relief.
d_2005skqb454.txt,"The plaintiff sues the defendants for $50,000 plus interest. The claim is based on the allegation that the plaintiff loaned the defendant Kelly $69,000. The plaintiff claims the defendants agreed to repay the loan in the amount of $1,500 per month. HELD: The plaintiff's claim is dismissed. The only evidence that might suggest that this transaction was a loan to either of the defendants was that some of the payments made by the defendant to the plaintiff were in the amount of $1,500, the amount that the plaintiff asserts was the monthly amount to be repaid by the defendant for the loan. However, there was no evidence as to when the agreement to pay $1,500 was made. In her testimony, the plaintiff stated that when the decision was made to pay the $69,000 to the business, she did not have a discussion with the defendant, Kelly. The only discussion she seems to have had was with her husband after which she wrote a cheque to the defendant.","The plaintiff sought damages in the amount of $50,000 plus interest in accordance with the provisions of The Pre-judgment Interest Act. The claim was based on the allegation by the plaintiff that she loaned some $69,000 to the defendant on or about the 30th day of January 2001. The defendants deny that this transaction was loaned to the plaintiff and her then husband, and argue that in fact it was an investment by the defendant and her husband into the auto broking business. HELD: The action was dismissed. 1)There was no evidence of any loan to either of the defendants. The evidence of the plaintiff in cross-examination was that after discussions with her husband, it was felt that they should invest some more money into Kelly's business so that he could buy more vehicles. However, there was no written contracts or other written evidence of an agreement between the plaintiff, the defendant, and/or the numbered company defendant evidencing the nature of the transaction. The only evidence that might suggest a transaction was a loan to the defendants was that some of the payments made by E & M were in excess of $1,500, the amount that the plaintiff asserts was the monthly amount to be repaid by E&M for the loan. 2)The plaintiff's claim that she received a loan was moot. There was no direct payment from the plaintiff or the defendant. 3)There were subsequent transactions between plaintiff and M and at least one transaction where the plaintiff issued a further cheque of $9,000 for the purchase of another vehicle. There is no evidence that any direct payment was made. 4)If the advance was loan, how much is outstanding."

The USA brought a motion to set a date for the extradition hearing. The respondent brought a motion requesting further disclosure and alleged that the USA had not disclosed all of the evidence in its custody or control. HELD: The application for disclosure was dismissed. A date for the extradition hearing was set.,"HELD: The application for detailed disclosure prior to an extradition hearing was granted. The hearing must necessarily result in either committal under s. 29 of the Extradition Act or discharge under ss. 3. The motion was not prepared to award costs to the solicitor as requested by counsel for the Attorney General.  1)The applicant was entitled to disclosure only of materials relied upon by the requesting state to establish its prima facie case. He was not entitled, at the extradition stage, to present his defence on the assumption that a fair hearing would not take place at the trial or in order to avoid trial in the foreign state. 2)The motion on behalf of the applicant was without merit and was dismissed. 3)It is not the business of an extradition judge to assume responsibility for reviewing the actions of foreign officials in preparing the evidence for the extradition hearing."
c_2001skqb39.txt,"The defendants brought an application to compel responses to a large number of questions objected to at examinations for discovery of the proper officer for SPMC, and sought an order requiring SPMC to comply with numerous undertakings. The objections were categorized as the questions sought to elicit the plaintiff's manner of investigation or expert opinions; it should have been asked of another witness better suited to answer or third parties as the questions relate to issues between the defendant and the third parties; it was irrelevant or improper. HELD: 1)The plaintiffs were not required to answer questions which would require them to accept or reject an opinion of another party to the action. 2)The plaintiffs should answer what cellulose fibre insulation was present at the time of the fire. 3)The affidavit answered whether Miner was a participant in the investigation notwithstanding the defendants are not entitled to the names of possible expert witnesses at the discovery stage. 4)Any meeting between the plaintiff's investigators and the fire marshal clearly related to its investigation and is privileged. The defendants could obtain the information directly from the fire marshal. 5)The question of whether there was any liaison between the city fire investigator and SIAST was improper as it relates to the manner of investigation. Questions can be asked of the city. 6)Details of the plaintiff's investigation, including an engineer's report, was protected by litigation privilege. 7)The question regarding what observations were made of the damage was too vague. The plaintiff's claim was in excess of $7 million. A proper foundation must be laid in the context of specific questions and answers given or not given (Hill v. Arcola School Division). The defendants are not entitled to expert opinion. 8)Whether SPMC's insurer's investigation team participated related to manner of investigation and was therefore privileged. 9)The defendant will be able to examine the city in the third party claim with respect to documents from the fire department. 10)All discussions at mediation proceedings are strictly confidential. The name of the plaintiff's expert, who prepared the drawings in contemplation of litigation, is privileged. 11)The facts and observations upon which expert opinions are based must be disclosed including any photographs.  12)Whether any pattern on the wood would indicate contact by propane flame required expert opinion. 13)Questions concerning what material first ignited could only be answered by having experts reconstruct what in their opinion occurred at the time the fire started. 14)If the plaintiffs do not have a position (on whether there was a fire stop in the 1967 construction of the tower), there is no rule the court is aware of requiring them to adopt a position. They can be required to give an undertaking to provide a position if they adopt one at a later date. Whether they believed the building was built in accordance with the 1960 fire code when constructed in 1967 was information obtainable by the defendants. 15)If the party being examined had no control over or greater access to a witness than the examining party, it need only disclose the evidence known to it. There is no obligation to seek information from third parties when the defendants are capable of obtaining that information. 16)An undertaking was given to advise if and when the plaintiffs develop a position on whether the parapet roof was constructed in accordance with the detail set out in FC and whether the detail in the sketch of the Tower parapet was correct. 17)If the request for the proposal related to Kelsey, the document should be produced, but if it only related to the Regina campus, the document was not relevant. 18)Whether it was considered anytime that Hagblom would be a sub-consultant was a legal question. The trial judge will interpret the terms of the agreement. 19)Any information required could be obtained directly from the architects who had been added as third parties by the defendants.  20)The plaintiffs gave undertakings to answer the other questions and did not object to answering them. 21)The 36 objections (less 3 that were withdrawn) failed. It would be an abuse of process for the defendants to ask the same question of a second officer hoping to obtain a different answer. The same question can be put if the first did not answer it. The fact there were three separate officers does not restrict the defendants to only asking certain questions of each. The reason for having three officers, each with a different expertise in a certain area, was to prevent the plaintiffs from having to give endless undertakings. Having all three present during each examination would have saved time and unnecessary legal fees. 22)The exhibit was not before the court to determine how complicated the question was. Defence counsel was to break it down. 23)There were 200 undertakings. As a general rule examinations for discovery should be completed before the party being examined is required to comply with the undertakings. It would lead to endless delay if the examining party were allowed to simply adjourn and demand the undertakings be complied with. There were no exceptional circumstances.  24)Costs were left to the trial judge.","The defendants brought this application to compel responses to a large number of questions that were objected to at examinations for discovery of the proper officers on behalf of Saskatchewan Property Management Corporation (SPMC). They also sought an order requiring SPMC to comply with numerous undertakings. HELD: The questions were asked in relation to the cause and origin of the fire and whether certain documents referred to in the plaintiffs' statement as to documents and for which the plaintiffs claimed privilege were obtained from the City of Saskatoon. The plaintiffs were advised that the plaintiffs were not there when the fire first started. The court granted relief of such a general nature that the meaning of the order was uncertain. The defendants were not entitled to ask for expert opinion. Objection No. 7-P. 273, Line 2 to P. 461, Line 3: The plaintiffs' objection that the question was asking for the names of possible expert witnesses would seem to be borne out by the portion of the plaintiff's comments which were underlined. The plaintiff's objection was that the questions appeared to be asking for an expert opinion on a burn pattern. The question was too vague to answer. In an application of this nature proper foundation must be laid in the context of specific questions asked and answers given or not given (Hill v. Board of Education). The defendants ought to ask specific questions, for example, whether the plaintiffs have any position that the detail outlined in that document is right, wrong or otherwise, and the plaintiffs are entitled to know what was in the wall where the Soprema was being applied not to an expert's interpretation of what was observable, such as what chemical change took place. In any event the defendants will have the opportunity to examine the city in the third party claim. 1) The court was asked what observations the question referred to. There must be some reasonable degree of specificity to the question when reference is made to document. 2) The plaintiff cannot be said to be seeking facts when he asks for this information; he is seeking details of the appellant's investigation. That is exactly the sort of information that litigation privilege is designed to protect. The trial judge will eventually interpret the terms of the agreement."
c_2012skqb426.txt,"The Crown applied under Part XXIV of the Criminal Code to have the accused declared a dangerous offender after he pled guilty to committing an aggravated assault on his common-law spouse contrary to s. 268 of the Code. The application is based on the Code provisions in effect before the danger offender legislation set forth in The Tackling Violent Crime Act was passed. The accused is 52 years old and in poor health. He has a significant criminal record thatreveals a history of violence and an inability to abide by court orders. The offences occurred between the time he was 40 and ended in 2006 with his last conviction, the predicate offence. Two psychologists prepared psychological assessments both of which concluded that the offender should not be declared a dangerous offender because his risk to re-offend could be reasonably managed by supervision in the community. The issues before the Court were: 1) whether the predicate offence is a serious personal injury offence as defined by s. 752 of the Code; 2) whether the offender is a threat of the kind contemplated by s. 753 of the Code and thus a danger to society; 3) if so, whether the Court should exercise its residual discretion an impose a fixed-term sentence or resort to long-term offender provisions, even though the statutory criteria for declaring the accused a dangerous offender have been met; and if a long-term offender designation is warranted, what determinate sentence and long-term supervision order should be imposed? HELD: 1) The Court held that the aggravated assault committed by the offender was a serious personal injury offence because it was an indictable offence involving the use of violence against his spouse. 2) The Court found that the Crown had proven the criteria required that the offender clearly fits within the definition set forth in ss. 753(1)(a)(i) and (ii), in that this offender had shown a repetitive and persistent pattern of aggressive behavior, especially against women. 3) The Court decided to exercise its residual discretion not to designate the offender as a dangerous offender and found that the he met the long-term offender criteria and that his risk to re-offend could be managed within the meaning of s. 753.1(1)(c). The offender has never been imprisoned in a penitentiary and thus had never had the benefit of programming offered in that system. The appropriate sentence should be 7 years. As the offender has spent approximately 3 years and 4 months in pre-sentence custody, the Court gave him credit in that amount on a one-to-one basis. The Court ordered that the appropriate length of time for a long term supervision order is the maximum of 10 years since the offender needs to learn alternative ways to express his frustration and address his issues with alcohol.","The offender pled guilty to committing an aggravated assault on his common-law partner contrary to s.268 of the Criminal Code. The Crown applied under Part XXIV of the Code to have him declared a dangerous offender. The offender is 52 years old and has a significant criminal record. HELD: The Court had jurisdiction to entertain the dangerous offender application because it is both the court which entered the conviction against the offender and is superior court of criminal jurisdiction.  1) The offender has serious health problems. As a result of a congenital heart disease, he required surgery as a child to have a heart valve repaired. In 2008 he had stroke. As consequence, he has left a left-side paresthesia and requires the use of a cane for stability and for walking lengthy distances. He appears to be at an age where his risk to reoffend can be expected to decline rapidly and that, therefore, his risk for re-offend violently will be mitigated only if he conscientiously applies himself to learning alternative ways of venting his anger. 2) There are two additional events that are also germane to the consideration of his criminal history. On January 1, 1995, the offender was charged with common assault. That matter was apparently resolved by having the offender enter into s. 810 recognizance wherein he was required to report to probation officer, have no contact with his wife and attend drug, alcohol and anger management programming. He also had significant negative attitudes and on the basis of this factor, believed he was high risk to commit violent crimes in the future. He was also found to be in denial regarding his potential to abuse alcohol and believed his potential for violent crimes was high. The Court was not at all sanguine regarding the offender's potential for success in such programming given his apparent denial of his culpability and lack of interest in most of the programming he had been ordered to attend."
b_2010skqb187.txt,"The plaintiff granted the defendant a mortgage over a parcel of land just outside the city limits. The defendant failed to make any payment. The plaintiff applied for foreclosure on the land and an order nisi for judicial sale. The defendant was a developer. He argued that the foreclosure action was void because the land was being used as farmland and was subject to protection under s. 9 and 11 of The Saskatchewan Farm Land Security Act. The other issues before the court were the appropriate period of redemption and whether the plaintiff could submit a bid that incorporated the value of the land as a 'credit' enabling the plaintiff to merely 'top up' the bid by the additional amount needed to reach the bid price. HELD: The Saskatchewan Farm Land Security Act (SFSA) did not apply. The undisputed evidence was that since the defendant acquired the land in 2007, their focus was to develop the land as an industrial park and they had undertaken a host of activities to achieve that purpose which clearly indicated that their intent was not to farm the land in the sense contemplated by the SFSA. There was no foundation to deviate from the usual redemption period of 90 days from the date of the decision. The bidding process in a judicial sale contemplates a level playing field for all participants. The fact that the plaintiff is likely to receive a significant cash payout from the judicial sale does not modify the desirability of obliging all bidders to pay into court the full bid price. Normal bidding rules shall apply. The plaintiff was entitled to costs.","HELD: The application was dismissed and the usual bidding rules applied. The Christie case remains the controlling authority such that when applied to this case rejection of the defendants’ submission on the applicability and effect of ss. and 11 of the SFSA must follow. Alberta Ltd. directed to the Land qua farm land which could reasonably bring it within the statutory purpose of theSFSA as considered in Christie, supra, and in particular Part II. Section 2(1)(f) of the Saskatchewan Farm Security Act provides for protection to farmers against loss of their farm land. Section 4 of the Act clearly states that a person can make an application with respect to a mortgage on farm land, but does not include: minerals contained in, on or under that land; land used primarily for the purpose of extracting, processing, storing or transporting minerals; and 'farming' includes livestock raising, poultry raising, dairying, tillage of the soil, bee-keeping, fur farming or any other activity undertaken to produce primary agricultural produce and animals. The plaintiff was not a farmer but rather was a developer and the Land was not farm land but rather a development site. HELD: 1) The Christie decision was dismissed. 2) The court found that the Christie case had no application here as it was decided within the scope of the 1984-85-86 FLSA, now repealed. The SFSA circa 1988-89 is said by them to have replaced, modified or reversed the legislative intention of providing farm land protection. 3) The proposed use of the land was recited in opposition to the application by the plaintiff for an order nisi for judicial sale and for declaration that the proceedings commenced are nullity pursuant to s. 11 of The Farm Land Security Act. 4) There was no evidence that the defendants had any interest in the land at the time the Christie action was brought. 5) The plaintiff had no obligation to pay into court any additional amount needed to attain a bid over the Land value. 6) The defendant was not the person mortgaging the land."
2_2005skqb513.txt,"FIAT: The parties are the parents of a son born April 10, 2003. They are married and the family home is in Connecticut. The respondent mother is a Canadian citizen and has returned to Canada and now resides in Laird, Saskatchewan. The petitioner is an American citizen and continues to reside in Connecticut and brings an application under The International Child Abduction Act for an order directing the child to be returned to Connecticut. HELD: The respondent is directed to return the child to the State of Connecticut by January 8, 2006.  1) The child was born in Canada. He and his mother joined his father in Connecticut one month later in May 2003. In February 2004 the child and his mother returned to Canada for a planned one-month visit. It is clear that the petitioner did not consent to the prolonged absence of the respondent and the child. In about November 2004 the respondent and the child returned to Connecticut and resumed living with the petitioner. Reconciliation was attempted. The respondent and child left in December 2004 and have not returned. The crystallizing moment was in March 2004 when the respondent did not return from her trip to Canada. For the purposes of the Convention, circumstances should be examined to determine habitual residence. At this point the parties had adopted traditional roles. The respondent was at home raising the child and the petitioner was attending his duties in the navy. Through their conduct the parties had evidenced a settled intention to make their home in Connecticut. The respondent chose to unilaterally remove the child from that home. 2) The petitioner had obtained an interim order in February 2005 directing the child to be returned to Connecticut. He also pursued his case in the Superior Court in Connecticut and on October 2005 obtained an order dissolving the marriage, directing the respondent to return the child to Connecticut and granted the petitioner sole custody. The respondent now asks that any order directing her and the child to return should be conditional on the petitioner varying the order he obtained in October 2005, vacating the award of sole custody to the petitioner and replacing it with something in the nature of joint custody. The conditional return order proposed by the respondent is inappropriate. Having determined that an order for return is warranted under the Convention, it does not lie with a Saskatchewan Court to impose a revised starting point for the process of determining custody in Connecticut. This Court's role concludes upon the determination the petitioner has made out a case for an order for return.","FIAT: The parties were the parents of a child born April 10, 2003. They were married and the family home was in Connecticut. The petitioner father brought an application under The International Child Abduction Act, 1996, S.S. 1996, c. I-10.11 (The 'Act'), for an order directing the child to be returned to Connecticut. HELD: The application was granted and the child was returned to the petitioner. The Court found that the petitioner did not consent to the respondent's prolonged absence and that it was appropriate to impose some sort of condition on the petitioner as the petitioner had demonstrated he had a right to custody and therefore met the obligation under Article 12 of the Convention."

The Court of Appeal had ordered the Crown to produce an itemized inventory of the information in its possession to enable the Queen's Bench to review the information the Crown should disclose to the defence. This fiat concerned several documents. The Crown had already disclosed the contents of each of these documents and the only matter remaining in issue was the name of the lawyer who released the information. This arose as a result of the action of a Regina lawyer who had improperly revealed information from two of his divorce clients with respect to the charges against LaPorte et al. The Crown quite properly disclosed these statements which had been conveyed to the investigating officer.

3_2001nssc117.txt,"The plaintiffs were Sergeants in the Town of Bedford Police Department. Following amalgamation and before any collective agreement was concluded, the Chief of the amalgamated force issued a department order declaring that all persons in the position of the plaintiffs would be referred to as a level two Sergeant which created a two-tier structure within the Sergeant rank. The bargaining agent for the union declined to process a grievance on behalf of the plaintiffs and agreed with the two-tiered structure which was eventually incorporated into the collective agreement. After unsuccessfully complaining to the Nova Scotia Police Commission and the Halifax Regional Board of Police Commissioners, the plaintiffs commenced an action alleging that the creation of the two-tiered structure was a violation of the Police Act and adversely affected their employment rights. The intervenor union brought an application to strike the plaintiffs' proceeding on the basis that the court lacked jurisdiction to hear the matter. Application granted; proceeding stayed pending submission to arbitration or any other form of proceeding that is permitted under the statutory enactments applicable; if no application is made to lift the stay within two years, the action will stand dismissed. Where there is a threshold question of whether the dispute is arbitrable, that decision should initially be made, absent very limited exceptions, by an arbitrator and not by the court. It is irrelevant if the plaintiffs have now lost their rights to initiate the arbitration process.","The Halifax Regional Municipality Act, effective as of April 1, 1996, provided for the amalgamation of the city's police forces into the Halifax regional municipality. The plaintiffs were not members of union but were subject to a working agreement established between the city and the plaintiff sergeants. The issues raised by the plaintiffs were the nature of the dispute, the extent to which it was, in substance, addressed by the legislation and the collective agreement; and the capacity of the scheme to afford effective redress. HELD: The Court of Appeal held that it had jurisdiction to deal with the matter of whether the Statement of Claim should be struck out or whether it was an exclusive mechanism for the resolution of the plaintiff's dispute. It held that, in the absence of an arbitration board, there was no evidence any demotion was the result of a disciplinary default. It would appear that the parties did not contemplate demotions except under proceedings taken under the Police Act."
5_1991canlii4241.txt,"The applicant union sought an order of mandamus with certiorari in aid, ordering the defendant Minister to exercise his discretion to appoint an arbitrator to hear a grievance. The Minister had refused on the grounds the union was neither certified nor a party to a voluntary agreement. Granting the application, that the Minister had misdirected himself on a point of law. Quite apart from certification and voluntary recognition, the union could attain bargaining rights pursuant to Part II of the Trade Union Act, which allowed an employer in the construction industry to assign bargaining and negotiating rights to an 'accredited employers' association' such as the Construction Management Labour Bureau Ltd. The Court ordered the Minister to exercise his discretion under s.107(4) of the Act according to law as set out in Part II of the Act and confirmed by the Appeal Division in Boyd &amp; Garland.","This was a matter of major concern in the construction industry. It arose from a decision in Boyd Garland v. International Union of Operating Engineers, which was upheld on appeal. The Minister of Labour and Manpower had taken the position that there were only two methods by which a union could obtain bargaining rights for the employees, namely certification and voluntary recognition. Dismissing the matter, that the Minister was bound by any agreement made on its behalf. HELD: The Court found in accordance with the tests laid out in Morin v. Comite National that a Minister in exercising his powers, conferred upon him by statute, can only be controlled by a prerogative writ which will only issue if he acts unlawfully. Unlawful behavior by the Minister may be stated with sufficient accuracy to warrant an arbitrator."
e_2001skqb128.txt,"The mother had custody of the 12 and year olds under the terms of the January 10, 2000 consent judgment. The father applied to vary child support in November on the basis of his reduced income. HELD: The application was dismissed with costs to the petitioner fixed at $1,000. The onus is on the applicant to provide cogent, independent or objective verification of change of circumstances. This application was brought 10 months after the pre-trial conference. It was of no consequence that someone may come into the home rather than using commercial day care service. There was no change in the father's hours of work or the schedule. The only change was that the mother was no longer available to provide care during Saturday of his access weekends. The mother was not to schedule activities during the father's access periods without his consent and he was to provide 7 days written notice if he chooses not to exercise access during specified times. This was not a variation of the custody/access regime but rather specific directions to provide some predictability for the children.","The parties agreed to vary the child support provisions of the consent judgment, including his contribution to child care expenses as well as access provisions. HELD: The application was dismissed with costs fixed in the amount of $1,000. The court found that the material change in circumstances did not satisfy the Court there had been any material change. The respondent's income was reduced and he was ordered not to schedule activities for the children during the respondent's access periods without the petitioner's consent. The Court found that there had not been any change in the circumstances of the children since the consent judgement."

The plaintiff claims she told the Town Office to shut off her water supply and the failure to do so let to the damages being sustained. HELD: The claim is dismissed. 1) There is no evidence that the plaintiff gave clear instructions to the town to shut off her water. 2) The proximate cause of the damage was turning off the heat and power without ensuring that water line, toilets, and the water tank had been properly drained. 3) The plaintiff sustained no damages herself. She admits she negotiated the sale price of $50,000 with her daughter prior to any damage being sustained to the property. No adjustment had to be made to her daughter thereafter for any 'loss' occasioned. Any claim would have to be made by her daughter not her.","The plaintiff brought an action for water damage sustained to her former residence when frozen pipes burst. Her contention was that she instructed the Town Office to shut off her water supply and the failure to do so led to the damages being sustained. The Town of Martensville disputes that such instructions were given and that, in any event, the cause of the pipes bursting was not as result of the water not being turned off but rather because the plaintiff had the power and heat disconnected. HELD: The action was dismissed. There was no order as to costs. 1)The plaintiff's action cannot succeed for the following reasons: a)The Court cannot find on the evidence that clear instructions are given to the plaintiff to disconnect the water service. To the contrary, the form executed by the plaintiff clearly indicates request for final billing. The evidence demonstrates a misunderstanding at best between what the plaintiff believed she was requesting and what in fact she did instruct. This cannot be construed as negligence in the circumstances by the town nor does the fact that specific forms are now utilized for disconnect purposes elevate the matter on the facts before the Court, to negligence by the Town. 2)The court could not find on either the evidence or the back of the form that clear instruction were given by the defendant to disconnect water. To be sure, there was no signature required or obtained on the form. Neither did Ms. Isaac advise the power was being shut off."

Corrigendum received dated March 19, 2010 and added to fulltext.","The accused entered a guilty plea to committing an assault causing bodily harm on the complainant. He had been employed in the construction industry for 23 years and had been for three months prior to the assault. The complainant had been drinking with his uncle when the assault occurred. He did not work for 3 months following the assault and was unable to work due to a broken arm and hand. He suffered lacerations to his face, head and arms and contusions to his upper arm and upper body. He was sentenced to 18 months imprisonment with a fine of $1,500 plus a $2,500 victim fine surcharge. The victim was to pay a $300 fine and a $500 victim impact surcharge to the court. HELD: The victim impact statement was admissible and the court was to rely on the facts of the offence, the severity of the injuries and the minor criminal record of the accused. The court was of the view that a fine plus a probation order with strict conditions could accomplish the principles of sentencing as outlined in s. 718.

Allowing the appeal and varying the sentence to nine months, that while perjury is a very serious offence, the sentence exceeded the range imposed for offences of this nature.","The appellant was charged with perjury at the preliminary hearing of a co-accused in a break, enter and theft case. He pled guilty to the charge and was sentenced to two years imprisonment. The aggravating factors were that he felt intimidated, that the perjured evidence was not given for his own benefit and that he had no criminal record other than his own conviction for break and enter.

2008skqb146.txt,"FIAT: The parties have three children, Jill born December 1981, Luke born May 1986 and Keegan born November 1989. The respondent states that he has paid child support pursuant to the court order of February 2000 but, when the children reached the age of majority, he reduced the amount of child support payable as the children became independent and moved out on their own. The petitioner takes issue with the respondent's unilateral reduction in child support and submits the children remained children within the meaning of the Divorce Act so long as they were attending university. The parties agree that given the age of the children there has been a change in circumstance sufficient to allow a review of the existing child support order. HELD: 1) The parties agree that Jill, age 26 is no longer a child of the marriage and that Luke, age 21 is not presently a child of the marriage but could once again become a child of the marriage if he attends university in the fall of 2008. The parties also agree Keegan is 18 and remains a child of the marriage by virtue of the fact that he is taking classes at the university. 2) While the respondent asks that he be allowed to pay child support directly to the children, there is nothing in the material filed which would indicate that the petitioner is not providing support to the child in an appropriate fashion. Further, the difficulties that would arise in respect to enforcement of the order if the child support payments were not made directly to the petitioner would mitigate against such a variation.","FIAT: The respondent filed an application for an order varying child support. HELD: The application was granted. 1)The parties agreed that given the age of the children, and the change in the amount of support for the children within the meaning of the Divorce Act, that there has been a change in circumstances sufficient to allow a review of the existing child support order. 2)The respondent's application for variation requested that he be allowed to pay any maintenance payable directly to the petitioner for the purposes of the application. The court found that the amount payable by the respondent was $380 per month plus 33% of s. expenses. Based upon the respondent's 2007 income of $44,781 and Ms. Strueby's 2006 income $90,628, the Guideline amount for the support of Keegan and Luke is $380 for the period of March 2003 to September 2007. 3)The child support arrears owing under the judgment of Justice Dielschneider dated February 28, 2000 were $10,587. It was well-settled that full time attendance in post-secondary education may result in a child over the age a majority qualifying as 'child' within the Meaning of the Act. However, the parties were at odds concerning all three children. The parties were in agreement that Jill, now 26 years of age and on her own, was no longer a child of the marriage. The father sought an order for an orderly payment of the child support orders.  4)The application was adjourned until November 1, 2008 at which time the respondent will be ordered to pay $500 per month for child support as well as an additional sum of $100 for child care expenses and extracurricular activities until such time as the child is no longer eligible to pay child support in an appropriate fashion.  5)The father was to have paid $1,147 per month in child support since August 20, 2007 in respect to the maintenance order of February 28 2000.  6)The mother sought to have her child support ordered in accordance with the Federal Child Support Guidelines. The order was confirmed by the Court of Appeal in Zaba, which set out a number of factors court should consider in determining whether a child attending a post-primary education remains a child within the definition of the Dorce Act."
9_2006skca114.txt,"This is an application for leave to appeal, and leave being granted, an appeal by the Crown from a sentence imposed against a young offender pursuant to the Youth Criminal Justice Act. The respondent pled guilty to a charge of robbery, an offence contrary to s. 344(b) of the Criminal Code. The respondent was sentenced to 90 days secure custody, 45 days community supervision, 1 year probation and a 10 year firearms prohibition. HELD: Appeal allowed orally. The sentence is set aside and a sentence of 12 months closed custody, 6 months community supervision, 1 year probation and a 10 year firearms prohibition was imposed in addition to the 90 days closed custody already served at the time of the appeal.  1) It was clear that the primary concern of the sentencing judge was that, in the wake of the Supreme Court of Canada decision in R. v. B.W.P.; R. v. B.V.N. 2006 SCC 27, a custodial sentence might not be open to him at all. It is the Court's view that the sentencing judge's conclusion that the decision in B.W.P. virtually ruled out custodial sentences for young persons under the Youth Criminal Justice Act was unwarranted. The gist of that decision is that under the Act the principle of general deterrence is not a factor to be taken into account and cannot be used to justify a sentence harsher than the circumstances of the offender and the offence would warrant. Nor is specific deterrence to be considered as a separate factor. 2) It is the Court's view that a long custodial sentence is necessary to accomplish the task of bringing the seriousness of the offence to the respondent's attention, and provide meaningful consequences to reinforce societal values without negatively affecting the respondent's likelihood of rehabilitation.","This was an application for leave to appeal and, leave being granted, an appeal by the Crown from a sentence imposed against a young offender pursuant to the Youth Criminal Justice Act, S.C. 2002, c. 1. The respondent had pled guilty to a charge of robbery, an offence contrary to s. 344(b) of the Criminal Code. The sentence was set aside and a sentence of 12 months closed custody, 6 months community supervision, 1 year probation and a 10 year firearms prohibition was imposed in addition to the 90 days closed custody already served. HELD: The sentence imposed was demonstrably unfit, taking into account the seriousness of the offence, the culpability of the respondent, the criminal history and other circumstances of the offender, and his need for psychological and substance abuse counseling and education. The Crown appealed the sentence, arguing that the sentence was unwarranted. The sentencing judge focused considerable attention on the decision of the Supreme Court of Canada in B.W.P., which he took to indicate that sentence of closed custody must be employed only rarely and in unusual circumstances. There was no suggestion in the decision that deterrence was a factor."
8_2001skca55.txt,"The Crown sought leave to appeal a conditional sentence of 9 months of time served plus 2 years less 1 day, including 3 months on electronic monitoring, and 2 years probation with a 10 year firearm prohibition on each charge to be served concurrently. The sentence was imposed for robbery with threats of violence contrary to s.348(1)(b) and s.334(2) of the Criminal Code which were committed in March 2000 while the accused was on probation. The appellant and co-accused were convicted of breaking and entering a private residence. The accused took $25 from the premises and held the 68 year old victim while the co-accused went to look for a knife after threatening to cut off his fingers. The following day the two accused used threats of violence while robbing a pharmacy and a witness testified the accused yelled to the co-accused to kill the victims. The co-accused who was convicted of assault received 7 years in prison for the robbery concurrent with 5 years for the B &amp; E. The 23 year old aboriginal who had a Grade 3 education had a prior record of 42 criminal convictions including eight violent or weapons related offences. HELD: Leave was granted. The appeal was allowed. The sentence of 4 years in prison on each charge to be served concurrently took into account time served on remand and electronic monitoring. The sentence was demonstrably unfit and fell outside the range of sentences previously imposed. The sentencing judge relied solely on the principle of rehabilitation, essentially ignoring the other sentencing principles including the level of gravity, the principle of deterrence, the need to denounce such acts, the sentence imposed on the co-accused, and the need to protect the public. A sentencing circle was inappropriate given the level of violence, his risk to re-offend, his consistent ignoring or refusal to follow court orders, and the fact that a penitentiary term was called for in such circumstances. He had violated various forms of community release orders including bail and probation 16 times. He had a history of drug and alcohol abuse and had not attended treatment.","The Crown sought leave to appeal the sentence imposed on the respondent after a sentencing circle. After pleading guilty to the offences of robbery and robbery with threats of violence contrary to s.348(1)(b) and 334(2) of the Criminal Code, he was sentenced to nine months time served, plus two years less one day conditional, including three months on electronic monitoring, plus 2 years probation with a ten year firearms prohibition on each charge to be served concurrently. The sentence was demonstrably unfit and falls outside the range of sentences previously imposed by this Court."
4_2005skqb279.txt,"The plaintiff claims damages for injuries sustained when he was punched in the face and knocked unconscious by the defendant. Liability is admitted. The plaintiff applies for summary judgment pursuant to Rule 485 of the Queen's Bench Rules. The parties agree that damages should be assessed on the basis of the affidavit evidence. HELD: 1) The defendant pled guilty to a charge of assault causing bodily harm. He was sentenced to a fine of $1,500, placed on probation for 18 months and ordered to make restitution to the plaintiff for the cost of the dental work in the amount of $3,263.30. 2) The plaintiff suffered serious injuries and significant pain for a number of months after the assault. Extensive dental treatment was required and will be required at some point in the future. The plaintiff has minimal scarring. He is awarded general damages of $12,500. 3) The pleadings and the affidavit evidence do not support a substantial award for aggravated damages. However, the photographs graphically depict the extent to which his appearance was altered. Hurt feelings can reasonably be inferred from the fact that the plaintiff was rendered unconscious on the ground in a crowd of onlookers. These circumstances justify an award of aggravated damages in the sum of $2,000. 4) The plaintiff was awarded special damages in the amount of $1,911.70.","The plaintiff claims damages for injuries sustained in the assault. Liability is admitted and the plaintiff now applies for summary judgment and an assessment of damages pursuant to Rule 485. HELD: The plaintiff was awarded general damages of $12,500, $2,000, and $1,911.70 plus pre-judgment interest pursuant to the Pre-Judgment Interest Act.  1) The court reviewed Queen's Bench Rule 153 (which requires a party to plead specifically any matter, fact or point of law which, if not specifically pleaded, might take the other party by surprise) and reviewed the purposes of that Rule. 2) The Court reviewed the nature and scope of aggravated damages. They too compensate for intangible loss but in particular for hurt feelings caused by the nature of the defendant's conduct. The range of injured feelings will of course vary with the circumstances but it often embraces such emotion as humiliation, indignity, degradation, shame, indignation, and fear of repetition. This can be dealt with by elective surgery (which the plaintiff suffered for a number of months after the assault) or by dental treatment followed by crowns. The plaintiff had some minimal scarring and disfigurement but found that it was not significant. Excluding any component for aggravated damages the court concluded that a fair award for general damages was $13,500. 3) The plaintiff did not plead case for punitive damages by alleging misconduct of the requisite nature, identifying the offending conduct of each of the defendants and asking for exemplary or punitive damages in consequence.  4) Each party contends that the cases relied upon by the other parties involved injuries that were not comparable to those sustained by the plaintiff in this case."
6_2000skqb94.txt,"A jury determined the plaintiff was constructively dismissed from his employment as park superintendent in 1997 and awarded damages for failure to give reasonable notice. The defendant claimed the contract of employment was all inclusive; that the plaintiff exaggerated the amount of time he spent on the job in winter; that the reduced winter hours were not in lieu of overtime pay as he was a manager within the meaning of s.4(2) of the LSA; the doctrine of estoppel or waiver applied as he never claimed a right to holiday pay for 10 years and the employer relied on his not doing so; if the plaintiff is entitled to holiday pay he should only recover back to April 1990 as he is limited by the Limitation of Actions Act; it should not be based on wages plus truck allowance as wages as defined in the LSA does not include allowances for costs. The claim for unpaid holiday pay claimed from April 1988 to October 1997, based on his wages plus one-half his truck expense allowance, was reserved pending a decision by the Court of Appeal as to whether the Court of Queen's Bench has jurisdiction to determine the issue of entitlement to holiday pay. HELD: The claim was dismissed with costs.  1)The Court of Appeal held in Kolodziejski v. Auto Electric Service that the Queens' Bench has jurisdiction to entertain a civil action for non-payment of holiday pay. 2)The plaintiff may rely on s.30(1) of the LSA to establish he is entitled to holidays and on s.33 to establish he entitled to pay in lieu of taking holidays. The onus then shifts to the defendant to prove it complied with some exception in the LSA. Section 75 prevents an employee from waiving his or her entitlement. Whether the plaintiff asserted his right to holiday pay or not, he remained entitled to his annual holidays in accordance with the LSA. 3)The plaintiff can claim for any holiday pay in lieu of time off that he can establish he was entitled to from April 1990 to his termination date. Section 3(1)(f)of the LAA states that a cause of action for recovery of money under a contract, express or implied, must be commenced within 6 years of the date on which the cause arose. 4)The plaintiff clearly indicated that a portion of the truck allowance was made to avoid paying tax. As such it would be contrary to public policy for the Court to appear to endorse the plaintiff's actions by calculating his holiday pay on the basis of his wage and this portion of his truck allowance.  5)The defendant's position that the contract included a component of holiday pay each month was inconsistent with its position that the plaintiff took these days off as holidays during the year. The contract of employment did not include a component of holiday pay in lieu of time off.  6)Failure by the defendant to keep records for the purpose of inspection by the minister does not result in a reverse onus. The onus remains on the plaintiff to establish what holidays he did not take. 7)The plaintiff admitted to taking time away from his duties for personal time and for city business as mayor. The plaintiff was not there in his capacity as superintendent. Section 31(1)(b) indicates that an employee shall be permitted to take holidays in one uninterrupted period. The defendant allowed the plaintiff to take days off in any manner he chose. It was inconsistent that the plaintiff's failure to comply with the notice requirement meant for the benefit of the employer could be used by an employee to disclaim that his days off were holidays. 8)The plaintiff was clearly a manager within the meaning of LSA. Even if he were not a manager, he failed to prove, on a balance of probabilities that he worked overtime hours in excess of the statutory minimum in order to qualify for overtime. Any days off taken by the plaintiff could not be considered taken in lieu of overtime. The days he was away were holidays as defined in s.30 of the LSA. 9)He did not establish he did 3 weeks holidays.","The plaintiff sued for damages from the defendant alleging he was constructively wrongfully dismissed from his employment with the defendant. The plaintiff elected to have the determination of liability and the assessment of damages determined by a civil jury. The jury determined that the plaintiff had been constructively dismissed and awarded the plaintiff $19,200.00. In addition to the claim for damages for failure to give reasonable notice of termination, the plaintiff asserted a claim against the defendant for unpaid holiday pay that he alleged was owing to him at the date of his termination. HELD: The plaintiff can rely on s. 33 of the LSA to establish he is entitled to holiday pay in lieu of time off. The defendant then bears the onus of rebutting the presumption of entitlement in accordance with some exception set out in LSA. The next preliminary issue to be determined is the period for which the plaintiff may make such a claim for holiday pay. The court should not appear to endorse the plaintiff's actions by calculating his holiday pay on the basis of his wage and his truck allowance, as the plaintiff was a'manager' within the meaning of s. 4(2) of the Act. Any holiday pay owing to the plaintiff will be calculated only on the plaintiff’s wage."
b_1995canlii6024.txt,"The accuseds were charged under ss.300 and 301 of the Code with (i)committing and (ii)publishing a defamatory libel against a police officer. They filed a plea of justification as permitted under s.611(1) of the Code. The Crown denied the truth of the plea pursuant to s.611(4) and the matter proceeded to trial. At the opening of their trial the accuseds applied for an order declaring ss.300 and 301 of the Criminal Code to be of no force and effect on the basis that they constituted an unreasonable limitation on their rights and freedoms guaranteed under ss.2, 7 and 11 of the Charter. The Crown admitted that ss.300 and 301 limited an individual's right to freedom of expression as provided by s.2 of the Charter but argued that this infringement was justified under s.1 of the Charter. HELD: Application allowed in part.  1)The onus of justifying the limitation of a right or freedom is on the party seeking to uphold the limitation and the standard of proof is by a preponderance of probability. 2)The standards against which a limit on a right or freedom guaranteed by the Charter can be shown to be reasonable and demonstrably justified are those underlying values and principles essential to a free and democratic society. While the right of free speech is important in our society, it is not unrestricted. 3)In order to justify an infringement of this right, it must be shown that: (i)the impugned legislative provision has an objective of pressing and substantial concern and (ii)there is a proportionality to the legislation in that: (a)the measures must be fair and not arbitrary, carefully designed to achieve the objective in question and rationally connected to the objective; (b)the means should impair freedom of expression as little as possible; (c)there must be a proportionality between the effects of the limiting legislation and the objective. S.300 of the Code meets these tests, and is therefore a reasonable limit on free speech and is valid. 4)Ss.611 and 612 of the Code, which permit a plea of justification do not create a reverse onus on the accused. They are procedural and merely serve to put the Crown on notice as to the accused's defence. The Crown must still prove that the alleged defamatory libel is knowingly false beyond a reasonable doubt. 5)S.301 of the Code makes it an offence to publish a defamatory libel whether or not the accused believes it to be true. S.301 is therefore not a reasonable limit and is invalid. ADDENDUM: The Court ordered that the agreed statement of facts set out at pp. 2 and 3 of the judgment not be published nor broadcast in any manner.","HELD: The Court found that s.300 of the Criminal Code constitutes an unreasonable limitation of one or more of the rights and freedoms guaranteed by s.2(c) and s.11(d) of the Charter. The Court applied for relief under s.309 and 311 of the Code. Both accused plead not guilty to both counts. 1)The impugned legislative provision minimally impair the Charter right to freedom of expression as guaranteed by ss. 2(b). 2)There is proportionality to the legislation in that the measures must be fair and not arbitrary, carefully designed to achieve the objective in question and rationally connected to the objective. 3)The principles of free and democratic society both guarantee the rights in the Charter and, in appropriate circumstances, justify limitations upon those rights. 4)The Court must balance the limitation of s. 300 of the code in the context of the value of the common usage capable of interpretation and an intelligible standard of conduct. 5)To warrant prosecution the accused must be sufficiently serious to require the intervention of the Crown in the public interest. 6)Section 301 of the criminal code is a limit prescribed by law within s.7 of the Criminal Code. Section 298, 299 and 300 constitute a limitation prescribed by statute. The threshold test for the application was met. Section 611 and 612 of the S.300 Code create a reverse onus. The court must be guided by the values of freedom, dignity and respect for the human person."

For the plaintiff, that there is a prima fade duty of care owed by the Department of Transportation to users of highway against reasonably foreseeable hazards, including the falling of trees onto the highway. Further, the defendant had a duty to use a reasonable standard of care in the operation of the hazardous tree removal program. The defendant was negligent in failing to train the inspector properly. The Court referred at length to the Supreme Court of Canada decision in Just v. British Columbia. The defendant's claim against the third parties (owners/occupiers of property on which tree stood) was dismissed.","The plaintiff was injured when a tree fell on his truck while he was driving. The plaintiff's action against the defendants was discontinued. The action was brought against the Attorney General and the defendants as occupiers of the property on which the stump or trunk of the tree was located. The Attorney General did not consent to the discontinuation of the action. HELD: The Court held that in order to establish a duty of care in a particular situation, it is necessary to bring the facts of that situation within those of previous situations in which a duty has been held to exist. It was also necessary to determine whether liability may be imposed upon the respondent.  1)There was no evidence that the tree fell due to DED but from Ganoderma applanatum, a fungus that was common on stumps but rare on the area of wound parasite. 2)The plaintiff as a user of the road was in sufficient proximity to the defendant to come within the purview of that duty of caring. 3)The Attorney General had no training or expertise in trees or tree diseases. He was unable to say that conks of this fungus were present at the time of the accident. 4)The defendant was awarded the sum of $10,000."
d_2009skqb70.txt,"At issue is the amount of Income Replacement Benefits (IRB) payable to the appellant by SGI. The parties agree that the calculation of the IRB as provided by s. 117 of the Act is the annualized sum of $28,889.75. The appellant takes issue with SGI's reduction of the amount determined in accordance with s. 117 of the Act by calculating the appellant's net income in accordance with s. 135 to s. 138 of the Act. HELD: SGI has correctly calculated the appellant's IRB when it made the requisite deductions as set out in s. 137 to find the appellant's net income, and then reduced the net income to 90% to determine his IRB. It would be neither a rational nor fair interpretation to reduce a full-time earner's IRB by 90% and not the other types of earners. It would be neither a rational nor fair interpretation to deduct income tax, employment insurance premiums and Canada Pension contributions from only full-time earners. All earners are subject to these payments being deducted from their income but for their inability to earn an income because of an automobile accident. The further deductions to obtain the non- earner's IRB are in keeping with his earning reality.","The respondent was awarded an amount less than that of the non-earner as defined by the Automobile Accident Insurance Act. The hearing judge found that the income replacement benefit (IRB) for the 181st and subsequent days following an accident should not be less than the IRB calculated for the first 180 days after the accident as determined pursuant to s. 116 of the Act. HELD: The respondent was not entitled to any more costs from SGI. 1)The hearing judge erred in holding that the respondent's IRB for the 180 day period was not to be less or greater than the amount paid by the respondent. The IRB calculation was based on the court's finding of facts and the amount of Canada Pension Plan benefits Montgrand was receiving.  2)SGI was correct in applying Regulation 102 which states that interest payable pursuant to Part VIII is to be calculated in accordance with the legislation [ss.117(4)]. It strives for one's earning reality. Non-earners in the past may well become someone whose employment income, but for the accident, would be more than the 'weighted average' approach used by SGI, but that is too restrictive a definition of the phrase. Section 134 of the act and Regulation 101 contemplate the payment of claimant's solicitor and client costs if the claimant is successful on appeal."

The complainant described certain incidents that amounted to sexual assault when she was under the age of 16. The Respondent had previously been acquitted of charges based on the same allegations in criminal court. The Respondent has abused a child within the meaning of the Act. Although the standard of proof is on the balance of probabilities, it is elevated with the seriousness of the allegations and their implications. However, it is considerably less than proof beyond a reasonable doubt.","This was an application brought by the Agency for a finding that the respondent has abused a child as described in s. 62(a) or (c) of the Children and Family Services Act. It was for the purpose of entry of the respondent's name in the Child Abuse Register.

The Court also held that the accused had not committed a criminal offence.  1)The standard of proof is high, but not as high as the standard for proof in criminal cases, where the proof must be beyond reasonable doubt. 2)The Court adopted the position that the standard is elevated with the seriousness of the allegations and its implications (considerably less than proof beyond a reasonable doubt)."
4_2000canlii2633.txt,"The parties were married for 14 years and separated in 1995, entering into a detailed Separation Agreement in 1998. The two children of the marriage are 16 and 8 years of age. There was a long history of relatively short terms of employment and several moves to take employment. The respondent had a grade 12 education and some university courses but no practical skills or training. For the past 3 years, the respondent had made no reasonable efforts for employment, developed no skills of a practical nature, and derived her income from child support payments and the Child Tax Credit and by incurring debt in excess of $20,000.00 The parties had entered bankruptcy during the course of the marriage and had no assets or savings or pension entitlement at the time of separation or acquired since. The petitioner now earned an annual salary of $115,500.00. The Agreement did not address the level of child support in accordance with the Federal Child Support Guidelines, nor did it provide for practical retaining by the Respondent to facilitate employment. This was an exceptional situation that required some adjustment to the Agreement reached by the parties. The court ordered the establishment of a retraining fund of $6,500.00 with direct payments to whatever institution the Respondent may choose. Limited spousal support was to terminate on the earlier of completion of the retraining allowance or transfer of the balance of the outstanding to the Respondent on September 1st, 2001. An adjustment was also made to account for arrears in child support and child support payments.","The parties entered into a Partial Agreement and Minutes of Settlement to provide for joint care and custody of the children with their primary residence being with their mother and fixing her with the responsibility for their day-to-day care. The parties separated in 1995 and have been married for 14 years. There have been a number of Interim Applications and Interim Orders. The Divorce Judgment will be issued forthwith. HELD: 1)The parties have never had any financial stability in part because they far too readily accessed credit based on future expectations of capacity that have never been realized and they would be wise to cease utilization of credit for short term relief. Doing so in the long run imperils the ability to provide properly for the children.  2)The court was satisfied that all jurisdictional requirements had been met and that there had been a permanent breakdown of the marriage and therefore, a divorce judgment would be issued. The court was not satisfied that arrears, other than those that have already addressed, had been established in the evidence."
5_1993canlii6695.txt,"The plaintiff applied under Queen's Bench Rule 231 to strike the statements of defence of a corporate and individual defendant for failure to attend scheduled examinations despite service of an appointment and payment of conduct money to their solicitor. The defendants had previously been permitted to re-open judgments obtained against them and had filed defences. Prior to that they had consistently failed to attend examinations in aid of execution. Contempt proceedings had been commenced against them but were adjourned sine die at the time the defendants were permitted to defend. The defendants resisted the application on the basis that they were now non-residents and not compellable by an appointment, and that the designated officer of the defendant corporation was no longer an officer. This information had not been communicated to the plaintiff's solicitor who had acted in good faith on information given to him previously by the solicitors for the defendants. The examinations had been scheduled unilaterally because the defendants' solicitor consistently refused or neglected to return phone calls or correspondence from the plaintiff's solicitors. HELD: The judge refused to strike the defences holding that in the circumstances Queen's Bench Rule 231 did not apply. He also held that the defendants, considering their conduct throughout the whole course of the lawsuit, were in contempt and ordered them to attend without conduct money any examinations unilaterally scheduled by the plaintiff failing agreement between counsel as to dates. Costs were fixed at $1,500 in any event of the cause and were ordered to be paid within two weeks.","The plaintiff applied to strike the statement of defence of the corporate defendant, Great Canadian Bingo Corp. The ground is that the designated officer of the corporation failed to appear at an examination for discovery on November 23, 1993. The plaintiff's solicitors had on several occasions telephoned the defendant's solicitor to schedule examinations for discovery and to obtain statements as to documents. None of the solicitors appeared at the scheduled examinations. The defendants' solicitor wrote to the plaintiff's solicitor proposing a range of dates for the examinations, claiming that he was not aware that judgment had been entered against him, or that he would need the 'appropriate conduct money' to proceed with reasonable dispatch through the various stages of the lawsuit until it was eventually determined. The conduct of the defendants and their solicitor clearly indicates that in the same fashion as before the contempt proceedings were adjourned, they have continued to duck and weave, and have effectively stalled all reasonable attempts on the part of the plaintiff to proceed."
1998canlii3382.txt,"The appellant employer and the respondent union are parties to a collective agreement with effect from January 1, 1994 to December 31, 1996. The collective agreement established employee salaries for that period, with annual adjustments on January 1st of each year. Shortly before the agreement was signed, the Public Sector Compensation Act was passed, which rolled back and froze public sector salaries. In a letter to the union, the employer confirmed the wage increases provided for in the agreement would be paid to the employees as a lump sum following the expiration of the legislated wage freeze. After the expiration of the wage freeze, however, the employer refused to pay the lump sum on the grounds that it would contravene the Act. The union sued the employer in the Supreme Court, claiming the lump sum or, in the alternative, damages for negligent misrepresentation. The employer applied to strike the Statement of Claim on the grounds that the union's claims were within the exclusive jurisdiction of an arbitrator. The Chambers judge dismissed the application. The employer appealed. Allowing the appeal and staying the action pending submission to arbitration as provided for in the collective agreement, that the Chambers judge erred in allowing the action to continue. Where there is a doubt about the arbitrability of a dispute, that issue should generally be determined at arbitration. This reflects the central role of arbitration in collective bargaining labour relations, recognizes that arbitration is the forum best suited to conducting the necessary inquiry, and helps ensure that no one, absent sound reasons, will be left with rights but no effective remedy.","The appellant and respondent union entered into a collective agreement in 1994.

HELD: Appeal allowed. 1)There was no determination by an arbitrator of whether the employer's claim was within the exclusive jurisdiction of the Court. 2)There were several factual questions relevant to the issue which could not be explored on an application under Rule 14.25. 3)The Court was not in a position to decide whether the collective agreement was an ancillary document. The action was to be directed to arbitration. 4)The issue of whether a letter of July 22'd, 1994 was an adequate document to determine whether the matter was arbitrable. There were no others to be asserted in Court."
