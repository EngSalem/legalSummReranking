The original mortgage executed by the plaintiff was for $191,000 of which $176,000 was advanced to purchase her condominium and $15,000, eight per cent of the total, was advanced for other purchases. The property sold for $156,000 pursuant to a judicial sale. The sale proceeds were distributed to pay outstanding property taxes, commission, and the principal and interest due under the mortgage in the amount of $141,945 and the net sale proceeds were to be distributed pro rata. As at November 1, 2017, the principal and interest owing on the non-purchase money portion of the mortgage was $21,250. The plaintiff requested judgment for the deficiency in the amount of $9,900 with interest to the date of judgment. It claimed it was entitled to solicitor-client costs and other costs accrued by it under the mortgage. The issue was whether such costs should be subject to the pro rata calculation for the nonpurchase portion of the mortgage, that is, 8 percent of the total costs incurred.  HELD: The application was granted. The court found that the plaintiff was entitled to a deficiency judgment for principal and interest owed under the mortgage in the amount requested. It was also entitled to judgment against the mortgagee for eight percent of the solicitor-client costs, condominium fees and property management charges.","FIAT. The plaintiff applies by notice of application for a deficiency judgment against the defendant, Doreen Pearl Partridge, pertaining to the non-purchase money portion of the outstanding indebtedness to her mortgage. RBC also applies to have its lawyers' costs assessed on solicitor-client basis. HELD: The issue is whether the pro rata distribution of purchase money proceeds and non-Purch money proceeds in any deficiency judgment pursuant to a judicial sale extends to the total outstanding amount of the mortgage.  1) RBC is entitled to solicitor's costs, disbursements and applicable taxes; 2) the condominium fees and property management charges are deductible by s. 8(1) of The Condominium Property Act; 3) the lawyer's costs and other costs accrued by RBC under its mortgage. 4) The court found that RBC was entitled to deficiency judgment for principal and interest owed under the mortgage in the amount requested.  5) The issue was whether such costs should be subject to the pro-rata calculation of the non‑purch money mortgage. The pro-rate calculation is 8% of the average mortgage amount.  6) The amount of solicitor’s costs assessed and to have the judgment for the deficiency amount set is $9,901.23 with interest from November 1, 2017 to the date of judgment at the rate of 2.79 per annum."
e_2016skca29.txt,"HELD: The majority of the court granted leave to appeal and restored the conviction entered by the trial judge. The parties and court agreed that the provisions of s. 34(1) as they read prior to May 2012 were applicable. The issues were determined as follows: 1) the appeal court judge erred by misunderstanding the applicable test and inappropriately focusing on the respondent’s belief. The appeal court judge reviewed cases that led him to focus on the doctrine of mistake of fact, which was not argued by the respondent at trial and were not part of his grounds of appeal; 2) the trial judge accepted some but not all of the expert’s evidence, as he was entitled to do. The trial judge also reinterpreted the video evidence, which was found to be an error by the Court of Appeal. The trial judge considered the factors without weighing the use of force to a nicety. He was determining the objective reasonableness of the force based on the factors; and 3) the appeal court judge properly instructed himself on the standard of review but failed to analyze the decision of the trial judge based on that standard, namely, whether the evidence was reasonably capable of supporting the trial judge’s conclusion based on the evidence as a whole. The dissenting judge would have granted leave to appeal but then would have dismissed the appeal. The dissenting judge of the Court of Appeal found that the appeal court judge erred in his approach but reached the right conclusion that the trial judge erred. The trial judge ignored the fact that the encounter was only three seconds long and he mischaracterized the thrust-kick as extreme force. The respondent had to react quickly. The trial judge also erred in questioning whether the respondent honestly believed he was in danger of harm.","The Crown applied for leave to appeal the decision of the summary conviction appeal court pursuant to s. 839 of the Criminal Code. HELD: Leave was granted, the appeal was allowed and the conviction of Constable Power entered in the Provincial Court was reinstated. 1) The Court reviewed the jurisprudence regarding s. 25(1) and 34(1), and found that the force used by the respondent in the execution of his duty was excessive on an objective basis. His reasons for this decision were that the trial judge misinterpreted the evidence and applied the wrong standard of appellate review. 2) The principles of proportionality were well established and the principles to be applied are fundamentally the same for both provisions. The trial judge properly focussed on the only issue to be decided, i.e., whether the police officer used more force than was necessary to either defend himself or effect the arrest of Mr. Stonechild. He was in extremely poor physical condition and blind in one eye. The accused must have subjectively believed he was in danger of harm and must be justified in using as much force as is necessary for that purpose. He did not err by using the wrong test to determine whether the level of force was reasonable. 3) There are principles set out in our law which govern the use of force for defensive purposes or the exercise of powers of arrest. The law provides for flexible or tolerant approach to the objective measure of whether force is proportionate. 4) The test is whether the application of force is objectively reasonable, having regard to the circumstances and dangers in which the officer found himself or herself is highly relevant. The Court found that in determining whether the amount of force used in the defence of self-defence is reasonable, the jury must have regard to whether the accused's belief is reasonable on the basis of the situation he or herself might be expected to employ. 5) It is common ground that the subjective and objective aspects of the proportional inquiry (Peremptitude) would be more beneficial to the accused than to the Crown."
8_2012skpc79.txt,"The accused's neighbour disliked the accused and alleged that the accused drove his vehicle into hers. The police arrested the accused and found a fob that operated the locks on the doors of the vehicle and the engine hood of the accused's vehicle was warm. The accused was charged with hit and run and impaired driving. HELD: The Court found the accused not guilty of both charges. The Court found that the police breaches of the accused's Charter rights were numerous. The approximate 11 minutes of investigative detention was not an infringement of his rights but the combination of the officers' failing to inform the accused of the reason for his arrest and not giving his rights to counsel without delay, coupled with the illegal search and seizure of the fob and keys were in total breaches serious enough to bring the administration of justice into disrepute. The Court excluded the evidence of the fob and keys which further weakened the circumstantial case against the accused to the extent that the Crown failed to prove the accused was the operator of the motor vehicle.",HELD: The accused was found not guilty of both charges. The court excluded evidence that was obtained in a manner that infringed or denied the accused's right to be free from an unreasonable search and seizure. The exclusion of the evidence of the fob and keys further weakens the circumstantial case against the accused to the extent that the Crown has failed to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused was the operator of the vehicle.
d_2013skqb90.txt,"The appellants appealed a small claims judgment. The judgment had found the appellants liable for damages after the respondent, who had purchased a house from the appellants, discovered that water was entering his basement. When the respondent investigated the source of the water, he removed the interior wall of the basement and discovered that there was a second wall behind the first one. He also discovered that a large chunk of the concrete footing and concrete grade beam were broken and had slid into the space between the interior basement wall. The respondent obtained a professional opinion that suggested that the problem had been there for a significant period of time and that the wooden beam that sat on the concrete grade beam was rotten and would have to be replaced. The respondent was awarded judgment in the amount of the repair. The appellant appealed on the basis that the trial judge should not have considered the respondent's expert's opinion about the age of the defect, that the trial judge had crossed a line in assisting the self-represented plaintiff at the trial and that the trial judge erred in calculating damages. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. The respondent's expert was qualified as an expert concerning foundation repair and had the necessary experience to give expert evidence on the type of structural repair and the need for structural repair. Once qualified as an expert in the area of foundations and structural repair, he could testify on the nature of the foundation's problems, including the wooden beam. The witness was also the person who actually carried out the repair to the foundation and was entitled to give evidence on what he saw and did. The witness was properly qualified by virtue of his years of experience and the trial judge was entitled to accept his evidence as to the state of the foundation and how long it had been in such a state. The trial judge's intervention and comments to the appellant's lawyer at the trial did not go beyond the nature of a legitimate attempt to ensure that all of the evidence regarding the matters at issue was before the Court with sufficient clarity to allow the trial judge to understand it. The cause of action in this case was negligent misrepresentation. The trial judge found that the appellants were aware of the structural defect and had covered it up. The proper measure of damages is the amount of money required to put the plaintiff in the position he would have occupied if the negligent misrepresentation had not been made. In this case, the judge made no palpable or overriding error in calculating damages at the amount it cost to fix the foundation.","This is an appeal from a Small Claims Court judgment dated August 20, 2012. HELD: This appeal is dismissed with costs of the appeal to the respondent. 1) The trial judge erred in failing to weigh necessity and qualification before determining the admissibility of certain opinion evidence tendered on behalf of the Plaintiff. 2) In this case, had the state of the foundation and/or the wooden beam not been covered by the interior wall built by the Richardsons, the defect in the foundation, which included not only rotten and rotten wood beam but also cracks, could have been discovered by his property inspector. However, the trial judge made no palpable and overriding error regarding the calculation of damages and the Court would therefore dismiss this ground of appeal as well. 3) In the classic case of R. v. Mohan, [2007] SCC 33 (CanLII), the Supreme Court referred to the role of an appellate court which would also apply to the appeal before it. 4) There is a strong presumption of impartiality on the part of a trial judge and the law should not carelessly evoke the possibility of bias in a judge, whose authority depends upon that presumption. In the case of Kitzul v. Ungar, 1991 CanLII, [1991] S.C.R. 239, the Court reviewed the law regarding trial unfairness in the civil context. It is clear from the case law that trial judges do not rest mute. They are entitled to seek appropriate clarification and give direction and, in certain cases, disclose tentative conclusions as means of ensuring proper understanding of the case. These questions are to be answered upon an examination of the proceedings as whole."
4_1994canlii4625.txt,"At trial in Provincial Court, the accuseds called no evidence and were convicted. They appealed on the basis that the Crown's evidence was so insufficient that a verdict of guilty was unreasonable or was one which could not reasonably be supported on the evidence. HELD: Appeal dismissed. 1)No medical evidence was necessary to establish that the victim's injuries were caused by an assault, given the photographs admitted into evidence, the evidence of the police officer who was called to the scene of the assault and the evidence of the 7-11 clerk who was first approached by the victim for assistance. 2)Evidence of exclusive opportunity was unnecessary to sustain a conviction where there was other circumstantial evidence pointing to the identity of the accuseds. 3)Although a failure to permit an accused who calls no evidence to argue last in a jury trial might be a good ground of appeal, the failure to be permitted to argue last before a judge alone was merely a procedural error which could be cured under the curative provision contained in S.686(1)(b)(iv) of the Criminal Code.","The Crown and the appellants argued that the evidence adduced by the Crown was insufficient to such a degree that the trial judge's verdict of guilty ought to be found by this Court either unreasonable or one that cannot be supported by the evidence and, on the basis of Yebes v. The Queen, 1987 CanLII 17 (3d) 417 (S.C.C.). HELD: Appeal dismissed. 1)Circumstantial evidence of opportunity was sufficient to support a finding of identity beyond a reasonable doubt. 2)The Court of Appeal did not make a substantive error in law. The procedural point raised was not supported by sufficient evidence to present a substantive defence. 3)The court relied on s. 651(3) of the Code which provides that where no witnesses are examined for an accused, he or his counsel is entitled to address the jury last but otherwise counsel for the prosecution is entitled. It is fair to infer that the victim received his injuries at the spot where the pool of blood was found at the southeast corner of the Enjoy Gardens building and next to the 7-Eleven store where the accused was severely beaten about the face."
c_1993canlii4474.txt,"The parties lived together for 14 years and had three children, aged eight, 13 and 14. The petitioner always worked and eventually became a successful stockbroker. The respondent was employed part-time doing minimum wage jobs and was responsible for the household duties and raising their children. The petitioner's annual income was $50,000 at the time of separation, but escalated to $200,000 in 1992 and was prone to great fluctuation. The respondent was to have custody of the children. She sought spousal and child support and an unequal division of assets. Ordering support and an unequal division of assets. The court extensively reviewed the case of Moge v. Moge (1992), 43 R.F.L.(3d) 345 (S.C.C.) and found that marriage and child care responsibilities hinder a wife's role in the workplace. The court awarded $4500 per month as spousal and child support, plus an additional $500 while the wife retrained. The court considered this an appropriate case for an unequal division of matrimonial assets in the respondent's favour. Finding that the awards were still not sufficient to satisfy the respondent's needs, a lump sum award of $18,000 was ordered. On appeal.","The parties were married for 15 years and had two children. The respondent sought spousal and child support in the amount of $16,868. The parties met at the start of their university education and not long thereafter the respondent became pregnant and they began a period of cohabitation. After three years, they married and resided together until their separation in January 1991. Their first child was born in February 1979 and their other two children were born in September 1985 and September 1985. They planned an education and teaching career in home economics. In 1990, the respondent moved from her apartment residence to a mobile home, rented by the respondent, and began to occupy with the children. During this time, they purchased six units, one of which was a rental property valued at $13,500. They sold the second unit in 1993 and the third unit in 1994. In 1997, they bought a fourth unit, rented a house, and sold it to the respondent for $15,000. In 1998, the parties separated and the respondent sought a lump sum of $7,000 to pay for the purchase of a second unit, which was $51,500 less the previous owner's home equity. The court found that the respondent's needs and means test was not the exclusive basis for determining support under the 1985 Divorce Act. In fact, the Court found that it would be impossible in many situations for the respondent to have the skills or opportunity to enter the work force at the level she would have been able to if she chose to follow her own career goals rather than the marriage, but should not be wholly unrelated to that which she enjoyed prior to the dissolution of the marriage."

He was required to discontinue his studies for failure to meet academic standards for promotion. The applicant appealed his dismissal and was unsuccessful throughout. He applied to the Court for an order of certiorari to quash the decision of the Academic Appeals Committee and the University Bylaws Committee Council and an order reinstating him as a student at the College of Medicine pending resolution of his appeal. HELD: The Court found that the Bylaws Committee Council exceeded its jurisdiction by reviewing the previous decisions made and drawing the conclusion that they were made fairly and properly. The Bylaw Committee determined the merits of the applicant's appeal and determined that it was not necessary to convene a full appeal board. There is nothing in the University policy to suggest that the Bylaws Committee has that power. The Bylaws Committee has exceeded its jurisdiction in this regard and its decision is quashed. The matter is returned to the Bylaws Committee to determine whether the applicant's appeal falls within the policy on student appeals and academic matters. The portion of the application requesting reinstatement of the applicant as a student pending the resolution of his appeal is dismissed. The applicant has a marginal academic record and there are a limited number of placements in the College of Medicine. It does not make sense to displace another student or require the College of Medicine to train a marginal student on a potentially temporary basis.,"The applicant was an undergraduate medical student at the University of Saskatchewan who was required to discontinue his studies for failure to meet academic standards for promotion. He brought this certiorari application to quash a decision of the Academic Appeals Committee of the College of Medicine, and of the University Bylaws Committee of Council. HELD: The application was dismissed. 1) The applicant followed the appeal procedures found in the College and University, but was unsuccessful throughout. 2) A full appeal board was not necessary. There was nothing in the policy to suggest the Committee has such power. There is no need for it to operate as a vetting step and of course no need to establish an appeal board. The Committee has exceeded its jurisdiction in this regard and its decision is quashed. 3) The matter is returned to the appeal board for a decision according to law that is whether the applicant's appeal falls within Part VI of Part VI, the policy on student appeals and academic matters.  4) The Committee seems to misunderstand the purpose of the appeal is to review the previous decisions that were made insofar as they come within the parameters set out in para.1(a) of the policy. It is not appropriate however for the Court to usurp the function of the Committee and review the material to determine if the matter should be remitted to it."
8_1994canlii4691.txt,"The landlord applied for possession of residential premises after his tenants refused to vacate in response to a written notice to vacate. The deputy rentalsman ordered that the landlord should have possession, but also ordered that the last two months rent would abate in order to assist the tenants with their moving costs. The landlord appealed the abatement of rent and a chambers judge reversed the deputy rentalsman. The tenants sought and were granted leave to appeal the chambers judge and this appeal resulted. HELD: Appeal allowed. 1)The chambers judge could only reverse the deputy rentalsman if he exceeded his jurisdiction or erred in law. 2)The deputy rentalsman had jurisdiction to order an abatement of rent pursuant to S.47(4) of the Act. 3)The jurisdiction is a discretionary one. The court will therefore show some deference to a decision of the rentalsman involving this jurisdiction. In this case the deputy rentalsman made no reversible error.","The issues in this case began long before the notice of termination of tenancy (which ultimately prompted this Court's involvement) and stem from a number of complaints made by both the tenants and the landlord. The landlord began leasing his premises to the tenants on August 31, 1994 and the deputy rentalsman released his decision on May 3, 1994 ordering the landlord to remove a stove, replace refrigerator and make appropriate repairs to floor tiles, fence and gate. The deputy rentalsmansman then served the tenants with a notice of the termination of rent. The tenants appealed this decision. Appeal allowed and the decision of the rentalsman restored. There was no order as to costs. The Deputy rentalsman had a discretion to determine those cases where an abatement of rent is appropriate. The differences between the landlord and tenants arose from reasonable complaints by the tenants. Where the application is made to the deputy rentalman, the appellatejurisdiction of the Queen's Bench is restricted to finding an error of law or jurisdiction."
c_1993canlii5621.txt,"The appellant was convicted of sexually touching a young girl who was under the age of 14. He contended the trial judge erred by permitting the complainant to testify behind a screen without first conducting a voir dire and by relying on Crown's submission the girl would be uncomfortable without the screen. As well, he argued the judge improperly permitted the complainant to read a statement given to the police, to refresh her memory during cross-examination. Dismissing the appeal, that the fairness of the trial was in no way impaired by use of the screen, and no miscarriage of justice occurred. The statement was given the complainant by defence counsel, who suggested she read v.  Allegations the trial judge interfered with the trial, thereby creating an impression of unfairness, were also dismissed as being without merit.",The appellant was convicted after a two and a half day trial of sexual touching a young girl under the age of 14 years contrary to s. 151 of the Criminal Code. The first ground of appeal alleged that the trial judge was in error by permitting the complainant to testify behind a screen without first conducting a voir dire and by relying solely upon the representations of Crown counsel to the effect that she would be uncomfortable without a screen. Even if it could be said that the judge had improperly exercised his discretion under s. 482 (2.1) of the Code we cannot say that the fairness of the trial was in any way impaired and would find that no miscarriage of justice occurred.
c_2014skqb284.txt,HELD: The court dismissed both applications. The respondent’s voluntary decision to significantly reduce his income was insufficient grounds to vary his child support application. The court found that there had not been a material change in the circumstances with regard to the petitioner’s application.,"The respondent father has applied to reduce his child support obligation and to extinguish arrears of child support as result of him quitting his job and embarking on an apprenticeship program to become an electrician. The parties have two children who are now eight and nine years of age. The respondent is to have reasonable access on reasonable notice. The petitioner has brought an application to change the custody and access arrangements for the two girls. While it is apparent the respondent is less than an involved father, it does not appear that situation is a new development in the relationship between the parties. HELD: The application to vary child support by the respondent was dismissed. 1) There is substantial case law stating that an unreasonable, self-induced income reduction is insufficient justification for a varying child support order. 2) There has been a material change in circumstances as required to vary the existing order and the respondent's application in this regard is dismissed.  3) The respondent's voluntary decision to significantly reduce his income is found to be insufficient grounds to vary his support obligation. It is apparent he is capable of earning considerably higher income and has taken no steps to test the job market."
6_1994canlii4901.txt,"Dr. Huerto appealed a decision of a Joint Medical Professional Review Committee, pursuant to which he was ordered to repay approximately $384,000.00 to Saskatchewan Health. HELD: Appeal dismissed. 1)The legislation provides for an appeal to the Court of Queen's Bench and for no further appeal. Such an appeal can be taken on the following grounds: (a)the committee exceeded its jurisdiction; (b)it failed to observe the rules of natural justice; (c)it made an error of law; (d)its findings can not be reasonably supported by the evidence which it was entitled to consider. 2) The Court found no error of jurisdiction or failure to observe the rules of natural justice. 3)The Court found no palpable or overriding error in the facts as determined by the Committee based on the evidence.",This was another appeal in a series of cases wherein a medical doctor has been reassessed and ordered to repay hospital billings already received as a result of services provided to patients. The Saskatchewan Medical Care Insurance Act provides that a physician who is aggrieved by an order of the joint medical professional review committee may appeal to a judge of the Court of Queen's Bench. There is no further right of appeal. HELD: The Committee did not commit any palpable and over-riding error and there was evidence to support its decision. There was no breach of natural justice.  1)The Committee exceeded its jurisdiction by basing its decision on irrelevant considerations and thereby abused its discretion and further acted on inadequate materials. 2)There was no factual foundation to support the Committee's findings. 3)It did not abuse its discretion in undertaking the review of Huerto's billing pattern. 4)The committee did not have the discretion vested in it by the legislation in conducting the review and hearing with respect to this matter and did not exceed its jurisdiction.
9_2010skqb122.txt,"FIAT: This is an application for an order pursuant to s. 63(2) of The Personal Property Security Act requiring the respondents or those in possession to deliver to the applicant four pieces of construction equipment. The four pieces of equipment were rented by applicant, Inland, to respondents, Mike Dery Holdings Ltd. and Giants Head Excavating Ltd. pursuant to an equipment rental contract entered into at Penticton, British Columbia, between April 21, 2008 and August 6, 2008. Inland did not register any security interest in the equipment in British Columbia or Saskatchewan until October 20, 2009. In the fall of 2008, the equipment was transported to Saskatchewan by Mike Dery Holdings Ltd. and/or Giants Head. In February of 2009, respondent 101138096 purchased the equipment from Mike Dery Holdings Ltd. and Giants Head for valuable consideration. Searches were completed to establish no registrations against the equipment. In April of 2009, the equipment was leased to Giants Head and a security agreement registered in Saskatchewan on May 5, 2009 listing the equipment as general property but not specifically registering the equipment by serial number. The security agreement was taken by 101138096 to secure the rental payments owed to it under the lease by Giants Head who had possession of the equipment. Mike Dery Holdings Ltd. and Giants Head defaulted under their payments to Inland and Giants Head defaulted in its payments to 101138096. September 18, 2009, 101138096 seized the equipment leaving it in the possession of Giants Head.

As of this date a Personal Property Security registry search in Saskatchewan disclosed no security interest other than that of 101138096 in the equipment. Inland subsequently registered both a British Columbia and Saskatchewan Personal Property registry interest by serial number respecting the equipment and its original agreements of 2008. The issue before the Court is whether Inland by virtue of its Personal Property Security registration by serial number on October 20, 2009 has priority over the interest of 101138096 which registered earlier as general security without serial numbers but who alleges to have taken possession of the equipment and elected to retain the equipment seized in satisfaction of Giants Head's indebtedness October 19, 2009. This occurred one day prior to the registration of the security interest by serial number of Inland. HELD: The application is dismissed with costs to the respondents. The respondent 101138096 had a general security registered and had actual possession of the equipment in early October 2009 which therefore perfected its security while it retained possession. As of October 19, 2009 when 101138096 elected to take the collateral as satisfaction of the debt the only party to whom notice was required was the debtor Giants Head and his notice is in compliance with s. 61(1) and s. 61(3) of the Act. When the applicant completed its registration on October 20, 2009 the collateral was no longer available because of 101138096's election on October 19, 2009. The respondent perfected its security interest in the equipment which is subject to this application by taking possession thereof.

HELD: 1)The respondent's supplementary allowances were taken into consideration in finding a gross salary of $53,000.00 per annum. Due to an injury he was no longer able to work overtime but was working full-time. Should a medical discharge become necessary an application to vary can be brought at that time. 2)The petitioner suffered a substantial economic disadvantage. The frequent moves due to the husband's employment had disrupted the petitioner's employment and university education. However, the court must also take into consideration the economic advantage enjoyed as a result of the marriage including the pension plan of the spouse. 3)If the petitioner did receive the greater share of the household goods it can be attributed to partial compensation for her economic disadvantage. Shares in joint names were divided equally. Other assets were divided equally. 4)Upon the granting of the divorce the petitioner will be disqualified from receiving the pension survivorship benefits. The fair solution was to use the enhanced value of the 'With Survivorship Benefits' column and the date of adjudication was used as the valuation date. The combination method of valuation was used in view of the 15 year marriage and given the economic disadvantage suffered by the petitioner. 5)The parties agreed that child support should be set in accordance with the Federal/Provincial/Territorial guidelines based on the respondent's gross yearly income. $600.00 per month per child was awarded.  6)The court must seek to promote the economic self-sufficiency of each spouse. The petitioner's future plans were realistic. $800 per month until June 1, 2001 was awarded for spousal support.  7)Costs including one-half of the cost of preparing reports and pension valuations were awarded to the petitioner.","The parties agreed on the divorce based on their separation in excess of one year and that Mary be granted custody of the children with reasonable access to John upon reasonable notice. While the liability of the respondent to pay maintenance for the children is not disputed, the parties were not fully agreed as to the quantum of the maintenance and the division of matrimonial property. HELD: 1)The amount of spousal maintenance was to be based on the Federal/Provincial/Territorial guidelines based on John's gross yearly income as determined by the Court. 2)Given the relative income of the parties as well as current income tax implications and the economic disadvantage suffered by Mary, the amount of $600 per month per child to be reasonable and fair. 3)Spousal and child support were to be divided equally between the parties when and if anything was realized on the shares."

3_1999canlii12362.txt,"The appellant appeals his conviction of sexual assault causing bodily harm on the ground the trial judge erred in preventing cross-examination of the complainant. The trial judge prevented the cross-examination of the complainant in relation to a previous allegation she had made relating to this sexual assault. The offence is alleged to have taken place at home of the appellant's brother. The appellant was asked by his brother and sister-in-law to babysit their daughter. The allegation was that the appellant had entered her parent's bedroom where she was sleeping and sexually assaulted her. The appellant, who has no previous record, was convicted of the charge and sentenced to three years imprisonment. The appellant during cross-examination of the complainant attempted to question her regarding a previous allegation regarding the same sexual assault against another person. The trial judge did not permit this line of questioning as he held it pertained to her past sexual history. HELD: Appeal allowed. The failure of the trial judge to allow this cross-examination has prevented the appellant from having a fair trial as he has been denied the opportunity to make full answer and defence. It seems the question that should have been put to the trial judge on this occasion was whether this section was applicable to a situation involving non-consensual sex. The complainant was not being questioned about her consensual sexual activities but rather a previous complainant of a sexual assault. It is understood the intent was to indicate the complainant had implicated someone else as the assailant and after investigation the complaint had not been acted upon. That evidence could have placed in doubt the reliability of the complainant's identification of the person who assaulted her since the room was dark when the assault was alleged to have occurred. The relevance of such a question pertaining to the existence of another complaint made by the complainant in respect of the same assault is obvious. That question has a direct bearing on her credibility.","The appellant was found guilty of having sexually assaulted the complainant contrary to s. 272(c) of the Criminal Code. He appealed the conviction on the ground that the trial judge erroneously interpreted s. 276 of the Code to prevent proper cross-examination of the complainant in relation to a previous allegation she had made relating to this sexual assault. HELD: The appeal was allowed and a new trial ordered. 1)It seems the question that should have been put to the judge on this occasion was whether this section was applicable to a situation involving non-consensual sex. The complainant was not being questioned about her consensual sexual activities but rather about a previous complaint of a sexual assault which was understood the intent was to indicate the complaintant had implicated someone else as the assailant and after investigation the complaint had not been acted upon. 2)The relevance of such a question pertaining to the existence of another complaint made by the complainant was obvious. It does not raise the issue of whether the complainant has 'engaged in sexual activity'. This being so, N.M. should have simply been directed to respond to the question, not so as to permit an assessment of her previous sexual conduct, but to clarify what previous complaint she may have made about this alleged assault. That question had a direct bearing on her credibility."

HELD: Appeal dismissed. Section 228 does not restrict the retroactive payment of pain benefits stemming from injury stemming from this injury within the window window.

6_2001canlii365.txt,"The accused was charged with impaired driving (Criminal Code ss.255(1) and 253(a)) and with operating a motor vehicle while having a blood alcohol concentration exceeding .08 (Criminal Code ss.253(b) and 255(1)). Issues included whether the Court should enter a stay of proceedings and award costs, given the failure of the Crown to produce a standard alcohol solution (SAS); could mouth alcohol have invalidated the roadside screening test; did the arresting officer have reasonable and probable grounds to demand a breath sample; was the accused denied his right to counsel; was the breathalyzer test administered as soon as practicable; was there evidence to the contrary? HELD: The accused was found not guilty on count #2 (exceeding .08). Count #1 (impaired driving) was dismissed during the trial.  1)The court was cognizant of the burden of proof and had reviewed the decision of R. v. Lifchus concerning reasonable doubt. 2)The accused's testimony was rejected as not being credible. 3)The burden lies with the applicant on an application pursuant to ss.7 and 24(1) of the Charter in which the defence alleges the accused's right to make full answer and defence has been infringed. The question remained whether once the defence established it sought the SAS but it was not provided for whatever reason, had it discharged its burden or must it prove the failure to produce the SAS solution could have a meaningful outcome on the trial. 4)The accused's s.7 Charter right to make full answer and defence was infringed by the failure of the Crown to produce a sample of the SAS solution in this case. In light of the Bourget and Kalafut decisions, the Crown has had ample opportunity to establish a system for routinely saving the solution until after a case has been concluded. It would bring the administration of justice into disrepute were the Certificate of Analysis admitted into evidence. It was more appropriate to exclude the Certificate of Analysis than to grant a stay of proceedings.  5)Costs are rarely awarded in criminal proceedings. Given the evidence presented concerning the usefulness of testing a representative SAS ampule had it been produced, the court was not persuaded costs should be awarded. 6)There was no evidence that created a reasonable doubt as to the time that elapsed or that there may have been mouth alcohol which may have invalidated the roadside screening test. Both the subjective and objective tests were met. The arresting officer, who has no reason to believe an accused has consumed alcohol in the last 15 minutes, may administer the roadside screening test without delay, but to do so carries with it a certain risk that there may be subsequently evidence which will invalidate the results (affecting the objective element of the test). Further, the officer has no duty to routinely wait 15 minutes before administering the test nor to ask the accused whether or not alcohol has been consumed in the preceding 15 minutes. However, if there are circumstances which suggest the officer should have waited or inquired about alcohol consumption, this may affect the reasonableness of the officer's belief (the subjective test). 7)There was nothing in the evidence to support the submission that the speedometers need to be checked to support the officer's evidence. The officer was acting in the lawful execution of his duty in stopping the accused's vehicle. While doing so he detected an odour of alcohol on the accused's breath which gave rise to the demand for a roadside screening. 8)The informational component of the right to counsel was satisfied. There was no evidence the accused misunderstood his right nor that he was not given sufficient opportunity to contact counsel. He declined twice, giving a clear and unequivocal waiver. Absent special circumstance, the police cannot be expected to draw information out of the accused. 9)The samples were taken as soon as practicable. It was accepted that there was typically no one available at the detachment in the small community and was sufficient reason to not consider attending there given the proximity of the city. The officer tried the closest detachment but found no one there. It may have been more important to question the judgment of the officer to return to the Saskatoon detachment if the delay had been more significant. On the face of it, the delay of 27 minutes did not seem unreasonable. 10)The statutory presumption applied. There was no evidence to the contrary as the accused's evidence was rejected. The court reviewed R. v. Gibson and considered s.258(1)(c) and (d.1) of the Criminal Code.",The accused was charged with impaired driving and operating a motor vehicle contrary to s.255(b) and s.253(1) of the Criminal Code. The accused had consumed alcohol in a concentration exceeding 80 milligrams in 100 millilitres of blood. The roadside screening was performed and the accused failed the roadside breathalyzer test. The officer made a demand that the accused provide a breath sample for analysis pursuant to s254(3). The accused was not qualified to give expert testimony concerning the absorption and elimination of alcohol as well as the calculation of blood/alcohol concentration and the effect of alcohol on human brain function. The evidence of the police officer was not available at the scene. The Court reviewed the decision of the Chief Justice of Queen's Bench written at the first level of appeal and found that the failure of the Crown to produce the standard alcohol solution as requested by the defence constituted a violation of s.16 of the Charter. HELD: The accused's Charter rights were breached and the only appropriate remedy was stay of proceedings and award costs.  1) The Court was not impressed with the testimony of the accused and rejected it. 2) There was no evidence to the contrary as the accused had not been advised of his right to counsel prior to the request of the defence. 3) It is the Court's practice to wait minutes to insure that there is no mouth alcohol to dissipate before administering the roadside screening. It does not follow that its accuracy is immune from attack. An integral component of any analysis is the solution contained in the ampoules. If the solution is deficient it will produce an inaccurate reading. The only way in which the defence can satisfy itself as to the suitability of the solution and be sure of its truth is to conduct a breath analysis. It is only by having access to the accused that the Court can be assured an opportunity to make full answer and defence.
3_1991canlii4569.txt,"The appellant appealed his conviction for sexual assault using a weapon and his sentence of eight years. The appellant contended that his counsel had failed to call the complainant's boyfriend as a witness even though he was in the courthouse under a defence subpoena. The appellant also raised on appeal the fact that he had lost his right to a jury trial. He had failed to appear at the jury trial scheduled and a bench warrant had been issued. The Crown had then applied for an order that the appellant was no longer entitled to a jury trial and the record showed that his counsel had agreed to forfeit the right to a jury trial. The appellant contended that his counsel and the Crown both advised him he had lost his right by failing to appear and that he was not told that he could avoid losing his right if he had a legitimate excuse for failing to appear. He put forth the excuse of having had no counsel at the time of the trial. Dismissing the appeal, (1) that there was nothing to show that the witness would have given relevant evidence bearing on a decisive issue in the trial and the appellant failed to meet the burden of showing that the evidence, if believed, could reasonably have been expected to affect the result of the trial when considered with all the other evidence; counsel's decision not to call the witness where the witness was hostile and counsel did not know what he would say was not inappropriate, and, the court noted, in the circumstances, seemed to have been the right decision; (2) the excuse of failing to appear because he did not have counsel was not a legitimate excuse within the meaning of s. 598(1)(a) of the Criminal Code; moreover, the appellant only raised this issue in his oral submissions and gave no notice to the Crown respecting this issue nor did he provide any supporting evidence by way of affidavit; it was seen by the Court as another unsupported and unjustified criticism of counsel and the Court concluded that the record showed that the appellant had agreed to forfeit his right to a jury trial; and (3) that an eight year sentence, although at the high end of the scale for sexual assault, was not manifestly excessive, having regard to deterrence, the circumstances of the offence, and the appellant's record which included three minor offences.","The appellant was convicted after trial of assault with a weapon contrary to s.253.2 of the Criminal Code. He applied for leave to appeal against the sentence of 8 years imprisonment and a firearms prohibition order. Dismissing the appeal, that the appellant's evidence would be reasonably capable of belief and in addition, his evidence could reasonably be expected to affect the result of the trial. HELD: Appeal dismissed. 1)The appellant failed to show any reason why this Court should now admit the evidence of the appellant. He was present during the trial under a defence subpoena. 2)There was nothing, either by affidavit evidence or otherwise, to show that he would give relevant evidence bearing on a decisive or potentially decisive issue. 3)The burden on the appellant is to demonstrate that R.B.'s evidence would have a reasonably capable belief and that his evidence, if believed, could reasonably affect the trial when considered together with all the other evidence. 4)The respondent was acquitted of all charges."
b_1995canlii6027.txt,"The accused appealed her conviction on a charge of impaired driving. The grounds of her appeal were that the trial judge erred in determining that she was impaired, and that the trial judge otherwise misconstrued and misapplied the evidence. HELD: Appeal dismissed.  1)Both grounds of appeal raised questions of fact. Findings of fact are not to be reversed on appeal unless it can be established that the trial judge has made some palpable and overriding error which affected her assessment of the facts. 2)The Court's task is not to retry the case or substitute its own decision. A trial judge's findings of fact can only be overturned if they are so clearly wrong as to make the decision unreasonable. 3)The Court was unable to say that an error of that kind was made by the trial judge in this case.","The appellant appeals from the conviction. HELD: The appeal is dismissed. 1)The trial judge made an error in law in determining the degree of impairment by alcohol or drug required before a conviction could be entered. 2)The evidence of impairment was so frail as to leave the trial judge with a reasonable doubt as to impairment, the offence has been made out. 3)The Stellato decision differs with the marked departure standard in that it differs with respect to the standard of proof required for conviction on a charge of impaired driving. The trial judge did not make an error on the evidence or on the weight of the evidence."
4_2009skca44.txt,"The respondent Homeowners sued the respondents Sebastian and the TWC alleging negligence or breach of contract for failing to obtain the coverage for insurance as instructed by the Homeowners. Sebastian and TWC issued a third party claim against the appellant SGI and claimed SGI was negligent or in breach of contract or contributory negligence pursuant to the Contributory Negligence Act for failing to issue a policy of insurance in accordance with the application submitted to SGI by Sebastian on behalf of the Homeowners. The trial judge concluded Sebastian and TWC were negligent and liable for the loss suffered by the Homeowners. Further, the trial judge concluded that the insurer, SGI, owed a duty of care to both Sebastian and TWC and the Homeowners to properly underwrite and deal with the application for insurance. The trial judge concluded SGI contributed equally to the Homeowners' loss by 'their negligent acts' and was responsible to pay 50% of the judgment. The negligence of Sebastian and TWC is not disputed in this appeal. The Homeowners have been paid the amount owed under the judgment and advised they have no interest in the matter and did not participate in the appeal. SGI appeals and submits the trial judge erred in determining that SGI: (a) owed a duty of care to the insureds, Homeowners, and to the broker when it received an application for insurance in 'all the circumstances'; and (b) breached its duty of care. HELD: That portion of the judgment finding that SGI is liable for 50% of the damages payable to the Homeowners is set aside and the Third Party Claim is dismissed. Accordingly, the appeal is allowed with costs to the Appellant. The trial judge correctly placed the duty of care on the intermediary, Sebastian. It is clear the insurer relies on the broker to apply for the coverage in accordance with his clients' (i.e., the insureds') wishes and needs. There was no other evidence before the Court to establish the standard of care, the basis for imposing a duty at law where none has previously existed, or the subsequent breach of that duty by the insurer, SGI, in connection to the application for insurance submitted by Sebastian. The Court concluded there was nothing in this transaction which warrants the creation of a duty of care owed by the insurer to a broker applying for insurance on behalf of his clients.","The appellant prepared a HomePak Application on behalf of the Homeowners for the purpose of obtaining policy of insurance for their home, including coverage for their Swarovski collection with an estimated value of approximately $9,950. The appellant prepared the HomePak application for cancellation of prior home insurance policy issued by SGI, which had been placed by McCallum Hill in 1992. Unknown to the appellant, the appellant had arranged for coverage outside of that which is usually provided for in the policy. SGI issued the standard 'comprehensive perils' home coverage policy with Fine Arts Rider, which contained an exclusion for accidental damage to and breakage of fragile items. HELD: Appeal allowed. 1) The appellant was not aware that SGI extended special coverages as they did under the previous policy. He would have proceeded, over all of the years, on the assumption that the Draders had exactly what they previously had under normal home-pak SGI policy without the special coverage. 2) The trial judge concluded that the appellant was in breach of his duty of care because he failed to properly identify the nature and extent of the homeowners' existing insurance coverage, which he could easily have done by carefully reviewing the support file SF 222. He concluded SGI contributed equally to the loss caused by the appellant's negligent acts and was responsible to pay 50% of the judgment. 3) There is no general duty on the insurer to provide coverage beyond what is understood by, and applied for by the broker. There are no general duties on SGI to the insurer."
8_2010skqb467.txt,"Employees were entitled to wage adjustments under the collective bargaining agreement. The plaintiff union brought an application for an interlocutory injunction requiring the defendant to pay employees who were retiring in 2010 their wage adjustments in the current calendar year. This was an issue because it would affect pensions and retirement dates. In the alternative, the union argued the employer should pay the entitlements before the year end on a 'best approximation' basis or be required to proceed to an expedited arbitration. The defendant brought a motion to strike or dismiss the plaintiff's motion under Queen's Bench Rules 99 and 173 on the basis that the issues raised were terms and conditions of the employment contract and outside the jurisdiction of the Court according to the terms of the collective bargaining agreement. HELD: The defendant's application was dismissed because the Court has residual discretionary jurisdiction to grant relief not available under a statutory arbitration scheme. The plaintiff's application for an injunction was also dismissed. While there may be a serious issue to be tried, the pleadings do not set forth a strong prima facie case. While there might be some irreparable harm to some employees, in general terms the losses can be dealt with through damages. It would be impossible for the defendant to meet a deadline two weeks away because of the complexity of the calculations. It is not appropriate to grant an injunction requiring the defendant to make payment before the end of 2010 and it is not reasonable to make payments based on best approximation. The Court has no jurisdiction to force arbitration on the parties.","HELD: The motion was dismissed. The court found that it was not appropriate to grant an injunction requiring the defendants to make the required retroactive adjustment payments before the end of 2010. The plaintiff union also applied for an interlocutory mandatory injunction. As the current collective bargaining agreement provides for wage adjustments going back to 2008, it requires substantial lump-sum adjustment payments for many of the employees. The plaintiffs had provided abundant evidence that in practical terms the imposition of a deadline less than two weeks from now cannot conceivably be met. The essential character of the issue raised concerns the terms and conditions of employment which, in accordance with the CBA, were beyond the jurisdiction of the court. HELD: 1)The court was without jurisdiction to determine whether the plaintiffs were entitled to mandatory injunctive relief. 2)The Court of Appeal did not have jurisdiction to deal with the issue of retroactive adjustments. 3)It is not appropriate for the court to issue an order requiring the defendant to make retroactive assessment payments. There might be irreparable harm for some employees, an example of which was provided to me in the evidence submitted on behalf of the plaintiffs. In general terms though the losses which, individual employees may incur should easily be covered by damages. 4)The plaintiffs conceded that the court is 'without jurisdiction' to determine the issue. The Court was not obliged to issue the order in the pleadings and evidence before it to meet the applicable test. 5)The plaintiff union's motion to strike and dismiss was dismissed with costs."

The RCMP had to execute a Feeney warrant to locate the complainant in the accused basement. The Crown sought an order declaring the accused a dangerous offender. HELD: The accused was designated a dangerous offender and was sentenced to imprisonment in a penitentiary for an indeterminate period on the conviction pursuant to s. 267(b) of the Criminal Code and received time served on the remaining eight charges. The evidence is conclusive that the offence for which the accused was convicted was a serious personal injury offence. The evidence was conclusive that the accused constitutes a threat to other persons because of his pattern of repetitive behaviour and persistent aggressive behaviour. The accused's First Nation would provide support for the accused but its support system is presently non-existent. The Court rejected the expert opinions recommending a long term offender order as being appropriate.","HELD: The Court found the accused guilty of assault causing bodily harm contrary to s. 266 of the Criminal Code, breach of no contact conditions, obstructing justice by dissuading or attempting to dissuade L.A. from testifying against him, and aggravated assault contrary to ss. 348(1)(b) of the Code. The accused was sentenced to 10 years imprisonment. The Court held that the accused was a dangerous offender because of the serious nature of the offences, the offences which brought about the dangerous offender application, incarceration will generally be the result for both aboriginal and non-aboriginal offenders alike. The court also held that it would be preferable to impose an indeterminate sentence on the accused because the accused had demonstrated a pattern of repetitive behaviours showing failure to restrain his behaviour, and likelihood of causing death or injury to others."

He claimed for pain and suffering, loss of income and loss of earning capacity. Plaintiff was found 60% responsible for injuries and defendant 40% responsible. Damages were assessed as follows: $8,500.00 for general damages, $5,000.00 as damages for loss of income and $1,000.00 for loss of ability to perform household tasks. The dolly cart out of view behind the counter was an 'unusual danger' which the defendant knew or ought to have known of and reasonable care was not used to prevent injury. However, the plaintiff failed to look at the floor as his attention was focused on the door. He assumed nothing had changed in the area from the time he entered the premises a few minutes previously. The plaintiff was in commercial premises and should have taken greater care to observe and avoid anything in his path. The plaintiff suffered an injury which restricted his activities for the first five months, to a lesser extent for the following year and to a very limited extent to the time of trial. There was no evidence to support a claim for diminishment of earning capacity.","The plaintiff injured his knee when he tripped over a 'dolly-cart' while attending at the premises of the defendant, J.D. Irving Limited, doing business under the firm name and style of Kent Building Supplies. HELD: The plaintiff was awarded $5,000.00 by way of general damages.  1)The defendant had not used reasonable care in these circumstances to prevent injury or damage to persons in the position of the plaintiff and to use reasonable care for his own safety. 2)The presence of a 'cart' or a dolly' out of view would also be an 'unusual danger' notwithstanding knowledge of the presence of such dollies within the premises.  3)The plaintiff's knee was swollen with infection and he had to endure considerable pain and discomfort for a substantial period following the accident.  4)The evidence indicated that the physical activities required in the performance of his work necessitated his hiring employees for activities which he normally performed himself. The presence of any number of obstructions on the floor would be obvious to the plaintiff. The defendant's premises were described as commercial warehouse from which building supplies were sold.  5)The realization that some of the loss can be attributed to this accident and recognizing the need to provide fair and reasonable compensation, even where proof of actual amounts may be difficult or impossible, I award the sum of $7,500."

Dismissing the application, that the test in such circumstances is whether the public represented by the reasonably informed person would be satisfied that no use of confidential information would occur. To do so it must be shown that a solicitor client relationship existed. There must not be a danger of the confidential information coming back to haunt the client. The court found that such a relationship did not exist in this instance. In addition, the applicant must demonstrate that the solicitor received information which is relevant to the matter at hand. The court found no such evidence of this possibility. It is no bar to representation by a solicitor that some former partners at a previous firm will be examined for discovery or called to testify.",HELD: The Court found that there was no conflict of interest requiring that a solicitor not be permitted to act for a particular client. There was no evidence of a solicitor-and-client relationship between the parties and the law firm. The Court applied the test'must be such that the public represented by the reasonably informed person would be satisfied that no use of confidential information would occur.'  1)The Court held that the respondent was not a party to any of the proposed actions. 2)The court did not err in answering the question 'Is there a disqualifying conflict?'  3)There was no solicitor and client relationship between respondent and law firm and the parties to the present relationship must be the same. Any confidential information received by respondent or law firm arising from its involvement in the pension plan was received from respondent's client which was P.M.

The law firm did not receive confidential information attributable to solicitor and/or client relationship. 4)A number of former partners of respondent in the Patterson Kitz firm may be witnesses during trial.

9_2002nssc264.txt,"The defendant had a 25 year lease in a shopping centre which provided that the defendant would only use the premises for the purposes of the business of the retail sale of a complete line of food products, as well as general merchandising, as carried out by the rest of the majority of its stores. The defendant proposed to open a pharmacy on the premises. Another tenant in the shopping centre already operated a drug store and their lease provided that no other tenant would operate a drug store in any part of their premises. The other tenant brought an application for a interim injunction against the defendant. The receiver of the shopping centre also brought an application for a declaration that the defendant could not operate a pharmacy on its premises. The defendant objected to the receiver's application on the basis that it involved controverted issues of fact requiring a trial. Application for interim injunction dismissed on the basis that the applicant had not established irreparable harm; the receiver's application could proceed as an application as the potential for a factual dispute was insubstantial; defendant provided with the option of either accepting an adjournment to allow time for further investigation, the conduct of discoveries and the presenting of any further evidence or moving for the court's further consideration.","The defendant applied for a permanent injunction against the defendant on the basis that the disputed questions of fact and law were beyond the scope of a summary proceeding. The defendant opposed the application for an interim injunction on the grounds that the evidence did not establish grounds for a temporary injunction at the required threshold, that the plaintiffs have not established that they will suffer harm not compensable in damages if their claim is right and if interim relief is not given, and that the balance of inconvenience is with Sobeys not its licensee. HELD: The application for interim injunction was dismissed. The court would not automatically engage in a prolonged examination of the merits just because a breach of a negative covenant is alleged. There are occasions for assessing the evidence for the cause of action or defence more closely than there is in Nova Scotia with respect to interim remedies. The plaintiffs rely upon Miller v. Toews and Canada v. LeBlanc for the proposition that the enquiry into irreparable harm is less vigorous or less telling in cases of breach of negative covenants. Unencumbered by the standing issues, the factual complication of the defendant's case is to be assessed simply in light of the lease terms and the conduct which is alleged to be breach of those terms."

HELD: A sentence of 5 years of imprisonment was imposed. The sentence was set aside because it did not comply with the fundamental principle of sentencing that it be proportionate to the gravity of the offence nor achieved the objective of denunciation of crimes of this nature. The manslaughter resulted from a common criminal enterprise, planned in advance, and was expected to be violent. The accused pled guilty, had no criminal record, did not participate in the actual physical beating and stabbing of the victim who died from the wounds or of the other victim; she intervened to stop the beating although only after being satisfied the alleged the drug dealer had nothing to give the robbers.  The accused appeared to be doing well in the prison programs. The sentence of the co-accused who had a record of 40 previous convictions had been increased to the equivalent of more than 10 years imprisonment.","The 18 year old single mother of one child and three months pregnant with a second child pleaded guilty to a charge of manslaughter and was sentenced to 2½ years imprisonment. The Crown sought leave to appeal the sentence on the grounds that it was not proportionate to the gravity of the offence and failed to meet the requirements of the law in respect of deterrence, denunciation and separation. HELD: The sentence imposed by the trial judge was set aside and a sentence of 5 years imprisonment was imposed in lieu of the sentence. 1)The appellant did not participate in the actual physical beating and stabbing of the victims and intervened to stop the beating of the robbers. Nor did the sentence achieve the objective of denunciation of crimes of this nature. The appellant was doing well in all programs in prison. The sentence was increased by this Court to the equivalent of more than ten years. The following factors mandate a lesser sentence for Ms. Thorne: (a) she had no criminal record; (b) she didn't participate in any physical beating, stabbing of Prodanovic and Kulas, and was at large on bail awaiting trial on other charges; (c) she seems to be doing well.  2) she did not volunteer to stop and stop the beatings, albeit only after she seemed satisfied that he had nothing to give the robbers; and (d) she seemed to have completed her program in prison in the fall of 1998."
5_2010nspc18.txt,"The on-site supervisor was convicted of two offences under the Fall Protection and Scaffolding Regulations (failing to ensure a guardrail was installed at the perimeter of the work area and failing to ensure that an intermediate or 'mid' guardrail was installed) after a mason was killed when he fell from scaffolding on the job site. Prior to the mason beginning work for the day and the supervisor temporarily leaving the site, he had told another employee to install a 'mid' guardrail but no such rail was in place when the mason fell. The court found that having decided to use guardrails, the defendant was required to make certain that those guardrails were, in fact, constructed in the manner prescribed in the regulations and to supervise and inspect the scaffolding before work was undertaken, no matter the experience level of his crew. In regard to the first count, what the supervisor thought might be a substitute for part of a proper guardrail system did not comply with the regulations. The defendant will donate $2,000 to the Public Education Trust Fund and make 18 presentations at various venues over the next 18 months; he will appear in court on a specified date to provide a status report on his progress in this regard. This was not a case of reckless disregard or deliberate indifference to the legislated safety measures and the defendant's degree of moral blameworthiness was at the lower end of the continuum as he neither created nor negligently left in place a hidden hazard. Both the actions of another workman and the deceased's own actions had contributed to the fall.","The defendant was found guilty of two breaches of the Fall Protection and Scaffolding Regulations of the Occupational Health and Safety Act. The defendant failed to ensure a guardrail was installed at the perimeter or open side where a person was exposed to a hazard of falling contrary to s. 7(1) and 9(1)(b) of the Act and in both cases, he thereby committed an offence contrary to S. 74. HELD: The defendant was sentenced to a fine of $8,050. The court found that the defendant did not create or negligently leave in place a hidden hazard, which caused the victim to fall off the work platform. He was also found to have made an error in believing that the steel I-beam supporting the roof overhang could substitute as a top-rail in the circumstances of this case. He died as a result of those injuries. The Court found that there was no evidence that the actions of the defendant contributed to the hazard of the victim working at heights without any fall protection measures in place. The sentencing judge must consider the factors of proportionality and parity in determining the appropriate sentence."
b_2018skca65.txt,"HELD: The appeal was allowed and a new trial ordered. In this case, the court found that the judge had not erred in his decisions regarding the first and the third requests for adjournment but had in the second request by failing to provide sufficient reasons for his denial. Amongst many factors it considered, the court found that most importantly, the appellant had not caused his counsel to withdraw for the purpose of delaying trial. It concluded that the error resulted in a miscarriage of justice based upon the appellant’s poor conduct of his own defence and lack of understanding of trial process.","HELD: The appeal was allowed and a new trial ordered. The court found that the judge's refusal to grant an adjournment was based on reasons not well-founded in law and whether the decision affected the accused's right to make full answer and defence or his right to fair trial. In the circumstances of this case, the appeal and the new trial order were granted and the accused was sentenced to 2-and-a-half years in prison. The issues in this appeal were whether the judge had properly weighed the factors or took into account irrelevant factors. The judge's decision to grant the adjournment did not address the issue of whether the accused had suffered a miscarriage of justice."
5_2005nssc172.txt,"The parents applied for leave to apply to terminate a permanent care and custody order respecting their three children. Proposed Notices of Adoption were filed for two of the children after the parents' application was filed but before it was heard. The order had been made due to, inter alia, issues of poor hygiene and nutrition; lack of supervision; domestic disputes; physical risk to the children due to inappropriate discipline; the mother's explosive temper and mental health; the father's anger; lack of insight, desire or inability to improve by the parents; inability to control themselves during access or exercise access meaningfully and an all-consuming anger and preoccupation with the Agency. Since the order was made, the mother was diagnosed with and now receiving medication for bipolar and obsessive compulsive disorders. Application for leave granted; access not ordered at the present time; supplemental affidavits and viva voce evidence were considered given that the parents had only obtained counsel after the application was filed and the nature of the issue at stake; the application could not be arrested simply because the Agency had taken steps to have the children adopted after the application was filed. Some of the factors leading to the permanent care order were being addressed by the parents, although they had not been fully dealt with; the main achievements so far appeared to be an improvement in the parents' relationship, the courses of counselling and parenting instruction they had embarked upon, an expressed willingness by the mother to undertake psychotherapy, the mother's diagnosis and medication and the parents' changed attitude towards cooperation with the Agency; these are significant building blocks on which to anchor intense parental counselling","The applicants applied for leave to terminate an order for permanent care and custody respecting their three children. The applicant had been diagnosed with bipolar disorder and obsessive compulsive disorder. Prior to January 2005 prospective adoptive parents for R and E.C.S. gave notice of proposed adoption. Counsel for the applicants indicated that they intended to proceed with the application for leave rather than the application to terminate. HELD: The application was granted. The Court found that the applicants had not made sufficient progress to justify granting leave to apply to terminate the order. There was no new evidence of parenting courses, marriage counselling, parenting counselling or parenting counselling. The Agency opposed the application. The applicants provided several affidavits, whose content will discuss below."

The defendant did not file affidavit evidence but opposed the application solely on the basis that recent amendments to the Queen's Bench Act precludes reference to minutes of settlement. HELD: The plaintiff was entitled to enter judgment for $15,000 plus costs of this application. A settlement agreement reduced to writing in no way offends the confidentiality required under s.28.1. The plaintiff is entitled to rely on the minutes of settlement and must be permitted to refer to them in his affidavit. Section 28.1 is not meant to apply to this situation. If a party to an action is unable to enforce a concluded settlement, the pre-trial process becomes meaningless. The legislation never intended such a result. There was no suggestion that there was non-disclosure, misrepresentation, duress or fraud in the execution of the minutes of settlement. Nor was it suggested the minutes were unclear or ambiguous. The defendant did not allege the settlement was amended or altered or that the balance of $15,000 does not remain owing.","This is an application by the plaintiff for summary judgment pursuant to Rule 184A(1)(a) and/or s29 of The Queen's Bench Act, 1998, c.

HELD: Section 28.1 is not meant to apply to the situation before me. 1) Once an agreement has been finalized and executed by parties there is no further requirement for such confidentiality with respect to the concluded agreement. If the parties had not reached a settlement agreement any reference to such discussions, admissions, disclosures, concessions, negotiations or evidence arising from anything said in the course of a course of litigation would be lost. 2) There is no suggestion that there was non-disclosure, misrepresentation, duress or fraud in the execution of the minutes of the settlement. 3) There was no suggestion by the defendant that the minutes were unclear or ambiguous. 4) No suggestion that the signatures on the minutes are not those of the parties and their solicitors."
c_2003skqb46.txt,"The Attorney General applied to strike out the plaintiff's claims on the grounds they are statute-barred by virtue of the LAA s.3 and that all the claims except for trespass to person are not exempted by s.3(3.1); by POPA s.2; alternatively, the Court has no jurisdiction over any cause of action relating to intentional torts committed by a Crown servant or employee prior to May 14, 1953; all claims arising from the conduct of two deceased Sisters who died in 1988 and 1993 are barred by the TA and SAA. The plaintiff claimed he was physically assaulted by employees and staff and suffered the loss of his traditional language and culture between 1944 and 1952 while attending the Qu'Appelle Residential School. The AG acknowledged the plaintiff attended the school from 1946 until 1949. The AG in a previous application was granted leave to amend its statement of defence and third party claim to plead and rely upon the Crown Liability and Proceedings Act; Limitations of Actions Act ss.31(d),(h) and (j); Public Officers' Protection Act; Trustee Act s.59, or its predecessor legislation Survival of Actions Act s.10; Crown Liability Act s.3(1)(a) and the Exchequer Court Act s.19. A third party claim against the Oblats alleging they controlled and operated the residential school at all material times, was not relevant on this application. HELD: 1)The claim based on physical assault by the Sisters was struck. The Court has no jurisdiction over any cause of action relating to intentional torts committed by a Crown servant or employee prior to May 14, 1953. The Crown remains immune from claims for trespass, assault and battery committed by servants and officers before the enactment of the Crown Liability Act in 1953 (renamed the Crown Liability and Proceedings Act in 1990), which did not operate retroactively. The LAA s.3(3.1) does not create a cause of action but simply removes statutory time limitation periods barring otherwise existing actions. Before May 14, 1953 the Crown was subject to claims for negligence pursuant to the Exchequer Court Act s.19(c). The Dyson procedure is available in Canada in every jurisdiction except New Brunswick and Nova Scotia. 2)The claim based on negligence is subject to the two year time limitation prescribed by LAA s.3(1)(d) which must calculated having regard to the principles of discoverability. 3)The claims of breach of trust and breach of fiduciary duty are equitable claims subject to the six year time limitation in LAA ss.3(1)(h) which explicitly begins to run from the discovery of the cause of action (PG v. AG Canada). Relevant factual issues are to be dealt with at trial. 4)Even though the claim in trespass is based on acts alleged to have occurred over 50 years ago, it clearly falls within the class of actions contemplated by LAA s.3(3.1)(b)(ii). As such it is also exempted from any limitation period against others liable for the conduct. 5)The argument that the 12 month limitation period in POPA s.2(1)(a) should be applied in priority to the more general provisions of the LAAA was rejected in RJG v. AG Canada. 6)Claims based on direct liability of the Crown for negligence, breach of trust and fiduciary duty are not affected by time limitation periods applicable to the deceased Sister Greyeyes and her estate. The time limitation periods are abrogated by LAA s.3(3.2). Since there is no limitation period barring an action against the Sister or her estate, there can be no provincial limitation period available to the Federal Crown under CLPA s.24. 7)The other claims made directly against the Federal Crown are not affected by limitation periods applicable to Sister Elle or her estate. SAA ss.5 and 10(1),(3) and (4) do not bar the claims against her.  LAA s.3(3.2) abrogates the time limitation in SAA s.10(3)(b).","The Attorney General applies to strike out the plaintiff's claims on the grounds that they are barred by certain statutes or alternatively that the Court has no jurisdiction over any cause of action relating to an alleged intentional tort committed by a Crown servant or employee prior to May 14, 1953. HELD: 1) The plaintiff's claim is based on events said to have occurred over 50 years ago, the two year limitation period must be calculated having regard to the principles of discoverability.  2) The Attorney General's submission that the twelve month limitation period in s. 2(1)(a) of the POPA should be applied in priority to the more general provisions of the LAA. The same argument was rejected in [R.J.G.] v. Attorney General of Canada and Missionary Oblates-Grandin Province.  3) Even if the time limitation period was removed, the claim of breach of trust or breach of fiduciary duty is subject to the six year time limit period. The limitation period explicitly begins to run from the discovery of the cause of the action."
c_1996canlii6986.txt,"A Director was charged with professional misconduct for coercing the resignation of two principals in his school division. The Discipline Committee found the appellant guilty of misrepresenting the school process report involving the first principal and of threatening the other principal that if he did not apply for a transfer and resign the matter would be dealt with at the board table and that 'it could get ugly'. The Executive Committee of LEADS issued a reprimand to be placed on his file for five years and a fine of $2,500. At issue was whether the Discipline Committee erred in its findings of fact and the burden of proof, whether the facts, if true, constituted professional misconduct and whether the penalty imposed was excessive. HELD: Appeal dismissed.  1)The legislation does not appear to call for a change in the traditional approach. The fact that an appellate judge can substitute his or her decision for that of the Discipline Committee or order of an executive does not mean that the appellate court's view of the facts and credibility of witnesses supercedes in any way the role of the Discipline Committee unless it finds there were inappropriate inferences drawn, conclusions reached which were not supported by the evidence, or a misdirection on a point of law. None were found in either case. The Discipline Committee did not err in its interpretation of 'professional misconduct' or its application to the facts.  2)Section 52 of the LEADS Act and s62 of the Medical Profession Act, 1981 are virtually the same except for minor changes in wording and format. The jurisprudence under the Medical Profession Act was applicable to the standard of review in this case. 3)The penalty imposed was not wrong or unjustified. Section 47 of the LEADS Act gives the Executive Committee wide latitude in the nature of punishment that it may impose upon a person found guilty of professional misconduct. The Executive is not bound by the recommendations of the Discipline Committee. They are only guidelines. 4)The Act is silent as to who shall bear costs of providing the documents filed pursuant to s51(2) of the Act. If the legislature had intended the statutorily mandated costs to be costs in the cause it would have said so. LEADS should bear the costs in this case. In any event pursuant to the court's inherent jurisdiction and pursuant to s52 of the Act the costs of providing the materials were to be borne by the respondent. 5)Subject to the above the respondent was entitled to costs of and incidental to the appeal.ADDENDUM to TWL QB96220. The concluding paragraph was amended to read: Subject to what has been stated in the immediately preceding paragraph hereof, the respondent will be entitled to recover its costs of, and incidental to this appeal, from the appellant, to be taxed on Column 3.","This was an appeal pursuant to s. 51 of The League of Educational Administrators, Directors and Superintendents Act from the decisions of the Discipline Committee and Executive Committee of the League. The issues raised by this application may be summarized as follows: 1)Did the Discipline committee err in its application of the burden of proof as set forth in s. 2 and s. 6 of the notice of appeal? 2)Was the penalty imposed by the Executive Committee excessive as alleged in ground number 7 of the Notice of Appeal? 3)The Discipline Committee found the appellant guilty of misrepresenting the school improvement process report involving said principal and of threatening him that if he did not submit his transfer request and resignation from the principalship that the matter would be dealt with at the Board table and that 'it could get ugly'. The penalty imposed was $2,500."

The 32 year old appellant had 32 previous convictions including two armed robberies and seven convictions relating to possession of weapons. HELD: The Crown appeal was allowed and the sentence for each offence was increased to three years imprisonment to be served concurrently. 1)The judge made an error in calculating the time on remand that should have been credited to the sentence. Only six months rather than the whole year should have been counted. 2)Given the appellant's record these offences demanded more than the three year minimum generally imposed.","This was a Crown appeal against two sentences of two years less a day each, to be served concurrently. The sentences were imposed in respect of two convictions for armed robbery. The respondent agreed that the facts of the case were accurately set out in the Crown factum.

He had been on remand the entire time being one year."
c_2012nssc46.txt,"The parties agreed on discovery dates and the order in which witnesses would be discovered. As a result of an honest error, the defendant wasn't able to attend the original dates. The plaintiff became frustrated and concerned about further delays. While the defendant was making good faith efforts to resolve the discovery issues (including whether its witnesses should be excluded from attending discovery of the plaintiff's witnesses), the plaintiff's lawyer issued discovery subpoenas to compel the defendant's witnesses to appear, making the exclusion issue moot. The defendant moved to have the subpoenas dismissed, and sought solicitor and client costs on the motion. The defendant argued the subpoenas were improper and an abuse of process, and accused the plaintiff's lawyer of making unwarranted attacks against the defendant's lawyer in his pre-hearing brief. The motion was heard over approximately one-half day. Motion granted. The plaintiff will pay total costs of $2,550 (plus disbursements) to the defendant, consisting of $1,500 in party and party costs under Tariff C and $1,050 in solicitor and client costs. The tariff amount of $1,000 is increased by $500 to reflect the fact the issuance of the subpoenas was an improper step, albeit one falling short of an abuse of process. It required the defendant to bring this motion to strike. The plaintiff was given a chance to withdraw the subpoenas and chose not to. Solicitor and client costs were warranted especially in light of the defendant's lawyer's language, which was unduly harsh and unnecessarily strong. His allegations added a layer of complexity and seriousness to the case, which caused the defendant to spend extra time preparing a response. Lawyers are officers of the court and the court must encourage them to use courtesy, respect and professionalism.","The defendant brought a motion to dismiss discovery subpoenas issued to the defendant's witnesses. The motion was allowed and the order granted included a direction as to the manner of discovery. The defendant argued that the issuance of the subpoenas was an abuse of process and that the plaintiff's counsel had made unwarranted attacks against its counsel in strong terms. Defendant seeks an award of costs on a solicitor/client basis against the defendant. HELD: The defendant was successful on the motion. Normally the successful party is entitled to costs in the amount of $500 to $1,000 per day. The Court reviewed the circumstances of the motion and found that the delay between July and September for discovery dates was not unreasonable. There was no evidence presented which warranted special consideration as to credibility issues as compared to other cases or situations. The issuance of discovery subpoena (which in effect dictated the order of witnesses) made exclusion a mute issue and the plaintiff did not have any authority for the proposition to exclude the Defendant's representative from the discovery of the Plaintiff's witnesses, on certain conditions. The Plaintiff did not take any position on exclusion of witnesses, as that was not what it was seeking. Further, there was a lack of certainty regarding the application of Rule 18.16 in terms of the order in which witnesses will be examined."
4_2016skqb136.txt,"Family Law – Custody and Access – InterimThe petitioner and the respondent had four children during the course of their marriage. They separated in 2010 and the petitioner applied for interim orders, including arrangements for the parenting of the children. The court made an interim order that the parties would have joint custody with the primary residence of the children to be with the petitioner. The respondent would have access at reasonable times and on every other weekend. The parties reconciled for two years but then separated again. In 2012 the petitioner applied for an order enforcing the 2010 interim custody order. At that application, the court found that both parents were capable of parenting, but in the short term it confirmed terms of the 2010 order. A number of pre-trial conferences were held without resolving matters, and during that time, the parenting arrangements changed substantially. The oldest child began residing with the respondent in December 2014. In December 2015, the second oldest child began residing with the respondent. They stayed with the petitioner on alternate weekends. The applicant then brought this application for an order pursuant to ss. 23(1)(a) and (e) of The Children’s Law Act and pursuant to the 2012 court order, confirming the original interim order that the four children of the marriage have their interim primary residence with her and that the respondent have specified parenting time on one day each week and alternating weekends. The petitioner alleged that the respondent was attempting to influence the two youngest children to reside with him. HELD: The court ordered that the status quo parenting arrangement should remain in place until trial. In this case, the status quo was not the arrangements as they had been in 2010 and in 2012. The court found that the arrangements had evolved since the 2010 order by agreement of the parties and the changes had not occurred because the respondent was attempting to alienate the children from the petitioner.","The parties separated in July 2010. Since then they have had ongoing disputes about a variety of matters including, but not limited to, the parenting of the children, child and spousal support, exclusive possession of the family home and division of family property. There have been variety of applications to the court, court orders and unsuccessful pre-trial settlement conferences. This application raises, once again, the question of a parenting plan for the children. HELD: The application is dismissed. 1)The Court found that the application is not an application for an order under s. 23(1)(a) and (e) of The Children's Law Act and/or the order of Kraus J. of November 22, 20112. 2)The court found that there was no evidence to support the petitioner's belief that the respondent was attempting to 'alienate' the children and that the children were at risk in the meantime. 3)The children have had their interim primary residence with the petitioner for the past 3 and 1/2 years. However, the respondent has engaged in parental alienation. The Court ordered that the interim parenting time be on Wednesdays from 3:20 until 7:00 PM and then alternating weekends from Friday after school to Monday mornings, and one evening every week from Friday until Sunday at 7:30 p.m. It would be inconsistent with the purpose and intention of the foundational Queen's Bench Rules. 4)The interim residence will continue to remain with the respondent for the first half of the school year with the exception of alternating weekends and weekday overnights. The children will have their interim exclusive possession and the household goods contained therein until further order."
3_1993canlii4594.txt,"The appellant was detained after leaving a suspected 'after hours' club which was under surveillance by police. He was charged with a breathalyzer offence, and was convicted. He appealed, arguing his s. 9 Charter rights had been violated. He also contended the evidence of the amount of alcohol he had consumed on the night in question constituted 'evidence to the contrary' which rebutted the presumption in s. 258 of the Criminal Code. Dismissing the appeal, that the police officers were not acting arbitrarily or in a random fashion when they detained the appellant, and had a reasonable basis for stopping his vehicle. The appellant's contention he consumed only two small bottles (1-1/2 ounces each) of rum, plus some cough syrup and mints, did not constitute evidence to the contrary to rebut the presumption of the breathalyzer offence. On Appeal.","The accused was arrested for impaired driving, read a breathalyser demand, and gave him the usual warning. At trial, the accused was convicted of impaired driving. Included in the accused's evidence was his statement that he had had two drinks of rum at another location prior to going to the alleged after hours club. He also advised the court he had taken some mints and cough drops while at the police station and before he took the two breath analyser tests. HELD: The Court found that the arrest was an arbitrary arrest and thus a violation of his rights under s. 9 of the Charter. It was clear that the police officers involved were not acting arbitrarily or in a random fashion. The evidence of the amount the accused had to drink and the effect of the drink on the accused constituted evidence to rebut the presumption of s. 258 of the Criminal Code. In the fact situation before the court, it is clear that they in fact had an articulable cause for stopping the vehicle in question, and the trial judge was not in error in law or in her finding of facts in her decision. The Court also found that in the circumstances the arrest had not been made in good faith and was a deliberate breach of the right to assist in the investigation, the stop should not be regarded as random."

Although the trial judge concluded the appellant rebutted the presumption in s.258(1)(where it is proven that an accused occupies the seat normally occupied by the operator of the vehicle, it is presumed he is in care and control unless he can establish that he did not occupy the seat for the purpose of setting the vehicle in motion), the appellant was found to be in de facto control. HELD: The appeal was dismissed. It was clear from the trial judge's acceptance of the evidence of the two paramedics who had noted the car parked in an unusual place and police officer who came along later, that he rejected the theory advanced by the appellant's counsel. The location of the ignition key was not relevant. The appellant's memory of the events was far from clear given the level of his intoxication. The trial judge was entitled to accept and rely on the evidence of the Crown witnesses.","The appellant appeals his conviction on count two of the Information. HELD: The learned trial judge was entitled to accept and rely on the evidence of the Crown witnesses to support the conviction. The appellant was also entitled to do so. The location of the ignition key was not relevant, given the fact it was located somewhere on the right side of the steering wheel. For example, the appellant was discovered by two ambulance attendants (paramedics) on their way back to Spiritwood when they noted that the vehicle was parked in an unusual place on the 51st Street ramp leading to the provincial highway going north. The learned judge rejected the appellant's counsel's argument that the appellant (notwithstanding that he rebutted the presumption) was nevertheless in de facto control of the vehicle to the point that he performed some acts of 'care and control' beyond a reasonable doubt."
c_2009skca53.txt,"The three respondents pled guilty to three offences: trafficking in cocaine for the benefit of, or at the direction of, or in association with a criminal organization contrary to s. 467.12 of the Criminal Code; conspiring together and with others to traffic in cocaine contrary to s. 5(1) of the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act and s. 465(1)(c) of the Criminal Code; and trafficking in cocaine contrary to s. 5(1) of the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act. On the last two counts, each was sentenced to 1 year less a day to be served in the community on each count, to be served concurrently, plus a 10 year fire arms prohibition. On the first count, each was sentenced to serve 1 year, in the community, consecutive to the sentences for the other counts. They were also subjected to DNA orders and there was an order of forfeiture of a vehicle belonging to a third party. The Crown appealed these sentences on the grounds that the sentencing judge failed to give proper effect to the gravity of these offences. The Court weighed all the evidence and circumstances of the accused, and found the sentencing judge was clearly moved by the personal circumstances of the accused and while they are mitigating and would normally justify a sentence at the low end of the range, it was the Court's view that the sentencing judge gave them undue weight in comparison to the principles of denunciation and general deterrence, which must play a significant role in offences of this nature. The Court further stated the 1 year sentence for the trafficking offence, to be served in the community, was demonstrably unfit given the range of sentences established in other cases of trafficking offences, even after taking into account the mitigating personal circumstances of these offenders. The Court found the sentences must be set aside. The Court found that an appropriate sentence for each of the respondents, taking into account the seriousness of the offences, the personal circumstances of the respondents, and the aggravating nature of the offences pursuant to s. 467.12, would be 18 months, concurrent, for each of the last two counts, and 1 year consecutive for the criminal organization offence, for a total of 30 months imprisonment.

During this period, they worked 12 hours a day and rotated their shifts so that the phone and delivery car were being operated twenty four hours per day, seven days per week. The respondents all graduated from high school without finishing high school. When the charges were laid, they left the city and returned to Edmonton to set up a business in the crack cocaine trade. They were arrested and charged with obstruction for giving false name to the police. The charges were later dropped. The sentences imposed were 18 months concurrent for each count, to be served concurrently, plus a 10 year fire arms prohibition.

An appropriate sentence for each respondent, taking into account the seriousness of the offences, the personal circumstances of the respondents, the aggravating factors, the highly dangerous nature of the substances sold, which included crack cocaine, the fact that their motivation was financial gain, the sentencing judge failed to give proper effect to the gravity of these offences, particularly in light of the volume of trafficking and lengthy period of time over which it had taken place, and the mitigating personal factors of these offenders.  2)The respondents were made subjects to DNA orders and there was an order of forfeiture of a vehicle belonging to a third party."

The son granted an option to purchase to the plaintiff which was exercised and a fee simple title was issued in 1973 subject to encumbrances including caveats protecting the surface leases. There was no reference to the rent charge reserved or excluded by the option agreement. The plaintiff asserted that whatever rights arose from the option agreement were merged in the transfer and effectively disappeared upon the registration of the transfer and the issuance of a new unencumbered title.

Plaintiff's action dismissed with costs. 1)The absence of a caveat protecting the rent charge has had no affect because of the plaintiff's continued ownership of the property.  2)Rarely, if ever, has there been a case where, as here, a purchaser has contracted to obtain the property under an instrument clearly accepting the unregistered equitable interest, then has obtained a fee simple title, then has permitted the unregistered interest to continue unimpeded for 15 years and then, perhaps tiring of the inconvenience of the lease and thinking that the money would be useful, has decided to seek an order of this Court terminating the other interest and directing that it be paid to him. His counsel made no suggestion that the plaintiff had a moral claim, it was purely an attempt to secure by legal means that which he had previously agreed to forego. This is a court of equity as well as a court of law and as such it is repugnant that the court be called upon to vest in an applicant an interest which he has heretofore freely recognized to be the property of another, both before and after receiving his transfer under The Land Titles Act. 3)It was apparent that there was no intention that the rent charge would be merged since it was recognized and allowed to continue for 15 years.","The plaintiff sold his farm to his son in 1968 and retained the right to continue receiving rentals arising from four surface leases he had granted to oil companies in respect to producing oil wells. When his son granted an option to purchase the plaintiff in 1973, the title was encumbered by caveats protecting the surface leases but there was no reference to the rent charge reserved or excluded by the option agreement. HELD: The action was dismissed with costs. 1)It is repugnant that the court be called upon tovest in an applicant an interest which he has heretofore freely recognized to be the property of another, both before and after receiving his transfer under The Land Titles Act.  2)There was no intention that the fee simple title would be merged since it was recognized and allowed to continue in the hands of its holders for a period of about 15 years. 3)The plaintiff was advised that since he had an unencumbered feesimple title he need not recognize the contractual reservation and this action ensued."
d_1995canlii3966.txt,The accused pleaded guilty to a charge of assaulting his 8 year old stepdaughter by slapping her and striking her with a small paddle. The Crown and counsel for the accused agreed that a fine and probation would be appropriate. The trial judge sentenced him to 1 year in prison and 1 year's probation. He appealed his sentence. HELD: Appeal allowed. 1)The force applied was minimal and the child was not injured physically. 2)The sentence imposed would result in the accused losing his employment which would harm his dependents. 3)The Court reduced his sentence to 60 days intermittent.,"The appellant pleaded guilty to the charge of assault contrary to s. 266 of the Criminal Code. He was sentenced to one year imprisonment and one year's probation. The evidence indicated that the assault consisted of cuffing the eight year old stepdaughter rather frequently as a disciplinary measure. The trial judge must have been influenced to substantial degree by the lack of parenting skills displayed by the appellant in the way he mistreated and verbally abused the young girl in a manner which was demeaning and destructive of her self image. HELD: The appeal was allowed and a sentence of 60 days intermittent be substituted for the sentence of 1 year. The probation order was to remain unchanged except to substitute the word 'approved' for'supervised' in the first condition. On Appeal From: QBCNJ 103/94 J.C. Regina Appeal File 6597 Reasons by: The Honourable Chief Justice Bayda and the Honourable Mr. Sherstobitoff WAKELING J.A. The Court of Appeal held that it was appropriate and appropriate that the appellant plead guilty to assault which was not severe and produced no injury. The sentence of one year under these circumstances, even with the record of the appellant, was excessive and the appellant would lose his current employment upon which the family was reliant."
6_1997canlii9876.txt,"The respondent was hired as an account manager by the appellant. She did not reach her planned sales goals during her employment, and became depressed. She took six weeks off work on the advice of her doctor. When she returned from sick leave she was dismissed by the appellant, who had already decided to terminate her employment after concluding that she was not able to handle the job. She claimed damages for mental distress for the sudden and callous manner in which she had been dismissed. The jury awarded the respondent $20,000 in lieu of notice and $60,000 damages for mental distress. The appellant appealed the award for mental distress. Per Hallett, J.A., Roscoe, J.A., concurring, allowing the appeal, that the suddenness and callousness of a dismissal does not constitute conduct that gives rise to an actionable wrong separate and apart from the cause of action for the dismissal without notice. Per Freeman, J.A., dissenting, dismissing the appeal, that a degree of mental distress is always likely to accompany the termination of employment. However, when the employer's conduct aggravates the mental distress beyond the degree which can be remedied by agreement or reasonable notice, a right to further damages arises.","The appellant Healthvision Corporation, which sells computer systems including hardware and software to hospitals and other health care facilities, appealed a jury award of $60,000 damages for mental distress brought by the respondent. The appellant had no history of sales in the Atlantic Provinces and it was expected to take three or four years to develop the territory. The conduct of Healthvision Corp. was high handed and callous. It was found that mental suffering would not have been in the reasonable contemplation of the parties at the time the employment contract was entered into as flowing from the appellant's unjust dismissal. HELD: Appeal allowed. While aggravated damages may be awarded in actions for breach of contract in appropriate cases, this is not case where they should be given."
e_1999skqb268.txt,"The defendant manufactured solarium in Saskatoon which it sold to the plaintiffs in Minnesota. The plaintiffs alleged the solarium was defective, sued and obtained judgment in the Minnesota Court which it now sought to enforce in Saskatchewan. The defendant argued the Minnesota court did not have jurisdiction because at the time the action was commenced he was not 'ordinarily resident' in the state of Minnesota. The defendant was served in Saskatoon with notice of the claim but did not appear or defend the action or surrender to its jurisdiction. HELD: The action was dismissed with costs to be taxed. 1)The defences available to defendant in Saskatchewan where an action is brought to enforce foreign judgment are set out in s.6 of the Foreign Judgments Act. 2)While there may be evidence supporting the conclusion that the defendant was carrying on business in Minnesota, that same evidence does not support the conclusion the defendant was ordinarily resident there. The defendant advertised its business in Minnesota and elsewhere in the United States and employed agents there to sell its product. The logical conclusion was that the address in the city of Minneapolis was a business address. It could be argued that the defendant carried on business in the state of Minnesota but the question was whether the defendant was ordinarily resident in that state. The Foreign Judgments Act reflects real difference in the meaning of 'ordinarily resident' and 'carrying on business'.","The plaintiffs sought to enforce payment by the defendant of judgment for $23,396.03 in US currency awarded them by Carver County District Court in the State of Minnesota. The defendant advertised its business in the state of Minnesota and elsewhere in the United States, and employed agents there to sell its product. HELD: The action was dismissed with costs to be taxed.  1) The court in Minnesota did not have jurisdiction over the defendant because at the time the action was commenced the defendant was not 'ordinarily resident' in the states of Minnesota, and did not appear and surrender to its jurisdiction. 2) Because of the activities of the defendant in Minnesota the logical conclusion, so it seems to me, is that it is a business address.  3) Because the defendant manufactured solarium in Saskatoon, Saskatchewan which it sold to the plaintiffs in Minnesota, the plaintiff obtained the judgment in the Minnesota court which it now seeks to enforce in Saskatchewan."
4_2000canlii3136.txt,"In a trial of liability only, jury found defendants to be entirely responsible for causing motor vehicle accident. Plaintiff was found contributorily negligent and liability was apportioned 57.5% to defendant and 42.5% to plaintiff. Plaintiff suffered significant injuries and plaintiff and spouse applied for interim payment of damages. Application allowed in part; plaintiff awarded $250,000.00 as interim payment; spouse's application denied. Once court is satisfied plaintiff has met threshold requirement of a judgment or admission of liability, it must strive with evidence before it to determine what damages are likely to be recovered by plaintiff and may then order interim payment if it thinks just, within limitation that it not exceed a reasonable proportion of the projected amount. The greater the certainty of the final outcome of liability and the greater the strength of the evidence supporting the damages claim, the higher the proportion of damages that will be advanced. There is nothing which precludes interim payment from being substantial amount in a proper case but court must be cautious to avoid any influence on eventual outcome of damage assessment. Although there had not yet been discovery of plaintiff's doctors or an independent medical exam obtained, the plaintiff's injuries were largely demonstrated by clinically objective medical evidence and there was no evidence of any pre-existing condition. In such circumstances, a substantial sum could be ordered. Neither pre-judgment interest nor costs are to be considered by the court in such an application. The evidence in support of the spouse's application was far too incomplete and had yet to be tested by defendants in discovery. Court could not form opinion on what damages spouse was likely to recover.","The plaintiff, who was seriously injured in a motor vehicle head-on collision, brought an action for the recovery of damages from his employer, Schneider National Carriers Inc. The issues of liability and damages were severed. The issue of liability only was tried before a civil jury on April 3-7, 2000 as result of which it was found that the accident was caused by the negligence of the defendants. With a judicial assessment of damages several months away, the plaintiffs have now brought an application under Civil Procedure Rule 33.01(A)(1) seeking an interim payment of damages. HELD: The court found that $250,000 represents a just amount of interim payment that ought to be made to the plaintiff. Even though this medical evidence has not yet been tested by the defendants, the evidence is not complete enough at this stage for the court to be able to form an opinion as to the likelihood of recovery of either of these heads of damages and it is not appropriate to order that an interim payments be made for her benefit.  1) The evidence to support the validity of this claim is far from complete at this time and that which is before the defendants in further pre-hearing procedures is yet to be tested. However, the assumptions underlying these claims have not yet be tested in the final analysis. 2) The assumption that damages are likely to be recovered by the plaintiff based on the results of the accident is not supported by the evidence before the court. The Court is unable to form a opinion of what damages will recover the plaintiff at a final assessment of the damages and is not able to decide on the probabilities of recovery. 3) There is a high degree of certainty that the plaintiff will recover substantial amount of special damages which are acknowledged to be nearing the $300,000 mark subject, of course, to the reduction for contributory negligence and any set off, cross-claim or counter-claim on which the defendant may be entitled to rely. 4) The defendants did not yet have an opportunity to discover any of Mr. Fowler's physicians or to conduct an independent medical examination or to retain other experts as they see fit. 5) The court is mindful of the fact that the defendants have yet to fully explore the issue of mitigation. The court must exercise some degree of caution to avoid any influence on the eventual outcome."
2003skqb248.txt,"An appeal from conviction and sentence for theft of an electricity generator valued at under $5,000 contrary to Criminal Code s.334(b). On the first appearance in October, 2001, the Crown advised it would proceed by summary conviction. The appellant pled not guilty. Defence argued that, in the absence of evidence to the contrary, it should be inferred that the accused acquiesced or implicitly consented to proceeding by way of summary conviction. Counsel agreed pursuant to s.786(2) to proceed by way of summary conviction and invited the court to treat the agreement as having been in place when the trial began. Both preferred the appeal to be heard in this Court or in the Court of Appeal. The appellant sought to have the conviction set aside on the grounds the verdict was unreasonable and not supported by the evidence; the trial judge failed to properly apply the doctrine of recent possession and did not provide adequate reasons for his decision. HELD: The conviction appeal was dismissed.  1)This Court had jurisdiction to entertain the appeal. The Provincial Court judge had jurisdiction as the trial proceedings did not violate s.786(2). 2)The trial judge did not misconstrue nor misapplied the doctrine of recent possession. The unexplained recent possession of stolen goods standing alone will permit, but not necessarily require, an inference that the possessor was the person who stole the goods. The elements of recent possession must be strictly proven if possession is the only evidence connecting the accused with the theft. Otherwise possession should be considered circumstantial evidence and weighed accordingly. There was no palpable and manifest or overriding error made by the trial judge in weighing the evidence.  3)Criminal Code s.687 appears to permit this Court to set aside the 9 month suspended sentence and to grant a conditional or absolute discharge. However, there was no transcript of the sentencing proceedings except for a few lines. If the transcript is not available, this Court may be reconvened to address the applicability of s.687 and whether it would be appropriate to vacate the sentence and embark on the sentencing process afresh.","This is an appeal from conviction on February 6, 2002 by judge of the Provincial Court sitting at Watrous and from the sentence imposed on March 11, 2002 on the charge of theft where the value of what is alleged to have been stolen does not exceed $5,000. The Crown may in accordance with s. 334 of the Code proceed on indictment or by way of summary conviction. HELD: The appeal is dismissed.  1)There is nothing in the decision that convinces me that the learned trial judge in weighing the evidence misconstrued or misapplied the doctrine of recent possession. 2)The Court is satisfied beyond any reasonable doubt that the accused committed the offence alleged and find him guilty as charged.  3)The appellant argued on the appeal that the question of the jurisdiction of the learned Provincial Court judge to proceed with the trial was not properly addressed.  4)The trial judge did not provide adequate reasons for convicting the appellant. He relied on the case of R. v. Sheppard, 2002 SCC 26 (CanLII), [2002] S.C.R. 869, decision of the Court delivered by Binnie J. in that case the Supreme Court provides detailed guidelines for the triers of fact in criminal cases. The procedural irregularity is not subject to s. 822(7) pertaining to defect to which the accused has not objected."

The father sought a declaration declining jurisdiction, or an order for joint custody. HELD: The children had a real and substantial connection with British Columbia and evidence of their best interests was available there. They were not habitually resident in Saskatchewan and had been here only 3 months. They were not living with their mother with the implied consent or acquiescence of their father. The uncontradicted evidence that the mother never had any intention to return to the matrimonial home was accepted.

Before filing a defence the appellants demanded particulars of the alleged lost profits. The plaintiff refused to provide particulars and the chambers judge dismissed the appellants' application for an order compelling particulars. ,appeal dismissed; the appellants had not challenged the sufficiency of the pleadings; no case was made out that the appellants required the particulars in order to file a proper defence to the action.

Alternatively, the respondent claimed a breach of contract.

An expectation claim which depends upon variable factors (here, factors such as the state of the economy, the price of sand, the cost of excavation) need not be particularized in the pleadings. 2)There are other Rules which can be utilized to discover the underlying details of the damage claim.  3)The appellants were entitled to know the amount of the claim for general damages based upon expected profit from the development of property and/or the excavation of the sand.

d_2000nsca117.txt,"Liability was admitted for a very mild rear end collision. The trial judge found the plaintiff's evidence to be lacking in credibility and found that the collision did not contribute materially to the plaintiff's poor health. It only caused a mild aggravation of her pre-existing and major back problem. The trial judge assessed general damages at $25,000. The plaintiff's costs were reduced on the basis that she refused a formal offer to settle for slightly less than what she was awarded and refused a second offer which was increased before trial to an amount in excess of what she was awarded. The plaintiff appealed and the defendant cross-appealed. Appeal and cross-appeal dismissed. No strong and cogent reasons were advanced to warrant interference with the trial judge's findings on credibility. There was ample evidence to support the conclusion that the accident only caused a mild aggravation of the pre-existing condition and thus no basis upon which court could interfere with that conclusion or adjust upwards general damage assessment. Trial judge applied no wrong principle in exercising discretion to reduce plaintiff's costs. Award of $25,000 was not so far outside range of damages for like cases as to be considered wholly erroneous estimate of damages.","The respondent admitted liability for driving his truck into the back of the appellant's motor vehicle. The trial judge described the accident as a very mild rear end collision. She determined that there was no other reason for the present medical problems but the accident. The appellant cross appeals claiming the trial judge's award of $25,000 as general damages is excessive and should be reduced. Appeal and cross appeal both dismissed without costs as per oral reasons. While recognizing the particular pain and anxiety which the respondent was found to have caused to the appellant and at the same time recognizing that a pre-existing condition was the major cause of his present back problems, she determined that the trial's assessment of general damages at $25000 was so inordinately high that it must be a wholly erroneous estimate of damages. HELD: The appeal was both dismissed and the cross appeal was also dismissed. 1)The trial judge applied no wrong principle in the exercise of her discretion to reduce appellant's costs and this court will not interfere with her assessment of those costs. In our opinion, and in the circumstances of this case, that award cannot be said to be so far outside the range of damages for like cases as to be considered a wholly incorrect estimate.  2)The appeal was dismissed. 3)The appellant was essentially asking this court to set aside the credibility findings against him, to take a different view of the medical evidence than did the judge and, ultimately, to attribute a larger percentage of appellant's present health problems to the accident in question, with correspondingly higher assessment of damages against the respondent."
1999skqb142.txt,"FIAT. The former registered representative of TFPG was terminated for selling unapproved investments in breach of a Shareholder Advisor Agreement which permitted the sale of TFPG's financial products and services only. TFPG sought an interim mandatory injunction requiring the respondent to return all materials and files respecting TFPG's clients, to cease any contact with its clients, and to make no attempt to solicit any current or prospective client. HELD: The respondent was ordered to immediately cease all contact with TFPG clients whose account the respondent, or anyone associated with him, had administered with a view to soliciting or directing a client, affiliate or associate away from TFPG. The restriction would not prevent a client or prospective client from engaging in any business with the respondent nor was he prevented from advertising his services. 1)It was agreed that the respondent should return all of TFPG's files and materials with a right to make and keep a copy.  2)TFPG abandoned the relief sought respecting solicitation of any business of any nature similar to that of TFPG from any TFPG client or prospective client. 3)The agreement merely set out the terms both parties agreed to for valuable consideration. It was not unconscionable nor against public policy. The respondent had warranted that he had an opportunity to seek independent legal advice prior to signing the agreement. The applicant met the test for injunctive relief but the relief as set out in the draft order was too restrictive and denied others freedom of choice as to which party they wished to deal with. 4)A contractual right to injunctive relief is only one factor. The applicant must establish that the right to interlocutory injunction is clear; there is a serious question to be tried and a strong prima facie case; that irreparable harm will result; if there is a doubt as to whether there is an adequate remedy in damages there must be a determination, on a balance of convenience, which party is likely to suffer a greater harm.","FIAT. The plaintiff sought an interim mandatory injunction requiring the defendant to:(i) forthwith deliver up to TFPG, or its authorized representative, all files, documents, statements of account, records, plans, software or other material respecting clients of the applicant;(ii) immediately cease and desist from any and all contact, direct or indirect, with those clients whose accounts were managed or managed by the respondent;(iii) make no attempt, either direct or indirectly, to solicit from any client or prospective client, any business of any nature or kind similar to that done by the applicant. HELD: The order was granted and the relief sought was to issue with the right of the respondent to make and keep copies of the documents turned over. The order did not address the issue of contractual right to have injunctive relief. It was too restrictive and denies other individuals freedom of choice as to which party they wish to deal with on their investments.  1) In order to succeed the applicant must also satisfy the Court that the right to an interlocutory injunction is clear;(2) that there is a serious question to be tried and there is strong prima facie case;(3) that irreparable harm will result in the absence of the injunction;(4) that the respondent continues to refuse to turn over to the applicant its property and client files;(5) that he continues to breach the 'non-solicitation' clause contained in the agreement by carrying on the same business on his own. It is appropriate in this way to give weight to the parties' agreement, but altered circumstances may give to a decree of specific enforcement an effect that had not been anticipated and might be oppressive, and consequently the court, which has to enforce the order, can never relinquish ultimate control of it and responsibility for it.  6) At the outset of the argument the applicant agreed to the relief. This leaves the issues raised in paragraph (ii) of the draft order to be resolved."

When this brother died, his son continued to use the driveway and garden, even after the second property changed hands many times. When the current owners of the second property refused to allow the continued use of their property, the son claimed that his use of the driveway was of right on the basis of expressed reservation or prescription. He argued that his uncle was incompetent when he executed a statutory declaration stating that the use of both the driveway and the garden had been with his express permission. Judgment for the defendants; there was no express reservation of the driveway in the deed to the second property and the plaintiff did not have a prescriptive right to use the driveway. Although the plaintiff and his father had used the driveway in a continuous, uninterrupted and peaceful manner for well in excess of 20 years, the statutory declaration showed that this use had been with the uncle's permission.","This is a dispute about the use of property. The plaintiff wants to continue to garden on the Keel property and use the Borden driveway. By this action he claims that he has the right to do both. HELD: 1) The plaintiff has not shown that the reservation contained in the 1942 Eldard deed to Borden's property is or incorporates the Bordens driveway. There is no expressed reservation shown by the plaintiff herein.  2) There is considerable and convincing evidence that Eldred and Roy Longard in combination used the 'Borden driveway' in a continuous, uninterrupted, open, and peaceful manner for many years (well in excess of 20 years) prior to it being blocked off by the Defendants.

7_2014skpc84.txt,"Criminal Law – Strict LiabilityStatutes – Interpretation – Traffic Safety Act, Section 203(1)Traffic Safety Act – Motor Vehicle Offences – Passing Highway Workers or Equipment The accused was charged with an offence contrary to s. 203(1) of The Traffic Safety Act, driving over 60 km/h passing highway workers or occupied highway equipment within a work zone. The accused was charged as the owner of the vehicle, not necessarily the driver. The offence was the result of a speed monitoring camera and the Act allows the Crown to complete their case without calling any witnesses. The accused testified that he did not speed past any highway workers or equipment. He said that he was following a pilot vehicle when he passed the workers and equipment and only sped up after the pilot vehicle turned around when there were no more workers or equipment. The picture of the accused’s vehicle from the speed monitoring camera did not show any highway workers or equipment. HELD: The person who tested and deployed the speed monitoring camera provided affidavit evidence that the picture was taken within a marked construction area but it did not say that the accused was speeding as he was passing highway workers or occupied highway equipment. Section 203(1) specifies that there is only an offence for travelling at a speed greater than 60 km/h when passing highway workers or operating equipment. The accused was found not guilty.","The accused was charged with the offence of driving faster than 60 kilometres per hour when passing highway workers or occupied highway equipment within a work zone. The offence was driving faster that 60 km/hr. The accused was not charged as the driver of the vehicle but as its registered owner. Section 273 of The Traffic Safety Act makes the registered owner liable for the driver's misconduct when the vehicle is driven by anyone who has the owner's actual or implied consent to do so. HELD: The offence under s. 203(1) of The Traffice Safety Act is a strict liability offence and its documentary evidence proves every element of the offence. The only aspect of the Crown's case that the accused disputes is that he passed highway workers (whether or not they are in a marked construction area) when he was travelling faster then 60 km per hour. No workers or highway equipment can be seen in the photograph of the accused's vehicle. Bradley George Christensen, the person who tested, deployed, and operated the speed monitoring device, testified that on September 5, 2013, he observed the accused driving and that he recorded the vehicle's speed immediately after it passed the workers or equipment, or when it turned around on the highway and returned in the direction it had come, Mr. Dallyn said that he sped up as there weren't any employees or equipment ahead of him. The evidence consisted of the following documents: 1) a speed monitoring camera showing the date and time the photograph was taken, which in this case was 84 kms/hr, 2) affidavits of service confirming service of the Summary Offence Notice, the photograph, and the SGI Motor Vehicle Division certified search.  3) the accused did not ask for an order requiring him to attend for the purpose of cross-examination."

One of the children predeceased the testator and an application was made for an interpretation of the Will. the gift to the deceased child did not lapse; her estate is entitled to it. The general rule that a lapsed gift falls into the residue is expressly subject to any contrary intention appearing in the will; a class gift always expresses such a contrary intention. Where the gift is to a class of close relatives (e.g. to children), if this is a class gift it does not fall under this statutory exception. In such a case, the gift falls to the surviving members of the class. This case satisfied two of the exceptions to the class rule, namely, that the number of beneficiaries was given and that the names of such were given. The gift was not a class gift but rather a separate bequest to each individual child and no contrary intention was discernible in the Will.","This was an application for the interpretation of the Last Will and Testament of the Testator and specifically to determine the entitlement of the Estate of Jane Mitchell under the Will pursuant to s. 31 of the Wills Act. HELD: 1) The testator intended to make a separate bequest to each individual child rather than make the gift personae designatae rather than a class gift.  2) Clause 11 does describe a contrary intention. In that clause, J.D. underlined the words'solely and absolutely'. The Court must be careful in determining what is relevant to be considered if it becomes necessary to put itself into the 'armchair' of the testator.  3) There is no need to resort to the rules of construction and assess the words of the Will in light of the surrounding circumstances. The intention is clear from the Will. Where the gift is to a class of close relatives, e.g. to whom this is a 'class gift' it does not fall under this statutory exception. 4) Jane's estate is entitled to her share just as if she had died 'immediately after' her father."

The plaintiff brought an action against the car's owner, Vernon Henry, and the Henrys for his $500 deductible and counterclaim for the same. The counterclaim succeeded against the plaintiff in the amount of $50.00 and $350.00, respectively.

HELD: The appeal is dismissed. The trial judge was not required to accept the entirety of the witness's testimony, despite having accepted most of it, particularly in light of the contradictory evidence of the respondent denying the sum claimed by the appellant.

The defendant's bank loans fell into default after SGI disability benefits were terminated. The Bank reported the particulars of the loan defaults to a credit reporting agency (Equifax). The defendant declined to give an assignment of any accident injury settlement he might receive from SGI and requested the bank direct Equifax to eliminate any references to his default or delinquency upon the bank loans. The bank offered to put an explanatory note on their credit report confirming the arrears were the result of the defendant's automobile accident and that he had undertaken to pay the bank from the proceeds of the accident settlement. The bank commenced this action for payment. The Compains sought general, punitive, exemplary and aggravated damages in a counterclaim for breach of the bank's duty of good faith, duty of confidentiality and breach of contract. HELD: The counterclaims were dismissed with taxed costs to the bank for both the claim and counterclaims. The bank's claim was admitted at trial. 1)Compain expressly waived any contractual rights which he had to confidentiality of his credit information by the provisions of paragraph 8 of the Personal Credit Line Agreement. The principles outlined by the English Court of appeal in Tournier enumerated four exceptions to a bank's confidentiality obligation to its customers. 2)The analogy between the insurance cases and a bank and borrowing customer was not complete or appropriate. Assuming, without deciding, that banks do have a duty of good faith and fair dealing towards their customers, the bank did not breach such duties in their dealings in this case. 3)The characterization of the accounts as collection accounts was fair, reasonable and accurate in the circumstances and were not out of the normal course of business.","The plaintiff banked with the defendant, Royal Bank of Canada, and at the time of the accident the Compain's were indebted to the Royal Bank under Royal Bank Credit Line and Visa credit card account (the ""Bank Loans""). The Royal Bank agreed to defer commencement of any action with respect to the defaulted Bank Loans until such time as Mr. Compain received an accident injury settlement from SGI. HELD: The plaintiff Royal Bank's claim against the defendant was dismissed in total. 1) There was no evidence lead to suggest that the characterization of the loans, as they appeared in the Equifax reports, were out of the normal course of business.  2) The characterization of these loans was fair, reasonable and accurate in the circumstances. 3) It is fair and reasonable inference to be drawn, from all of the facts and circumstances, that persons using and relying upon Equifax statements would be familiar with the various codes and classifications used to generate the credit report."
2_2011skpc5.txt,"The accused was charged with impaired driving and driving over. 08. The sole issue to be determined was whether the accused was the person operating the vehicle at the time of the stop. The police testified that they had walked through the bar before closing time and then returned to the bar at closing time. The evidence was that the accused had been seen playing drinking games in the bar. The police observed the people they had seen in the bar get into a truck and back up. The police activated their emergency equipment and approached the vehicle. The accused was sitting in the driver's seat when the police approached the vehicle. The defence suggested that another individual had been driving the truck when it backed up but had gone inside the bar to purchase off sale before the police approached the truck. HELD: The accused was convicted of both counts and a judicial stay was entered on the impaired driving count. The Court found that the evidence of the accused was unreliable as a result of her alcohol consumption on the offence date. The evidence of the person that the defence suggested was the driver was inconsistent and caused the Court concern about its reliability. The Court found that at the time the individuals got into the truck, the accused was behind the wheel and that she was the one who backed the vehicle up and pulled it forward. The keys were in the vehicle and it was running when the police came to the driver's door. The accused's blood alcohol content at the time of driving as shown by the Certificate of Analysis was 150 milligrams of alcohol in 100 millilitres of blood.","The accused was charged with impaired driving and driving over.08. The defence admitted all of the essential elements of each charge; the only issue was the factual one of whether or not the accused was the person operating the vehicle. The accused was found guilty on count 1, the charge of impaired operation of a motor vehicle. HELD: The defence evidence lacked reliability. 1)The defence evidence lacks reliability.  1)At the time the individuals got into the truck, Ms. Neigel was behind the wheel; 2)the police officers were absolutely adamant that they had the vehicle in their sight at all times, and at no time did the vehicle start to back up. 3)The evidence of each of the officers was examined in cross-examination, and the defence evidence was not accepted. The evidence of the driver was not supported by the evidence nor did it leave me in a state of reasonable doubt. 2)The police officer was polite and forthright in his evidence, and was adamant and unshaken on the main points of the evidence. The demeanour he exhibited during his testimony, based on who was asking him questions, caused me to have considerable concern."
b_2006skqb218.txt,"The respondent applies to vary the consent joint custody order granted in October 2004. His application was prompted by the relocation of the petitioner with one of their two children, Tyson. The sole issue on this variation application is the determination of the primary residence of Tyson. HELD: 1) The petitioner wants to move Tyson 5.5 hours away from the respondent. This also requires a change in access arrangements. These are changes in circumstances that are material.  2) The petitioner has developed a strong bond with Tyson. The respondent has developed a close relationship with the parties' other child Kailey. After Kailey went to live with the respondent, neither parent did much to facilitate the access of either child. Before the petitioner and Tyson moved, although a short distance apart, neither Kailey nor Tyson saw his or her non-custodial parent and sibling on a regular basis. Even telephone access has been sporadic. Both parents have established homes that accommodate only one child. 3) The petitioner's move must be considered in light of the circumstances that existed before the petitioner's relocation. The parties had already adopted a split custody arrangement without formalizing access or adjusting child support. 4) Permitting the petitioner to relocate is in the best interests of Tyson. It is important that Tyson continue to live in the home of the parent whose constant presence he has become accustomed to. The petitioner has always been Tyson's primary caregiver. The petitioner is the psychological parent.","The petitioner applied to vary the consent joint custody order granted on October 14, 2004. HELD: The sole issue on this variation application is determining the primary residence of Tyson. That entails deciding what is in his best interests. The law relating to the mobility rights of divorced parents was clearly defined in Gordon v. Goertz, 1996 CanLII 191. Before a custodial/primary parent is permitted to relocate a child where there is an existing custody order or agreement, there must be material change in circumstances affecting the child since the making of that order. Once the threshold test has been met, the court embarks upon a fresh inquiry into what is best interests of the child in the new circumstances. Ultimately the focus is the best interests and the child under either The Children's Law Act, 1997, S.S. 1997, c. C-8.2 or the Divorce Act must be able to adjust easily to changes in circumstances."

He argued that the Crown did not prove that he had distributed the copyrighted material, or that the distribution was to an extent that it prejudicially affected the owners of the copyrights. Dismissing the appeal, that by placing the copyrighted computer pro-grams on his computer bulletin board in a compressed format, for ease of transmission, and allowing access by modem to the programs, the appellant was distributing the programs to the prejudice of the owner's copyright.","This was an appeal by a young offender from convictions entered by Judge Atton on three counts of distributing infringing copies of computer software contrary to s. 42(1)(c) of the Copyright Act. The appellant refers to the definition of 'distribute' in Black's Law Dictionary and argues that the appellant did not distribute the copyrighted material by placing it in a restricted area of the bulletin board in a'scrambled' format. The evidence accepted by the trial judge was that they were 'packaged' or 'compressed' for efficient storage and 'ease of use'. It is also clear that when he accessed his computer by modem from his friends' homes and downloaded the programs onto their computers, he was 'distributing' the infringing copies. Furthermore, by controlling the means and manner of which the users accessed his bulletin board, and providing the software to assist in the downloading by modem by those users, the appellant was also distributing, that is giving out, or sharing the infringing copy."

The appellant had done everything required of it pursuant to the Act. The provisions of s. 39 did not require the appellant to follow up with the local registrar’s office to see if the transcript had been filed. In a case such as this, s. 39(9) of the Act provides the court with the ability to exercise its discretion to remedy the problem and ensure that justice is achieved where a transcript could not be filed within the six-month period.",The respondent argued the appeal must be dismissed based on s. 39(5) of The Small Claims Act. The transcript was not filed within the six month period set forth in ss.39(5). The appellant argued the non-filing did not occur through the fault of the appellant. HELD: There was no order as to costs in the circumstances.  1)The transcript was filed and the appeal was allowed to proceed. 2)The court reviewed the transcript and found that it had not been filed within six months of the date the notice of appeal was filed. It was determined that the transcript may now be filed and this appeal shall proceed to be argued and determined on its merits. The setting of the appeal date was confirmed. 3)The respondent was awarded a payment of $110.00. 4)The appellant did not see the letter from Transcript Services.

Steps were not taken to ensure that no disclosure of information would occur for a month after the firm was put on notice. At issue was whether the screening measures taken ensured that no disclosure would occur and satisfied the evidentiary burden imposed on the law firm. HELD: The solicitor and the law firm were disqualified from acting for the petitioner in the action. Because two years had lapsed further examinations were appropriate and an order issued for the petitioner to attend a further examination. If the updated information is not necessary for trial the petitioner may request costs at that time.

7_2014skqb116.txt,"Tax Law – Contract for Services – Payment of PST The plaintiff has the onus of proving it is not liable for the payment of PST on a balance of probabilities. Parties are entitled to structure their legal relationships as they see fit. The Court must determine whether the tax is payable based on the agreements as constructed between Husky and the third parties. There was no evidence that Saskatchewan Finance and the third party contractors entered into an agreement to alter the nature of the contracts so that Husky paid PST when it would not otherwise have been obligated to pay. The evidence established that Husky determined the way in which bids were submitted and the way Husky was invoiced. In each contract, Husky required that the bid include a price for service and price for materials. In each case, it was contemplated that PST was in addition to the price bid for the materials provided. The contracts between Husky and the third parties all contain provisions and terms that provide for the sale of materials to Husky. On the basis of the contracts, there was a sale of tangible property under the PST Act. Husky was the user or consumer of the cement. The third parties were providing materials and services to assist in the construction of the oil well. Husky has failed to establish that the contracts were supply and install contracts. Husky was the ultimate user and consumer of the tangible personal property. Husky is not entitled to rely on mistake of law. Husky has failed to establish on a balance of probabilities that it is entitled to a refund of the PST it paid on well cementing contracts between itself and third parties. The claim is dismissed.","HELD: The plaintiff sought a refund of the Saskatchewan Provincial Sales Tax it paid on well cementing contracts it had with the third parties. The Government of Saskatchewan, pursuant to s. 50(2) of The Revenue and Financial Services Act, imposed a PST on the contracts. The third parties brought an application to be allowed to defend the liability of the Government at trial. An order was made and the third party was allowed to do so. The plaintiff was awarded $419,964.69 plus interest as alleged in the Third Party Claim. The court found that the amount to be refunded to the plaintiff was not subject to the limitation period set forth in s. 56(4) of the Act and s. 59(1), 5(1)(m), 6(1) and 7(6) of S.S. 1983 as amended. HELD: Even if the Government is entitled to refund of PST from the plaintiff, it is not liable to the Saskatchewan Government in the amount of $393,289.73 on materials consumed in the performance of their contracts with the plaintiff. The Court found that there was a mistake of law in the payment of PST by the plaintiff in that it relied on the representations and interpretations in collecting and remitting the PST.

The Crown appealed. HELD: Appeal allowed. The sentence neither reflected the seriousness of the offences nor provided adequate deterrence. The 2 new sentences totalling 2 years were made consecutive to the remaining term of 18 months as well as to each other.","This was an appeal by the Crown against a sentence imposed upon the respondent, a young offender as a result of his having committed two armed robberies. The two terms of closed custody, having been ordered to be served concurrently with the remainder of the previous term, did not constitute a fit sentence having regard for the seriousness of the offenses, the need for deterrence and the need to uphold public confidence in the administration of justice. HELD: The appeal was allowed to the extent that it wasought by the police. The Crown appealed the sentence. The sentence did not meet either the interests of re-habilitation or the requirements of deterrence. An additional six month period of secure custody for these armed robberies does not meet the same requirements as the one imposed on the respondent.  1)An additional 6 month period was provided for the armed robberies in addition to the 18 months of previous secure custody remand for the offences.  2)The sentence was not fit for re-offence.

HELD: 1)Section 258(7) has been judicially amended to mean 'true copy' which presumably, though not logically, means something more than 'copy'. It has grown to the point that an affidavit may be disregarded if the police do not provide supplemental evidence when challenged as to the manner in which they assured the accuracy of the copy. 2)The trial judge further advanced the law to a point where, even when not challenged, there is an obligation to provide supplemental evidence of comparison in order to buttress the evidence of the affidavit. This is an error of law. A challenge under s258(7) should be based upon a discovered difference as between the copy and the original. Otherwise the refusal to admit the certificate becomes merely a prize in a procedural game which can only bring the justice system into disrepute. 3)A new trial was ordered to determine whether the stop was justified.","The accused was charged with operating a motor vehicle while his blood alcohol level exceeded.08 contrary to s. 255(1) and s. 253(a) of the Criminal Code.

The validity of the stop was not one of fact. The Court held this to be an error of law.  3)The Court was unable to infer that true copy was indeed served, failing the proof by the police officer by way of his testimony that he did compare the two.

8_2005skca27.txt,"Fulltext of judgment follows:[1] It will not be necessary for us to hear from the respondent. The appellant has failed to persuade us that Mr. Justice Koch erred in any material respect. In other words, we see no tenable basis for interfering with his decision. [2] The debtor clearly committed an act of bankruptcy under ss. 42(1)(e) of the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act, R.S.C. 1985, c. B-3, as a result of the sheriff's return of nulla bona to the respondent's writ of execution against the debtor. [3] That left Justice Koch to consider whether to dismiss the petition pursuant to ss. 43(7) of the Act or to stay proceedings on the petition pursuant to ss. 43(11). [4] As for the first, the debtor did not satisfy Justice Koch that he was able to pay his debts or that there existed other sufficient cause to dismiss the petition. Based on the evidence adduced by the debtor, we are of the view there is no basis to conclude that Mr. Justice Koch should have been satisfied of these matters. [5] As for second, concerning ss. 43(11), we note that the subsection contains discretionary power to stay proceedings. That, of course, serves to narrow the basis for intervention on appeal. We cannot say Justice Koch erred in any requisite respect in the exercise of this discretionary power. [6] Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed, with costs on appeal to the respondent to be taxed in the usual way.","The debtor clearly committed an act of bankruptcy under s. 42(1)(e) of the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act as result of the sheriff's return of nulla bona to the respondent's writ of execution against the debtor.

3_1999canlii12358.txt,"Two female employees filed complaints with the Saskatchewan Human Rights Commission alleging sexual harassment and discrimination contrary to the Saskatchewan Human Rights Code. The unionized employer applied for judicial review in the nature of prohibition contending the provisions of the Code were superseded by the collective agreement and s.25 of the Trade Union with the result that the Board of Inquiry lacked jurisdiction to hear the complaint. The chambers judge found the Act took precedence over the Code on the basis that the Act dealt specifically with the employment relationship and granted an order prohibiting the Board of Inquiry from hearing and determining the matter. Sub-questions to be determined included: what are the statutory schemes of the Trade Union Act and the Saskatchewan Human Rights Code; what has the Supreme of Canada decided about the exclusive jurisdiction of an arbitrator to resolve disputes in the context of labour law; the essential character of the dispute and ambit of the collective agreement; whether either the Code or the Act has exclusive jurisdiction to decide the dispute and if not, which statute takes priority or is paramount. HELD: The order of the Court of Queen's Bench was set aside and the matter was remitted to the Board of Inquiry appointed under the provisions of the Code. 1)The chambers judge correctly decided that the issue in this case is confined to a determination of the correct forum in which to bring the complaint of sexual harassment. 2)Human rights are fundamental, quasi-constitutional rights which embody fundamental values and public policy. Because human rights are not private rights, but public rights which constitute fundamental public policy, parties are not able to contract out of, alter, amend, or repeal or create exceptions to human rights provisions. To do otherwise would permit the denigration of the rights and obviate the protection of the rights the statute seeks to protect. 3)The mere fact that a collective agreement includes an article or clause which complies with the Code or a provision which covenants not to discriminate on the basis of the grounds set out in the Code, does not in and of itself transform the nature of the dispute from a human rights violation to a breach of the collective agreement. The ambit of the collective agreement does not affect the finding that the essential nature of the dispute is a human rights violation particularly when the public interest component and wide powers granted under the Code to redress a violation are taken into account. It is not in its essential character a complaint arising out of the employment relationship under the collective agreement.  4)The Commission was awarded its costs on double column V in this Court and on the appropriate Court of Queen's Bench tariff. No costs were requested by the intervenor.ADDENDUM: Paragraphs number 25 and 31 are substituted as follows: [25] This position was reinforced by Weber v. Ontario Hydro and New Brunswick v. O'Leary. The policy driving such decisions is that the dispute resolution process, established by the various labour statutes, should not be duplicated or undermined by concurrent common law actions in the courts. This also conforms to the theory of deference that courts accord decisions of specialized tribunals. For a complete discussion of the issue see Parr and Prince Albert District Health Board v. Saskatchewan Federation of Labour released concurrently with this judgment. The Ambit of the Collective Agreement [31] One must not lose sight of the fact that the terms of the collective agreement itself can play an important role in the determination of whether the jurisdiction of the court has been ousted in favour of an arbitrator. The fact that parties have included an anti-discrimination clause in the collective agreement does not alter the fundamental nature of the dispute or have the effect of extending the scope of the arbitrator's jurisdiction. It may play a role in determining whether the statutory tribunal would decide to hear the complaint, but it cannot affect the determination of the essential nature of the dispute or the question of jurisdiction. The essential issue is whether this complaint is a dispute between the parties with respect to the meaning, application or alleged violation of the collective agreement. To find that it is, with the result that the dispute must be arbitrated, would permit the parties to contract out of the Code, something they cannot do.","HELD: The order of Queen's Bench was set aside and the matter remitted to the Board of Inquiry established under the Act in accordance with the provisions of the Act. 1)Human rights are more than just statutory rights. They are fundamental, quasi-constitutional rights which embody fundamental values and public policy. While it is true that the employees' employment rights were inferentially affected because the alleged act of discrimination was addressed by the collective agreement, the mere fact that an alleged violation of the Code occurred in place of employment rather than in some other setting is not determinative. 2)The Act took precedence over the Code when dealing with an issue of sexual discrimination arising out of the employment relationship of the employees. The Act dealt specifically with the resolution of disputes between unionized employers and their employees. 3)A board of inquiry appointed pursuant to the terms of a collective agreement or an arbitrator appointed under the collective agreements had exclusive jurisdiction to resolve the matter. 4)The mere fact the Act includes an article or clause which complies with the Code or a provision which covenants not to discriminate on the basis of the grounds set out in the Code does not in and of itself transform the nature of the dispute from a human rights violation to a breach of the collective bargaining agreement. 5)While human rights legislation is not constitutional in nature, it is of such a special nature that it cannot be contracted out of, altered, amended or repealed nor may exceptions be created to its provisions except by clear legislative intent and pronouncement. To do otherwise would permit the denigration of the rights the statute seeks to protect. 6)The Chamber judge correctly decided that the issue in this case is confined to a determination of the correct forum in which to bring the complaint of sexual harassment: a board of arbitration appointed pursuant pursuant to s. 25(1) of the Collective agreement or a Board of enquiry appointed pursuant the Code.  7)The chambers judge examined the controlling authorities in this jurisdiction and in the Supreme Court of Canada and relied on Weber v. Ontario Hydro to decide the issue of appropriate forum. In his opinion, the only method of enforcement of the substantive rights based upon a common law interpretation of the agreement and the fact that sexual harassment could also be characterized as a violation of s. 16(1)(a) of The Trade Union Act that was merely the legal characterization. 8)The fact the parties have included an anti-discrimination clause in their collective agreement does not alter the fundamental nature of this complaint and does not affect the essential nature of it"

During the course of his arrest, the plaintiff received cut to his scalp. He remained in custody until released at approximately 7:30 a.m. that morning. The three named defendants are members of the Saskatoon Police Service. The City of Saskatoon is their employer. HELD: The action for wrongful arrest is dismissed. The plaintiff was assaulted when his head was driven onto the hood of the vehicle. The plaintiff is awarded $2,500 in general damages and pre-judgment interest on that amount. It is not an appropriate case to award punitive damages, but the Court awarded solicitor client costs to the plaintiff in the amount of $6,000 plus taxable disbursements. 1) The Court accepted the plaintiff's evidence that he did not physically interfere with the police officers outside of the lounge. The police officers that attended at the lounge and became involved in the arrest of Mr. Sampson were in the execution of their duty. The plaintiff does not dispute that he possessed the general intent to make the comments that he did throughout the proceedings and that he did so wilfully. The issue is whether or not his actions obstructed the police officers, who were in the execution of their duty. 2) The combined actions of the plaintiff and Ms. Krupa clearly interfered with the police officers' arrest of Mr. Sampson, to the point that Constable Pura called for back-up help. Once the back-up officers arrived, one of them was required to expend time and effort restricting the movements of the plaintiff and Ms. Krupa. Once on the street, they again confronted the police officers. Their combined actions clearly affected the work of the police officers in the execution of their duty. There were reasonable and probable grounds to believe the plaintiff was obstructing the police officers in the course of their duty. 3) On the facts in this matter, the same conclusion is arrived at based solely on the plaintiff's individual actions. The plaintiff's officious interference consisted of verbal abuse, excessive criticism and undue pertinacity in his discussion and questioning and provided reasonable and probable grounds to believe he was obstructing police officers in the execution of their duty. The action for wrongful arrest is dismissed. 4) The cut to the plaintiff's head is a minor one, not requiring stitches or immediate medical attention.

He remained in custody until 7:30 a.m. that morning when the police officers arrested him and removed him from the premises, he refused to go with them. The police officer who arrested the plaintiff was not involved in the arrest and the actions of the defendant outside of the lounge were in dispute. The plaintiff was convicted of remaining in licensed premises after being required to leave contrary to s. 122(2)(a) of The Police Act, 1990, S.S. 1990-91, c. P-15.01."
c_2004nssc248.txt,"In a divorce proceeding, the wife claimed lump sum spousal support in the amount of $20,000 to allow her to return to her native country. She also claimed that periodic maintenance was not appropriate because of the difficulty of enforcement when she is living abroad and referenced two occasions when the husband was paying periodic support that she had to seek the assistance of Maintenance Enforcement. The husband opposed paying any more spousal support but expressed a preference for lump sum support if he was required to pay more, as it would allow him to move on with his life with his new family. Husband ordered to pay a lump sum award of $10,000 to wife; when the parties moved to Nova Scotia, the husband was able to improve his financial situation, while the wife's position deteriorated.","The parties were married in 1996 having previously been married in Sweden and then divorced in 1993. There are no children of their relationship and the only contested issue on this hearing is the respondent's claim for lump sum spousal support. The parties agree that all property has been divided to their mutual satisfaction and an outstanding debt of approximately 34,000 krona is their joint responsibility. The respondent is now working, albeit part-time, to alleviate the economic hardship that results from the marriage or its breakdown. There is a strong likelihood that the respondent will be moving to Sweden in the near future. HELD: The respondent will pay $10,000.00 to the respondent.  1) The Court has jurisdiction to grant a support order as an incident to divorce. Periodic payments are the norm. However, Parliament did not attach any particular priority to the factors to be considered, and the objectives sought to be achieved in spousals orders. 2) The respondent was able, because of her education and background, to improve her financial position, while the respondent has effectively seen her position deteriorate.  3) This is a very significant change in the current statute, when compared to the previous statute, and it does not follow that the quantum of support must always equal the amount of need. In these circumstances, clearly lump sum support is preferable and more likely to enable each party to get on with the rest of the lives. 4) Having decided there is need and ability to pay, albeit diminishing in view of the evidence of the respondent that the major contract was not being renewed, lump sum payment is preferable to periodic payments in these circumstances."

e_1998canlii13440.txt,"The applicants sought an order under s.11 of the Landlord and Tenant Act vesting the whole term of their sub-lease with either VIP Business Centre (VIP) or 598710 Saskatchewan Ltd (SaskLtd). Bennett, owner of an office building (the Plaza), leased space to VIP for five years ending in 1997. Issues included (i)whether there had been a valid renewal of the head lease; (ii)whether there had been valid renewals of sub-leases; (iii)assuming valid renewals, did s4 of the Statute of Frauds bar enforcement against Bennett; (iv)whether the Court had jurisdiction to hear an application for relief under s11 brought solely by notice of motion; (v)are the applicants entitled to such relief; (vi)whether Bennett was bound by the sub-leases by virtue of taking the assignment from VIP. HELD: The application was dismissed. 1)It was assumed that the evidence led by the applicants was true in order to determine issues (iii) and (iv) which dispose of the application. Issues (i), (ii) and (vi) could not be dealt with summarily because of the conflicting affidavits. 2)Notwithstanding Queen's Bench Rule 13(1), the term action in s11 includes summary application by way of notice of motion. There is no reason for landlords to have better access to this Court than the tenants concerning possession of demised premises. The words 'or otherwise' include extrajudicial actions by landlords, including re-entry. Had it been concluded that it was necessry to proceed by statement of claim, such error would have been procedural one, curable under Rule without affecting the jurisdiction of the Court. 3)The Court should exercise its discretion within the guidelines outlined in Golden Griddle. grant of relief requested by the applicant would constitute an improper exercise of such discretion. They were not the sole tenant in stand alone building of the kind in Chatham Empire Theatre. The relief sought would unfairly affect the landlord. As the applicants expressed no interest in taking over the whole head lease premises on the terms of the head lease, there was no need for a conditional order of the nature of London Bridge. 4)The only memoranda consisted of the original head lease and subleases and the unsigned fax messages. The fax messages did not meet the essential requirements for a valid lease. The actions and performance by VIP and the applicant fell short of constituting part performance for the purposes of s.4 regardless of a narrow or broad interpretation of the doctrine. In any case the Court would not have exercised its discretion by binding Bennett with leases which comprised less than 15% of the head premises in the absence of evidence that clearly demonstrated the owner's ability to rent out the balance of the head lease premises was not impaired economically or physically. The applciants could obtain other office space including that offered by Bennett. General and punitive damages would provide an adequate remedy.","The applicants sought an order under s.11 of The Landlord and Tenant Act vesting the whole term of their sub-leases with either V.I.P.

HELD: The application was dismissed. 1)Credibility cannot be determined on an examination of the conflicting affidavits. 2)The Court was of the view that a decision on issue nos.1, 2 and 4 can dispose of the application, and perhaps the issues between the parties. 3)The applicants had established the essential requirements for valid renewals of the head lease and their subleases and that they had met the requirements of s.2 of the Statute of Frauds. 4)The actions and performance by the applicants fell short of constituting partperformance for the purposes of s4, regardless of whether a narrow or broad interpretation of the doctrine was applied."
5_2009nspc10.txt,"The accused was arrested for possession of drugs and a weapon, and for breaching his probation. Police testified they saw him walking down the street at 10am and noticed a strong smell of marijuana. When approached, he was smoking a cigarette in front of the provincial courthouse. He said he had smoked marijuana on the street, but did not have any other drugs on him. After they spoke, he asked to leave, saying he was late for a court appointment. The police asked him to deal with this matter first, ran a CPIC check and discovered the accused was on probation and required to keep the peace and be of good behaviour. He was not cautioned/advised of his right to counsel until he was arrested on the basis of what the Crown claimed was a reasonable belief the accused possessed drugs. Police conducted a 'pat-down' search, and found drugs (marijuana and cocaine) and a weapon. The accused argued his Charter rights were violated (s. 8, 9 and 10(b)) and asked the court to exclude the evidence obtained in the search. He also argued his admission/statement was not voluntary and should be excluded on the basis that it was given in the context of a violation of his Charter rights. Motions to exclude the statement and evidence obtained in the search denied. The accused's s. 8 and 9 rights were not breached. While his s. 10(b) rights were violated when he asked to leave and the officers asked him to deal with this first (which amounted to detention), his admission/statement was made before the detention and was voluntary. Further, no evidence was obtained as a result of the breach since the search only took place after the arrest/cautioning. After reviewing the relevant jurisprudence, the court concluded: the Crown must prove the arresting officer subjectively believed they found an offence apparently being committed; that subjective belief must be objectively reasonable; police may rely on an inference in forming their belief (such as the inference that marijuana smokers typically carry a supply with them); and that inference must be objectively reasonable in light of the circumstances and facts of the case. Here, the officer's subjective belief that the accused was in possession of drugs was objectively reasonable. The court accepted her evidence that she had special training in identifying the smell of marijuana and distinguishing between a strong and faint smell of marijuana. The CPIC check showed he was on probation in relation to a drug charge. Since the officer had the authority to arrest under s. 495(1)(b) of the Criminal Code, the arrest was lawful. The search taking place incidental to the arrest was reasonable. In obiter, the court went on to say that, even if the accused's s. 8 and 9 Charter rights had been breached, an analysis under s. 24 would lead to a decision not to exclude the evidence: it was not conscriptive; the offence was serious; there was no bad faith on the part of police; and the accused could have lawfully been arrested for admitting to what was a breach of his probation.",The accused was charged with possession of marijuana for the purposes of trafficking and possession of cocaine for the purpose of trafficking. The accused was arrested for possession of cannabis. The defence sought an order excluding admission of the accused's statement to the police and exclusion of the results of the search of his person. HELD: The Court held that the officer's stated reason for arrest was based upon reasonable and probable grounds. The Court also contested the voluntariness of a statement given by the accused to police.  1) The Court found that the accused was not under arrest. He was not physically restrained. He hadn't been given any order or direction not to leave. The statement was found to be free and voluntary. 2) There was no section 10(b) violation prior to the officer’s statement.
9_1994canlii4283.txt,"The respondent had undertaken the residential development of certain lands bordering the appellant's property and constructed roadways which it proposed to convey to the Department of Transportation, who agreed to accept with the consent of owners of property where water would drain from the road. When the appellant refused to consent, the respondent applied to the municipality for proceedings under the Ditches and Water Courses Act, which failed to achieve agreement. The respondent then filed a requisition with the county clerk pursuant to s. 7(1) of the Act which allows for the appointment of a municipal engineer. The engineer filed a report in which he concluded the respondent was entitled to open a ditch on the appellant's land, subject to certain conditions. In this action, the appellant appealed pursuant to s. 12 of the Act. Allowing the appeal, that the Act appears to assume that landowners will agree that a ditch benefits their land and provides a mechanism for apportioning cost. However, it does not give an engineer authority to expropriate land or take any interest in it, nor does it provide a means by which the appellant is forced to accept the ditch. Further, the common law prohibits the use of another's property to solve one's drainage problems.","HELD: The application was granted. The court found that the respondent was entitled to build a ditch and drain on the Haverstock lands. The issue was whether the Act provided a means by which the respondent would be forced to accept the drainage. The respondent was awarded costs of $3,000.00.  The Court found that s.7(1) of the Act does not give the engineer the authority to take (or expropriate) the land, or any interest in it. The Act does provide a method of apportioning the cost of the ditch or drain amongst the owners and prescribing the means to which will be determined the necessary technical details of a ditch."
b_2001skca85.txt,"The Court of Appeal was required to determine the limits of its authority to change the application of the Rule against Perpetuities, an established common law principle, to a particular type of oil and gas lease. In 1950 Taylor entered a 'top' (head) lease for mineral rights with Freeholders Oil, effective upon the expiry of Imperial's interest in 1959. The new owner of the land recognized the assignment of the 1961 top lease sold to Tarragon in 1993. After reaching an agreement in 1993 in principle for a 'farmout' arrangement whereby Maxx agreed to drill the lands for Tarragon, Maxx concluded the top lease offended the Rule against Perpetuities and entered its own lease with the landowner. The trial judge held the 1950 Freeholders lease was void because it contravened the Rule against Perpetuities; although top leases do not offend the policy behind the rule, any modification of the rule is best left to the legislature; there was a breach of confidence. HELD: The appeal was allowed with costs on double column V. The action for a declaration that the top lease is void was dismissed with costs in Queen's Bench. 1)The top lease in question was not void as it did not offend the object and purpose of the Rule. The reasoning and approach of the Supreme Court of Canada in Salituro, Tolofson and Morguard was persuasive. The decision of the House of Lords in Arthur J S Hall demonstrates the need to re-examine archaic rules of common law which cannot be justified in modern society. The genius of the common law lies in its adaptiveness to changing times. Its basic principles are not meant to become rigid formulae. Common law rules may be tweaked to do justice between the parties when a rigid and mechanistic application of the rule would run counter to the object and purpose of the rule. Since the socio-economic and political conditions which gave rise to the creation of the Rule no longer exist, it was open to the Court to consider the application of the rule in the context of a commercial instrument such as the top lease in question.  2)Although top leases have been attacked on other grounds, this was the first case before the Saskatchewan Courts in which the Rule against Perpetuities has been advanced to void such a lease. The historical background and object and purpose of the rule were reviewed. The general purpose is to prevent the tying up of property to the detriment of society in general. The common law rule against perpetuities prevails over intention because it is not a rule of construction, but a rule of property. A mere possibility, or even a probability that the estate or interest may vest within the time is not enough. The 'wait and see' doctrine has been adopted by statute in some jurisdictions.DISSENT: The Court should not modify the Rule in the face of the significance of such a modification, the efforts of the legislature to legislate and the inability to deal with such issues as the retrospective operation of such a decision. The Rule against Perpetuities applies to this top lease. As there is no life in being in this case, the interest must vest within 21 years of its creation which would have been 1971. The Rule is not concerned with the duration of an interest but only that an interest may vest at a remote time in the future. The rule invalidates interests in land that vest too remotely.","The trial judge held that the lease was void because it breached the rule against perpetuities. He allowed the counterclaim by the appellant for breach of confidence with consequent directions for an accounting and assessment of damages. HELD: The principal question on this appeal is whether the appellants' oil and gas 'top lease' with the late Harry Herbert Taylor should be rendered void by the rule. The background and essential facts with respect to this controversy are not in dispute. The trial judge found for Tarragon that it was intended by the parties to have a contingent relationship with future vesting as to the reversionary interest in the mines and minerals. The court found that the phrase 'in the event', connote time and condition and not property or an interest in property. The Court held that this was the first case before the Saskatchewan Courts in which the rule was advanced to void such a lease. The test for whether there has been a breach of the rule is to determine whether the lease creating the interest was void."

HELD: A trial of the issue was directed, as it could not be decided on the material filed whether he was intentionally unemployed or underemployed. The father's circumstances had changed since the consent order. The fact he no longer resided with a girlfriend and was making payments on a truck did not justify any reduction. Income should not be imputed based on former employment that is no longer available or practicable.","FIAT. The respondent father applies to vary a consent order dated April 5, 2001, by reducing his required child support payments from $236.00 per month to $19.00. The consent order was granted one month after the respondent had quit his employment at Lilydale Foods. Although he remained unemployed, the respondent agreed to pay child support based upon an imputed annual income of $17,386.00, which is what he had been earning. HELD: The issue is whether the respondent is intentionally underemployed or unemployed within the meaning of s. 19(1)(a) of the Federal Child Support Guidelines. 1) The real issue is if the respondent's circumstances have changed since April 2001. He is now employed as tow truck driver, and says that he is earning an annualized income of only $7,510. He purchased a one-half ton truck on which he has been making payments of $624.00 for the past month. 2) The material indicates that the respondent’s circumstances had changed since the consent order, and he is no longer residing with his girlfriend, with whom he shared expenses. The first and third of these “changed circumstances” do not justify any reduction in his child support obligations. Income should not be imputed to a payor based on a former employment that was no longer available or practicable. He has made an effort to secure alternate employment."
c_2012nsca78.txt,", motion denied. While the province has an arguable appeal, it does not concern a summary judgment motion that would result in the claims being dismissed outright. If the certification order is struck, the province will still face individual claims. The AG has not shown that defending individual actions will cost less than defending one class proceeding. There is no evidence to estimate how it may incur significantly higher expenses as a result of how the points at issue in the appeal are resolved. The matter has been ongoing for some time and it is reasonable to expect the province has already spent time and money to prepare the defence they will eventually file. To succeed on this basis, the court would require a reliable indication of what remains to be done during the stay period, what component of that residue would be wasted if the appeal is allowed, and some estimate of that cost.","The plaintiffs sought certification of the class proceeding under s. 7(1), naming of two classes: property owner and residential. They sued in tort and for breach of fiduciary duty, and sought damages for their own exposure and for injury to their property and their value. In October 2010, the plaintiffs filed an amended motion for certification, that proposed class boundaries with a reduced area but extended a 7 year habitation requirement for the residential class. The defendants appealed the certification order in a class action. The Court of Appeal dismissed the motion for stay, finding that the province's grounds of appeal were arguable on their face. HELD: The appeal does not involve a summary judgment motion that would dismiss the claims outright, in any form, against the Province. This appeal seeks to strike the Certification Order for common issues trial in class proceeding. 1) There is no evidence on the point that establishes how defending individual actions would cost the Province less than defending one common issue trial. 2) The Province has offered no evidence that establishing this would be significantly higher because of points that are in issue on the appeal.  3) The court has not yet fixed a date for implementation of the Notice Program under para 15 of the Order."
3_1995canlii4243.txt,"The appellant Board granted the respondent temporary total disability benefits on a part-time basis. The respondent contended that it should be on a full-time basis, and applied to the Supreme Court in chambers for an order quashing the appellant's decision. The chambers judge found that the appellant had ignored the clear words of s.37 of the Workers' Compensation Act in reaching its decision, and thus had exceeded its jurisdiction; the decision was quashed and the matter remitted back to the Board. The appellant appealed. Allowing the appeal and setting aside the order to quash, that s.37 of the Act was not a section limiting the Board's jurisdiction and that, considering s.37 and s.53 of the Act, the decision of the Board was not patently erroneous.","This was an appeal from a decision in Chambers allowing an application for certiorari to quash a decision of the Workers' Compensation Board and remitting the matter to the Board to determine the rate of compensation payable to the respondent. The respondent had worked for M-I Drilling Fluids Canada since 1963 and experienced periods of layoff for as long as two years. In 1993, he was laid off from full-time hourly employment. He was given part-time casual work for which he was paid a rate of $15 per hour. He sustained a back injury and was unable to continue with his caretaking duties. The hearing officer awarded him 75% of an amount close to full time worker's pay. Although he was not disabled from his duties as caretaker, he would get more compensation than he would have received from his work had he not been disabled. The Board appealed.

b_1999canlii12407.txt,"The defendant, who was to install sewer and water lines on four lots for the hamlet, was charged with seven violations of the Occupational Health and Safety Act and Regulations. It had been agreed that the offences were strict liability. The principle issue was whether the defendant had an obligation imposed by law with respect to the workers and if so whether he discharged it by exercising due diligence in the circumstances. The essential facts were not in dispute. HELD: The defendant was found guilty on all offences.  1)There is a legal duty on an employer under the Act to take steps to supervise and oversee excavations to ensure the usual protocols for safety are met. This requires at a minimum the presence of an experienced person on site. Any reasonable person with some knowledge of worksite safety would insist that the walls be properly sloped, that there be at a ladder or other method to get out of the trench and that first aid supplies were readily available. Supervision is essential particularly when the worker is inexperienced. The deceased had had no experience in sewer and water trenching. No inexperienced person should be allowed to work on such a potentially dangerous site without proper training and specific guidance and supervision. The Law is specific on the requirements to be met for safety of the workers on excavation and sewer and water hookups. 2)The remedial progress report was ruled inadmissible. There was no formal comment on the issue of admissibility. 3)The Act does not define due diligence but well established case authority defines it as taking reasonable care to avoid causing harm which is prohibited by law. 4)The Act does not apply to a contractor. The relationship had all the ordinary indicia of an employer/employee relationship. The defendant controlled the project, tools and materials and bore the risk of loss or profit, had the ultimate responsibility for the worksite, completion of the project and the payment of wages.","The defendant was charged with seven violations of the Occupational Health and Safety Act, 1993 being Chapter 0-1.1 of the Statutes of Saskatchewan and Regulations made pursuant to the Act. The defendant had obtained a contract from the Hamlet of St. George's Hill to install sewer and water lines on four lots. This he arranged to do by using the services of an individual he knew by the name of Russell Woods who was hired to do the backhoe work on the excavation. As a matter of fact no inexperienced person ought to be allowed to work on such a potentially dangerous site without proper training and specific supervision. HELD: The defendant was guilty as charged on all offences. 1)The defendant had an obligation imposed by law with respect to the workers at the excavation site.  2)If the defendant did have a legal obligation did he discharge it by exercising due diligence in the circumstances?  3)The evidence was clear that the relationship between the defendant and the workers was one of an employer to workers. The fact that Woods arranged for his nephew to work with him does not make the defendant an employer since the nephew understood that this would be work for wages in the service of the defendant.  4)There was no evidence that the defendant had any obligation to supervise and oversee the work site because he was extremely busy with other business matters which had taken him to Laloche and then to Saskatoon when the trenching was being done at St.George's Hill.  5)The court found that once one finds that there was a legal duty on the defendant as an employer under the Act then his obligations under the law are to take active steps to ensure that all work at the place of employment was sufficiently and competently supervised, and to make sure that the usual protocols for job safety are met. At minimum this would have required the presence of an experienced person on site (either Mr. Peterson Sr. or someone on his behalf with his authority to give orders and directions at the worksite). Of course, any reasonable person with some knowledge of worksite safety in relation to trenching would insist that the walls be properly sloped, that there be ladder or other method to get into out of the trench safely, that first aid supplies readily available."
c_2008nssm39.txt,"The applicant law firm applied for a taxation of accounts in a complicated family law matter. The client contended that there was obvious overbilling and that the solicitor was negligent in failing to specify in an interim Order the actual time at which she had to leave the matrimonial home. Accounts as presented are certified; there was no indication whatsoever of overbilling, whether with respect to legal fees or disbursements, and there was no negligence on the part of the solicitor as she had acted reasonably in relying on the representations of the husband's lawyer as to when the Order would be enforced. It is not always necessary to examine every single entry in detail on a line-by-line basis; an overall view of the entries contained in an account can be taken when assessing reasonableness. The temporal limitation of cross-examination is within the Small Claims Court's scope of discretion in special circumstances.","The Applicant sought a taxation of the accounts issued to the Respondent. The Respondent argued that the respondent was negligent in the execution of a Court order granting interim exclusive possession of a matrimonial home to the respondent's estranged spouse. HELD: 1) The respondent firmly believes that this is an obvious overbilling. The respondent's first complaint is that she was 'overbilled.' The Court found that there was a reasonable apprehension of bias on the part of the respondent. 2) There is very little in the Small Claims Court Act, supra, which specifically sets out the procedure to be followed in the Court. There is also a strong presumption in favour of judicial impartiality and the presumption is that such an oath as that made by an Adjudicator at the outset of his or her appointment will be respected by that adjudicator. 3) In this case, the respondent took the position that it is not common to put in an interim possession Order an exact time on a particular day that one party must vacate a Matrimonial Home. This is not the case in Nova Scotia where cross-examination is a common practice. 4) There are a number of factors that a decision maker's participation in earlier proceedings involving the same party or parties who are again before the decision-maker in fresh, new proceedings does not, and should not, invariably lead to disqualification. The Court reviewed all of the legal accounts derived from docketed time entries and found that even when a person has previously appeared before the same judge and adverse findings of credibility were previously found with respect to that person, such does not by itself require recusal. 5) In both civil law and criminal law contexts, courts have repeatedly found that decision-makers, when appointed, must take and subscribe an oath before a judge of the Nova Scotia Supreme Court whereby the decision maker promises to do right to all manner of people after the laws of the Province without fear, favour, affection or ill will. The evidence regarding her Crownside appearance is sufficient by itself to cause the Court to seriously doubt the applicant's assertion that she did not authorize Ms. Stevenson to attend Crownside. Such prior participation as basis for disqualification, without something more, appears to be, as pointed out by Justice Joyal in Kalo v. Manitoba, at paras. 32 to 34, the exact type of shortcut in reasoning that is inappropriate in such cases of alleged apprehension of a bias."

A pediatrician testified that inconsistency in parenting approaches would further delay the child's development. HELD: Custody was awarded to the father. 1)Each parent was a capable caregiver. However, the father was available to provide full-time care due to an employment disability and exhibited a strong desire to do so. The past physical abuse of his former spouse was not considered relevant as it did not affect his ability to parent the child. 2)The mother was to have weekly access on two non-consecutive days for eight hours and two hours on a third day.

The parties cannot agree if any of the expenses fall into s. 7 of the Guidelines as being extraordinary: $975 for child care, $500 for dance, $350 for school activities, and $1,140 for asthma medication. 2) The court does not believe that the 'reasonable coverage' definition contained in the May 1, 2006 amendment is new law. At best, it is a single test now enunciated in legislative form which should provide for more consistency and predictability as opposed to the many attempts to articulate a definition of extraordinary which is found in the case law.

Which items might be reasonably covered by the sum of the parent's income plus child support? 2) The child care costs and asthma medication costs are of sufficient amount and peculiar to this child as to be extraordinary or not expected to be reasonably covered from the table amount of child support and the respondent's income.  3) With respect to spousal support, neither counsel referred to the spousal support guidelines and the formula for spouses with children which measures the difference between the individual net disposable incomes of each former spouse. These guidelines suggest that an award of between 40% to 46% of that difference in individual net disposable income be paid by the spouse with the higher INDI to the former spouse with the lower INDI. These guidelines create a rough ballpark of $900 to $1,100 per month in this particular case. However, the petitioner is bearing the full responsibility for family debt repayment in the interim. In order to pay creditors in a timely fashion, the petitioner has taken this responsibility onto his shoulders. In the circumstances, it is ordered that the petitioner pay to the respondent interim spousal support of $700. The consequent reduction of family debt is therefore a factor of this particular interim spousal support order and should not cause confusion when addressing any property issue in the future.","FIAT. The respondent moves for an order granting joint custody and primary care (residence) of the child with access to her former spouse. The parties agree that the established status quo of shared parenting shall also be included in this order. However, the petitioner is bearing the full responsibility for family debt repayment in the interim. The childcare costs and asthma medication costs are of sufficient amount and peculiar to the child as to be extraordinary or not expected to be reasonably covered from the table amount of child support and the respondent's income.

9_2001canlii390.txt,"The accused was charged with operating a motor vehicle while his ability to do so was impaired and while over .08 (breath sample readings were 160 and 150 mg) contrary to s. 253(a) and s.253(b) of the Criminal Code, respectively. Issues arising during the trial included whether there was a breach of his s.8 and s.9 Charter rights to be secure against unreasonable search or seizure, and not to be arbitrarily detained; if there was a breach, was there a remedy under s.24(2); whether the evidence was sufficient to prove the offence of impaired driving beyond a reasonable doubt. The police officer concluded that he had reasonable and probable grounds for the breath demand based upon the accused sleeping through two green traffic lights, a strong smell of alcohol, and his somewhat bloodshot or glassy eyes. HELD: The accused was acquitted of both charges. 1)The evidence was sufficient to establish breaches of s.8 and s.9 of the Charter. The Certificate of Analysis constituted conscriptive evidence which, on balance, would not have been discovered by alternative means. Its admission into evidence might render the trial unfair and bring the administration of justice into disrepute. In the absence of the Certificate of Analysis, the evidence was not sufficient to prove the offence under s.253(b) beyond a reasonable doubt. 2)The strong smell of alcohol and somewhat bloodshot or glassy eyes were not sufficient to conclude there were reasonable and probable grounds for the demand. The court is required to examine the evidence as a whole. Every case will depend a great deal on its individual circumstances. It was not reasonable for the officer to assume that the vehicle not moving at the lights was a reliable indicator of impairment for these purposes. The evidence of slurred speech was not reliable as there was nothing in the officer's notes regarding slurred speech, nor had it been included in the investigation documents. The accused did not have any problems with balance or manner of walk, was cooperative throughout, and did not have any difficulty understanding his rights and the breath demand read to him from a printed card. The officer did not ask the accused whether he had been drinking. 3)The nature and quality of the evidence of a strong smell of alcohol, and eyes which were somewhat glassy or bloodshot, in the context of Stellato, was so frail as to leave a reasonable doubt as to impairment. The 'classic' signs of impairment (erratic driving, strong odour of alcoholic beverage, glassy and bloodshot eyes, slurred speech and unsteadiness on one's feet) was not intended to be an all-encompassing list, and its application will very much depend on the circumstances of a given case.","The accused was charged with impaired driving contrary to s. 253(a) and 253(b) of the Criminal Code. The evidence of a strong smell of alcohol coming from the accused's vehicle and eyes which were somewhat glassy and bloodshot did not constitute reasonable and probable grounds for the breath demand. HELD: The evidence was not sufficient to prove beyond a reasonable doubt the offence of impaired driving. The Court found that the Certificate of Analysis constituted conscriptive evidence which, on balance, would not have otherwise been discovered by alternative non-conscriptive means. As well, the admission of it into evidence might well render the trial unfair and bring the administration of justice into disrepute. The accused was not guilty of the charge under s.253(a)."

The father now applied for interim sole custody, alleging that the ongoing extreme conflict between the parties was adversely affecting the children. An assessment recommended that the children live with the father and have access with the mother. Father granted interim sole care, custody and control of the children. The serious concerns raised by the assessment satisfied the threshold requirement of a material change in circumstances; the urgency of the concerns required immediate action.","This was an interim application to vary the terms of a 2001 Corollary Relief Judgment respecting parenting arrangements.

Nevertheless, the parties shared parenting arrangement has existed since 2000, albeit with much disagreement and discord."
b_2018skca27.txt,"HELD: The appeal from conviction was dismissed and sentence appeal allowed. The sentence was varied to 12 months of probation. The court found with respect to each issue that: 1) the presumption of competent trial representation had not been displaced. The trial lawyer’s decision not to cross-examine the complainant was a tactical one. She was very young and had difficulty expressing herself in the courtroom whereas she had given clear, coherent statements to the police shortly after the offence. The lawyer determined that it was not beneficial to the appellant’s position to highlight those statements by raising certain inconsistences between them and the complainant’s testimony;  2) the trial judge’s assessment of credibility was entitled to deference. He correctly identified R v W.(D.) as the guiding legal principle in the circumstances and his credibility findings were supportable on the evidence; and 3) the sentence was unfit because denunciation and deterrence are secondary factors in sentencing young offenders and are to be considered in a fashion consistent with the principle of “diminished moral blameworthiness” described in s. 3 the YCJA. The court acknowledged that this offence, committed against an 11-year-old and causing her serious psychological harm, might warrant a custodial sentence but for the appellant’s exemplary conduct since the offence and the almost four years that had elapsed between the offence in 2012 and his sentencing in 2016. Under s. 3(1)(b)(iv) and (v) of the YCJA, the delay in this case offended the concept of timely justice. To impose a custodial sentence on the appellant in this case would be contrary to the purposes of the YCJA as it would impede the appellant’s rehabilitation and reintegration into society. The court decided that a fit sentence in this case would be 12 months of probation.","The appellant was convicted after trial of sexually assaulting his 11-year-old niece contrary to s. 271 of the Criminal Code. The trial judge made no specific findings of fact related to reliability or credibility of the former babysitter. The appellant appeals both his conviction and sentence. HELD: The appeal is dismissed. 1) The verdict in this case came down to a question of credibility. A trial judge failed to adhere to and properly apply the principles and purposes of sentencing pursuant to the Youth Criminal Justice Act, SC 2002, and the sentencing principles in s. 38 of the Code. 2) The evidence must meet the criteria for the admission of fresh evidence as set forth in Palmer (1979), 1979 CanLII (SCC), [1980] SCR 759 at 775. 3) It is well understood that an appellate court must show 'great deference' to a trial judge's assessment of witness credibility. In this case, the trial judge erred in assessing the credibility of witnesses and that he received ineffective trial representation. 4) The appellant has failed to establish that the appellant's credibility findings are supportable on the evidence. 5) The sentencing judge committed an error in principle when he emphasized denunciation and deterrence as the paramount sentencing objectives. This error impacted the sentence imposed and the sentence was varied to 12 months of probation. 6) The focus of sentencing under the YCJA is balancing conflicting principles to arrive at a sentence tailored to the individual circumstances. Given the circumstances of the case, counsel had to determine whether certain lines of questioning would be beneficial or prejudicial to his client's case."
1997canlii11078.txt,"The applicant sought to be appointed as property guardian for his uncle pursuant to s19 of the Dependent Adults Act. The proposed dependent adult resisted the application and attributed his previous difficulty managing his affairs to a severe drinking problem but indicated that he had not been drinking for six years. The uncle had never been declared incompetent to manage his affairs. He voluntarily transferred the land left to him by his father and had allowed the trust arrangement to continue since 1951. Over the years, the land was transferred from the original trustees to various other family members and was presently registered in the name of the applicant nephew. There was no dispute that the uncle was the beneficial owner.HELD: The land was vested directly in the name of Selwyn Hand. The conditional stay in place pending the resolution of this application for the appointment of a property guardian was lifted. 1)The proposed dependent adult was capable of managing a significant portion of his business affairs and matters relating to his estate and property. However he required significant independent assistance in the management of the land held for his benefit. His suggestions and proposal to sell the land and travel were reasonable and financially modest. 2)The criteria set forth in s18 for the appointment of a property guardian was met and the Public Trustee was appointed to administer the balance of the proceeds from the land sale remaining after the uncle pursued his financial commitments and his dreams.  3)Costs in the amount of $7,000 were to be paid to the applicant in the event the uncle chose to sell his land. 4)Any proposed sale would be subject to the approval of the Court upon application of Hand. One half of the proceeds were to be provided directly to Hand to be dealt with as he chooses and the remaining half were to be administered by the Public Trustee in his longer term best interests according to the normal powers and procedures of that office.","The applicant sought the appointment of a property guardian pursuant to s. 19 of The Dependent Adults Act. The applicant was a 76 year old gentleman who lived in the Biggar area of Saskatchewan and in 1994 moved to Estevan, where he established a relationship with the applicant's nephew. HELD: The application was granted. 1)The applicant met the criteria set forth in s. 18 for appointment as property guardian. 2)The application was in the best interests of the applicant. 3)The court found that the applicant was capable of managing some of his affairs. 4)The Court ordered that the land should firstly be vested directly in the name of Selwyn Hand. The court ordered that some of the proceeds from the land sale should be placed directly into his control to pursue his financial commitments and his day-to-day activities.

Section 37 of The Wills Act permits the Court to order a document to be fully effective as a Will notwithstanding that it was not executed in compliance with all the formal requirements imposed by the Act.

The parties agreed to Gabrielson J. receiving the report and neither party sought to cross-examine the writer of the report. HELD: Leave denied. Even if there was a scintilla of merit to the argument, the Court would not grant leave to appeal on the basis that to grant leave to appeal on an extremely technical ground would cause delay that is manifestly not in the best interest of the child in the circumstances of this case.

The result favoured joining the federation. The applicant applies under The Non-Profit Corporations Act, 1995 seeking sundry relief, the net result of which would set aside the outcome of the referendum. HELD: 1) The test emanating from the Controverted elections cases are not applicable. In debates of this type, the preferred guidance is from the test articulated in Walton (Litigation Guardian of) v. Saskatchewan Hockey Association and the related cases dealing with non-profit organizations. In those cases, the Court does not ask itself whether the results have been skewed, but rather has the organization acted in good faith and generally in accord with the concepts of natural justice? This does not mean that there must be an exacting legal process or an application of the full 'panoply' of procedural natural justice issues. The question is has the organization acted in a fashion that meets the legitimate expectations of a fair-minded observer? 2) No reasonable observer could conclude that the USC approached the post-vote process in good faith or in a fashion that is in harmony with the broad rules of natural justice. When faced with a result (rendered by a procedure which it had specifically established for the referendum) which was not consistent with its wishes, the USC simply ignored its own rules and imposed its own preordained outcome. Accordingly, the Court concluded that the USC breached its obligation to act in good faith and conducted itself in a fashion inconsistent with natural justice. The applicant is entitled to a portion of the relief he seeks.

6_1999skqb124.txt,"The plaintiff who had been employed by the defendant's predecessor for 23 years as office manager and bookkeeper until 1997, brought an action for damages against her new employers for dismissal without adequate notice. The plaintiff took stress leave and requested to be relieved of her duties as office manager in 1998. The action proceeded under the simplified procedure in Part Forty of the Queen's Bench Rules. HELD: 1)The conduct amounted to constructive dismissal entitling her to withdraw services without a reduction in the notice period. Although the defendant had numerous complaints the plaintiff was not dismissed for cause. Her termination of employment related only to her reduced position as bookkeeper which was for an indefinite period of time. Her employment had already been terminated by notice of nearly a year. She remained entitled to notice to March 31, 1999 at her salary at the time of termination and to medical expenses that would have been covered but without bonuses or extra payments for sick pay. 2)The defendant did not establish the plaintiff ought to have done more to mitigate her loss. There was no basis for punitive damages nor for an extension of the period of notice.  3)The net earnings between May 1998 and March 1999 were deducted after deducting $50 for the cost of qualifying for that employment.

Sections 45 and 46 of the Employment Insurance Act was drawn to their attention. 6)The plaintiff was awarded costs. Fees were to be taxed on column 2. 7)The plaintiff was to deliver a copy of the calculation of the judgment. Either could issue judgment with the other's consent as to form and content. An application for further directions could be made.","The plaintiff's action is for wrongful dismissal or, stating correctly, for damages for dismissal from her employment without adequate notice. The plaintiff was employed by the defendant Welding and Machine Shop for 23 years and had become the office manager, bookkeeper and, generally, the key office person. Her role included decision making, especially in matters relating to the accounts. The defendants are now fully aware of this process and object to an amount charged by the plaintiff for repairs which were completed during the defendant ownership but were not fully known to the new owners. HELD: The conduct to which she refers may be viewed as constructive dismissal and was accepted as such by her by letter on May 25, 1998. But her employment had already been terminated by notice of nearly a year. The employer is entitled to the benefit of the services of its employee during the period of notice but the defendant can therefore make no deduction for any such insurance payments made to the plaintiff. 1) Equal latitude may be required in the plaintiff's cross-examination of the defendant's witnesses. 2) There is to be deducted the amounts which are owing the plaintiff to the defendant. This does not include the Saxby account which predated the transfer of the business. The theory of notice is that at the end of the period the employment insurance benefits will remain unimpaired. 3) The defendant can only deduct the premiums made to plaintiff.

2005nsca64.txt,"The chambers judge refused to grant an adoption to a single mother of her own daughter as he determined that the child would not gain anything vis a vis the mother by such an adoption but would lose the potential for a relationship and support from her father. The evidence before the chambers judge was meagre but showed that the father had not seen the child for the past four years. The mother appealed., appeal dismissed; the chambers judge focused on the best interests of the child and did not fail to give appropriate consideration to the factors set out in the Act. He did not place too much emphasis on the child's loss of a potential relationship with and support from the father on the facts of this case.","The single mother appealed the November 2004 decision of the Court of Appeal refusing to grant her the adoption she sought with respect to her four year old daughter. The mother argued the chambers judge erred by placing too much emphasis on the child's loss of her possible relationship with and support from her father. The chambers judge did not err when he balanced the neutral impact the adoption would have on her relationship with her father against the loss of a possible relationship to her biological mother. HELD: Appeal dismissed. 1) The facts are scant, as acknowledged by the appellant, because the only evidence before the chambers court was the usual documentation provided to court with an application for an uncontested adoption. The child has been living with the appellant since birth. The father has had no contact with her and has worked for her present employer for approximately 2 years. There is no evidence as to why there has been no contact between the child and her father since November 2000 or whether he was or is presently able to provide financial support for her and whether the appellant ever sought child support. It is not known if the appellant and the child have lived with the father or anyone else or if there is contact between them and the extended families of either parent. 2) The appellant did not satisfy on the meagre facts available to him that he failed to take into account the applicable enumerated factors set out in s3(2)(n) in determining whether the proposed adoption was in the best interests of the child. He agreed that the father was not entitled to notice and was not required to consent to the adoption as a result of the interplay between s.67(1)(f) and s.70(1) of the Act. Section provides that child's parents have a legal duty to support their child if they are able. If the adoption was granted those statutory provisions would no longer apply and pursuant to s.80(1(b) the Act the child would cease to be her father's child, with the consequent loss of possible contact, support and inheritance. There was net loss to the child if the adoption were granted.  3) The evidence was scant because the appellant was not aware of the adoption application and did not identify and weigh the factors which should be considered in answering that question.

Mr. Russell sold the vehicle under consignment to the plaintiff for $1,600. The sales agreement indicated the vehicle was sold 'as is'. The purchaser returned the vehicle the next day because of a problem with the seat belt, a vibration or pulsation from the brakes and the 'check engine soon light' had come on. The plaintiff paid for the sensor replacement. Triple R absorbed the other costs of repair. The plaintiff's daughter continued to have problems with the car including with lower ball joints, exhaust system and motor mounts. At issue was whether or not a consignee is a 'retail seller' as defined in the Consumer Protection Act. HELD: The plaintiff was entitled to recover the $1,600 purchase price plus foreseeable damages which included costs of repairs and inspection totalling $242.35 and costs of $20 less a reduction of $1,542.35 for the 5,000 km it was driven. 1)A consignee is a retail seller within the meaning of the CPA and accordingly Triple R was deemed to have given the warranties set out in the CPA. If the legislature had intended that consignees were not to be considered retail sellers, it would have listed them in the excluded group. Persons may be considered retail sellers even though they have no contractual relationship to the purchaser in s.55. 2)While the plaintiff did not pay a large sum of money, he could still expect this vehicle to be safe to drive. It was not safe and accordingly was not of acceptable quality. The retail seller bears the burden of establishing the exceptions enumerated in the statutory warranty and failed to do so. The vehicle was unsafe from the outset and could not be considered suitable for the purpose of providing transportation. It was unnecessary to make a finding with respect to warranty s. 48(g) (durable for a reasonable period of time). 3)This auto was substantially unfit for all the usual purposes for which, to the knowledge of the retail seller, it was being bought and accordingly the breach was of a substantial character. 4)The plaintiff rejected the goods within a reasonable period. The commencement of the present action was treated as the rejection of the product. The bulk of delay was caused by the defendant's failure to pick up and look at the vehicle (and implication this would involve repair) as agreed.","This issue largely involved Part III of The Consumer Protection Act and inter alia, the question of whether or not a consignee is a'retail seller' as defined in that Part. HELD: The plaintiff was awarded $1542.35 plus costs of $20 for a total of $1563.35. 1) The defendant was a retail seller within the meaning of the Act and accordingly entitled to recover the purchase price of $1600 plus foreseeable damages. The costs incurred for repairs and inspection were foreseeable and properly recoverable.  2) The vehicle was driven almost 5,000 kilometres before the seriousness of the problem was discovered. The defendant's position remained that it was Mr. Oborowsky's problem and not Triple R's. 3) In the circumstances, the defendant did reject the goods within a reasonable period. 4) The plaintiff is awarded $1642 plus foreseeable and fully recoverable costs. 5) The court found that the defendant was in breach of any of the warranties set out in the Act. The plaintiff's total recovery would ordinarily be $1842."
c_2017skqb144.txt,"HELD: The application was granted. The court ordered that the property be sold and the proceeds of sale take into account the amount necessary to protect the respondent father’s claim. The Partition Act, 1868 applies in the province. It did not allow the equitable principles of unjust enrichment and constructive trust to operate to create a proprietary interest. The court found that s. 4 of the Act applied, which provides a monetary remedy so that if the respondent father could establish entitlement to some amount for his maintenance and improvement costs, he would be protected for that amount for his costs.","The sisters apply to have the partition and sale of a lake front recreational property partitioned by the parties. Each of the parties owns an undivided one quarter interest as tenants in common in the property. The parties inherited the property from their mother after her death in 1996. They are now separated and may have to sell the property to realize on its capital value. HELD: The application will be allowed. 1) The court has discretion to refuse partition under s. and a broader discretion exists. This necessitates determining whether it is s. or s. which operates in these circumstances. 2) When applying the Act the equities that might result in an unequal division of the sale proceeds are taken into account after the sale and are not used to determine the ownership interest of the title holder opposing partition or sale. In either case the remedy of constructive or resulting trust will give the respondents collectively an interest in the Property greater than 50%. 3) There are numerous authorities for the proposition that a joint tenant has a prima facie right to partition or a sale at any time. The Court can look to all of the circumstances of the transaction in order to determine whether there is another reason to deny recovery. 4) In seeking partition, it is hard to see how resulting trust can arise from contributions made over time to the improvement of an existing asset, or contributions in kind over time for its maintenance. This opens the door to consider the manner in which the parties organized their relationship and whether an injustice has arisen that without equity cannot be remedied. 5) In Kerr the court was clear that the law of unjust enrichment and the remedies flowing from it would not be applied differently in different areas of law."

e_2005skqb549.txt,"There is no dispute between the parties as to the nature of the plaintiff's investment in the defendant corporation. The real issue between the parties is whether the plaintiff is entitled to the summary relief, which she now seeks pursuant to Rules 129 and 133 of The Queen's Bench Rules. It is the position of the plaintiff that the cross- examination of the defendant on his affidavit discloses that the corporation is profitable company and that s. 34(2) of The Business Corporation Act does not provide any defence to the defendants against the requested relief sought. The parties are in disagreement over the issue of the amount of dividend payments that have been made by the corporation to the plaintiff pursuant to her investment in the corporation. HELD: 1) The plaintiff's application for summary judgment does not require the corporation to redeem any redeemable shares. Rather, the plaintiff's application is one seeking summary judgment. The corporate defendant is not making payment to redeem shares, but rather following judgment however and whenever obtained, it would be subject to the normal judgment process, including execution. Such execution or enforcement of judgment is not tantamount to redemption of shares. The plaintiff provided notice in writing to the corporation that she wished to redeem all her Class E preferred shares effective March 2005. The principal amount of her shares is $214,600. It is this amount that she seeks as the substance of her summary judgment. Section 34(2) of the Act does not serve to prevent the plaintiff seeking summary judgment from the court. The effect of granting judgment, if it is otherwise appropriate to do so, does not place the corporation in a position of breaching the prohibitions contained in s. 34(2) of the Act. 2) The defendants have not demonstrated that there is real insolvency on the part of the corporation. The defendants have failed to provide responses to the undertakings. Further, the defendants have not provided any professional analysis or evidence in support of their position that s. 34(2) is applicable. 3) The amount sought to be recovered by the plaintiff does represent debt or liquidated demand as contemplated by Rule 129. The plaintiff is entitled to summary judgment against the defendant corporation for the sum of $214,600 pursuant to Rule 129. Further the plaintiff is entitled to interest at the rate of 16% from March 2005 in accordance with the Share Agreement. 4) The plaintiff has not demonstrated an appropriate basis for summary judgment against the individual defendants. 5) The plaintiff is entitled to costs.","The plaintiff commenced an action against the defendants seeking various items of specific relief and costs on solicitor-client basis. There was no dispute between the parties as to the nature of the plaintiff's investment in the defendant corporation. The real issue was whether the plaintiff was entitled to the summary relief which she now sought. HELD: The application for summary judgment was brought under Queen's Bench Rules 129 and 133. The plaintiff's motion does not require the defendant to'make any payment to purchase' or to'redeem any redeemable shares'. The effect of granting a judgment, if it is otherwise appropriate to do so, does not place the corporation in a position of breaching the prohibitions contained in s34(2) of the Business Corporations Act.  1) There is no evidence before the Court to suggest any grounds for believing that the corporation is or would be insolvent as required by s. 34(2). 2) The cross-examination of the defendant did not provide any professional analysis or affidavit evidence in support of their proposition that s34 is applicable. Further, the defendants have not provided any professional Analysis or Affidavit evidence. 3) The plaintiff has not demonstrated that she is entitled to summary judgment on the basis of the affidavit filed by the defendants. 4) The affidavit of Donald Beveridge, sworn on July 15, 2005, did not require that the defendants make any payments to purchase or to redeem the plaintiff’s preferred shares. Rather, the plaintiff asserted that the corporate defendant was not making payment to redeem shares in essence but rather, following judgment however and whenever obtained, it would be subject to the normal judgment process, including execution. Such execution or enforcement is not tantamount to redemption of shares."
d_1997canlii14978.txt,"This was an appeal from an assessment of $5,454,000 in damages resulting from the appellant's liability to the respondent in tort for negligently prepared financial statements upon which the respondent relied in deciding to purchase the shares of a business. The appellants appealed. They argued that the trial judge, by measuring the respondent's loss on the basis that he should be put in the position he would have been if the financial statements had been accurate, had applied the wrong test. Allowing the appeal reducing the damage award to $2,745,600, that the trial judge erred in the test he applied to the award of damages. The proper test is to put the respondent as far as possible in the position he would have been in if he had not invested in the company. The damages are the amount by which the actual value of the company was less than what the respondent paid at the time of purchase.","This was an appeal from an assessment of damages flowing from the appellant's liability to the respondent in tort for negligently prepared financial statements upon which the respondent relied in deciding to purchase the shares of a business. The appellant was a businessman living in Port Hawkesbury who, on the basis of negligent misrepresentations respecting potential volume of petroleum sales, purchased a service station business. He was given no bargain that the throughput would amount to 200,000 gallons a year. The trial judge found that the appellant never would have purchased ABM had he known the true financial condition of the company. The exercise therefore was to put the respondent as far as possible in the position he would have been had he not invested in ABM. In particular, the damages were prima facie the amount by which the actual value of ABM was less than what the appellant paid for it. HELD: The appeal was allowed in part as it was the test for measuring damages for breach of a contractual warranty.  1)The trial judge had measured the loss on the footing that the respondent should be put in, had the financial statements been correct, having paid out the $800,000 he had spent on the business. This, being the test, was not the correct test.  2)The Court was not satisfied that the trial judge's assessment of the loss was correct. The Court was unable to determine the exact amount of loss suffered by the respondent. 3)It was impossible to perform that reconstruction. There are too many variables, many of which were not addressed in the evidence, presumably because the parties were satisfied that an attempt to unravel the transaction and establish the clients' position on the assumption that the transaction had not occurred was so complicated as to defy performance. The burden is on the respondent to establish his loss."

The lottery money was spent on household finances and lost in husband's small business venture. Husband 'spent more money on alcohol than he should have'. HELD: This did not amount to dissipation of matrimonial property within the meaning of the Act. Husband's mismanagement of the family's financial affairs was grounds for unequal division of the property:","The applicant sought a division of matrimonial property pursuant to the provisions of The Matrimonial Property Act and maintenance for the two youngest children pursuant to The Deserted Wives and Children's Maintenance Act. The parties were married in 1964 and shortly thereafter moved to Saskatchewan. They owned modest home and equity in the said home valued between $5,000 and $7,000. The family took more holidays and did more travelling. The respondent abused alcohol and spent more money on alcohol than he should have.

HELD: The evidence from the lawyer who prepared the Testator's last Will was that she was concerned that the testator was being influenced. The evidence from the executor of the Estate raises no such concerns. Based on the evidence, the conflict in the evidence and the law, the issue of undue influence cannot be resolved without a trial of the issue. A trial is ordered.","FIAT: The sister of the deceased testator, who died February 28, 2007 at the age of 86, asks that a hearing be ordered to prove his last will and testament in solemn form, for the purpose of determining whether the will was brought about by the exertion of undue influence on the testator by Barry Shade. HELD: 1) There shall be an order directing a trial to prove the last will of Roland Linkert.  2) There is a general principle of probate law emanating from the case of Barry v. Butlin (1838), 12 E.R. 1089. It is not necessary to have the viva voce evidence of Violet Beaudry on this application. 3) There will be a further order prohibiting the administration or disbursement of the estate without leave of the court until the issues referred to above are resolved by order of the Court or agreement of the parties. 4) The conflict in the evidence between the applicant and the executor of the November 3, 2005 Power of Attorney is apparent. 5) The court recognized the difficulty of proving the coercion which is part of the undue influence, and recognized the legitimacy of drawing inferences of an inference from undue influence."
e_2013skqb390.txt,"HELD: The Court sentenced the accused pursuant to s. 742.1 of the Criminal Code in force at the time of the offence that precluded the use of conditional sentence order for a serious personal injury offence, which included sexual assault. The Court found that the offences fell on the low end of the sexual assault spectrum as there was no skin to skin contact, the contact was brief and without violence or threats. The aggravating factors were that the accused had two previous convictions for sexual offences and that one of the victims had some cognitive disability. The accused was sentenced to a term of one year imprisonment for each count, followed by a term of probation of two years. The sentences were to be served concurrently.","The accused was found guilty of sexual assault contrary to s. 271 of the Criminal Code. The accused had two previous convictions of sexual interference on children, one for assault and one for sexual interference with a minor. The complainant and the accused both attended a house party where the accused moved onto the bed behind her and placed his hands down her pants, removed his pants and placed himself on top of her. When the complainant awoke, the accused kissed the complainant and touched her breasts and vaginal area, over and over again. The assault lasted 20 seconds. The Court of Appeal set aside the sentence and imposed a 20 month sentence of imprisonment. The respondent used physical force which distinguishes this case from the cases of fleeting touching and one involving the use of a physical force. HELD: The accused was convicted and sentenced to one year incarceration. 1) The relevant provisions of the Code in force at the time of these offences do not allow a conditional sentence. 2) There is no reason why the same starting point should not be used in a case such as this. The offences were singular incidents and there was no historical or ongoing abuse of the complainant. The court found that the accused presented a low risk to re-offend, either generally or sexually, and that he minimized his actions by claiming they were of disciplinary nature. He had no prior record for sexual offences. Aggravating factors included the abuse of person under 18, lack of remorse, sleeping complainant, and small degree of violence."
5_1994canlii5076.txt,"FIAT The accused, who was charged with two counts of sexual assault involving complainants 15 and 13 years of age, applied for a remedy under ss.24(1) of the Charter of Rights compelling the respondent to provide full disclosure to him, without trust conditions or undertakings of any sort. HELD: The imposition of trust conditions on the disclosure of victim's statements and videotaped statements in cases of sexual assault does not prevent the accused from exercising his right to make full answer and defence as guaranteed by ss. 7 and 11 of the Charter. The obligation to disclose is not absolute. The Corwn's obligation to protect the privacy of the complainants is fulfuilled by providing the statements and videotapes to counsel for the accused on trust condition that counsel retain them in his possession. The information contained therein is available to the accused and retained experts for use in preparing his defence. Since the accused knows the sustance of the complaints and, therefore, the case he has to meet, there is no danger to the fairness of the trial by virtue of the trust condition attached to disclosure. The public interest is served and the integrity of the criminal justice system is maintained when complainants are assured that staements and videotapes will not be reproduced. Application dismissed.",FIAT The accused applied for a remedy under s. 24(1) of the Charter and s. 650(3) of The Criminal Code compelling the respondent to provide full and complete disclosure to him. The accused contends not for less onerous trust conditions or undertakings but that disclosure be without trust condition or undertaking of any sort. HELD: The application was granted. 1)The Court found that the accused's constitutional rights and right to make full answer and defence had been infringed by the refusal of the Crown to provide disclosure without trust conditions and undertakings being imposed thereon. 2)The only issue for determination was whether the imposition of trust conditions on the disclosure of the victims' statements and videotapes were inconsistent with the right to disclosure which flows from the constitutional guarantee of fair trial. 3)The court found that placing conditions on disclosure did not constitute failure to disclose and an infringement of s. 4.The Court held that disclosure in criminal proceedings is now constitutionally required by law to be made available to the accused. 4)The application was made in the context of a policy applied to cases of sexual assault.
e_2013skqb434.txt,HELD: The Court granted the application. It held that: 1) a solicitor-client relationship was created between the applicants and the defendants based on the evidence; and 2) that the applicants had not rebutted the presumption that they had received confidential information during the meeting that was relevant to the plaintiff’s action against the defendants. That finding was sufficient to disqualify them for acting for the plaintiff.,"The sole issue presented by this application is whether Mervin C. Phillips and the lawyers with Phillips Co. should be disqualified from continuing to act for the plaintiff because of a conflict of interest. At its core, the action between Pearce-Ell and the Holgates pertains to the terms of the agreement for sale, which is the same matter, or at the very least, a related matter to the original retainer. That alone is sufficient to justify their disqualification. The same result is achieved by applying the Martin principles and presumptions. As Mr. Phillips possessed relevant confidential information from a former client which could prejudice them in the within action, disqualification is generally automatic."
e_2011skqb467.txt,"The complainant and the accused were in relationship and came to Regina where they stayed in hotel, drank, consumed cocaine and shopped. An argument ensued about missing shopping bag. The accused was charged with two counts of uttering death threats to the complainant; unlawfully confining the complainant; assault causing bodily harm on the complainant; committing sexual assault on the complainant; breach of recognizance in having contact with the complainant. At trial, both the complainant and the accused testified as to what transpired during the argument that resulted in the charges. HELD: 1) The accused was found not guilty of sexual assault. 2) The accused was found guilty of unlawful confinement. 3) The accused was found guilty of assault causing bodily harm. The Court did not accept the accused's invoking of self-defence pursuant to s. 34(1) of the Criminal Code. The accused admitted to striking the complainant with a closed fist five times as hard as he could and the force used was excessive. 4) The accused was found guilty of threatening to kill the complainant at the hotel. 5) The accused was found guilty of uttering death threats and breach of recognizance by contacting the complainant. The Court did not accept his testimony and denial.","The defendant was found not guilty of sexual assault, assault causing bodily harm, unlawful confinement, two counts of uttering death threats, and breaching his recognizance. The complainant swore she tried to flee several times after the melee in the hotel room, but the defendant physically prevented her from doing so. During the events at the Coachman Hotel in Regina, the defendant threatened to kill the complainant, and the complainant was guilty of this charge. HELD: The defendant was not guilty. The Crown has proven each required element of this offence beyond a reasonable doubt.  1) The complainant's evidence and the Crown's assessment of all the evidence raise no doubt as to the guilt of the defendant on these two charges. 2) The defendant's testimony did not raise any doubt. 3) There is no requirement that the defendant measure his force to a nicety, here the force used was excessive. 4) While there is no evidence that the complainant's strength and physical prowess (while contemporaneously alleging she was severely intoxicated) did not explain his reaction to her mental state, the court found as a fact that he was the initial attacker. 5) The Court found the defendant guilty of the sexual assault charge. The elements required for self-defence are not present. The defendant knew the complainant had tried to leave the hotel and had not been arrested as he was back in Rocanville. He knew that she was trying to leave, and he was going to kill her. He was very large, muscular man. His description of the parties' behaviour following the altercation defies belief. The court found that an accused who was strong and who hit the victim twice in the face was, at the very least, reckless in his use of force. The Court also found that the accused, who struck the complainant with a closed fist five times as hard as he could, did not intend to cause death to her contrary to s. 277(2) of the Criminal Code. He is a very large and muscular man and the defendant is not reckless in the application of force; however, the Court found that he is guilty of both charges."

The Shareholders' Agreement obliged all shareholders to vote their shares so as to confirm the nominees of certain shareholders, thereby freezing the board composition without regard for its performance. As a result the board was dominated by the original Precision group of shareholders and even though the Government of Saskatchewan and Bondco were entitled to enough votes to exercise control of the company, they could not change the board and did not have the usual ways of enforcing their wishes. Members of Bondco were concerned that jobs were being obtained in Saskatoon at the expense of Rosetown jobs and the economic spin-offs expected from their $800,000 investment were not being realized in Rosetown due to the opening of the Saskatoon facility. An application was brought under s234 of the Business Corporations Act. They sought a restraining order enforcing the covenant, an order appointing new directors, an order of compensation for breach of contract and an order directing the closure of the Saskatoon operation and the return of company assets to Rosetown district unless Bondco granted written consent. HELD: It was ordered that 1)the Shareholders Agreement was amended deleting the offending paragraph concerning the Board of Directors and substituting a new paragraph; 2)certain provisions of the Articles of Continuance as amended were suspended until the Termination Date; 3)the present board was suspended pending the election of directors at a special meeting of shareholders; 4)the respondent was enjoined from moving its operations and from transferring or hiring employees at any place other than Rosetown District unless Bonco's written consent was filed with the Court. 5)The Chief Executive Officer was not displaced nor was the Saskatoon operation directed to be closed.  6)Bonco was entitled to its taxable costs against the individual respondents.","This motion raised the question of the right of a corporate board to breach its undertaking to remain in a small community when it had taken advantage of the government-sponsored community bond program in order to establish its business.

While there was no direct evidence to establish the plaintiff set the fire himself, the inference was drawn that he did or, in the alternative, caused someone else to do so.  2)Had the plaintiff been in the mobile home he should have been suffering to some degree from carbon monoxide poisoning, he should have been coughing, his hair should have been singed, he would have had soot on his face and his clothes would have smelled of smoke. 3)The plaintiff did not call evidence to rebut the fire investigator's opinion that a significant quantity of fire accelerant had been used nor was his brother called to confirm his testimony that he attempted to re-enter the mobile home after arranging for the fire department to be called.","The plaintiff's residence, mobile home and contents were insured with the defendant.

The medical evidence conflicted as to whether the injuries were the cause of the continued pain. Awarding $25,000 valued at date of judgment with an adjusted interest rate.

The bankrupt supported four children and had been discharged from the military due to illness arising from her active service. The bankrupt will be entitled to an absolute discharge once certain conditions are met, including the payment of one month's rent, the value of the horses and surplus income for nine months to the Trustee. The bankrupt's disability pension from Veterans' Affairs was not included in the calculation of surplus income as the public policy reason behind the exemption for proceeds received due to personal injury and a soldier's danger pay applied to this disability pension. The Trustee had no claim to the insurance proceeds received by the bankrupt following the loss of her home by fire as it was a modest sum used to replace lost personal exempt assets; the three horses were found to be owned by the bankrupt as opposed to her children, for whom she had purchased them as pets and were included in the value of her estate; the court exercised its discretion in determining the amount of surplus income, noting that the administration of the estate had been unusually hostile and it was important that the bankrupt be able to stabilize her family finances.","The applicant sought to be discharged from bankruptcy. She owned a ride-on lawnmower and horse trailer. The Trustee claimed ownership and sought to keep them in compensation for the certain exempt personal property which had been taken from her.

She paid $500 for rent and $300 for the horses. She provided bank statements for twelve months prior to her bankruptcy. 2)Technically with the bankruptcy they become the property of the trustee. The trustee has discretion in determining surplus income. It is appropriate that she as condition of her discharge pay surplus income of $325 per month for the basic bankruptcy period of 9 months. 3)In the present situation, one can fairly say that one or more of the children have acquired title to the horses and that their mother owns them and provides for them. 4)The trustee is responsible for the loss of household goods which under section 45 of the Judicature Act are exempt. 5)The court reviewed the definition of 'income' and'revenue' in the context of determining whether a care giver amount under s.68 is an asset. The judge concluded that the net proceeds the trustee can receive for an asset after covering all expenses in selling it.

He signed a 5-year, 10 mile non-competition clause in 1995. He quit in early March with the intention of opening a new drug store down the street in early April. Other key staff members intended to quit and work in the new store. The applicant moved for an interim injunction to prevent the respondent from opening his store pending the hearing of their motion for an interlocutory injunction. Interim injunction granted. The new Civil Procedure Rules (2008) distinguish between interim and interlocutory injunctions. This is one of the circumstances which was contemplated when the new Rule 41.04 was enacted. Urgency exists and the applicant can't wait. While the non-competition clause may well not survive a challenge at the full hearing of the interlocutory injunction motion, all the applicant needs to show is that there is a serious issue to be tried. There is. This isn't a frivolous or vexatious application. There's a high potential for the applicant to suffer irreparable harm (e.g. the loss of customers, market share) especially given that this is a small community. An interim injunction will only result in a delay of a few weeks. The interlocutory injunction is set to heard at the end of April. The stakes are higher for the applicant than they are for the respondent.","The plaintiff brought a motion for an interim injunction to prevent the defendant from operating a drug store within 10 miles of the plaintiff's business for years after the end of his employment. The applicant sought an interlocutory injunction in the amount of 30 days. HELD: Interim injunction granted. 1)The applicant was facing only the postponement of the opening for a few weeks. The stakes were much higher for the Plaintiff's existing business.  2)There was a high potential for irreparable harm to the plaintiff company - the loss of customers, market share, though difficult to quantify, is real and is the type of harm contemplated by this branch of the test. The balance of convenience favored the applicant.  3)The application was not frivolous or vexatious. The impending and imminent opening of the new business satisfies the requirement that 41.04 2 (c) that urgency exists and cannot await the determination of the motion for interlutory injunction.

The Crown was not obligated to acquit him. 4) The respondent was acquitted of the charge of impaired driving."
5_2005skqb219.txt,"The accused has been in custody since November 17, 2004. After show cause hearings, the court refused to release the accused from detention. The accused apply for a review of the detention orders. HELD: 1) A review of the detention orders would ordinarily be cursory and the applications dismissed. The reasons for the decisions to refuse to release the accused cannot seriously be questioned. 2) However, a factor that causes concern is that 6 months after their arrest, not only has a preliminary hearing not been conducted, no date for a preliminary hearing has been set. No preliminary hearing date will be set before May 2005. The preliminary hearing will take 2 to 3 weeks.  It seems unlikely that the trial of these individuals will take place within a year of the date of their arrest. 3) They are ordered released on terms and upon the filing of security in the amount of $1,000.","The accused were charged with a multitude of offences pursuant to the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act, S.S. 1996, c.19 and the Criminal Code, which include trafficking in cocaine and methamphetamine, conspiracy to do so with one another and several other individuals, and several Criminal Code offences, including possession of proceeds of crime. Both individuals were in custody since November 2004. After a show cause hearing, her Honour Judge refused to release the accused.

e_2014skqb265.txt,The determination of whether the trial judge’s conclusion regarding the officer’s suspicion was reasonable was question of law subject to the correctness standard. The respondent conceded that the officer had the requisite subjective belief that he had alcohol in his body so the appeal centered on whether the objective test had been met. The appeal court did not find any basis to disturb the trial judge’s finding of fact as to the factors the officer based his suspicion of alcohol consumption on. The court noted the trouble with the fact that the respondent admitted to drinking alcohol that “evening” but the stop was at 5:00 am in the morning. The trial judge disregarded the respondent’s admission to drinking because there was no smell of alcohol and the trial judge said there should be if the consumption was recent. The court concluded that the trial judge erred in dismissing the alcohol consumption admission. A reasonable person would have assumed that the officer’s question was with respect to recent consumption of alcohol not an earlier irrelevant time. It was also found reasonable for the officer to believe the consumption was recent. The court concluded that a reasonable person standing in the officer’s place would reasonably suspect that the respondent had alcohol in his body. An answer by an accused person that they have been drinking was found to be stronger support for a suspicion than the smell of alcohol. Because the respondent’s Charter rights were not breached a new trial was ordered.,"The accused was charged with impaired driving contrary to s. 253(1)(a) of the Criminal Code and operating a motor vehicle when the concentration of alcohol in his blood exceeded 80 milligrams. The accused challenged the reasonableness of the investigating officer's suspicion upon which the officer based his ASD demand. The Crown appealed the acquittals of both of the charges. HELD: The appeal concerns whether that suspicion, based on the facts as found by the trial judge, satisfies the objective requirement of s. 254(2)(b). 1) The trial judge specifically found that the accused relied only on three factors in forming his suspicion. This is a finding of fact and there is no basis for disturbing this finding. 2) The Court reviewed the meaning of reasonable suspicion set out by the Supreme Court of Canada in R. v. Labrie, 2012 SKCA 63 (CanLII), [2009] S.C.R. 527. 3) The court reviewed how the standard of review to be applied on an appeal under this section was set out. The standard was correctness and the Court did not second guess trial judge's findings or substitute its own view just because it would have decided the matter differently. The Court was not satisfied that trial judge had the requisite reasonable suspicion to make an approved screening device demand on the accused."

HELD: The sentence was varied by reducing the term of probation to 1 year and by deleting the provisions concerning possession and consumption of alcohol, entry into premises where alcohol is sold and consumed, and submission to breath or blood testing. A period of probation was appropriate but 3 years was out of proportion to the nature of the offence. The inclusion of a term prohibiting him from consuming alcohol was inappropriate since it had no relation to the purpose of the original recognizance.","The offence was breach of a recognizance made under the authority of s. 810.1 of the Criminal Code, the purpose of which is to prevent further sexual offences against persons under the age of 14 years. The Crown admitted that there was no nexus between consumption of alcohol on the part of the appellant and his propensity to paedophilia. HELD: The appeal was allowed. The sentence was varied by reducing the term of probation to one year and by deleting the provisions concerning possession of alcohol, entry into premises where alcohol is sold and consumed, and submission to breath or blood testing.

c_1998canlii14058.txt,"FIAT. An application pursuant to Rule 188 for a determination of whether the defendant was liable pursuant to s86(1) of the Highway Traffic Act for the personal injuries of the infant plaintiff or was immune from liability by virtue of s228 [now s232] of the Education Act. The second point of law to be determined was whether the co-defendant as car owner was liable if the driver was found to be immune from liability. The motor vehicle accident occurred while the infant plaintiff was being transported during a field trip, approved by the defendant school board, and the defendant was the teacher. HELD: 1)The teacher/driver was acting within the scope of her duties and was immune from liability by virtue of the Education Act. 2)The owner was only liable to the same extent as the driver. The reasoning in Neault was directly on point. Just as the Workers' Compensation Act and the Highway Traffic Act prevent the injured worker from suing the owner of the vehicle because he is prevented from suing the driver, the Education Act extends the same immunity to the owner as it does to the driver by operation of s86(1) of the Highway Traffic Act. 3)There was no apparent conflict between the statutes. When read together, the legislation provides that a negligent teacher is granted immunity from liability if the teacher has acted within the scope of the Education Act. The Traffic Act is the general statute, governing liability of all drivers. The Court did not agree with the School Board's analysis that the Education Act was the general statute. 4)The injured plaintiff was not denied a party to sue for negligent operation of a vehicle as he had recourse against the school board and its insurer. The immunity under the Education Act only applies to teachers and principals.","FIAT. The plaintiff was a student at a school operated by the defendant, the Board of Education of the Parkland School Division, No. 63 of Saskatchewan. The defendant was the teacher within the meaning of the provisions of the Education Act. At all material times the automobile was not stolen or otherwise wrongfully taken out of the possession of the defendant nor out of his possession. The vehicle was involved in a motor vehicle collision resulting in the plaintiff's bodily injury and resulting loss and damage. The co-defendant was the owner of the vehicle. In the event the plaintiff was not liable, the school board would have to maintain insurance to indemnify the board and its teachers acting within the scope of their duties. HELD: The Education Act is the general statute dealing with teacher's liability and immunity in a general way. The immunity only applies to teachers and principals. 1)In the event Edith Larsen is immune from liability by virtue of s. 228 of the Highway Traffic Act, the School Board is liable. 2)There is no apparent conflict between the statutes. The legislation provides that negligent teacher/driver is granted immunity from liability if the teacher has acted within the s.228 of the Act. Even if there were an apparent conflict, the Act must yield to those of special one.  3)The Education Act specifically provides an immunity to a teacher when acting within s228 of The Act. The protection only applied to schoolteachers and principals who were liable for the plaintiffs injuries.  4)The school board was not able to find in favour of the Board. Edith was immune from the liability by s.231 of The Highway Traffic act for the personal injuries suffered by the plaintiff.  5)The School Board was not in a position to find that the teacher's immunity under the Act extended to the owner."
5_2004skqb417.txt,"Each party has applied for a variation of the judgment granted by Gunn J. in April 1999. The judgment incorporates the terms of an Interspousal Contract dated April 1999 that provides for basic child support to be paid by the petitioner in the amount of $1,411 per month. The calculation of child support in the Interspousal Contract was based on the petitioner earning $110,000. The petitioner seeks to have child support reduced for Kimberly and discontinued for Ashley. The petitioner has unilaterally terminated support for Ashley on the basis that she is over 18 years of age and not in full time attendance at school. The respondent seeks an upward variation of ongoing child support for Kimberly on the basis that the petitioner's income is significantly higher than $110,000. She also seeks a retroactive variation of support paid for both girls. HELD: 1) The parties agree that much of the petitioner's income since the separation has included significant amounts of non-recurring income in the form of capital gains, stock options and severance pay. In accordance with s. 16 of the Guidelines, a payor's income for child support purposes is determined based on total income, adjusted in accordance with Schedule III, as shown on his or her income tax return. The petitioner has provided no compelling reason to exclude any of his non-recurring income. To the contrary, it is the fairest way of proceeding. The petitioner's income since separation discloses that non-recurring income can realistically be anticipated in the future, as it has constituted a significant portion of his income in four of the last five years. The fairest way of determining the appropriate level of child support is by calculating it based on his income during the previous year. 2) The petitioner's line 150 income on his 2003 income tax return was $199,922. This includes $114,454 of non-recurring capital gain income from the sale of shares in Poplar Hill Resources. It does not include the non-taxable portion of that capital gain in the same amount. Pursuant to Clause 6 of Schedule III referred to in s. 16 of the Guidelines, this non-taxable amount is to be included as an adjustment to income. This results in the petitioner's 2003 income for child support purposes being $314,376. However, in examining documents provided by the petitioner regarding his previous year's income, it is apparent that he incurred net capital losses in 2002 of $65,424. The Court imputed $150,000 of income to the petitioner for the year 2002 despite this net capital loss and his line 150 income being only $2,410. It is therefore reasonable that this capital loss be deducted from the non-taxable portion of the capital gain he realized in 2003. This results in only $49,030 of the non-taxable portion of the 2003 capital gain being added to income for total income of $248,952. Based on the Guidelines, child support of $1,928 would be payable for Kimberly.  3) During the same year that the petitioner was enjoying income in excess of $248,000, the respondent's income for herself and the two children was only $24,345. It is self-evident that the petitioner has a substantially greater ability to provide financial support for Kimberly than does the respondent. In the circumstances it is appropriate that one-half of the Guideline amount for the petitioner's income in excess of $150,000 be payable as child support. Effective January 1, 2004, the petitioner shall pay monthly child support for Kimberly of $1,557.  4) Ashley did not complete grade 12 until June 2003. In the normal course, she would have graduated in June 2002, but she was short some classes. The required classes were not available in September 2002 so she did not return to school until the new semester in January 2003. Although Ashley was not in full time attendance in school during the last six months of 2002, she had not yet completed her basic education and had every intention of doing so. She was not in a position to withdraw from her parent's support. Considering the disparity in the ability of each of her parent to contribute to her support, it is appropriate that support for Ashley be the amount determined by applying the Guidelines as if she were a child under the age of majority.  5) A written request by the respondent for the petitioner to provide copies of his income tax returns is not required because the parties incorporated a positive obligation to exchange tax returns in their Interspousal Contract. Consistent with the objectives of the Guidelines and implicit in the Interspousal Contract the parties must have understood that the petitioner's child support obligation could change if his income changed. 6) This is clearly a case where a retroactive variation is warranted. No variation can be considered for 1999, the year of the Interspousal Contract and the judgment. Given the various sources of the petitioner's income and the significant annual fluctuations in his income, it is appropriate to use his previous year's income as the basis for calculation of his child support payable in the subsequent year. The Court went on to calculate the petitioner's income and the child support payable for each year. 7) In 2002 the petitioner's line 150 income was only $2,410. Given the pattern of the petitioner's income in the three preceding years, along with the fact that he disposed of capital assets in 2003 that generated undisclosed cash flow, and, some 2 years later, he nevertheless retains significant net assets, the Court imputed additional income to the petitioner of $150,000 for child support purposes. 8) The respondent was awarded costs set at $2,600.","Each party applied for a variation of the 1999 divorce judgment. The parties separated in 1997 and shortly thereafter Mr. Marzolf moved to Alberta. The 1999 judgment contained the terms of an Interspousal Contract which provided for basic child support to be paid by the respondent in the amount of $1,411 per month. The respondent sought an upward variation of support for Kimberly born April 2, 1992 and entirely discontinued for Ashley born April 4, 1984. HELD: 1) Given the various sources of income and the significant annual fluctuations in his income, it is appropriate to use his previous year's income as the basis for calculation of child support payable in the subsequent year. It is also reasonable that this capital loss be deducted from the non-taxable portion of the capital gain he realized in 2003.  2) Based on the Guidelines and an annual income of $248,952.25 the respondent has a substantially greater ability to provide financial support for the child than does the respondent. 3) The respondent deposed that she had not had the resources to provide lifestyle for the children similar to the one they enjoyed prior to their parent's separation. In these circumstances, she was not in a position to withdraw from her parents' support. 4) Given that the respondent's income in 2003 was significantly higher than what he earned while the parties were together, it was self-evident that his income in that year would be substantially greater than that of his wife. Given the unpredictable, variable and to some degree speculative aspect of much of his post-separation income, the court has discretion as to whether the Guideline amount or some other amount should be used to calculate child support on income in excess of $150,000."
d_1998canlii4665.txt,"The primary issue in this appeal was the standard of review to be applied on appeals from a Hearing Officer to the Workers' Compensation Appeals Tribunal. The appellant had his appeal denied on the grounds that the decision of the Hearing Officer was not patently unreasonable. Allowing the appeal and remitting the matter for re-hearing, that an appeal from a Hearing Officer to the Tribunal is a statutory appeal. It is not a judicial review, and the standard of review is therefore one of correctness not whether or not the Hearing Officer's decision was patently unreasonable. The deference that the Tribunal must show is only with respect to the advantages the Hearing Officer may have in the fact finding process of a particular case.","This was an appeal for leave from a Worker's Compensation Appeals Tribunal decision dated October 25, 1996. It is limited to a question as to the jurisdiction of the Tribunal and the Court concurring. The concept of patently unreasonable decision has no place in this statutory appeal process. The appeal is allowed and the matter is remitted to the Tribunal as per oral reasons. An appeal from the Hearing Officer to the tribunal is a statutory appeal and it is not a judicial review.

The plaintiff was not included in his father's Will as a beneficiary and the Will contained no reference to the mortgage debt. The father's statement of assets filed in his divorce and matrimonial property action did not disclose it as an asset. HELD: 1)The unsigned handwritten memorandum evidenced a binding agreement for lease between the plaintiff and his father. He affirmed the lease in his discussions with a daughter. 2)The plaintiff neither repudiated the lease nor failed to complete his obligations under it.  The fact that he did not vigorously contest the right of his brother to farm the land on behalf of the estate did not estop him from suing for damages for his father's breach of the lease.  Damages of $6,500 were awarded. 3)The plaintiff failed to establish a quantum meruit claim. He did not produce any documents to show he had been reimbursed for his labour on the farm in prior years. Other family members helped with the farming from time to time. He did nothing while his father was alive to demand or obtain payment. 4)Even if the mortgage was considered a debt in 1989 it was subsequently forgiven.

b_2016skpc86.txt,"HELD: The court found that the child was in need of protection under s. 11(b) of The Child and Family Services Act, that his parents were unable to care for him, and that physical or emotional harm was likely to occur to him. J.A.’s mother was found to be a person of sufficient interest under s. 23 of the Act. The court ordered that the child should be placed in the custody of J.A.’s mother as a person of sufficient interest for a period of four months pursuant to s. 37(1)(b) of the Act. The child’s parents should have adequate access to build their relationship with him and to allow them, with the assistance of others, to come up with a plan that would allow them to eventually care for their child.","HELD: The order was made under s. 23 of the Child and Family Services Act. The child was apprehended at birth by the Minister of Social Services but the Minister did not proceed with the application and the parents were allowed to take the child home with them. The parents were not able to care for the child and there was a risk that physical or emotional harm would occur to the child. The plan was to return the child to the parents' care in the same location as on November 23, 2015 with the support of grandfather BA, who was living there on the apprehension date, and a friend and neighbour of BA's. The mother was not satisfied on the evidence presented that the care these young parents could as of today provide for this child would result in WBA not being in need of protection. Having found that WBA is in need protection under s11(b), that then leads to the question of what order should be made."
2_2006nsfc7.txt,"Although the mother initially had sole custody of the parties' two children, they were placed in the joint custody of both parents, with primary care and control with the father, when the mother was hospitalized due to mental health disturbances. When the children were not later returned to her care, the mother brought an application to vary the primary care arrangements, alleging that the children were not receiving suitable and appropriate parenting while in the father's care. The father, who lived close to the maternal grandparents and relied upon them extensively for the care of the children, questioned the mother's emotional and mental health and stability. The transfer of primary care of the children to the mother is conditional upon the fulfillment of several provisions and prohibitions, including the mother's disclosure to her mental health caregivers of any alcohol consumption and the recent harassing phone calls made by her; should the parents be unable or unwilling to cooperate with the court directives, the court will consider filing a report of neglect under the Children and Family Services Act; primary care and access will be reviewed by the court in six months time. The children were at considerable risk if placed in the primary care of either parent; the evidence showed that the father was unable to meet the children's needs on a daily basis; in addition to his questionable parenting judgment, his regular daily drug use in circumstances where the family lived in poverty and one child had an asthmatic medical condition showed that he placed a higher priority on his relationship with marijuana than his primary responsibility as protector of his children. Although the mother's parenting plan was well-conceived, the court questioned whether she could withstand the daily pressure of raising the children and noted her past habit of consuming alcohol while taking medication.","The mother applied for a change in the primary care arrangements for the two children. Pursuant to the Maintenance and Custody Act, the mother applies to vary in order to preserve the present arrangement vesting primary and day care and control of the children with him, subject to access times with their mother. The father is currently employed as a roofer and is unable to drive a motor vehicle, having accumulated a myriad of driving infractions to add to his already lengthy criminal record. The mother's plan is well conceived, however, it is the execution of her plan which causes concern for the Court. HELD: The Court found that the children were at considerable risk if placed in the care and custody of either parent. The parents' relationship with their children was worsened by the persistent and daily use of marijuana. The children were exposed to daily and troublesome drug use by the father, emotionally upset by series of broken promises by their father, exposed to violent physical and verbal attacks by her current common-law partner, and exposed to the ongoing strain of poor relations with the father. The Court was of the opinion that the mother's current drug habit had an adverse effect on the children's short and long term care. It was also of concern to the Court that the father's current habit of consuming alcohol while in the day care of the mother had compromised his emotional and mental well being and stability."

b_2002nsca30.txt,"A fifteen year old died in a motor vehicle accident. The estate brought a claim for loss of future income and lost earning capacity. The Chambers judge found that such a claim was not available and the estate appealed. Appeal dismissed; the context of the legislation, its purpose and text all support the conclusion that the deceased's loss of prospective earnings is not an actual pecuniary loss to the estate.","Where a person is killed due to the fault of another, the person's estate may sue the wrongdoer for certain damages which have resulted in an actual pecuniary loss to the estate. This is a rich and complicated background against which they must be interpreted. The Nova Scotia survival of actions legislation contained several exclusions and limitations not found in the earlier Ontario and English legislation. The appellants relied on allegedly wrongful acts of the respondent for which the respondent could have sued had he been injured rather than killed. The deceased's dependants had no separate claim for the loss of support suffered directly by them as result of the wrongful act because no cause of action for wrongful death was recognized. The only question on this appeal is whether the estate has right to claim damages under the Survival of Actions Act in respect to the deceased's loss of expectation of life. HELD: The Court dismissed the appeal. 1) There was no trial in this matter. The facts before the Court are those agreed to by the parties for the limited purpose of resolving a preliminary point of law. The statute has been amended several times with respect to both the types of damages that are recoverable and the definition of the persons for whose benefit the action may be brought. 2) In Nova Scotia's legislation, the estate was not entitled to do so because loss of future earning capacity does not constitute an 'actual pecuniaiary loss' as required by the Survival Of Actions Act. 3) Nova Scotia legislation does not do away entirely with the common law rule barring wrongful death actions. Rather, it only modifies the rule in specific ways. The claim under the legislation is limited to defined class of persons. The rights conferred under it were in addition to and not in derogation of rights of dependants under the Fatal Injuries Act. The current form of the Act retains these features."

2_2007nsca122.txt,"Two days after the wife commenced a divorce action in Nova Scotia, the husband commenced one in Texas. He successfully applied to have the wife's divorce petition set aside on the grounds that she had not been ordinarily resident in Nova Scotia for at least one year immediately prior to the commencement of the proceeding. The wife applied for a stay of execution pending her appeal of this decision. She argued irreparable harm to herself and the parties' child on the basis that if the stay was refused, she would be required to travel to take part in the Texas proceeding, leaving her law practice for an extended time and uprooting the child who was settled in school here. She also feared that she would be found in contempt for failing to obey the Texas custody orders and be imprisoned. Application for stay pending appeal dismissed; the irreparable harm claimed by the appellant was entirely speculative at this point as if the Texas court did grant custody to the father, under the Child Abduction Act, a Nova Scotia court would have jurisdiction to determine the child's habitual residence and whether the appellant was wrongfully detaining him here. Given that the Texas court would be free to continue its proceeding even if a stay was granted, until such time as the conflict of laws issue was resolved, it would be risky for the appellant not to participate in the process there. Furthermore, the order under appeal was not one that lent itself to being stayed under Rule 62.20.","The appellant appeals from and applies for a stay of execution of an order setting aside her petition for divorce made by the Supreme Court of Canada (Family Division). On an application by the respondent to set aside the divorce petition on the basis that Nova Scotia lacked jurisdiction, Justice Wilson determined that the appellant had not been ordinarily resident in Nova Scotia for at least one year prior to filing the petition, as required by s.3 of the Divorce Act. Pursuant to that statute, a Nova Scotia court would have jurisdiction to determine the respondent's habitual residence and if the appellant was wrongfully retaining the child there. Since Nova Scotia is not a reciprocating state pursuant to the Reciprocal Enforcement of Custody Orders Act, 1989, R.S.NS, c. 387, the Child Abduction Act and the Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child abduction would be applicable.

That is the loss of profit that the plaintiff's claim is based on multiplied by 297.957 and totals $10,875.43. 3) The part performance involving the sale under the contract of 2.043 tonnes is sufficient to meet the requirements of The Sale of Goods Act.","The plaintiff farmer was in the business of buying and selling grain. The defendant agreed to sell 300 metric tonnes of flax at a net price of $264.65 per tonne after calling several times to determine the market price for flax.

Each party will bear their own costs; the court had no confidence that any offer made by either party, short of 100 per cent vindication, could have resolved the case in advance of trial.","This was one of those cases where there was no clear winner. Both parties contributed to the trial, the complexities of the issues and the attitude of the parties leading up to and during the trial. The plaintiff felt greater entitlement to costs generally and double costs after trial. HELD: The Court held that it would not award costs and the parties would bear their own costs. 1) Rule 41A offers when assessing costs post trial. There was no doubt that any offer made by either the plaintiff or the defendant would have resolved this case in advance of trial. However, in this particular case the Court had no confidence any offer by either party would have been resolved. 2) There were problems associated with the construction of this home where both parties contributed materially. This was clearly the case with deficiencies. Force Construction Limited were often sloppy in their construction. Ms. Campbell refused to recognize proper deficiencies that should have resolved pursuant to the building contract. There is also an element of this joint contribution in relation to the septic system. The intent of rule 41A is to induce settlements and avoid trials. There should be a departure from the prima facie operation of the rule only where the interests of justice clearly require it. It was not necessary for them to continue with the peat system when the conventional system proved unworkable. They were the party most responsible for the necessity of the case."
2_2007nssc40.txt,"Following the collapse of the roofs of two buildings in Newfoundland, both of which were constructed with open web steel joists fabricated by the same company, the Nova Scotia government wrote to owners of buildings containing these joists, including the plaintiff mall owner, recommending that the joists be inspected by a qualified professional engineer. An inspection of the mall roof revealed that 10.5 per cent of the joists inspected had at least one panel point with a broken or missing weld and the same remediation scheme as that implemented by the Province for the government's own buildings was recommended. The plaintiff, concerned with safety issues arising from the report, followed the consultant's recommendations and undertook remediation of the mall and then claimed against the defendant, which was the parent company of the corporate entity which had fabricated the joists. The defendant's expert took the position that although the actual repairs to the welding and webs of the open steel joists was necessary, the reinforcing of the joists undertaken in the remediation was not required in order to mitigate the danger. Judgment for the plaintiff; there were defects in the open web steel joists at the mall which constituted a real and substantial danger to the occupants; this danger was caused by the defendant's negligence and the remediation program carried out at the mall was necessary to alleviate the real and substantial danger. There were internal problems with the welds which could not be discovered by non-destructive inspection and the lack of proper welding procedures and quality control issues at the company prevented one from having confidence in any welds fabricated by them, at least based on external observations.","The Mayflower Mall was constructed in 1979. The owners, concerned with safety issues arising from the report, followed the consultants' recommendation and undertook the remediation of the mall. Burnac Corporation, the owner, claimed against the respondent for the cost of the inspection and remediation. HELD: 1) The actual repairs to the welding and webs of the open web steel joists were necessary, but the reinforcing of the joists was not necessary to repair defects. 2) The failure rate of the welds was 8.3%. 3) The quality control of the quality of welding during the fabrication of joists is poor with weld failures and poor fit up noted throughout. 4) The remediation scheme was proposed with buildings categorized on the basis of the percentage failure and age. In buildings that had satisfactorily performed for twenty years and had failure rates of 1% or less, only failed welds or members would be repaired. 5) The respondent followed the recommendations of the consultants, followed by a detailed inspection by a division of the respondent. The respondent was not asked to determine the cause of the defects. The evidence for all parties was that many of the cracks were caused by shielded metal arc welding of the flare-groove and puddle welds, which makes it virtually impossible to inspect for weld length and freedom from defects. 6) There was no standard way to pile joists for inspection. There was a pile which allowed an inspector to see either the top or bottom chord, depending on how the joist was placed on the pile. What the inspector could not see was not inspected. The amount of work in the plant determined how much Mr. Smith inspected. If he was busy, he had no time to inspect joists. The average for buildings inspected in Nova Scotia containing the respondent was 2.28%. The report set out a strict quality control program, which was not implemented during the respondent's involvement with the company. The report recommended all joists be deslagged to allow for routine inspection for weld quality and weld length. In those areas, the respondent did not have to deslag as there were no approved weld data sheets to be prepared. The reinforcing of joist joists undertaken in this remediation was not required to mitigate the danger."

The appellant appealed. Dismissing the appeal, that the trial judge erred in law in that she failed to direct herself in law as to the appropriate burden of proof in a criminal case. HELD: The appeal was dismissed with costs. 1)The trial judge applied the correct test for impairment. She did not err.  2)The test is simply the test that the Crown must meet in any case on any issue. The standard of proof is neither more nor less than that required for any other element of criminal offence. Before he can convict, trial judge must receive sufficient evidence to satisfy himself beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused's ability to operating motor vehicle was impaired. It is not an offence to drive motor vehicle after having consumed some alcohol as long as it has not impaired the ability to drive. However, person who drives while his or her ability to do so is impaired is guilty of an offence regardless of whether his ability is greatly or only slightly impaired. Courts must therefore take care when determining the issue not to apply tests which assume or imply tolerance that does not exist in law. Trial judges constantly have to keep in mind that it is an offence in motor vehicle. If them is sufficient evidence before the court to prove that he's impaired, the Judge must find him guilty. 3)The words 'impaired by alcohol' in the Criminal Code raises an issue for the trier of fact in each case. would resist any attempt to further define these words, but do reject the proposition that by the use of such plain and simply words, parliament intended to adopt some standard involving a marked departure from the norm or other graduated standards.""

The executor is the husband of the testator and was designated as the sole executor in her will in December 2000. The applicant, a niece, is the alternate executor.

2006skqb536.txt,"The primary issue is whether the plaintiff, the owner of certain farm equipment consigned for sale at unreserved auction, has indirectly allowed another individual to bid on its behalf, or for its own benefit. The plaintiff corporation agreed to sell its entire inventory of farm equipment at unreserved auction for a guaranteed return of $577,500. The guarantee was given by the defendant corporate auctioneers (Ritchie). The auction was to be conducted by the defendant corporate auctioneers (LeBlanc), a newly formed division of Ritchie. After the auction sale was concluded, the defendant refused to pay the plaintiff the guaranteed price. The defendant declared the guarantee unenforceable under provisions of the 'Contract to Auction' and ultimately charged the plaintiff a commission of 14% on the gross proceeds. The defendant alleges that the plaintiff indirectly allowed another individual to bid on its behalf or for its own benefit. HELD: 1) Clause 3.07 of the Contract to Auction prohibits an owner from bidding directly or indirectly, and from allowing any other person to bid on his behalf. The issue here is whether the plaintiff allowed a family member to bid for the plaintiff's benefit. A family member can be a bona fide purchaser as well as anyone else, but the nature of an unreserved auction dictate that such relationships be disclosed to the public. The essence of the problem and the underlying purpose behind clause 3.07 is to protect bona fide bidders, and to ensure that there be no surreptitious bidding by another for the owner's benefit. 2) The plaintiff allowed Mr. Caruk to bid at the sale for the plaintiff's benefit. It went beyond the passive act of allowing him to bid. It actively facilitated bidding. Mr. Caruk acknowledged he had no money to buy equipment. The plaintiff lent him up to $100,000 for that express purpose. It is immaterial that the loan came from Mr. Tkachuk personally rather than from the plaintiff company he controls and directs. The plaintiff corporation benefited. It has leased all its cattle to Mr. Caruk and the equipment will be of significant value to the fulfillment of that contract. 'For the benefit of the owner' does not have to mean for the exclusive benefit of the owner. 3) The undisclosed arrangement between Mr. Tkatchuk and Mr. Caruk gave the nephew a significant advantage at auction. That advantage was magnified by the fact that he possessed insider information. He knew his uncle had a guaranteed price from Ritchie's for the equipment, because that information had been imparted to him by his uncle. All one needs to add is that Mr. Tkachuk would have profited very significantly had his arrangement with the nephew gone undiscovered. He would have secured a guaranteed price, while procuring the commercial advantages of having his cattle lease fulfilled using equipment the nephew could not otherwise have afforded to purchase. 4) In an area such as this where bona fides are of fundamental importance, and particularly where an owner has the advantage of a guaranteed price from the auctioneer, a deliberate non-disclosure of material information can have an impact every bit as significant as a deliberate and obvious misrepresentation. The plaintiff should have disclosed the arrangement with Mr. Caruk to the defendants. In not doing so, and in allowing and enabling Mr. Caruk to bid at the auction, the plaintiff breached clause 3.07.  5) The provision for a 14% commission on the gross proceeds of sale as a consequence of breach of a fundamental term of the contract is not extravagant or unconscionable and, as the defendants pointed out, they did not elect to exercise their conjunctive right in clause 4.05 to additional amounts as liquidated damages. The concluding paragraph would have entitled them, in addition to all other rights and remedies, to re-sell the property acquired by Mr. Caruk and to retain an amount equal to 20% of the proceeds realized. The provision for a 14% commission on the gross proceeds of sale does not constitute a penalty. 6) The defendants' claim solicitor and client costs pursuant to clause 4.03 of the contract. The defendants are prima facie entitled to costs on a solicitor and client basis, but in the circumstances there are issues whether they should be restricted to one set of costs, and other issues relating to appropriate quantum. The issue of costs will be assessed by this Court pursuant to Rule 565, with the defendants serving and filing a draft bill in the form required for a solicitor and client bill, an affidavit of disbursements, and written argument. The plaintiff shall have 14 days to reply. 7) The plaintiff will have a judgment against the defendants in the amount of $1,316.64 representing the power washing bill wrongfully deducted from the auction sale proceeds payable to the plaintiff. In all other respects, the plaintiff's action is dismissed with costs.","The plaintiff agreed to sell its entire inventory of farm equipment at an unreserved auction for a guaranteed return of $577,500. The guarantee was supplied by Ritchie Bros. Auctioneers (Canada) Ltd. The auction was to be conducted by LeBlanc Auction Services Ltd. and the plaintiff was to receive the first deliveries of cattle from the plaintiff. HELD: 1) While a number of issues require exploration in the present case, the preeminent question is whether the plaintiff, the owner of certain farm equipment consigned for sale at unreserved auctions, has indirectly allowed another individual to bid on its behalf, or for its own benefit. 2) In the early stages of the auction, the contractual negotiations between the plaintiff and the defendants generated two standard form agreements, preliminary 'LeBlanc' contract dated December 23, 2003 and subsequent 'Ritchie Bros.' contract dated March 28, 2004. After the auction sale was concluded, the defendants refused to pay the plaintiff the guaranteed price. The plaintiff declared its guarantee unenforceable under provisions of the Contract to Auction and charged the defendant a commission of 14% on the gross proceeds of sale. 3) The plaintiff was not aware of the contractual provisions in the contract, nor did he know that the guarantee was only available to the highest bidder. He was unaware that it was available to anyone else. 4) While there are some issues of breach of contract that need to be considered, none of them are central to the final analysis of this case. The issues in this case have much to do with the unique nature of 'unreserved auctions', where goods are sold to a highest bidder and the owner is precluded from affecting sale prices either by the use of reserve bids or through involvement, directly or indirectly in the bidding process. An open and level playing field is critical to the integrity of an unreserve auction. An honest honest person would not be expected to take a position that he was inescapably bound to contract with the defendants at any point in time. It might be inferred from this course of conduct that Mr. Tkachuk was continuing to explore more lucrative opportunities after December 2003, notwithstanding his assertion that the entire contract between the parties was formed on December 23. The defendant's justification for proceeding in that fashion is that the plaintiff had actually been paid in full, in that Ritchie's had included the full sale price of the plaintiff's equipment when it calculated its gross proceeds at auction, less 14% commission under clause 4.05."
7_1997canlii11172.txt,"An application pursuant to s232(4)(c) of the Income Tax Act for a determination of whether the applicants have solicitor-client privilege in respect of 25 documents for which Revenue Canada had sought disclosure. The applicants were husband and wife, their two sons and the companies in which they were principal shareholders and/or directors. The documents related to three separate occasions upon which the applicants sought the advice or assistance of a lawyer in relation to proposed transactions. The documents in issue were originally in the possession of their accounting firm. At issue was the extent to which solicitor-client privilege could be asserted in relation to communications with and documents prepared by third parties. HELD: 1)The privilege claimed in relation to all of the documents relating to the legal advice sought after January 1995 was upheld. 2)The claim was not upheld for copies of a letter setting out the proposal for the 1988 transaction. One letter appeared to be advice offered by the accountants to the applicants.  3)The applicants abandoned their claim for privilege with respect to handwritten notes summarizing share value and fair market value of assets which had been prepared by the accountants other than for the purpose of obtaining legal advice. The claim of privilege was abandoned for a declaration of gift and minutes of a director's meeting in 1991. 4)It has been clearly established in case law that even though a client may look to his/her accountant rather than a solicitor for advice in relation to the law of taxation, the applicants must show the documents were protected by solicitor-client privilege and not merely accountant-client privilege. 5)Although solicitor-client privilege is defined in s232(1)(e) of the ITA, the issue had to be resolved in light of the common law test for privilege. 6)Privilege may extend to accountant communications where the accountant is acting as agent or representative of the client for the purpose of seeking legal advice from a solicitor. Recent cases appear to diverge on the question of the circumstances necessary to found the requisite relationship of agency. 7)The accountants were clearly acting as agents for the applicants for the purpose of obtaining legal advice, as was found in Susan Hosiery. They were at all times acting in a confidential capacity on behalf of and on instructions of the applicants. 8)Solicitor-client privilege extended to items of accounting information obtained for the purpose of receiving legal advice. Notes prepared by the accountant and the interoffice communications summarizing discussions with the solicitor also fell within the scope of privilege.","This was an application pursuant to s. 232(4)(c) of the Income Tax Act for the determination of whether the applicants have solicitor-client privilege in respect of 25 documents for which RevenueCanada has sought disclosure. HELD: The application was dismissed. 1)The respondents were clearly acting as agents of the applicants for the purpose of obtaining legal advice from the applicant. They were at all times acting in a confidential capacity on behalf of the applicant applicants and on the instructions of applicants.  2)The respondent took the position that the only privilege that could be asserted in relation to communications between the applicants and their accountants was the solicitor's privilege.  3)The solicitor and client privilege extended to communications to or from third parties which were said to ""complement"" or 'perfect"" the legal advice sought by the applicants from their solicitor. It is clear that the respondent abandoned its claim for privilege in regard to the balance of the documents, for which privilege is claimed. The privilege extends to communications made by the applicant's accountants to the extent that they are privileged from production, or giving evidence as to the contents of, a letter written by the accountant to the solicitor. 4)The extent to which solicitor privilege can be asserted is unclear."
4_2016skqb160.txt,"Criminal Law – Assault with a WeaponCriminal Law – Defences – Self-defence The accused was charged with assault by threatening to use a weapon, a butcher knife, contrary to s. 267(a) of the Criminal Code. The accused was panhandling outside a store when he and one of two security officers had a verbal confrontation. The accused walked towards the security officer with a butcher knife. The security officer ran to his vehicle and the accused followed him and slashed a tire on the security officer’s vehicle. The attending officer was directed to a yard where he located the accused. A knife was also located in the yard. A videotape from the store was entered as an exhibit and played for the court. The accused was considerably smaller than either of the security officers. The accused testified that he was homeless and had a lot to drink the day of the incident. He indicated that he “blacked out” and was in front of two security officers when he came to. He said that he offered them a cigarette for being in their personal space and one of the men told him that he would punch him out. The accused indicated that he got the knife out of the bag just to show the men that he was bigger than them. He said that he did not intend to stab them. At one point the accused admitted following the security officer to his vehicle and at another point said he did not. The accused said he then tried to get away from the area but was prevented from doing so by a large black vehicle. The accused said he eventually stabbed the vehicle’s tire because it was blocking his way and he went into panic mode. The accused raised the issue of self-defence. HELD: There was no question that the Crown established the offence beyond a reasonable doubt. The court found that the accused initiated the confrontation by walking up to the security officer and getting very close to him. The court found that the Crown witness’s evidence was preferred over the accused’s where it differed, namely the slashing of the vehicle tires. The court accepted the accused’s submission that the security officer told the accused to get out of his face or he would knock him out or something to that effect. The court considered the factors set out in s. 34(2) and concluded that the force or threat faced by the accused due to the size of the security officers and the words used by one of them did not warrant the action taken by the accused. The court offered numerous reasons for the conclusion: the accused initiated the confrontation; the security guard did not touch or further go after the accused; no physical force was used against the accused; and there was no history between the accused and security officer. The accused’s actions were out of proportion to any reasonable response to any threat. The court held that the Crown established, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the facts and circumstances of the case did not give rise to the defence of self-defence. The accused was found guilty as charged.","The accused was charged with assault with a weapon contrary to s. 267(a) of the Criminal Code. The accused left the area, went to the rear of the building and in close quarters, as the accused himself testified, threw a kitchen knife at the complainant. The complainant was injured in the confrontation with the accused and the complainant ran to his vehicle, where the accused pursued him to the vehicle and slashed one of the complainant's tires with the knife he was carrying. HELD: The accused was found not guilty of the charge of assault. 1) The nature of the force or threat that was presented by the size of the defendant and the words used by the defendant were not of a nature that would warrant, as reasonable, the action subsequently taken by the accused. 2) There was no question that the accused threatened to apply force to the complainant and that the butcher knife entered as Exhibit P1 was clearly a weapon as defined by s. 2 of the Code.  3) The accused's actions were not reasonable in the circumstances and did not constitute lawful protection of himself from any use or threatened use of force against him. The Crown had established, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the offence charged occurred on the date and at the location alleged in the indictment. The evidence showed that the defendant initiated the confrontation by his approach to and very close contact with the complainant, the knife was still in his hand and he did not further assail the complainant or touch him nor, as Mr. Drysdale admitted on cross-examination, pursue him as he left, and use the knife to slash the complainant’s tire. 4) While it is the case that the facts and circumstances clearly establish that both Mr. Brown and Mr. Hedstrom were much bigger than the defendant, the latter was far more physically capable, if force were to be used, no physical force was actually used against the complainant that would support a reasonable defence of self-defence."

He had no criminal record. The appellant had been employed by Westcan for a number of years and was considered a good and reliable employee. His employer advised him that because of the nature of their business and uncertainty surrounding the appellant's ability to enter the United States as a driver of one of their trucks, they had no choice but to terminate his employment.

1998canlii13596.txt,"Administrative Law - Judicial Review - Bias/Institutional BiasAdministrative Law - Medical Care Insurance - Medical Fees - Repayment - AppealProfessions and Occupations - Physicians and Surgeons - Cardiologist - Medical Fees_____ A cardiologist appealed an order made against him by the Joint Medical Professional Review Committee for repayment of  $207,821.03 in medical fees he received over a fifteen month period from the Medical Care Insurance Branch (MCIB). Alleged errors of law included improperly placing the burden of proof on the doctor; failing to take into account all relevant factors including the doctor's statistical analysis; considering it beyond his mandate to provide cost effective services in keeping patients out of the hospital; by using and relying on the knowledge of the Committee in preference to the expert evidence; the orders made concerning various medical services were not reasonably supported by the evidence. The numerous grounds of appeal also included breach of the rules of natural justice by reason of a lack of institutional independence. The application under Part 52 of the Rules of Court for a judicial review was brought to determine whether there was a reasonable apprehension of bias raised by the statutory roles of the Committee and Director or lack of institutional impartiality of the Committee or its lack of independence from the Director or MCIB. _____ HELD: The judicial review application was dismissed. The appeal was allowed and the repayment orders were set aside except for the orders respecting surcharges. 1)Natural justice issues: A reasonable apprehension of bias or institutional bias were not proven. The Committee provided adequate written reasons for its decision. The chairman refuted the allegations that the Committee heard and relied on evidence outside the presence the appellant about which he was not advised. Neither the Director nor the Committee acted in a prosecutorial fashion. Examples included the adjournment granted when the appellant failed to attend and the concession to his request that no cardiologist be placed on the Committee. 2)Errors of law issues: The statistical evidence could be considered by the Committee as a prima facie case. It was then open for it to call on the doctor to rebut the presumed departure from an acceptable pattern of medical practice. This did not shift the overall burden of proof to the doctor nor did it require him to prove his pattern of medical practice was acceptable to the Committee. The Committee did not err in law in misconstruing its mandate or by ignoring the statistical analysis presented by the appellant whose definition of the mandate was much narrower than envisaged by the legislation. It was not agreed that the Committee is not bound to follow the rules of evidence and the proceedings were of an investigative nature. The phrase 'balance of probabilities' means 'more likely than not'. To hold otherwise would make nonsense of administrative law and would violate the rules of natural justice. The distinction between the pattern of the doctor's billings and the pattern of his medical practice was more a matter of semantics than substance. If economics were the only consideration the review process would be a useless exercise and the statistical comparative evidence would be conclusive of the issue. There was no credible evidence that the members of  the Committee misused their expertise and relied on it rather than determining the issues from the evidence presented. 3)The appellant established that for the most part the decision of the Committee was not reasonably supported by but was contrary to the evidence. The MCIB statistics were flawed as a reliable comparison tool and the appellant's adjusted statistics were more reliable even if based on estimates rather than substantiated data. The appellant's medical practice was unique in three respects. He did not have hospital privileges and  had staff and diagnostic equipment equivalent to a cardiac care unit in the hospital; he ordered more diagnostic tests and did more follow up than other cardiologists and had extended office hours. 4)The decision of the Committee was varied to quash all repayment orders except for $14,239.76. The appellant admitted that many of the surcharges had been billed because of his erroneous interpretation of the tariff.  5)Leave was granted to bring the issue of costs back for determination if necessary.","The cardiologist appeals an order made against him by the Joint Medical Professional Review Committee that he repay $207,821.03 in medical fees he received over a fifteen month period from the Medical Care Insurance Branch. HELD: The appeal is brought under s. 49.21(1) of The Saskatchewan Medical Care insurance Act. The Committee made the following errors: 1) improperly placing the burden of proof on the cardiologist; 2) using and relying on the Director of Professional Review in the hearing conducted by the Committee; 3) the orders made concerning the various medical services were not reasonably supported by the evidence before it; 4) institutional bias raised by the roles of the director and the Committee assigned to them by the Act.  5) The Committee failed to provide adequate reasons for its decision to award the cardiology doctor $207.821., which was out of line with the billings to medicare by the other cardiologists in Saskatchewan.  6) It is trite law that the rules of natural justice impose a duty to consider the reliability of the statistics as a fair and meaningful indicator of comparative patient costs.  7) There is a reasonable apprehension of institutional bias in the Committee's decision making.  8) The Court was restricted to considering only the record of the proceedings of the Committee. In any event, it would go on to review it in the event it was considered by the committee."
5_2006nssc353.txt,"The claimant flooring dealer had supplied and installed a large amount of flooring in the defendant's new home. Although the defendant had visited the claimant's store and selected the flooring, the actual purchase was made by the defendant's contractor who did not pay the claimant and had now declared bankruptcy. The adjudicator found that although the three criteria for an unjust enrichment claim had been met, there was no special relationship between the parties and thus, denied the claim. The claimant appealed. Appeal allowed; the absence of a special relationship will not automatically defeat a claim of unjust enrichment; the Small Claims Court has the equitable jurisdiction to determine unjust enrichment claims.","This was an appeal from a decision by an Adjudicator of the Small Claims Court. HELD: The Court allowed the appeal. The Court held that there was a special relationship between the parties, frequently contractual at the outset, which relationship would have made it unjust for the defendant to retain the benefit conferred on him by the plaintiff benefit, that was not conferred 'officiously' and was not an inevitable guarantee of success. It was held that no special relationship existed. On the issue of the absence of such a relationship, coupled with either request for or acquiescence in the receipt of the benefit, no recovery will be allowed. On balance, the presence of the special relationship will be persuasive but not necessarily conclusive in the fact-finder's analysis. The absence of a relationship will not necessarily defeat a claim.  1) The facts do establish a 'casual arrangement' as contemplated by Justice Muldoon in McLaren, MacKinnon JA stated that there had been contract between Joseph and Maritime, however, there had not been a contract between the defendants' words and conduct, and the plaintiffs conferring the benefit. The same is not true in this case as Joseph was clearly aware that the work was being performed, and had in fact selected the flooring from Wacky's store. 2) In almost all of the cases, cited here by counsel in which the plaintiffs have succeeded, there was an essential nexus between the words and actions of the defendant and the plaintiff conferring benefit. It is the essential nexus that the defendants’ words, conduct and actions form the foundation of the entire law of restitution. 3) The Court of Appeal offered little guidance and appeared to come perilously close to suggesting that, in the absent of such relationship coupled with a request for, acquiescence or receipt of a benefit, there will be no recovery. The Adjudicators did find that the small claims court has the equitable jurisdiction to determine unjust enrichment. 4) The presence of a'special relationship' would be persuasive, but would not necessarily be conclusive."
8_2005skca120.txt,"The deceased made a Will appointing her only son, the appellant, as executor. In her Will, she left her home to her son, and divided the rest and residue between her two daughters, the respondents. The deceased transferred title to her house to the names of herself and the appellant jointly. She also transferred some bank deposits totalling approximately $57,000 into the joint names of herself and the appellant and designated him as the person entitled to receive payments under a RRIF totalling approximately $29,000. After her death, the appellant took the position that the bank deposits and the proceeds of the RRIF did not pass under the Will but were given to him for the benefit of the deceased's grandchildren and himself. He paid out about $45,000 to the grandchildren and himself, but nothing to his sisters, the residuary beneficiaries under the Will. The sisters brought action against him, claiming the funds were part of the residue of the estate and obtained a judgment to that effect against him. He appeals against that judgment. HELD: Appeal dismissed with costs.  1) Section 75 of The Queen's Bench Act does not apply to this case. 2) The trial judge carefully reviewed the evidence and the law respecting the presumption of advancement and the presumption of resulting trust. The judge did not mention the possibility of and express trust in favour of the grandchildren. She must have considered whether an express trust existed because that was exactly what the appellant's evidence suggested and exactly what the trial judge rejected in her findings of fact. Since the funds in question were not given to the appellant as a gift, and were not given to him in trust for the grandchildren, they must of necessity revert to the estate. In the case of the bank deposits, the funds would revert to the estate on the basis of a resulting trust. In the case of the RRIF, the funds would revert to the estate on a different basis. Since there was no gift to the appellant, and no trust in favour of the grandchildren, the monies must revert to the estate. 3) While the appellant characterized this issue as being one of mixed law and fact, it was essentially one of fact alone, the issue was what the deceased intended when she transferred the bank deposits and designated the payee of the RRIF. The standard of review in respect of such an issue is palpable and overriding error. The judge made no such error.  4) The appellant asked for relief pursuant to s. 57 of The Trustee Act in respect of the money paid by him to the grandchildren. The appellant says he paid the monies to the grandchildren in the honest belief that he was carrying out the wishes of the deceased. The appellant knew from the outset that his sisters disagreed with his position and intended to take proceedings against him. The appellant's actions in distributing the funds without at least getting directions from the Court were imprudent for a trustee. The circumstances do not justify, on any equitable basis, compelling the innocent respondents to bear the loss to them occasioned by the trustee's imprudence","The appellant took the position that the bank deposits and the proceeds of the RRIF did not pass under the will but were given to him for the benefit of his sisters.

2_2007nssc235.txt,"The parties, divorced, had children, aged 23, 19, and 14 years, respectively. The wife applied to vary the Corollary Relief Judgment (CRJ) following the termination of spousal support. The termination had occurred pursuant to the terms of the CRJ which provided that support would terminate either twelve months after her graduation from the M.B.A. program in which she was enrolled, six months after she withdrew from the program, or when she found employment. The wife had graduated from the program later than expected and a further six months after her course work was completed. Both parties applied to vary child support. The oldest child had completed his first university degree and was currently attending law school. Pursuant to the father's employment, until the completion of their first degree, the children qualified for a program which reimbursed the father for 75 per cent of the child's educational expenses. The CRJ had provided that the father's responsibility to pay all of the oldest child's educational expenses was conditional upon compliance and eligibility for the education reimbursement policies. The middle child was attending university and lived in the wife's home over the summer months. Spousal support application denied; given the family history of an emphasis on education and the oldest child's career plans and apparent aptitudes, he remained a child of the marriage; the father is to pay $10,000 per year directly to the oldest child for the next two years.

The parties had been married since 1982. They had three children: William, April, and Sarah. In 2000, Rosamond cancelled the education savings plans with the Canadian Scholarship Trust (CST) Fund because there was a regular deduction made from the father's income by his employer which would be akin to an income tax deduction that would be made if the father were resident and working in Canada. In 2006, the parties made a series of cross-applications concerning child support. The respondent brought an application to vary spousal support. HELD: The respondent's application was dismissed. 1)The respondent's income was found to be $12,759.73 US per month which is an annual income of $153,116.76 US or $203,706.00 Can. 2)The requirement for the respondent to pay William's educational expenses is conditional upon William and the administration of the educational institution complying with U.N. policy with respect to ensuring reimbursement for and/or payment of post-secondary education expenses incurred for the benefit of children of the United Nations. Any reimbursement due from the Father's employment as result of the payment of private school fees shall be retained by the respondent. 3)There was no change in circumstances related to the marriage that would result in a different order of support.  4)There were no significant changes in the children's circumstances. Their health began deteriorating after the CRJ as they were performing the multiple roles of mature student, and day to day parent of the two girls (who were then home) (clause 9(o) of her March 21, 2007 Affidavit). The order contemplated her parenting the girls she was receiving a significant amount of child support and funding. However laudable this proposed organization may be there is no reason for the husband to fund its establishment. The children are responsible for their own choices. 5)The court found that the respondent's level of support was reasonable.

8_2013skqb403.txt,"HELD: The application was dismissed. With respect to the issues, the Court found: 1) that the board had not relied upon the clause in the Policy Statement but on the evidence before it. It was not necessary to decide then whether the Policy Statement was ultra vires; 2) that the board’s interpretation that the Act granted discretion to the board to refuse to reimburse a specific medical treatment was reasonable; 3) that the board’s conclusion was reasonable. The scientific studies did not definitively stated that medical marijuana was effective. In some situations where a patient’s only recourse would to be to use a non-clinically approved drug whose safety and efficacy was still questioned, a determination that the medical aid was not necessary or required might be unreasonable, but not in this case where the applicant declined to try Sativex; and 4) that there was no evidence that the board based its decision on irrelevant considerations such as the potential political ramifications of paying for medical marijuana.","This is an application for judicial review of decision of the Workers' Compensation Board denying the applicant reimbursement for the cost of his medical marijuana application. The applicant argues that the Board improperly fettered its discretion by relying on the submissions of the Board's medical consultant and medical department. HELD: The application is dismissed. The Board's interpretation that the Act granted the Board discretion to refuse to reimburse a specific medical treatment is reasonable. It is not necessary to decide whether Policy Statement 5 is ultra vires. 1) There is no evidence the Board made its decision on the basis of considerations such as the potential political consequences of paying for medical marijuana. On the face of its reasons, the Board denied reimbursement specifically because medical marijuana is potentially unsafe and unproven. The studies did not definitively state that medical marijuana was effective. Many studies noted side effects and most recommended further research before drawing a definitive conclusion on the use of marihuana as medicine. 2) Even if policy statement is ultra-vires, it does not decide this matter. There is nothing in the language of the Act that suggests the Board does not have the power to determine whether a medical aid is necessary or 'necessary' or'required' but this is not the case here."
e_2009skpc9.txt,"The plaintiff claims against the defendant for water damage sustained to their belongings while in transit from Edmonton to Nipawin in a one ton, 17 foot cube van owned by the defendants. The issues are whether the plaintiffs are precluded from recovery against the defendant by virtue of the contractual term acknowledging the equipment to be water resistant only as well as the posted disclaimers to this effect. HELD: The plaintiff shall have judgment for $250 plus costs of issuing the claim and service. 1) Notwithstanding that the plaintiff signed the rental contract acknowledging that the equipment was not waterproof and only water resistant, it appears from the last three sentences of the inspection report that water was entering at the corners of the door by virtue of the door not sitting flat at the corners. This defect would have permitted excess water to enter prior to being cleaned. Perfection could not be expected since it was acknowledged that the rental unit was not waterproof and some seepage may be expected even after the door had been fixed. Nonetheless, the sealing problem would have taken it beyond the acknowledgment of the unit being only water resistant. 2) The plaintiff acknowledges that the truck remained parked outside in heavy rainfall for two days and nights prior to being unloaded. This exacerbated the scope of the damage claimed since the water would have continued to seep in unabated for roughly six times as long as the trip itself took. The Court concludes that the defendant is only 20% responsible for the damages sustained to the plaintiff's possessions.","The Plaintiffs claim $6,700.77 for water damage sustained while in transit from Edmonton to Nipawin, Saskatchewan in a one ton, 17 foot cube van owned by the Defendant.

HELD: 1) Whether the Plaintiffs are precluded from recovery against the Defendant by virtue of the contractual term acknowledging the equipment to be water resistant only as well as the posted disclaimers to this effect.  2) Quantum of damages and mitigation. The Court infers from Mr. Verklan's report that the apparent defect in the inability of the door to sit flat would have permitted excess water to enter prior to being cleaned and remedied. Perfection however could not be expected since it was acknowledged that the rental unit was not waterproof and therefore, some seepage may be expected even after the door had been cleaned. Nonetheless, this existing sealing problem would have taken it beyond the acknowledgment of the unit being only water resistant. This may well have applied to the door seal once cleaned, remedied or before the door was cleaned. 3) The plaintiffs acknowledge that the U Haul truck remained parked outside in heavy rainfall for two days and nights prior to its being unloaded. This undoubtedly exacerbated the scope of the damage claimed since the water would have continued to seep in unabated for roughly six times as long as the trip itself took. 4) Quantum damages.  5) Apportionment of damages. 6) Costs to the plaintiffs.  7) Appeal to the Court of Appeal.  8) Appeal of damages awarded totalling $250,000.  9) The court infers that the term of the rental contract which stated 'water resistant and not water proof' would have given it the benefit of the doubt that the unit was only water-resistant and therefore there was no mitigation of damages to be assessed.  10) Appeal for damages to the plaintiff.  11) Appeal in all the circumstances to the defendant to be only 20 responsible for the damages sustained to the Plaintiff's possessions."

He was given credit for 22 months spent in custody. Matychuk was sentenced to 12 years in prison but was given credit for time in custody on a 1:1 basis because the Court had not found any circumstances to justify any greater amount of credit. Matychuk’s credit was for 19 months. The sentences were based on the circumstances of the offence: a home invasion and inflicting serious bodily harm on a young victim. The assault was violent and degrading and took place over a period of time. Weapons were used while the victim was bound and sexually assaulted and threatened.,"HELD: The Court found the accused guilty of breaking and entering the complainant’s home and committing the indictable offence of aggravated sexual assault. The Court sentenced the accused to 40 months concurrent on each count. The accused had a lengthy criminal record dating back to 1992 when he was youth. Most of his convictions relate to thefts and break and enters to commit theft. He also had numerous convictions for obstruction of police officer, fail to attend court and fail to comply with recognizance and court orders. The court found that the accused was an addict and an alcoholic."

In so doing, it asked that its solicitor, Mr. Hesje, be appointed as selling officer to conduct the sale and report to the Court. The court expressed its concern to Mr. Hesje during the course of his submissions as to the propriety of the applicant solicitor serving in such a dual function. He informed the court that some members of our Court have allowed this to be done, others have declined. In the court's respectful view, it is not appropriate for the Court to appoint, as selling officer, the solicitor for the applicant creditor. There are obvious difficulties with conflict of interest. Who does the selling officer serve: the Court, from which his or her authority originates; or the client? The matter is of sufficient importance that the court concluded it should reduce its thoughts to a fiat and direct that it be distributed to other members of the Court.

e_2016skpc157.txt,"HELD: The court found with respect to the following issues: 1) it would not permit the defence to argue the s. 8 violation at the conclusion of the trial because it had not mentioned it in its Charter notice. The Crown disclosed the video-taped interaction between the officer and the accused to the defence at the outset and it was clearly pertinent to the issue of reasonable suspicion, but the defence failed to raise it; and 2) there were two periods of delay and the court was satisfied that the 77 minutes between arrival at the station and the taking of the second sample was satisfactorily explained. However, the court found that first period of 35 minutes between the arrest to the time of departure was not satisfactorily explained. The officer did not act expeditiously and the delay may have prejudiced the accused because when, as here, the readings are slightly above the legal limit, the tests need to be taken as soon as practicable to ensure that the accused’s blood alcohol content at the time of driving is determined accurately. The Crown was not entitled to rely on the presumption in s. 259(1)(c) of the Code.","The accused was charged with impaired driving. The accused was arrested at 5:36 a.m. and the police officer did not leave the scene until some 36 minutes later. The delay was not satisfactory as the delay may have prejudiced the accused. The need to take the tests as soon as practicable is to ensure that the accused's blood alcohol content was as accurate as possible at the time of driving. This is particularly important when the readings are slightly above the legal limit. HELD: The Court found that the defence did not mention the s. 8 violation in its Charter notice and defence should not be allowed to argue it at the conclusion of the trial. 1) There were two time periods that have to be considered the period from arrest to departure to the police station, and the time from arrival at the scene to the time the tests were taken. 2) There was no compelling reason, or need, to wait for the tow truck especially when there was no indication when one was expected to arrive."

Spousal support to continue at the rate set out in the separation agreement for a period of fifteen months from the date of the decision at which time all support shall terminate, unless, prior to the termination date, the wife commences an application which results in her showing cause why spousal support should continue; the husband has complied with his obligations with respect to the provision of an automobile. The wife's financial means and needs required support, the husband had made an agreement to provide such support and the evidence did not support a conclusion that it was agreed to be for only one year. Although the wife did not establish any disadvantage from the marriage, there were disadvantages relating to its breakdown and her lifestyle deteriorated as result of the marriage ending.","The issues were: 1) Spousal support; 2) Ms. Bemister's allegation that the husband failed to comply with the Separation Agreement requiring him to provide her with an automobile.

The evidence supported a conclusion it was agreed to be only for 1 year. 2) There were disadvantages related to the husband's failure to pay her $1,000 per month. 3) The Court reviewed the evidence and found it was not a conclusion based on the needs and means, capacity, economic circumstances of the parties. 4) The respondent was entitled to spousal assistance at separation and that such entitlement continues.

The defendants objected to the finalization of the judgment on the ground that, pursuant to Court of Appeal Rule 15, the notice of appeal had stayed the execution of the judgment until the disposition of the appeal. The plaintiff submitted that the calculation of the judgment was not acting on it. HELD: The defendant misconstrued the scope of Rule 15 as it does not stay proceedings.

The parties were in a common law relationship and had two children, aged 9 and 12. After separation, the children resided with their mother, the respondent, in La Ronge and they had access with the petitioner on the weekends. In January 2011, the parties agreed to a weekly co-parenting arrangement. In April 2013 the petitioner was advised by the respondent that she and the children had moved to Melville. Up until that point the child had always resided in the La Ronge area and attended only one school. HELD: The Court found the co-parenting arrangement to be the de facto parenting arrangement and that there was no risk to the children with either parent. The Court ordered that the parties were joint custodians of the children and that preservation of the status quo was in their best interests. The Court ordered that the children primarily reside in La Ronge with the petitioner and attend school there. The Court also ordered specified access for the respondent.","FIAT: Further to the hearing of this matter, the issue is whether the children are to be relocated from La Ronge to Melville, Saskatchewan.

There are two children of the relationship, namely: Justin Morgan McKerracher born May 31, 2001 and Sean McKerracher born September 26, 2004. HELD: The Court held that as general rule moves should not be allowed on interim applications. The Court considered the fact that the respondent unilaterally relocated the children resulting in the petitioner having to bring two applications for the return of the children to their home.

d_2017skqb42.txt,"HELD: The action was allowed. The defendants had defamed the plaintiff and he was entitled to damages in the amount of $100,000. The court found the following with respect to each issue: 1) it would substitute Postmedia as a defendant pursuant to Queen’s Bench rule 3-84(2) as it was the successor to Canwest and was aware of the plaintiff’s claim when it purchased the Star Phoenix and it would not be prejudiced. It would not deprive Postmedia of a defence under s. 5 of The Limitations Act because the articles remained on Postmedia’s websites and were republished whenever they were viewed or downloaded; 2) after reviewing each of the articles and assessing the words complained of, it found that the words constituted defamation; 3) all of the defendants were found to be joint tortfeasors with Purdy because they participated in the publication of a libel and were jointly and severally liable in defamation to the plaintiff; and 3) an appropriate award for general damages was $50,000. The court allowed the claim for aggravated damages as the defendants were found to be motivated by actual or express malice because Purdy did not simply report the jury’s verdict in her articles but indicated that she believed that the jury had not reached the proper verdict in the trial. She deliberately chose to report the stories of people who had made complaints about the surgical care provided to them by the plaintiff without verifying it or seeking comment from the plaintiff. As she was acting in the course of her employment, Purdy’s malice was attributed to all the defendants. The plaintiff was awarded $50,000 in aggravated damages.","HELD: The Court found that the defendants, acting alone or in concert, published defamatory comments about Dr. Graham in series of articles in the StarPhoenix newspaper and on websites owned and operated by the newspaper and Canwest Publishing Inc. The plaintiff suffered loss and damage to his professional and civic reputation. The defendants did not publish any retraction or apology nor did they remove the alleged offensive articles. The court ordered the defendants to submit further written submissions on the basis that the two-year limitation period set forth in The Limitations Act in force at the time of the alleged defamation had expired.

e_2014skqb344.txt,"The court gave leave to counsel for the plaintiff to file an amended draft order nisi. It made the following recommendations regarding the draft order: 1) the sale should be held under the direction of a solicitor other than the plaintiff’s solicitor; 2) that relying upon a partial appraisal and in the absence of information on the condition of the property, setting the reserve bid at $100,000 might not reflect the best price. Fairness demanded the reserve bid be set at $125,000 but the court set the bid at $115,000. If the property could not be sold at that price, the plaintiff was given leave to apply to the court for a lower reserve bid; and 3) Queen’s Bench rule 10-47(2) required that purchase monies are to be paid into court to the credit of the cause to be applied as directed by the court, including costs. Only after an application and service upon the defendant and after the court had assessed solicitor client costs could monies be disbursed to the plaintiff. Monies owed under the mortgage must be set out by the court on application. All of these matters may be addressed in one final proceeding, in the application to confirm the sale, if the judicial sale proved successful.","The plaintiff applied for an order nisi for judicial sale of the property owned by the defendants. The Limitation of Civil Rights Act does not preclude the plaintiff from suing on the covenant because this is not a purchase-money mortgage. However, a judicial sale is required so that the plaintiff may apply to have the amount of deficiency in the judgment set by the court. Otherwise, as provided by s. of the LCRA, foreclosure of the mortgage operates as full satisfaction of that debt. If the land cannot be sold at that amount, the plaintiff has leave to return the matter to court to seek a lower reserve bid, based upon evidence to support its position.

8_2014skqb299.txt,"HELD: The application was dismissed. The court held that the standard of review of the arbitrator’s decision was one of reasonableness. Section 25 of The Trade Union Act states that the conclusions of arbitrators are final and therefore the court noted they should not be interfered with lightly. Further, the court noted that the decision of the arbitrator was not of significant importance to the general public. The court reviewed the history of collective bargaining at the university and found that tenure was not dependent on the president’s personal recommendation in the past. The court found that the arbitrator’s reasoning was transparent and intelligible throughout. To include the word tenure in the definition of appointment or promotion was not the only conclusion that could be drawn. The arbitrator’s decision was within the range of acceptable conclusions and was reasonable.","The parties agreed to a lengthy statement of facts and the admissibility of number of documents before the Arbitrator. The parties disagreed on the standard of review to be applied to the arbitrator's interpretation of s. 51 of the Act. The University's position was that the Act gives the president the authority to overrule the Renewals and Tenure Appeal Committee. The Act is one of general law, that is both of essential importance to the legal system as whole, and outside the adjudicator’s specialized area of expertise. It relies on the Rucker decision and the British Columbia legislation, which hold that existing legislation must be read in such a way as to harmonize with the Agreement unless the operation of the Agreement is clearly excluded by the statute. The Arbitrator concluded that an award of tenure is neither an appointment nor promotion as contemplated by the Act, the Saskatchewan Act and this collective agreement can more readily be harmonized. HELD: The arbitrator found the Act to have exceeded his jurisdiction, made an unreasonable decision, or committed an otherwise reviewable error by misinterpreting sections of the University Act and in particular Section 51. 2. He concluded that the legislature has, by default or design, chosen not to restrict the Board's ability to set up the appropriate process and to award tenure itself. The court found that legislation might regulate the awarding of tenure in the same way as promotions and appointments, but there were also reasons why it might be left to the Board to regulate for itself."
9_2005skca89.txt,"This appeal arises from proceedings under The Family Property Act. The couple had lived together for several years. She sought judgment distributing their property. The property included a house in Vancouver, which he had acquired some years earlier with the financial assistance of his parents. The trial judge found that the respondent had acquired the house after the commencement of the spousal relationship and then went to hold that the petitioner was entitled to an equal share of its value with no reduction owing to the gifts or loans from his parents. The respondent appealed. HELD: Appeal allowed by the majority. Lane J.A. wrote in dissent. Majority: 1) The Vancouver property was acquired after commencement of the spousal relationship. The value of the property did not qualify for exemption under s. 23(1)(a) of the Act. There are a number of facts that merit emphasis. The respondent received $125,000 from his mother before the spousal relationship started. He still had that amount on hand when the relationship commenced. He used the money as a down payment on the purchase of the Vancouver house shortly after the relationship commenced. By establishing these facts, the respondent established the requisite conditions for the grant of an exemption of the value of the Vancouver property to the extent of the $125,000. 2) The trial judge erred in declining to take into account the loans of $100,000 the appellant received from each of his parents for the purpose of purchasing the Vancouver property. There was insufficient evidence before the trial judge to enable him to find that the mortgage debts were statute-barred and he did not make a firm finding on this point. The trial judge's finding that the respondent will not have to repay the loans was incomplete. He did not assess the loans in light of s. 21(3)(e) of the Act. On the whole of the circumstances concerning the Vancouver property and the length of the spousal relationship, there is no tenable basis for not giving effect to s. 21(3)(e) of the Act and the contributions made by the respondent's parents on his behalf to the acquisition of the property. The petitioner is entitled to share in the build up of the equity in consequence of the pay-down of the mortgage. Minority: 1) The Vancouver home ought to be distributed in accordance with s. 22 of the Act. The gift of $125,000 was made by the respondent's mother with the full knowledge that the parties were living together. In this case, the contribution by a third party on behalf of a spouse to the acquisition of family property is one of the usual factors outlined in s. 21 of the Act and it would be inequitable to exempt the gift from distribution. 2) The trial judge did not err in failing to deduct from the family property the loans given by the appellant's parents. He made a finding the loans were statute-barred. The trial judge clearly considered the legislation and his interpretation of the legislation was not challenged by the respondent. He also made the finding the loans would likely never be repaid. He simply used less than precise language.","This appeal stems from proceedings under The Family Property Act, s.S.1997, c.F-6.3, initiated by a nurse against a doctor. The two had lived together for several years. She sought a judgment distributing their property or its value equally between them. The trial judge held that the respondent had acquired the house prior to the commencement of the spousal relationship and then went to hold that the wife was entitled to an equal share of its value with no reduction owing to the gift or the loans. With that, the appellant appealed. HELD: The appeal was allowed. 1)The trial judge erred in finding that the value of the house was exempt from distribution because he had acquired it prior to commencement. Alternatively, he contended the gift and loans served to reduce the value available for distribution.  2)The Court considered the equivalent of this section in Mitchell v. Mitchell (1992), 1992 CanLII 8234 (SK CA), and Vilcu v. Grams (1999), 172 Sask.R. 201(Sask.C.A.). The Court considered that Mitchell was the equivalent to this section. It was the same reasoning applied in Mitchell. The Court held that it would be unfair and inequitable to require the respondent to repay money to the extent of the fair market value of his property. 3)The respondent's position regarding the loans he obtained from his parents to enable him purchase the Vancouver property and the mortgages in favour of his parents came to rest on these provisions of s.21 and s.23 of the Act. 4)The appellant's application for distribution of their property was concerned with the conditions of ss.23(1)(a) and (c), which exempt the fair-market value of property acquired before the commencing of spousa relationship, of family property (other than the family home or household goods) where the property is: (a) acquired before it was established that the property no longer exists, unless it can be shown that the gift was conferred with the intention of benefiting both spouses; or (b) owned by spouse prior to that date. This is a more complex question, one that will serve to identify the issues and set the stage for their analysis.  5)The court reviewed the relevant provisions of the family property act and found that as of late June 1994 the parties had cohabited with one another continuously for two years.

The Minister argued that given the extensive past history of the three older children, the Minister properly apprehended the infant and the permanency planning committee was of the opinion that there was no use putting off the inevitable permanent order for the child.

This shall be done on a transitional basis as determined by the Ministry with the child to be completely returned to the mother within 30 days of this order.

1993canlii3174.txt,"This was an appeal from a decision varying the appellant's maintenance downwards. The parties had a traditional marriage, with the wife remaining at home and caring for their three children. Upon separation, they entered into a settlement agreement whereby maintenance was set al. $2000 monthly while the appellant remained in the matrimonial home. The agreement stipulated that the settlement was a full and final settlement on all corollary matters between the parties. The respondent subsequently remarried, underwent some difficult financial times and made the application which was the subject of this appeal. The appellant contended the terms of the agreement were final. Per Jones, J.A. and Chipman, J.A. (concurring for separate reasons), allowing the appeal and setting aside the lower court order, that while courts have ultimate jurisdiction in the matter of support, settlement agreements must be respected. There is no difference between an agreement which provides for long term maintenance and one that does not contain such a provision. The effect is to permanently settle the issue in both cases. To review the agreement, particularly after the lapse of a substantial period of time, could lead to grave injustices to one or both parties. Per Hallett, J.A., (dissenting), dismissing the appeal, that a settlement agreement which provides for periodic support payments indefinitely is very different than one which contains provisions for termination of support after a specified period. The causal connection test established in Pelech v. Pelech (1987), 38 D.L.R. (4th) 641, should not apply to payors of periodic support for an indefinite period. Such agreements do not have the degree of finality that was effected by the settlement agreement under consideration in the Pelech decision.","This was an appeal from a decision of Hall, L.J.S.C. which reduced the appellant's support from $2,000 to $1200 per month. HELD: The appeal was allowed without costs. The decision did not deprive the Court of ultimate jurisdiction in the matter of support. It was clear from the evidence that the parties had negotiated their own agreement, freely and on the advice of independent legal counsel, as to how their financial affairs should be settled on the breakdown of their marriage, and that the agreement was not unconscionable in the substantive law sense, it should be respected."
c_2016skqb293.txt,"HELD: The appeal was granted on the basis of the first two grounds as well as others. The court quashed the tribunal’s decision and reinstated the appellant’s hospital privileges. The court reviewed the transcript of the tribunal’s hearing and its written decision. With regard to the first two issues, it found that the tribunal had erred in law in the following ways: 1) by failing to conduct a de novo hearing as required. It did not refer to the expert opinion submitted by the appellant as new evidence at the hearing; and 2) by failing to explain its decision. It did not refer to the new evidence nor did it state how it had reconciled the conflicting expert opinion evidence offered by the appellant and the respondent. It merely accepted the evidence of the SMO’s experts.","HELD: The judgment was based on a statute-based appeal brought by the appellant against decision of an administrative tribunal. The appellant had his hospital privileges suspended by the senior medical officer (SMO) of the respondent Health Authority. The respondent placed numerous policies and clinical guidelines before the appellant, which the appellant and his counsel saw for the first time at that hearing and had not been disclosed to the appellant prior to that hearing. The SMO did not review the matter, only the SMO did so. The result of the SRO's review of the appellant's interpretation of fetal heart rate tracings was that the appellant met the standard of care and that ultimately the Tribunal made fatal errors when dealing with this matter pursuant to the statutory appeal. The s. 45 appeal to tribunal is a de novo hearing. It is not an appeal on the record.

His income tax returns for the years 2004, 2005 and 2006 have been filed, but certain adjustments must be made. The purpose of the capital cost allowance is to provide money to purchase replacement equipment. However, not all of the money is needed and is not used for that purpose. It is that unused portion which should be allocated as part of the respondent's income. In this case, 40% of the allowance should be treated as income for the purpose of calculating child support. The personal portion of the utility costs should be included as part of his income, an appropriate percentage is 25%. An amount of the legal and accounting costs should be attributed to the respondent personally and added to his income, in 2004 $1,000 is added, in 2005 $5,000 is added and in 2006 $1,000 is added. The respondent has taken advantage of the optional inventory adjustment and that must be factored back into his income using the methodology set out in Tamke v. Tamke, 2001 SKQB 528. As the respondent's income has undergone serious fluctuation over the years, it is therefore appropriate that his income for calculating child support be based on the average of his income in the years 2004 and 2005. 2) The respondent will not have to pay half of the cost of Stacey joining a school trip to Europe. This is because Stacey paid half of the cost herself and because the respondent was asked to contribute at the time but refused. The petitioner knew the respondent had refused to contribute and, when she elected to pay the balance, she did so unilaterally. It would be inappropriate to compel the respondent to contribute now. 3) The school fees paid by the petitioner are not extraordinary and should be encompassed in the basis child support. The health costs in the form of orthodontic treatments are extraordinary and the parties shall contribute equally as their incomes are presently comparable. 3) On five occasions the respondent failed to attend at the agreed meeting spot with the result that the petitioner had to make the entire trip to deliver the children to the respondent so he could exercise access. She will be compensated for the actual lost wages and fuel costs that she incurred on the respondent's behalf, but not for costs she would have incurred in any event.  4) The respondent shall pay costs of $1,200.","The issue was the respondent's income. HELD: 1) The respondent was ordered to pay one-half of the $4,237.16 he claimed for child support, past and future. The issue centered on what monies were owed from the past. The petitioner paid $1,500 toward the cost of the trip. The respondent refused to contribute at the time. The parties have three children: Carley, Stacey, Mandey and Mandey. Mandey is now on her own. 2) The petitioner claimed for full day's wages. This ignores the fact that she would have been away from her employment for one half the time in any event. Her actual loss would be less. It would be inappropriate to now compel the respondent to contribute when he expressed a contrary position. 3) There was a material change in that the respondent claimed for $300 per month as child support in each year from 2004 to 2005. This amounted to material change and variation should be retroactive to that date. 4) There were certain health costs and they were extraordinary and to be shared by the parties. 5) The fees are ordinary, and not extraordinary expenses and would be encompassed in the basic child support. An appropriate retroactive variation was effected."

It found that the accused was not capable of representing himself but that the accused had not shown that he was indigent.,"HELD: The application for court appointed counsel was dismissed. The court found that the accused was not capable of conducting his own defence in light of the personal issues which he was facing and his methamphetamine addiction. The Court found that in circumstances where an accused's fair trial interests are impaired for want of legal representation, that an appropriate remedy is a stay of proceedings under s.24(1) of the Charter in the event the prosecution insists on proceeding with trial in breach of the accused's Charter right to fair trial. The subtle but critical issue of the difference between possession of substance for the purposes of a trial and possession of a weapon is also examined."
4_1996canlii5334.txt,"Following three patient suicides at the Cape Breton Regional Hospital, the hospital, in response to concerns and questions from family members, retained two psychiatrists to review the cases, the roles and responsibilities of individuals involved in the cases, patient records and hospital policies and practices. At the end of the review they were to provide a written report to the hospital's Chief Executive Officer. The hospital staff participating in the investigation and review were advised that their information would be treated as part of a 'peer review' and therefore confidential. Upon receipt of the report the hospital, as a result, refused to disclose the report to the families. An application pursuant to the Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy Act was made by an M.L.A., who sought for the disclosure of the report and for a review of the hospital's decision to not release the report. The hospital decided to release the full report. The appellant employees appealed the decision of the hospital, claiming that they had been assured confidentiality. Allowing the appeal, that the disclosure of personal information consisting of personal recommendations or evaluations, character references, or personal evaluations by the appellants and other hospital staff are presumed under s. 20(3)(g) of the Act to be an unreasonable invasion of a third party's personal privacy. Under s. 20(1) the hospital is required to refuse to disclose this information. It necessarily follows that recommendations in the report founded upon such information is also presumed to be an unreasonable invasion of privacy and is likewise not to be disclosed. The remainder of the report is disclose able.","The appellants appealed the Regional Hospital's decision to release a summary of a peer review team report. Dismissing the appeal, that the report would be used as an internal document only, thus ensuring the confidentiality of the appellants' participation in the process. HELD: The decision was made against the recommendations of senior management at the hospital and contrary to assurances given to the various persons who had participated in the preparation of the report. The report was to be a confidential document only. The appellants were assured confidentiality would be honoured. The Regional Hospital refused to release the report and refused to do so. The appellant appealed. Pursuant to s. 41(1) of the Act, the appellant appellants have appealed the decision to the Nova Scotia Supreme Court. The Court reviewed the evidence of the various doctors and other staff members who testified before the court. The court found that the appellant physician was the only person from the administration of the hospital who had access to the medical files of the three deceased patients. It was also found that there were other mechanisms available to the families to answer their questions."

8_2017skqb53.txt,"The accused was charged with the commission of sexual assault, sexual touching in relation to a 16-year-old and possession of child pornography. The accused came to police attention via a report by the complainant. She reported that the accused was often viewing a pornographic website while in her presence. The police prepared an information to obtain a search warrant (ITO). The ITO stated that the search would provide evidence of the accused’s viewing of pornography in the presence of the complainant, bolstering the complainant’s credibility. The ITO did not reference possession of child pornography. The ITO sought only a search of the “search history on the computer”. The issued warrant authorized a search of the accused’s computer and related devices and media, as well as documents pertaining to occupancy of the home and control of computer equipment. The complainant subsequently alleged that the accused had taken photos of her in the shower. The police did not amend the ITO to include a search for photos. The police executed the search and seized, inter alia, a laptop, an iPhone and CDs. The police delivered the material to a computer forensic specialist at the RCMP and requested a complete forensic search of the computer and phone to obtain a general search of the Internet history, pictures of the complainant and messages between the complainant and the accused. The police knew that the search of pictures was not included on the search warrant. The RCMP did not review the terms of the warrant prior to completing the examination and examined the entire contents of the laptop and phone. The accused submitted that his s. 8 Charter rights had been violated by the search and applied for exclusion of evidence pursuant to s. 24(2). The application proceeded by voir dire. The evidence was apparently located on either the accused’s laptop or cell phone, but the nature of the evidence obtained was not disclosed at the voir dire. The following issues were raised: 1) What is the correct procedure to be used to challenge evidence seized pursuant to a search warrant; 2) Was the Crown able to call amplification evidence and have it considered in support of the search and seizure conducted; 3) Did the ITO set forth reasonable and probable grounds that the items sought were evidence with respect to the commission of an offence; 4) Did the ITO use boiler plate clauses; 5) Did the ITO establish reasonable and probable grounds that the items were likely to be found in the place to be searched; and 6) What was the extent of a search of a computer or computer device. | HELD: Evidence of the accused’s search history was validly obtained. Other evidence was beyond the scope of the search warrant and obtained by violation of the accused’s s. 8 rights. The court held: 1) There is a two-step inquiry to be made when real evidence is seized during a search. The first step is an inquiry into constitutionality, and the second is reached only after a constitutional infringement has been established. Both inquiries impose an onus on the person claiming infringement. The standard of proof is the balance of probabilities. Challenges to constitutionality of warranted searches may involve either or both a facial and a sub-facial attack on the authorizing warrant. The record examined on facial review is fixed: it is the ITO, not an amplified or enlarged record;  2) In attempting to enter evidence of the complainant’s allegation that the accused took pictures of her in the shower, the Crown relied on an argument that the ends justified the means. This amplification evidence sought to allege a whole new offence and area of search. It was not admitted; 3) The point of this voir dire was not to determine admissibility of evidence outside of the search warrant context. There was no requirement that evidence sought in support of allegations made be directly connected to a complainant or the actual subject matter of a complainant; 4) The ITO did not use impermissible boiler plate clauses when read in its entirety. However, it did not set forth reasonable and probable grounds that text messages were evidence with respect to the commission of an offence; 5) The ITO provided sufficient description. It was reasonable to infer that search history meant search history of the accused with respect to the websites defined in the ITO. Further argument was required on whether text messages could be included; and  6) Police are not entitled to rummage through entire contents of a device searching for other evidence. The ITO sought only the search history.","The accused applied for relief pursuant to s. 24(2) of the Charter to exclude evidence seized through the execution of a search warrant. The accused called no evidence. He disputed the facial validity of the search warrant and also argued his s. 8 Charter rights had been violated. HELD: The application proceeded by way of voir dire. The determination of whether any evidence seized should be excluded was dependent on the decision on the above captioned issues. 1) The evidence seized was not disclosed at the hearing. It is apparently located on either the accused's laptop computer or his cell phone. 2) There was no evidence to the effect that the accused had taken photographs of the complainant while she was naked and in the shower. 3) The accused's testimony in the amplification hearing was to await the determination of these issues. 4) The scope of evidence at an amplification hearing is limited to correcting'some minor, technical error in the drafting of their affidavit material' or to 'exclude erroneous information' in the ITO. This information was not part of the evidence at trial unless the parties expressly agree to its incorporation. To allow the Crown to supplement the record with Sgt. Parisien's testimony would be to countenance subsequent validation.  5) The Court reviewed the evidence of the accused viewing pornography on his computer and cell phone and found that it was found to be in the possession of digital files of a person who is or depicted as being under the age of 18 years engaged in explicit sexual activity, the dominant characteristic of which is the depiction, for sexual purpose, of a sexual organ or the anal region, contrary to section 271 of the Criminal Code. It was also found that there was a seven month gap between his discovering the pornography on the internet and the swearing of the first ITO and his discovery of the second ITO, which was not included in the original ITO as it was not set forth in that ITO nor was it considered in support of the application. The court reviewed the limited scope of amplification evidence and concluded that the test is whether there was reliable evidence that might reasonably be believed on the basis of which the authorization could have issued. The Court concluded that this was not the case and that the Crown was entitled to use it to justify, or authorize, the seizure of additional items. The same principle applies to erroneous information in an affidavit on a warrant application."

It was held in an earlier fiat in June that the addition of the two proposed plaintiffs asserted new causes of action and amendments to the statement of claim could only be considered pursuant to an application under s.44(11) of the Queen's Bench Act. The defendant resisted the joinder of the new plaintiffs and amendments on the basis of undue delay and actual prejudice. The statement of claim alleged nuisance, and in the alternative, negligence against the City with respect to the design, construction and maintenance of the sewer system causing his basement to flood. The plaintiffs stated they only became aware of the damage to their home and possible health problems over period of time. Leave to appeal the June fiat was denied. The defendant plead limitation period defence to the amendment and argued that if the City had received notice of any ongoing problems it would have investigated and possibly taken steps to minimize any damage; that evidence had been lost; it may be too late to determine the causes. HELD: The amendments were allowed. 1)The limitation period in s.314(1) applies from the time damages were sustained, not from the date of the occurrence which led to the damage. The facts were uncertain. It was uncertain when the limitation period commenced. If the date the applicant should have discovered the additional damage was the date they received the geotechnical and structural engineering report, the amended claim was brought within the 1 year limitation period. 2)Inexcusable delay was not established. 3)It was not accepted that the defendant suffered actual prejudice. If it was prejudiced it was through its own inaction. No evidence had been lost. The basement was available for inspection. It had the benefit of the reports provided by the applicants. 4)The requirements of s.44(11) were met and judicial discretion was exercised to allow the amendments. The fact that the joint owner of the property was not included was due to inadvertence rather than any deliberate choice. It was also appropriate to join the new plaintiff. It appeared that the expanded claim alleged in the requested amendment was not apparent at the time the original claim was issued and arose out of the same occurrence. 4)Costs in the cause.","FIAT.

The respondent counter-petitioned for similar relief, including divorce, joint custody and an equal division of the property. HELD: 1)Sole custody was awarded to the mother with access on the same terms as contained in the interim order. Two reasons for not awarding joint custody were the obvious acrimony between the parties and the respondent's reluctance to support his children. Three weeks after his application for sale of the home was rejected, he applied for a leave of absence from his job. It was inferred that he was trying to avoid complying with the order for interim support. 2)The mother re-entered the workforce after many years' absence.

e_2016skpc106.txt,"HELD: The accused was found not guilty. The court found that the accused’s s. 8 Charter rights were breached. Pursuant to a Grant analysis, the court excluded the evidence obtained after the illegal entry of the accused’s home. The court found that the accused had not consented to the entry by the officer and the complainant and it was therefore a warrantless search. The officer did not have the lawful authority to enter the home on the basis of arresting the father as he was not in hot pursuit. The complainant had not obtained a warrant under s. 13.1 of The Child and Family Services Act to enter the accused’s home and therefore had no lawful authority to enter the home. There were no exigent circumstances to justify the search such as preventing the destruction of evidence as they already established that the person they sought was not in the house. The unlawful entry and search of the accused’s home was a severe breach of the accused’s Charter rights. The impact upon her was severe as the complainant gathered evidence and apprehended her children. The accused’s assault on the complainant was minor in nature and although not excusable, her offence was a reaction to a significant breach of her rights. The administration of justice was served by excluding the evidence.","The accused was charged with assault contrary to s. 266 of the Criminal Code. She enlisted the assistance of the Moose Jaw Police Service so that she could enter the accused's home to investigate whether the children were in need of protection and if necessary to apprehend those children. The accused kicked and hit the complainant. The complainant testified that she went to the residence hoping to arrest the accused, not apprehend the children. She was specifically asked whether she had a warrant under s. 13.1 of The Child and Family Services Act, allowing her to enter the home. She said she had no such warrant, and had never utilized a warrant before. HELD: The Court concluded that the accused did not have any lawful authority to enter Ms. Bigsky's apartment suite to effect and arrest Justin Lerat. The Court held that a warrantless search is presumed to be unreasonable and the Crown must establish the search was reasonable on balance of probabilities. A mere breach of an order from the Ministry or its worker does not, ipso facto, establish grounds for apprehension. This evidence doesn't conclusively determine or preclude the Court from determining that Corporal Mickleborough was lawfully exercising Criminal Code power. It is certainly indicative that the officer did not believe he had authority under the Code to act, and that he wasn't attempting to act under the Charter."
e_2009nssm47.txt,"The claimants live on property abutting the defendant Burrow's property. The defendant Renouf is Burrows' friend. As favour, Renouf attended the property while Burrows was away and cut down some trees that he was asked to cut. He went on to cut down several others that he felt were diseased/damaged. eventually realizing he had crossed the property line and cut down more than 17 of the claimants' trees. The claimants sued for the cost of replacing the trees with a comparable number of mature trees, the cost of removing the felled trees and to recoup for anticipated damage to their septic field. At issue was: 1. whether Renouf trespassed; 2. whether Burrows was liable for Renouf's actions (for 'hiring' Renouf or because they were engaged in a joint enterprise); and 3. damages. The claimants did not want Burrows helping with the tree removal, even if doing so would save money. 1. Renouf trespassed on the claimants' land and is liable for damages. That it was an honest mistake is irrelevant since trespass does not require bad faith or improper purpose. 2. Burrows is not liable. He was not Renouf's employer, nor were Renouf's actions foreseeable. It was a favour and Renouf went way beyond the scope of what he was asked to do. Burrows is not responsible for everything that flowed from their limited enterprise. The case law requires a degree of blameworthiness (a neglectful or unlawful enterprise) which creates a foreseeable risk of harm. 3. Renouf to pay the claimants: $3,750 to replace the trees with young, native trees (half the amount sought by the claimants), $2,000 for tree removal (half the quote submitted by the claimants since they refused to mitigate the damage by allowing Burrows to help). While Burrows had counterclaimed for damages arising from a confrontation between the claimants and his son, he did not seriously pursue it and it was dismissed. Costs of $1,234 awarded to the claimants (including $960.77 for disbursements). While the amount seems high, the case was large one and the counterclaim, although not seriously pursued, hung over the claimants' heads as they prepared for trial.","HELD: The claim was dismissed. The court found that there was a degree of blameworthiness which caused liability to attach. The defendant was part of a joint enterprise to remove some damaged trees from his property, which was fully lawful enterprise. There was no reasonable foreseeability that the defendant would stray so far from the area discussed that a neighbour's property might be breached.

There were four separate incidents involving the dog in September 2001. At issue was whether the Crown had proven an attack on any of the four occasions. The accused agreed that the presumption of non-provocation set out in s.135.2(1) of the UMA applied and that presumption had not been displaced. HELD: 1)A $200 fine was imposed along with conditions. The dog must be kept within an enclosed continuous fence and chained to a post. There must be a gate preventing exiting except while on a leash and muzzled. The owner must display a sign stating Guard Dog on Duty. 2)If dog is territorial or protective, and the facts show the human has, by intruding, been in law provocative, the offence may not be proven beyond reasonable doubt. On the evidence there was no intrusion sufficient to justify an attack or which could be considered provocation. 3)There were seven specific pieces of evidence which supported the conclusion that the owner did not take reasonable steps to ensure his dog did not attack someone in the fashion prohibited by s.135.3(3). It is irrelevant at law that after dog attacks it responds to its owner's commands. The dog escaped the yard, was off leash and was not sufficiently restrained or enclosed. logging chain affixed to post is substantial way of tethering dog. One would not expect dog to be attached to logging chain if there were no concerns.","The accused was charged with assault contrary to s. 135.3(3) of the Urban Municipalities Act. The evidence indicated and established that the accused owned a dog, to wit, that without provocation attacks a person. The accused displayed a sign on the fence warning of the presence of the dog with the wording 'Guard Dog on Duty, Beware of Dog'. HELD: The accused was given a fine of $200. The court accepted the accused's evidence that the dog was not sufficiently restrained or enclosed, that it ran from its yard and attacked the lady attending a garage sale. There was clear evidence that on the occasion when Mrs. Barks was in her back alley, the dog escaped through the garbage can enclosure. The Court was of the view that the Crown had established beyond a reasonable doubt that there was an attack on the accused. The offence was not proven on any of the four occasions and the accused was ordered to obtain and keep in effect liability insurance in an amount not less than $300,000 to cover damage or injury caused by the dog.

b_2010nssc387.txt,"The small claims adjudicator granted an order for substituted service after the respondent had trouble serving the appellant with notice of her claim. As per the order, she personally served the appellant's mother and notified the appellant of the hearing date by text message. He didn't appear and default judgement was granted against the appellant in the amount of $11,031.35. The appellant appealed, arguing the adjudicator failed to follow the natural requirements of justice. He denied being in contact with his mother. He admitted receiving the text message(s) but said he didn't believe the respondent, but didn't make any further inquiries. New evidence (a letter from his mother saying she was not in contact with her son) was allowed on the appeal. Appeal dismissed. The right to be heard is a fundamental right, and an appeal of a default judgment must be subject to the highest scrutiny. Here the respondent's claim was valid. The adjudicator had the jurisdiction/authority to make an order for substituted service and the respondent followed it. At the very least, the appellant was notified of the hearing dates by text message(s). While he may not have believed the messages, he should have taken some steps to confirm with the court if there was indeed a hearing set. He failed to prove he had a reasonable excuse for defaulting, chose to ignore the notice, and was mistaken only as to what would be the outcome if he failed to appear.","The respondent appeals the Adjudicator's decision in favour of the respondent in the amount of $10,852 plus costs of $139.35 for a total of $11,031.35. The singular ground of appeal cited in the respondent's Notice is a failure to follow the requirements of natural justice. The respondent mistakenly showed up for the hearing on the wrong date, which was one day after the actual hearing. He did acknowledge having received the text message from the Respondent notifying him of the hearing date. HELD: The respondent appeals this decision by Notice of Appeal (form 9) dated June 16th, 2010, within the 30 day appeal period. 1) Personal service was effected upon him by the Order for Substituted Service granted by the Small Claims Court in accordance with the provisions of the Act and Regulations. Service having been properly effected on the respondent, the Court is not prepared to interfere with this finding of the Small claims adjudicator.  2) The respondent was not mistaken about the date of the hearings. He was mistaken as to what would be the outcome of his absence. His conscience choice to ignore the hearing notification resulted in the judgment against him. The Court has sympathy for the appellant and for the reason he chose to ignore it and make no further inquiries. This is not a reasonable excuse as found in Kemp, supra nor one of the Court's sympathy for Forsyth, supra. 3) Natural justice is simply fairness, including procedural fairness. Natural justice demands that the appellant be heard."
e_2012nssc101.txt,"The accused was charged with sexual assault and various other sexual offences with respect to his niece (who had spent weekends and summers with her father, who lived with his sister and the accused) when she was between the ages of 12 to 15. The accused denied the allegations, suggesting that, since the niece had not disclosed any of these matters until she was 17 years old, she had made up generalized allegation against him to stop her boyfriend from breaking up with her and then found it necessary to maintain the lie, tell her friends, her mother and the police and get more specific when pressed for details. He also argued that she was not credible because her testimony in court was inconsistent with that in the preliminary inquiry and although there were numerous persons she could have confided in at the time, she never told anybody about the alleged incidents but kept going back to visit her father. Accused found guilty of all counts. Although she was at times frustrated and unable to recall precisely, the niece's demeanour was consistent with a young person doing her best to be truthful and accurate in intimidating and embarrassing circumstances. Her evidence was both consistent with that of other witnesses and internally consistent and the inconsistencies with her previous statements were minor. The court found she had no motive to lie initially or during her trial testimony and the reality was that by making these allegations, she knew her father would be forced to move and would become estranged from his sister, her family would be fractured and the 'sister'-like relationship she had with the accused's daughter would end.","HELD: The Court found that the accused was guilty of four counts of sexual assault. The Court held that the Crown had proved beyond a reasonable doubt that he was guilty. The court also held that there were other mitigating factors to consider, such as whether the accused intended the victim receive a communication as an invitation, incitement or counseling to do the physical conduct, coupled with knowing the communication was for sexual purpose."
d_2008nsca10.txt,"The appellant appealed the adoption order regarding her natural child. Although at one time the child had been in the permanent care of the Agency, that order was terminated and replaced by a private guardianship order which had placed the child with the now-adoptive parents. Although neither of the birth parents, who resided in British Columbia, had attended the adoption hearing, the birth mother now sought access to the child and requested that the court receive fresh evidence as to her unsuccessful efforts to obtain counsel to represent her at the adoption hearing. Appeal allowed; adoption order set aside; matter remitted to the application court for a further hearing; application to admit fresh evidence granted in part; the portions of the appellant's affidavit addressing her efforts to secure counsel for the adoption hearing admitted into evidence. The appellant had a bona fide intention to appear or to be represented at the hearing and had made reasonable, although unsuccessful, efforts to do so. Allowing the appeal would be in the child's best interests as she had resided with the adoptive parents for the past three years and would continue to do so pending the further hearing.","The appellant was the birth mother of a child who was in need of protective services. A temporary guardianship order was issued in Alberta. The child was returned to her birth parents but again apprehended by the child welfare authorities. In 2005 an order for permanent guardianship was granted. The appellant appealed. HELD: Appeal allowed. 1) The due diligence requirement is not applicable here. 2) The appellant had a bona fide intention to appear or be represented and that she made reasonable, although unsuccessful, efforts to do so. 3) The court was entitled to dispense with the birth parents' consent if she did not appear at the adoption hearing. 4) The respondent's application to adopt the child was granted in 2005. 5) The parties were each personally served with Notice of the Adoption Hearing scheduled to take place on May 1, 2007. Neither appeared at the hearing. 6) Although the appellant was not seeking to oppose the adoption but wished to be heard on the issue of access, she was unsuccessful in her efforts to obtain counsel."
6_2007skqb111.txt,"FIAT: A caveat registered to the applicant was removed as a result of the notice to lapse procedure. The caveat purported to be based upon a right to receive royalties from all gas, carbon and oil produced from the land. The applicant denied having ever received the notice to lapse. The applicant sought: 1) retroactive reinstatement of the caveat by order of the Court; and 2) an inquiry by the Court as to whether or not the caveat was removed improperly. The respondent companies that acquired an interest in the subject land subsequent to the caveat being removed opposed the application based, among other things, on the principle of indefeasibility of title, as did the Registrar of Land Titles. HELD: The application is dismissed with costs to the respondents. 1) Even if the caveat was removed improperly, the Court ought not to retroactively reinstate it, because to do so would defeat the fundamental principle of indefeasibility of title that has been continued in The Land Titles Act, 2000; and 2) it would not be appropriate to permit the applicants to attempt to access the assurance fund through the mechanism of a chambers application requesting declaratory relief. The process, if the applicants chose to pursue it, would be an action under Part XII of the Act.","The companies that acquired an interest in the South West Quarter of Section Twenty-seven (27), in Range Four (4) in the Province of Saskatchewan, in the Dominion of Canada applied for declaration that the caveat was wrongfully removed by the Registrar of Land Titles and that it be reinstated retroactively to the date of its removal. HELD: The application was dismissed. 1)It would simply not be appropriate to permit the applicants to attempt to access the assurance fund through the mechanism of a chambers application requesting declaratory relief. The process, if the applicants choose to pursue it, would be an action under Part XII of the Land Title Act, 2000. Alternatively, the Court ought to declare the caveat correctfully removed, a necessary remedy due to the principle of indefeasibility of title. 2)The respondents were entitled to costs of defending the application."
d_2005skqb454.txt,"The plaintiff sues the defendants for $50,000 plus interest. The claim is based on the allegation that the plaintiff loaned the defendant Kelly $69,000. The plaintiff claims the defendants agreed to repay the loan in the amount of $1,500 per month. HELD: The plaintiff's claim is dismissed. The only evidence that might suggest that this transaction was a loan to either of the defendants was that some of the payments made by the defendant to the plaintiff were in the amount of $1,500, the amount that the plaintiff asserts was the monthly amount to be repaid by the defendant for the loan. However, there was no evidence as to when the agreement to pay $1,500 was made. In her testimony, the plaintiff stated that when the decision was made to pay the $69,000 to the business, she did not have a discussion with the defendant, Kelly. The only discussion she seems to have had was with her husband after which she wrote a cheque to the defendant.","The plaintiff loaned some $69,000 to the defendant on or about the 30th day of January 2001. The claim goes on to say that the defendants agreed to repay the loan in the amount of $1,500 per month, that some payments were made, but in the end an amount of approximately $61,000 was still outstanding. The defendants deny that this transaction was a loan to either of the defendants and argue that in fact it was an investment by the plaintiff and her husband into the auto broking business. HELD: The claim is dismissed. 1) The only evidence that might suggest that this transactions was a Loan to either the defendants was that some of the payments made by the defendant were in the amounts of $ 1,500, the plaintiff stated on cross-examination that she felt she received a profit from the first transaction and that she chose to pay for another vehicle instead of deducting that amount from what was owed. There is also evidence that the plaintiff benefitted the husband by repurchasing equipment that the husband had lost to the trustee in bankruptcy and gifting it back to the husband. There was no written contracts or other written evidence of any agreement between the plaintiff, the defendant, and/or the numbered company defendant evidencing the nature of this transaction. 2) On the basis of the evidence of the cross examination of the defendant and the defendant's cross-examinations, there was no evidence that any of the plaintiff's evidence was advanced on the basis that she had not made a written statement to the plaintiff. The cross examination did not show that the defendant had advanced any material evidence on which to make a loan. 3) The evidence of her cross examination was not supported by the evidence that she made any written statement on the part of the Defendant. The evidence was that she did not have any written material to testify on. 4) No evidence was produced as to the type of material that might have advanced the loan. 5) No material was produced on the evidence. The defendant's affidavits were not filed on a monthly basis.  6) There is no evidence to support the claim that the advance was loan."

The respondent brought a motion requesting further disclosure and alleged that the USA had not disclosed all of the evidence in its custody or control. HELD: The application for disclosure was dismissed. A date for the extradition hearing was set.,"The United States sought to extradite the Jamaican national to face a charge of conspiracy to import cocaine. The Jamaican entered Canada in May 2003 and is entitled to remain in Canada as permanent resident for the time being. He has a permanent resident card which expires May 5, 2008. The Attorney General of Canada filed a motion with the Court of Appeal seeking an order fixing a date for the hearing of the extradition request in this Court. HELD: The motion was dismissed. 1)It is alleged that the Attorney General has not disclosed all the evidence in his custody or control. The motion for a stay of proceedings is without merit and it is accordingly dismissed. 2)The motion on behalf of the Minister and the extradition judge occupy two different solitudes. The Minister has a role at the beginning and the end of extradition process. The judge discharges his function in the middle. An appeal to the court of appeal is dismissed. 3)It follows that the role of the hearing judge is a narrow one, confined to what is specified in the enabling statute. It is not the business of an extradition judge to assume responsibility for reviewing the actions of foreign officials in preparing the evidence for an extradition hearing. This would seem to be in breach of the most elementary dictates of comity between sovereign states. The issues with respect to disclosure are that the application before Krueger J. in the Daul case was under s.15 of the Charter and no consideration was given to parallel common law rights advanced by the Minister of Justice in Germany v. Schreiber."
c_2001skqb39.txt,"The defendants brought an application to compel responses to a large number of questions objected to at examinations for discovery of the proper officer for SPMC, and sought an order requiring SPMC to comply with numerous undertakings. The objections were categorized as the questions sought to elicit the plaintiff's manner of investigation or expert opinions; it should have been asked of another witness better suited to answer or third parties as the questions relate to issues between the defendant and the third parties; it was irrelevant or improper. HELD: 1)The plaintiffs were not required to answer questions which would require them to accept or reject an opinion of another party to the action. 2)The plaintiffs should answer what cellulose fibre insulation was present at the time of the fire. 3)The affidavit answered whether Miner was a participant in the investigation notwithstanding the defendants are not entitled to the names of possible expert witnesses at the discovery stage. 4)Any meeting between the plaintiff's investigators and the fire marshal clearly related to its investigation and is privileged. The defendants could obtain the information directly from the fire marshal. 5)The question of whether there was any liaison between the city fire investigator and SIAST was improper as it relates to the manner of investigation. Questions can be asked of the city. 6)Details of the plaintiff's investigation, including an engineer's report, was protected by litigation privilege. 7)The question regarding what observations were made of the damage was too vague. The plaintiff's claim was in excess of $7 million. A proper foundation must be laid in the context of specific questions and answers given or not given (Hill v. Arcola School Division). The defendants are not entitled to expert opinion. 8)Whether SPMC's insurer's investigation team participated related to manner of investigation and was therefore privileged. 9)The defendant will be able to examine the city in the third party claim with respect to documents from the fire department. 10)All discussions at mediation proceedings are strictly confidential. The name of the plaintiff's expert, who prepared the drawings in contemplation of litigation, is privileged. 11)The facts and observations upon which expert opinions are based must be disclosed including any photographs.  12)Whether any pattern on the wood would indicate contact by propane flame required expert opinion. 13)Questions concerning what material first ignited could only be answered by having experts reconstruct what in their opinion occurred at the time the fire started. 14)If the plaintiffs do not have a position (on whether there was a fire stop in the 1967 construction of the tower), there is no rule the court is aware of requiring them to adopt a position. They can be required to give an undertaking to provide a position if they adopt one at a later date. Whether they believed the building was built in accordance with the 1960 fire code when constructed in 1967 was information obtainable by the defendants. 15)If the party being examined had no control over or greater access to a witness than the examining party, it need only disclose the evidence known to it. There is no obligation to seek information from third parties when the defendants are capable of obtaining that information. 16)An undertaking was given to advise if and when the plaintiffs develop a position on whether the parapet roof was constructed in accordance with the detail set out in FC and whether the detail in the sketch of the Tower parapet was correct. 17)If the request for the proposal related to Kelsey, the document should be produced, but if it only related to the Regina campus, the document was not relevant. 18)Whether it was considered anytime that Hagblom would be a sub-consultant was a legal question. The trial judge will interpret the terms of the agreement. 19)Any information required could be obtained directly from the architects who had been added as third parties by the defendants.  20)The plaintiffs gave undertakings to answer the other questions and did not object to answering them. 21)The 36 objections (less 3 that were withdrawn) failed. It would be an abuse of process for the defendants to ask the same question of a second officer hoping to obtain a different answer. The same question can be put if the first did not answer it. The fact there were three separate officers does not restrict the defendants to only asking certain questions of each. The reason for having three officers, each with a different expertise in a certain area, was to prevent the plaintiffs from having to give endless undertakings. Having all three present during each examination would have saved time and unnecessary legal fees. 22)The exhibit was not before the court to determine how complicated the question was. Defence counsel was to break it down. 23)There were 200 undertakings. As a general rule examinations for discovery should be completed before the party being examined is required to comply with the undertakings. It would lead to endless delay if the examining party were allowed to simply adjourn and demand the undertakings be complied with. There were no exceptional circumstances.  24)Costs were left to the trial judge.","The defendants brought this application to compel responses to a large number of questions that were objected to at examinations for discovery of the proper officers on behalf of Saskatchewan Property Management Corporation (SPMC).

All discussions at the mediation proceedings are strictly confidential. Any questions arising out of anything disclosed during the mediation are clearly improper. The name of the plaintiffs' expert who prepared the drawings in contemplation of litigation is privileged. The plaintiffs were not required to answer the questions asked. Objection No. 8-P. 317, Line 15 to P. 318, Line 1) The question was asked what observations were made of the damage post fire, the damage to the roof and its... and the attic that would connect the point of breakout to the point where Hagblom were operating or were working.

c_2012skqb426.txt,"The Crown applied under Part XXIV of the Criminal Code to have the accused declared a dangerous offender after he pled guilty to committing an aggravated assault on his common-law spouse contrary to s. 268 of the Code. The application is based on the Code provisions in effect before the danger offender legislation set forth in The Tackling Violent Crime Act was passed. The accused is 52 years old and in poor health. He has a significant criminal record thatreveals a history of violence and an inability to abide by court orders. The offences occurred between the time he was 40 and ended in 2006 with his last conviction, the predicate offence. Two psychologists prepared psychological assessments both of which concluded that the offender should not be declared a dangerous offender because his risk to re-offend could be reasonably managed by supervision in the community. The issues before the Court were: 1) whether the predicate offence is a serious personal injury offence as defined by s. 752 of the Code; 2) whether the offender is a threat of the kind contemplated by s. 753 of the Code and thus a danger to society; 3) if so, whether the Court should exercise its residual discretion an impose a fixed-term sentence or resort to long-term offender provisions, even though the statutory criteria for declaring the accused a dangerous offender have been met; and if a long-term offender designation is warranted, what determinate sentence and long-term supervision order should be imposed? HELD: 1) The Court held that the aggravated assault committed by the offender was a serious personal injury offence because it was an indictable offence involving the use of violence against his spouse. 2) The Court found that the Crown had proven the criteria required that the offender clearly fits within the definition set forth in ss. 753(1)(a)(i) and (ii), in that this offender had shown a repetitive and persistent pattern of aggressive behavior, especially against women. 3) The Court decided to exercise its residual discretion not to designate the offender as a dangerous offender and found that the he met the long-term offender criteria and that his risk to re-offend could be managed within the meaning of s. 753.1(1)(c). The offender has never been imprisoned in a penitentiary and thus had never had the benefit of programming offered in that system. The appropriate sentence should be 7 years. As the offender has spent approximately 3 years and 4 months in pre-sentence custody, the Court gave him credit in that amount on a one-to-one basis. The Court ordered that the appropriate length of time for a long term supervision order is the maximum of 10 years since the offender needs to learn alternative ways to express his frustration and address his issues with alcohol.","The offender pled guilty to committing an aggravated assault on his common-law partner contrary to s.268 of the Criminal Code. The Crown applied under Part XXIV of the Code to have him declared a dangerous offender. The offender is 52 years old and has a significant criminal record. The Court entered the conviction of the offender and prior to him being sentenced, he had accumulated several violence related convictions and concluded that his risk to re-offend violently in the future was mitigated only if he conscientiously applies himself to learning alternative ways of venting his frustration and anger. HELD: The Court had jurisdiction to entertain the dangerous offender application because it is both the court and is superior court of criminal jurisdiction. 1) It is an absolute necessity that the offender addresses his apparent alcohol abuse problem and makes a commitment to sobriety for the remainder of his life. If he refuses to do so, his risk for committing acts of future violence is high. He appears to predate upon intimate partners for reasons which are not clear to me. However, there seems to be a pattern of offending in this way, which needs serious attention. 2) The Court has the benefit of two assessment reports together with testimony of the authors of the two reports. The first is a comprehensive 52-page report that was initiated following a court order. The second is a 52 page report prepared by the author of the report. The author of this report prepared a detailed 52 page Report that was reviewed by the Court. The report is based on the author's own personal experience and the respondent's own assessment of his risk. 3) The court reviewed the circumstances of the predicate offence that precipitated this application and found that the risk was high. The accused was a high risk to return violently and sexually violently in this future and this risk was reduced only if the offender applied himself to learn alternative ways to vent his anger. 4) There are two additional events that are also germane to the consideration of his criminal history. On January 1, 1995, the offender was charged with common assault and was sentenced to 60 days in jail. He appeared to be in denial regarding his potential to abuse alcohol and did not appear to have seriously addressed the role alcohol plays in his life and also, in his potential for violent crimes. He was remanded for a period not exceeding 60 days to be assessed by Dr. Holden. The circumstances of this application also involves a female partner with whom the accused was intimately involved. The respondent has little insight into the aetiology of his violent offending"
b_2010skqb187.txt,"The plaintiff granted the defendant a mortgage over a parcel of land just outside the city limits. The defendant failed to make any payment. The plaintiff applied for foreclosure on the land and an order nisi for judicial sale. The defendant was a developer. He argued that the foreclosure action was void because the land was being used as farmland and was subject to protection under s. 9 and 11 of The Saskatchewan Farm Land Security Act. The other issues before the court were the appropriate period of redemption and whether the plaintiff could submit a bid that incorporated the value of the land as a 'credit' enabling the plaintiff to merely 'top up' the bid by the additional amount needed to reach the bid price. HELD: The Saskatchewan Farm Land Security Act (SFSA) did not apply. The undisputed evidence was that since the defendant acquired the land in 2007, their focus was to develop the land as an industrial park and they had undertaken a host of activities to achieve that purpose which clearly indicated that their intent was not to farm the land in the sense contemplated by the SFSA. There was no foundation to deviate from the usual redemption period of 90 days from the date of the decision. The bidding process in a judicial sale contemplates a level playing field for all participants. The fact that the plaintiff is likely to receive a significant cash payout from the judicial sale does not modify the desirability of obliging all bidders to pay into court the full bid price. Normal bidding rules shall apply. The plaintiff was entitled to costs.","HELD: The application was dismissed and the usual bidding rules applied. The plaintiff was granted a mortgage for $3,100,000 repayable by two installments of $300, then the balance payable on April 30, 2009. The defendant issued a statement of claim in October 2009 seeking foreclosure on the Land. None of the defendants entered defence but served demands for notice and then were noted for default of defence on March 12, 2010. By its notice of motion, the plaintiff seeks an order nisi for judicial sale pursuant to s. 11 of the Saskatchewan Farm Security Act. The court reviewed Christie v. Texas Industries (1985), 1985 CanLII 2631 and found that the Christie case remains the controlling authority, such that when applied to this case rejection of the submissions on the applicability and effect of ss. and 11 must follow. The Christie case has no application here as it was decided within the scope of the 1984-85-86 FLSA, now repealed. This application by the plaintiff is dismissed.  1) The court found that no foundation has been laid to deviate from the usual redemption period where, as here not only has the mortgage expired but no attempt to make payments was made and no conduct is alleged on the part of the defendant which contributed to the defendants' default, the redemption period shall therefore be 90 days from the date of this decision. 2) The fact that FMI is owed an amount on the mortgage and that it will likely receive a significant cash payout on sale does not modify the desirability and necessity of obliging all bidders to pay into court the full bid price. The entire foreclosure action brought against the Land is a nullity.  3) The undisputed evidence is that since its acquisition of the Land in 2007, Alberta Ltd.'s focus and direction vis-à-vis the Land has been the undertaking of a host of activities designed to develop the Land into an industrial park.  4) The Court found that there was no foundation to cause the deviate form of the statutory redemption period that the defendants deviated from."
2_2005skqb513.txt,"FIAT: The parties are the parents of a son born April 10, 2003. They are married and the family home is in Connecticut. The respondent mother is a Canadian citizen and has returned to Canada and now resides in Laird, Saskatchewan. The petitioner is an American citizen and continues to reside in Connecticut and brings an application under The International Child Abduction Act for an order directing the child to be returned to Connecticut. HELD: The respondent is directed to return the child to the State of Connecticut by January 8, 2006.  1) The child was born in Canada. He and his mother joined his father in Connecticut one month later in May 2003. In February 2004 the child and his mother returned to Canada for a planned one-month visit. It is clear that the petitioner did not consent to the prolonged absence of the respondent and the child. In about November 2004 the respondent and the child returned to Connecticut and resumed living with the petitioner. Reconciliation was attempted. The respondent and child left in December 2004 and have not returned. The crystallizing moment was in March 2004 when the respondent did not return from her trip to Canada. For the purposes of the Convention, circumstances should be examined to determine habitual residence. At this point the parties had adopted traditional roles. The respondent was at home raising the child and the petitioner was attending his duties in the navy. Through their conduct the parties had evidenced a settled intention to make their home in Connecticut. The respondent chose to unilaterally remove the child from that home. 2) The petitioner had obtained an interim order in February 2005 directing the child to be returned to Connecticut. He also pursued his case in the Superior Court in Connecticut and on October 2005 obtained an order dissolving the marriage, directing the respondent to return the child to Connecticut and granted the petitioner sole custody. The respondent now asks that any order directing her and the child to return should be conditional on the petitioner varying the order he obtained in October 2005, vacating the award of sole custody to the petitioner and replacing it with something in the nature of joint custody. The conditional return order proposed by the respondent is inappropriate. Having determined that an order for return is warranted under the Convention, it does not lie with a Saskatchewan Court to impose a revised starting point for the process of determining custody in Connecticut. This Court's role concludes upon the determination the petitioner has made out a case for an order for return.","FIAT: The parties are the parents of a child born in Canada. The respondent mother, an American citizen, continues to reside in Canada and brings an application under The International Child Abduction Act for an order directing the child to be returned to Connecticut. HELD: The children have been returned. 1) The Court is faced with the fact that change in primary caregiving might occur as result of a 'chasing order' issued in the former jurisdiction. Psychological harm to children may result by reason of the severance of that primary caregiver relationship. 2) More than a year has elapsed between the removal and the commencement of judicial proceedings and it can be demonstrated that the child is now settled into his new environment. 3) The petitioner has obtained an interim order on February 22, 2005 directing the respondent to return Joshua to the United States. In addition to his application in Saskatchewan under the Act, he pursued his case in the Superior Court in Connecticut and obtained an order which, inter alia, ordered the respondent return to the state of Connecticut and granted the petitioner sole custody. 4) There is no suggestion that the exceptions under the Convention under Articles 12, 13 or 20 are applicable. The Court must fix some point in time for the purpose of determining the issue of habitual residence."

The Court of Appeal had ordered the Crown to produce an itemized inventory of the information in its possession to enable the Queen's Bench to review the information the Crown should disclose to the defence. This fiat concerned several documents. The Crown had already disclosed the contents of each of these documents and the only matter remaining in issue was the name of the lawyer who released the information. This arose as a result of the action of a Regina lawyer who had improperly revealed information from two of his divorce clients with respect to the charges against LaPorte et al. The Crown quite properly disclosed these statements which had been conveyed to the investigating officer.

3_2001nssc117.txt,"The plaintiffs were Sergeants in the Town of Bedford Police Department. Following amalgamation and before any collective agreement was concluded, the Chief of the amalgamated force issued a department order declaring that all persons in the position of the plaintiffs would be referred to as a level two Sergeant which created a two-tier structure within the Sergeant rank. The bargaining agent for the union declined to process a grievance on behalf of the plaintiffs and agreed with the two-tiered structure which was eventually incorporated into the collective agreement. After unsuccessfully complaining to the Nova Scotia Police Commission and the Halifax Regional Board of Police Commissioners, the plaintiffs commenced an action alleging that the creation of the two-tiered structure was a violation of the Police Act and adversely affected their employment rights. The intervenor union brought an application to strike the plaintiffs' proceeding on the basis that the court lacked jurisdiction to hear the matter. Application granted; proceeding stayed pending submission to arbitration or any other form of proceeding that is permitted under the statutory enactments applicable; if no application is made to lift the stay within two years, the action will stand dismissed. Where there is a threshold question of whether the dispute is arbitrable, that decision should initially be made, absent very limited exceptions, by an arbitrator and not by the court. It is irrelevant if the plaintiffs have now lost their rights to initiate the arbitration process.","HELD: The Court held that it had jurisdiction to hear the matter on the basis it had no jurisdiction to convene an investigation or inquiry since there was no evidence any demotion was the result of a disciplinary default. The Court reviewed the recent decision of the Nova Scotia Court of Appeal in Pleau v. Canada (1999), 181 N.S.R. (2d) 365 and found that s.35(1) of the Regulations made under the Police Act does not apply because the cause of action pre-dates the collective agreement; and, given the structure of the Act and the fact that third party had no independent right to challenge the outcome of the grievance procedure, decided that no adequate remedy was available. The court also held that the pre-eminent role of the arbitration process is not simply product of particular provisions but is central aspect of the overall scheme of collective bargaining labour relations."
5_1991canlii4241.txt,"The applicant union sought an order of mandamus with certiorari in aid, ordering the defendant Minister to exercise his discretion to appoint an arbitrator to hear a grievance. The Minister had refused on the grounds the union was neither certified nor a party to a voluntary agreement. Granting the application, that the Minister had misdirected himself on a point of law. Quite apart from certification and voluntary recognition, the union could attain bargaining rights pursuant to Part II of the Trade Union Act, which allowed an employer in the construction industry to assign bargaining and negotiating rights to an 'accredited employers' association' such as the Construction Management Labour Bureau Ltd. The Court ordered the Minister to exercise his discretion under s.107(4) of the Act according to law as set out in Part II of the Act and confirmed by the Appeal Division in Boyd &amp; Garland.","This was an appeal of a decision by the Minister of Labour and Manpower in Boyd Garland v. International Union of Operating Engineers, Local 721, which was upheld on appeal. Dismissing the matter, that there were only two methods by which an employer can become bound by collective agreement and those are (1) certification and (2) voluntary recognition. In the absence of any statutory provisions, that is quite true. However by virtue of sections 89 et seq of the Trade Union Act the legislature has provided for a rather hybrid scheme of labour relations applicable to the construction industry.

The father applied to vary child support in November on the basis of his reduced income. HELD: The application was dismissed with costs to the petitioner fixed at $1,000. The onus is on the applicant to provide cogent, independent or objective verification of change of circumstances. This application was brought 10 months after the pre-trial conference. It was of no consequence that someone may come into the home rather than using commercial day care service. There was no change in the father's hours of work or the schedule. The only change was that the mother was no longer available to provide care during Saturday of his access weekends. The mother was not to schedule activities during the father's access periods without his consent and he was to provide 7 days written notice if he chooses not to exercise access during specified times. This was not a variation of the custody/access regime but rather specific directions to provide some predictability for the children.","The respondent applied to vary the child support provisions of the consent judgment including his contribution to child care expenses as well as access provisions. HELD: The application was dismissed with costs fixed in the amount of $1,000. The respondent did not suggest any change in his hours of work or work schedule. What had changed was that his mother was no longer available to provide child care during the day on the Saturday of his access weekends. This order was made in order to provide some predictability for the children. It does not constitute a variation of the custody/access regime but rather, specific directions with respect to execution of the access regime. Variation of the Child Support Regime The respondent's income is reduced and refers to his 1999 tax return indicating an income of $42,386.34. It was the understanding the children no longer attended institutional daycare. The fact that he works all day Saturday in the family business means that there are no suitable babysitters in the area. As his taxable income is less than the imputed income, there is no material change in the circumstances."

The plaintiff claims she told the Town Office to shut off her water supply and the failure to do so let to the damages being sustained. HELD: The claim is dismissed. 1) There is no evidence that the plaintiff gave clear instructions to the town to shut off her water. 2) The proximate cause of the damage was turning off the heat and power without ensuring that water line, toilets, and the water tank had been properly drained. 3) The plaintiff sustained no damages herself. She admits she negotiated the sale price of $50,000 with her daughter prior to any damage being sustained to the property. No adjustment had to be made to her daughter thereafter for any 'loss' occasioned. Any claim would have to be made by her daughter not her.","The plaintiff brought an action for water damage sustained to her former residence when frozen pipes burst. She alleged that she instructed the Town Office to shut off her water supply and the failure to do so led to the damages being sustained. The Town of Martensville disputes that such instructions were given and that, in any event, the cause of the pipes bursting was not as result of the water not being turned off, but rather because the plaintiff had the power and heat disconnected. HELD: The action was dismissed. 1)The Court cannot find on the evidence that clear instruction were given by the plaintiff to the town to disconnect the water service. To the contrary, the form executed by her clearly indicates request for final billing. The evidence demonstrates a misunderstanding at best between what the plaintiff believed she was requesting and what in fact she did instruct. This cannot be construed as negligence in the circumstances by the town nor does the fact that specific forms are now utilized for disconnect purposes, thereby causing the damage to the property.  2)The plaintiff's action cannot succeed for the following reasons: 1)There was no negligence on the part of the town or the town in dealing with the plaintiff. The court cannot find clear instructions given by either the plaintiff or her daughter to the Town to disconnect water service and that clear instructions were clearly indicated. This is not the kind of negligence that could have been negotiated by the Town."

2008skqb146.txt,"FIAT: The parties have three children, Jill born December 1981, Luke born May 1986 and Keegan born November 1989. The respondent states that he has paid child support pursuant to the court order of February 2000 but, when the children reached the age of majority, he reduced the amount of child support payable as the children became independent and moved out on their own. The petitioner takes issue with the respondent's unilateral reduction in child support and submits the children remained children within the meaning of the Divorce Act so long as they were attending university. The parties agree that given the age of the children there has been a change in circumstance sufficient to allow a review of the existing child support order. HELD: 1) The parties agree that Jill, age 26 is no longer a child of the marriage and that Luke, age 21 is not presently a child of the marriage but could once again become a child of the marriage if he attends university in the fall of 2008. The parties also agree Keegan is 18 and remains a child of the marriage by virtue of the fact that he is taking classes at the university. 2) While the respondent asks that he be allowed to pay child support directly to the children, there is nothing in the material filed which would indicate that the petitioner is not providing support to the child in an appropriate fashion. Further, the difficulties that would arise in respect to enforcement of the order if the child support payments were not made directly to the petitioner would mitigate against such a variation.","FIAT: The parties agree that given the age of the children, and the change in their income, that there has been a change in circumstances sufficient to allow a review of the existing child support order. HELD: 1) The children remain children of the marriage within the meaning of the Divorce Act.  2) Given the parties' current financial situation and the fact that the children were attending university at the time of the application, the Court of Appeal suggested a three-step process in dealing with support orders for children who have reached a certain age. 3) The parties agreed the respondent's application for variation requested that he be allowed to pay any maintenance payable for Keegan directly to the petitioner. The petitioner filed material indicating that the total arrears were $9,440. The parties also agreed that Jill, now 26 years of age and on her own, was no longer a child of the relationship. The court agreed that the respondent was not providing support to her in an appropriate fashion. 4) The difficulties that could arise in respect to enforcement of the order if the child support payments were not made directly to Ms. Strueby would mitigate against such a variation.  5) Although initially the parties were at odds concerning all three children, by the time their latest submissions were made, some consensus had been reached regarding two of them.  6) Although the parties agree the respondent is not providing adequate support to the children within s. 2(1) of the Act, there is nothing in the material filed which would indicate that the Court considers that the child remains a child within s2(1).

The respondent was sentenced to 90 days secure custody, 45 days community supervision, 1 year probation and a 10 year firearms prohibition. HELD: Appeal allowed orally. The sentence is set aside and a sentence of 12 months closed custody, 6 months community supervision, 1 year probation and a 10 year firearms prohibition was imposed in addition to the 90 days closed custody already served at the time of the appeal.  1) It was clear that the primary concern of the sentencing judge was that, in the wake of the Supreme Court of Canada decision in R. v. B.W.P.; R. v. B.V.N. 2006 SCC 27, a custodial sentence might not be open to him at all. It is the Court's view that the sentencing judge's conclusion that the decision in B.W.P. virtually ruled out custodial sentences for young persons under the Youth Criminal Justice Act was unwarranted. The gist of that decision is that under the Act the principle of general deterrence is not a factor to be taken into account and cannot be used to justify a sentence harsher than the circumstances of the offender and the offence would warrant. Nor is specific deterrence to be considered as a separate factor. 2) It is the Court's view that a long custodial sentence is necessary to accomplish the task of bringing the seriousness of the offence to the respondent's attention, and provide meaningful consequences to reinforce societal values without negatively affecting the respondent's likelihood of rehabilitation.","This was an application for leave to appeal and, leave being granted, an appeal by the Crown from a sentence imposed against a young offender pursuant to the Youth Criminal Justice Act, S.C. 2002, c.1.

The sentence was set aside and a sentence of 12 months closed custody, 6 months community supervision, 1 year probation and a 10 year firearms prohibition was imposed in addition to the 90 days closed custody already served.

The principles of deterrence were not a factor to be taken into account and cannot be used to justify a sentence harsher than the offender and the offence would warrant. Nor was specific deterrence to be considered as a separate factor.  2) The respondent has already served the 90 day closed custody portion of the sentence originally imposed.

The sentence was imposed for robbery with threats of violence contrary to s.348(1)(b) and s.334(2) of the Criminal Code which were committed in March 2000 while the accused was on probation. The appellant and co-accused were convicted of breaking and entering a private residence. The accused took $25 from the premises and held the 68 year old victim while the co-accused went to look for a knife after threatening to cut off his fingers. The following day the two accused used threats of violence while robbing a pharmacy and a witness testified the accused yelled to the co-accused to kill the victims. The co-accused who was convicted of assault received 7 years in prison for the robbery concurrent with 5 years for the B &amp; E. The 23 year old aboriginal who had a Grade 3 education had a prior record of 42 criminal convictions including eight violent or weapons related offences. HELD: Leave was granted. The appeal was allowed. The sentence of 4 years in prison on each charge to be served concurrently took into account time served on remand and electronic monitoring. The sentence was demonstrably unfit and fell outside the range of sentences previously imposed. The sentencing judge relied solely on the principle of rehabilitation, essentially ignoring the other sentencing principles including the level of gravity, the principle of deterrence, the need to denounce such acts, the sentence imposed on the co-accused, and the need to protect the public. A sentencing circle was inappropriate given the level of violence, his risk to re-offend, his consistent ignoring or refusal to follow court orders, and the fact that a penitentiary term was called for in such circumstances.

Excluding any component for aggravated damages, a fair award for general damages is $12,500. HELD: 1) Aggravated damages are variety of non-pecuniary damages aimed at assuaging wounded feelings. The key factors are the nature of the hurt feelings and their impact on the plaintiff's lifestyle, together with their past and projected duration.  2) In assessing general damages, the Court of Appeal referred to its own earlier decision in Rieger v. Burgess (1988), 1988 CanLII 209 (SK CA), 66 Sask. R. 1, another case in which a trial judge reassessed the amount awarded by jury for non peuniary loss. The Court reviewed Queen's Bench Rule 153 (which requires parties to plead specifically any matter, fact or point of law which, if not specifically pleaded, might take the other party by surprise) reviewed the purposes of that Rule and concluded that the nature and scope of aggravated damages ought to be pleaded which accounts no doubt for the practice in this jurisdiction of doing so. 3) The injuries sustained by the defendant as result of the assault were serious but not life threatening.

6_2000skqb94.txt,"A jury determined the plaintiff was constructively dismissed from his employment as park superintendent in 1997 and awarded damages for failure to give reasonable notice. The defendant claimed the contract of employment was all inclusive; that the plaintiff exaggerated the amount of time he spent on the job in winter; that the reduced winter hours were not in lieu of overtime pay as he was a manager within the meaning of s.4(2) of the LSA; the doctrine of estoppel or waiver applied as he never claimed a right to holiday pay for 10 years and the employer relied on his not doing so; if the plaintiff is entitled to holiday pay he should only recover back to April 1990 as he is limited by the Limitation of Actions Act; it should not be based on wages plus truck allowance as wages as defined in the LSA does not include allowances for costs. The claim for unpaid holiday pay claimed from April 1988 to October 1997, based on his wages plus one-half his truck expense allowance, was reserved pending a decision by the Court of Appeal as to whether the Court of Queen's Bench has jurisdiction to determine the issue of entitlement to holiday pay. HELD: The claim was dismissed with costs.  1)The Court of Appeal held in Kolodziejski v. Auto Electric Service that the Queens' Bench has jurisdiction to entertain a civil action for non-payment of holiday pay. 2)The plaintiff may rely on s.30(1) of the LSA to establish he is entitled to holidays and on s.33 to establish he entitled to pay in lieu of taking holidays. The onus then shifts to the defendant to prove it complied with some exception in the LSA. Section 75 prevents an employee from waiving his or her entitlement. Whether the plaintiff asserted his right to holiday pay or not, he remained entitled to his annual holidays in accordance with the LSA. 3)The plaintiff can claim for any holiday pay in lieu of time off that he can establish he was entitled to from April 1990 to his termination date. Section 3(1)(f)of the LAA states that a cause of action for recovery of money under a contract, express or implied, must be commenced within 6 years of the date on which the cause arose. 4)The plaintiff clearly indicated that a portion of the truck allowance was made to avoid paying tax. As such it would be contrary to public policy for the Court to appear to endorse the plaintiff's actions by calculating his holiday pay on the basis of his wage and this portion of his truck allowance.  5)The defendant's position that the contract included a component of holiday pay each month was inconsistent with its position that the plaintiff took these days off as holidays during the year. The contract of employment did not include a component of holiday pay in lieu of time off.  6)Failure by the defendant to keep records for the purpose of inspection by the minister does not result in a reverse onus. The onus remains on the plaintiff to establish what holidays he did not take. 7)The plaintiff admitted to taking time away from his duties for personal time and for city business as mayor. The plaintiff was not there in his capacity as superintendent. Section 31(1)(b) indicates that an employee shall be permitted to take holidays in one uninterrupted period. The defendant allowed the plaintiff to take days off in any manner he chose. It was inconsistent that the plaintiff's failure to comply with the notice requirement meant for the benefit of the employer could be used by an employee to disclaim that his days off were holidays. 8)The plaintiff was clearly a manager within the meaning of LSA. Even if he were not a manager, he failed to prove, on a balance of probabilities that he worked overtime hours in excess of the statutory minimum in order to qualify for overtime. Any days off taken by the plaintiff could not be considered taken in lieu of overtime. The days he was away were holidays as defined in s.30 of the LSA. 9)He did not establish he did 3 weeks holidays.","The plaintiff sued for damages from the defendant alleging he was constructively wrongfully dismissed from his employment with the defendant. At the time of the jury trial, the issue of the Saskatchewan Court of Queen's Bench's jurisdiction to deal with entitlement to holiday pay was being determined by the Court of Appeal for Saskatchewan. The plaintiff asserted that the $250.00 portion of the truck allowance was made to avoid paying tax. In the alternative, the defendant claims that the doctrine of estoppel or waiver should apply to prevent the plaintiff from claiming his entitlement to holidays. HELD: The jury trial was to be held in front of myself as judge alone and would deal with the issues, both factual and legal, with respect to the claim for holiday pay. The defendant asserted that if the court finds that the plaintiff's employment contract was not all-inclusive or that it did not exceed the minimum standards set out in the LSA, the plaintiff should only be entitled to recover back to April 1990 as the plaintiff is limited by The Limitation of Actions Act, R.S.S., 1978, c.L-15 which only allows recovery of money under a contract up to 6 years after the cause of action arises. Finally the defendant asserts that the s.4(2) holiday pay should not be based on his wage and truck allowance as it was only designated as an allowance to avoid taxation. The Court held that the defendant never claimed his holiday pay for 10 years and relied on the plaintiff not doing so. It would be substantially prejudiced if the plaintiff was now allowed to assert that right."
b_1995canlii6024.txt,"The accuseds were charged under ss.300 and 301 of the Code with (i)committing and (ii)publishing a defamatory libel against a police officer. They filed a plea of justification as permitted under s.611(1) of the Code. The Crown denied the truth of the plea pursuant to s.611(4) and the matter proceeded to trial. At the opening of their trial the accuseds applied for an order declaring ss.300 and 301 of the Criminal Code to be of no force and effect on the basis that they constituted an unreasonable limitation on their rights and freedoms guaranteed under ss.2, 7 and 11 of the Charter. The Crown admitted that ss.300 and 301 limited an individual's right to freedom of expression as provided by s.2 of the Charter but argued that this infringement was justified under s.1 of the Charter. HELD: Application allowed in part.  1)The onus of justifying the limitation of a right or freedom is on the party seeking to uphold the limitation and the standard of proof is by a preponderance of probability. 2)The standards against which a limit on a right or freedom guaranteed by the Charter can be shown to be reasonable and demonstrably justified are those underlying values and principles essential to a free and democratic society. While the right of free speech is important in our society, it is not unrestricted. 3)In order to justify an infringement of this right, it must be shown that: (i)the impugned legislative provision has an objective of pressing and substantial concern and (ii)there is a proportionality to the legislation in that: (a)the measures must be fair and not arbitrary, carefully designed to achieve the objective in question and rationally connected to the objective; (b)the means should impair freedom of expression as little as possible; (c)there must be a proportionality between the effects of the limiting legislation and the objective. S.300 of the Code meets these tests, and is therefore a reasonable limit on free speech and is valid. 4)Ss.611 and 612 of the Code, which permit a plea of justification do not create a reverse onus on the accused. They are procedural and merely serve to put the Crown on notice as to the accused's defence. The Crown must still prove that the alleged defamatory libel is knowingly false beyond a reasonable doubt. 5)S.301 of the Code makes it an offence to publish a defamatory libel whether or not the accused believes it to be true. S.301 is therefore not a reasonable limit and is invalid. ADDENDUM: The Court ordered that the agreed statement of facts set out at pp. 2 and 3 of the judgment not be published nor broadcast in any manner.","HELD: The Court found that s. 300 and 301 of the Criminal Code constitute an unreasonable limitation of one or more of the rights and freedoms guaranteed by s. 2, and 11(c)and (d) of the Charter. The accused were arraigned on two counts of defamatory libel. Pursuant to s. 655 of the Code, the accused admitted the following facts: 1) the accused published matter without lawful justification that was likely to injure the reputation of [the police officer] by exposing him to hatred, contempt or ridicule or that was designed to insult the police officer knowing that the matter published was false. 2) They published a plea of justification consisting of 17 typed pages which, for the purposes of this application, need not be reproduced."

For the plaintiff, that there is a prima fade duty of care owed by the Department of Transportation to users of highway against reasonably foreseeable hazards, including the falling of trees onto the highway. Further, the defendant had a duty to use a reasonable standard of care in the operation of the hazardous tree removal program. The defendant was negligent in failing to train the inspector properly. The Court referred at length to the Supreme Court of Canada decision in Just v. British Columbia.

He was now a paraplegic. The plaintiff's action against the defendants Redden and Lockhart as occupiers of the property was originally framed in nuisance and negligence. A separate action was started against the Attorney General. The Attorney General did not consent to the discontinuance of the action against them. HELD: The Court found that the duty of care should not arise in relation to acts and omissions which reflect the policy-making and discretionary elements involved in the exercise of statutory discretions. It was necessary to determine whether liability may be imposed upon the respondent in any case where negligent misconduct has been alleged against a government agency. The Court also found that there was a policy to inspect, which was not adopted in a bona fide exercise of discretion."
d_2009skqb70.txt,"At issue is the amount of Income Replacement Benefits (IRB) payable to the appellant by SGI. The parties agree that the calculation of the IRB as provided by s. 117 of the Act is the annualized sum of $28,889.75. The appellant takes issue with SGI's reduction of the amount determined in accordance with s. 117 of the Act by calculating the appellant's net income in accordance with s. 135 to s. 138 of the Act. HELD: SGI has correctly calculated the appellant's IRB when it made the requisite deductions as set out in s. 137 to find the appellant's net income, and then reduced the net income to 90% to determine his IRB. It would be neither a rational nor fair interpretation to reduce a full-time earner's IRB by 90% and not the other types of earners. It would be neither a rational nor fair interpretation to deduct income tax, employment insurance premiums and Canada Pension contributions from only full-time earners. All earners are subject to these payments being deducted from their income but for their inability to earn an income because of an automobile accident. The further deductions to obtain the non- earner's IRB are in keeping with his earning reality.","The respondent's IRB for the 181st and subsequent days following an accident was not less than the IRB calculated for the first 180 days after the accident. It would be neither a rational nor fair interpretation to deduct income tax, employment insurance premiums and Canada Pension contributions from only full-time earners, such as Montgrand. The respondent took issue with SGI's reduction of the amount determined in accordance with s. 117 of the Act by calculating Montgrand's net income. HELD: SGI has correctly calculated Montgrand’s IRB when it made the requisite deductions as set out in s. 137 and then reduced the net income to 90% and not the other types of earners. SGI was correct in applying Regulation 102 which states, “Interest payable pursuant to Part VIII is to be calculated in accordance accordance with the Pre-judgment Interest Act.” 1) The respondent was paying an amount less than that. 2) SGI is correctly deducting the amount of Canada Pension Plan benefits Montgrand is receiving. The hearing judge raised no concern with respect to the 'weighted average approach' employed by SGI beyond advancing an interpretation of s. 116(4) of the act that is inconsistent with the legislation. 3) There is no true lis regarding the efficacy of using the SGI standard approach to calculate the net incomes of all victims. The Act is intended to correlate the non-earner's income replacement benefit (IRB) with his or her earning reality. The further deductions are in keeping with his earning reality, poor past record ought not to preclude the claimant from an IRB that reflects his earning realities. 4) The Court of Appeal reviewed the matter of the determination of the calculation of the interim IRB and found that SGI had correctly calculated the respondent’S net income by calculating it. The parties brought the matter back for further determination because the respondent is paying $28,889.75."

There was a long history of relatively short terms of employment and several moves to take employment. The respondent had a grade 12 education and some university courses but no practical skills or training. For the past 3 years, the respondent had made no reasonable efforts for employment, developed no skills of a practical nature, and derived her income from child support payments and the Child Tax Credit and by incurring debt in excess of $20,000.00 The parties had entered bankruptcy during the course of the marriage and had no assets or savings or pension entitlement at the time of separation or acquired since. The petitioner now earned an annual salary of $115,500.00. The Agreement did not address the level of child support in accordance with the Federal Child Support Guidelines, nor did it provide for practical retaining by the Respondent to facilitate employment. This was an exceptional situation that required some adjustment to the Agreement reached by the parties.

Limited spousal support was to terminate on the earlier of completion of the retraining allowance or transfer of the balance of the outstanding to the Respondent on September 1st, 2001. An adjustment was also made to account for arrears in child support and child support payments.","The parties entered into a Partial Agreement and Minutes of Settlement to provide for joint care and custody of the children with primary residence being with their mother and fixing her with the responsibility for their day to day care. The Agreement did not address the level of child support in accordance with the Federal Child Support Guidelines in effect nor did it provide a limited capacity or practical retraining by the petitioner to facilitate employment. HELD: The Divorce Judgment will be issued forthwith. 1) This is an exceptional situation that requires some adjustment with respect to the Agreement reached by the parties and filed May the 13th, 1998. 2) It must be acknowledged that the parties have never had any financial stability in part because they far too readily accessed credit based on future expectations of capacity that have never been realized and they would be wise to cease utilization of credit for short term relief. Doing so in the long run imperils the ability to provide properly for the children."
5_1993canlii6695.txt,"The plaintiff applied under Queen's Bench Rule 231 to strike the statements of defence of a corporate and individual defendant for failure to attend scheduled examinations despite service of an appointment and payment of conduct money to their solicitor. The defendants had previously been permitted to re-open judgments obtained against them and had filed defences. Prior to that they had consistently failed to attend examinations in aid of execution. Contempt proceedings had been commenced against them but were adjourned sine die at the time the defendants were permitted to defend. The defendants resisted the application on the basis that they were now non-residents and not compellable by an appointment, and that the designated officer of the defendant corporation was no longer an officer. This information had not been communicated to the plaintiff's solicitor who had acted in good faith on information given to him previously by the solicitors for the defendants. The examinations had been scheduled unilaterally because the defendants' solicitor consistently refused or neglected to return phone calls or correspondence from the plaintiff's solicitors. HELD: The judge refused to strike the defences holding that in the circumstances Queen's Bench Rule 231 did not apply. He also held that the defendants, considering their conduct throughout the whole course of the lawsuit, were in contempt and ordered them to attend without conduct money any examinations unilaterally scheduled by the plaintiff failing agreement between counsel as to dates. Costs were fixed at $1,500 in any event of the cause and were ordered to be paid within two weeks.","The plaintiff applied to strike the statement of defence of the corporate defendant, Great Canadian Bingo Corp. on the ground that the designated officer of the corporation failed to appear at an examination for discovery on the basis of an appointment. The plaintiff's solicitors had on several occasions telephoned the defendant's solicitor to schedule examinations for discovery and to obtain statements as to documents. None of the calls were returned. The defendants' solicitor subsequently wrote to the plaintiff's solicitor proposing a range of dates for the examinations. HELD: The application was dismissed. 1)The defendants were not entitled to any conduct money for the initial attendances at the examinations for the discovery or for any subsequent attendances required for the completion of the examination.  2)There was no court order designating the proper officer for the defendant corporation. He is no longer an officer or a director of the Corporation.  3)The plaintiff was not compellable to attend the scheduled examinations. 4)The defendant corporation was guilty of contempt of court.  5)The non-attendances did not constitute'refusing or neglecting to attend' within the meaning of Rule 231.

1998canlii3382.txt,"The appellant employer and the respondent union are parties to a collective agreement with effect from January 1, 1994 to December 31, 1996. The collective agreement established employee salaries for that period, with annual adjustments on January 1st of each year. Shortly before the agreement was signed, the Public Sector Compensation Act was passed, which rolled back and froze public sector salaries. In a letter to the union, the employer confirmed the wage increases provided for in the agreement would be paid to the employees as a lump sum following the expiration of the legislated wage freeze. After the expiration of the wage freeze, however, the employer refused to pay the lump sum on the grounds that it would contravene the Act. The union sued the employer in the Supreme Court, claiming the lump sum or, in the alternative, damages for negligent misrepresentation. The employer applied to strike the Statement of Claim on the grounds that the union's claims were within the exclusive jurisdiction of an arbitrator. The Chambers judge dismissed the application. The employer appealed. Allowing the appeal and staying the action pending submission to arbitration as provided for in the collective agreement, that the Chambers judge erred in allowing the action to continue. Where there is a doubt about the arbitrability of a dispute, that issue should generally be determined at arbitration. This reflects the central role of arbitration in collective bargaining labour relations, recognizes that arbitration is the forum best suited to conducting the necessary inquiry, and helps ensure that no one, absent sound reasons, will be left with rights but no effective remedy.","The appellant was an employer and the respondent union. By successorship, they are parties to a collective agreement signed in 1994 with effect from January 1, 1994 to December 31, 1996. The collective agreement establishes employee salaries for that period, with annual adjustments to January in each year. The employer sought to strike the respondent's statement of claim on the ground that the union's claims were within the exclusive jurisdiction of an arbitrator. The respondent appealed, seeking leave for this purpose. HELD: Appeal allowed. 1)Where there is doubt about the arbitrability of the dispute, that issue should generally be determined initially at arbitration. This view is mandated by the text of the collective agreement and the Trade Union Act. It also best reflects the central role of arbitration in collective bargaining labour relations, recognizes that arbitration is the forum best suited to conducting the necessary inquiry and helps ensure that no one, absent sound reasons, will be left with rights but no effective remedy. 2)There were several factual questions relevant to that issue which could not be explored on an application under Rule 14.25. It was inconsistent with Weber's emphasis on the exclusive nature of arbitral jurisdiction."
