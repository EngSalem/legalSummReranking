September 17, 2010[1] By order and judgment dated March 29, 2010, I certified the within action as a class action.
DJO Canada, Inc., DJO, LLC, McKinley Medical LLC, McKinley Medical Corporation and Curlin Medical Inc. sought leave to appeal the certification order to the Court of Appeal pursuant to s. 39(3)(a) of The Class Actions Act, S.S. 2001, c. C-12.01.
A number of grounds of appeal were advanced by the defendants.
[2] On August 26, 2010, Chief Justice Klebuc rendered a decision on the leave application.
All other aspects of the leave to appeal application, including that relating to the breach of duty of care cause of action, were dismissed.","This was an appeal from a conviction for carrying a concealed weapon, a push dagger, contrary to s.89(a) of the Criminal Code.

BETWEEN: ALBERT D. DOYLE and HER MAJESTY THE QUEEN Respondent Barbara J. Beach for the Appellant Bruce P. Archibald for the Respondent Appeal Heard: March 27, 1991 Judgment Delivered: March 27, 1991 THE COURT: Appeal allowed and new trial ordered per reasons for judgment of Hallett, J.A.; Matthews and Freeman, JJ.A. concurring. The reasons for judgment of the Court were delivered orally by: HALLETT, J.A.: This is an appeal from conviction for carrying a concealed weapon, a push dagger, contrary to Section 89(a) of the Criminal Code. It is clear from the remarks of the learned trial judge that he did not consider the definition of weapon as set out in Section 2 of the Criminal Code. He founded the conviction solely on the basis the push dagger was concealed on the accused person. This case was tried before the Appeal Division handed down its decision on November 14, 1990, in R. v. Roberts in which the Court interpreted the 1985 definition of weapon as contained in Section of the Criminal Code. That definition is as follows: ""'weapon' means: (a) anything used or intended for use in causing death or injury to persons whether designed for such purpose or not, or (b) anything used or intended for use for the purpose of threatening or intimidating any person, and, without restricting the generality of the foregoing, includes any firearm as defined in section 84."" In this case, before convicting the accused of Section 89(a) offence, the trial judge would have to be satisfied that the Crown had proven beyond reasonable doubt not only that the push dagger was concealed but that it was weapon as defined in Section of the Criminal Code. On the second element of the offence, the trial judge would have to be satisfied that the accused intended to use the push dagger to cause injury or death to persons or intended to use it for the purpose of threatening or intimidating any person. That is question for the trial judge. As the trial judge did not consider this, the appeal must be allowed. We disagree with the argument that there is no evidence from which an inference of the accused's intent in having the concealed push dagger on his person might be drawn. It is question for the trial judge, considering all the circumstances, to determine if the Crown has proven the essential intent element of this offence. Considering the evidence, it would be inappropriate to enter an acquittal. The appeal is allowed and a new trial ordered. Under the circumstances, there is no need to consider if the sentence imposed was, fit. Hallett, J.A. Concurred in: Matthews, J.A Freeman, J.A.

R. 273].
The defendant seeks to have the costs reduced because the plaintiff was unsuccessful in part of her claim.
The trial did not commence until November 27, 2000.
It lasted for parts of 12 days.
On November 22, 2000, the defendant served an offer to settle for $75,000.00 plus taxable costs.
The offer was not accepted by the plaintiff.
The judgment obtained by the plaintiff was for $77,406.15 together with some additional special damages and pre-judgment interest for a total judgment of $120,540.43.
ISSUES[3] The issues to be resolved on this application include: 1.
Whether the success of each party affects the amount of costs to be awarded to either; 2.
What amount should be awarded for expert witnesses; and; 3.
The level at which a second counsel fee should be taxed or allowed.","The defendant farmer pled guilty to failing to take every precaution that was reasonable in the circumstances to ensure the health and safety of persons in the workplace, after a young employee drowned in a manure pit that was not properly secured due to a damaged barricade having been removed while a new one was on order.

The defendant was an individual and not a huge corporation, had been conscientious about safety issues prior to this incident and had endeavored to improve safety at his farm after the incident; the deceased had also failed in his responsibilities under the Act and was working with a significant blood alcohol content.","[0, 4, 1, 5, 8, 2, 10, 3, 7, 13, 15, 17, 6, 18, 14, 12, 11, 16]",18,"LANE J.A. IN THE PROVINCIAL COURT OF NOVA SCOTIA Citation: R. v. Sutherland, 2009 NSPC 21 Date: May 4, 2009 Docket: 1929864 Registry: Shubenacadie Her Majesty the Queen v. Mark Sutherland DECISION Judge: The Honourable Judge Anne S. Derrick Heard: May 4, 2009 Oral Decision: May 4, 2009 Charges: Occupational Health and Safety Act Section 74(1) Counsel: Glenn Hubbard for the Crown Brad Yuill for the Defence [1] Mark Sutherland owns and operates a family dairy farm. It is his family’s livelihood. Mr. Sutherland has been active in the farming community and has been developing and improving his farm since acquiring it in 1996. He is 38 years old and supports two children. On August 13, 2006, one of his employees, Gary Boake, died in an accident at the farm property. [2] Mr. Sutherland has pleaded guilty to an offence under the Occupational Health and Safety Act , that he failed to take every precaution that is reasonable in the circumstances to ensure the health and safety of persons at the workplace. Mr. Sutherland’s guilty plea relates to the fact that on August 13, 2006, there was a manure pit on the farm that did not have a barrier. Mr. Sutherland’s responsibility to safeguard employees from risks associated with that manure pit arise under section 13(1) of the Occupational Health and Safety Act. The Act also requires, under section 17(1), that every employee, while at work, shall ""take every reasonable precaution in the circumstances to protect the employee’s own health and safety...at or near the workplace."" [3] On August 13, 2006, Gary Boake, nineteen years old, met ghastly and tragic death. He drowned in a manure pit. The tragedy that resulted in his death unfolded in matter of minutes after he got to the farm. The facts establish that he had been out all night at social event, and like many young people sowing their wild oats, had been drinking and had not slept. His blood alcohol concentration was significantly over the legal limit for operating any kind of vehicle. Nevertheless, he was responsible enough to show up for his job at the Sutherland dairy farm. He probably should not have gone to work in his condition but he did, perhaps because he was not the kind of young man to let an employer down by not showing up. However he was in no condition to be operating equipment, which he needed to do to remove manure to the manure pit, and placed himself at risk. Mr. Sutherland ’s failure was in not securing the manure pit which had its damaged barricade removed while a new one was on order, or not arranging for an alternative to using the pit, alternatives that did exist on the farm at the time. [4] The news of Mr. Boake’s death was the news families dread. And it was the worst news imaginable. Not only had there been an accident, and farm work being inherently dangerous, accidents are daily risk, but Mr. Boake had died. There is nothing that will bring any comfort to Mr. Boake ’s family: they are left to mourn the loss of such young life. His mother, Bonnie McMullen continues to grieve. In her Victim Impact Statement she says the following: think what upsets me the most is not really knowing what he was going through as he was being submerged deeper into the pit. think of him every day, and yes, have the memories, but it is just not the same. want my baby back. Without the support of my husband, family and friends, would not have made it through this ordeal."" [5] Section 74(1) of the Occupational Health and Safety Act provides that the penalty for corporation violating the regulations under the Act is maximum fine of $250,000. Section 75 establishes range of additional sentencing options, sometimes referred to as ""creative sentencing options"" that can include: directing the offender to pay to the Minister an amount for the purpose of public education in the safe conduct of the activity in relation to which the offence was committed, and principles of internal responsibility provided for in the Act; community service; and requiring the offender to comply with such other reasonable conditions as the court considers appropriate and just. [6] The Crown and Defence have taken joint position that the total amount of the fine in this case should be $25,000. have heard submissions on how this penalty should be broken down, into fine portion and portion representing the value of Mr. Sutherland’s time and expertise in educating other farmers about farm safety and promoting new Farm Safety Association. [7] The legal framework for this sentencing has been constructed by the purpose and principles of sentencing found in sections 718 to 718.2 of the Criminal Code, which apply here by operation of Nova Scotia’s Summary Proceedings Act, and the occupational health and safety cases applying these norms. The principles of sentencing for occupational health and safety violations that is reflected in these sections of the Criminal Code mentioned has been described as follows: There are three primary objectives of sentencing for violation of the applicable health and safety legislation. First, there is the deterrence aspect of the sentencing process, both specific to the convicted party and generally for the community. Secondly, there is the retribution aspect of the sentencing process, indicating the moral wrong and the need to reinforce the value or standard that was violated. Thirdly, there is the rehabilitation‑reform aspect of the sentencing process for the convicted party to be assisted in not repeating the offence. [8] Principles of sentencing that must be examined closely in arriving at fit and proper disposition are proportionality, parity and restraint. The principle of proportionality requires that Mr. Sutherland’s sentence be proportionate to his moral blameworthiness for the offence of failing to take reasonable precautions to address the problem of the damaged barricade having been removed at the entrance of the manure pit. Other factors that are relevant to the issue of proportionality in this case are the fact that Mr. Sutherland is before me as an individual not a large corporation and the fact that Mr. Boake also had responsibilities under the Occupational Health and Safety Act that he did not meet. [9] The principle of parity in sentencing requires that ""a sentence should be similar to sentences imposed on similar offenders for similar offences committed in similar circumstances"", but this case does not lend itself easily to comparisons. am satisfied that it cannot be equated to Occupational Health and Safety Act cases where fatalities have led to high fines being imposed against corporate offender. Punishment should be mitigated by Mr. Sutherland’s lesser degree of culpability. He also has no prior record for Occupational Health and Safety Act violations. It is material to me as well that the evidence in Exhibit 1, containing diagrams and photographs of Mr. Sutherland’s farm, and the submissions of Mr. Yuill, indicate clearly that Mr. Sutherland was conscientious about safety issues before August 13, 2006 and has endeavored to address and improve safety at his farm since the tragedy of Mr. Boake’s death. He has made substantial changes to the farm since August 2006, including building new dairy barn. These plans were in the works before Mr. Boake’s death but have been informed by this tragedy, including safer method for disposing of manure, through gravity fed tightly spaced gratings that Mr. Sutherland designed himself. [10] The primary goal in sentencing Mr. Sutherland is general deterrence; the sending of message to other employers that safety in the workplace must be rigorously maintained. Satisfying the imperatives of general deterrence in sentencing however has to be accomplished in manner that reflects the particular circumstances of the case. General deterrence may mean different things in different cases. [11] Having accounted for the mitigating factors that apply in this case, Mr. Sutherland’s guilty plea and the steps he has taken since Mr. Boake’s accident to improve safety at the farm, I am satisfied that the joint recommendation of counsel for a total penalty of $25,000 is appropriate in this case. I accept the submission that a $25,000 penalty is a significant penalty for Mr. Sutherland. [12] also accept that the penalty should include significant contribution by Mr. Sutherland to farm safety initiatives. Nothing can bring Mr. Boake back to life but the experience of the tragedy and, very importantly, Mr. Sutherland’s knowledge of addressing farm safety issues, can assist in preventing the loss of another life, which at least will mean that however heartbreaking the loss of Mr. Boake’s life, he will not have died in vain. [13] I am going to direct that the fine portion of the penalty be paid, as is jointly recommended, to the Canadian Farmers’ Disability Registry. That amount will be $15,000. In addition I am directing that Mr. Sutherland perform 160 hours community service specifically with respect to farm safety, including preparation and travel to meetings associated with the issue. can say that regard the total penalty that am imposing here to be substantial penalty for Mr. Sutherland, accepting that this is family run dairy farm. Mr. Sutherland is before me as an individual. have, of course, taken into account that the failure to have met the requirements of the Occupational Health and Safety Act here did result in fatality and so that is material in recognizing the appropriateness of substantial penalty. [14] am not imposing Victim Surcharge for the reason that consider it to be an undue hardship in Mr. Sutherland ’s circumstances and also because the joint recommendation, which have accepted, did not propose Victim Surcharge portion and recommended that Mr. Sutherland be responsible for an amount totaling $25,000, and in doing so, recognized that the components would be straight fine and community service. [15] will finally note that while certainly appreciate that farmers do not work 40 hour weeks, that if one takes conventional 40 hour week, obviously 160 hours is four such weeks and that is how arrived at the 160 hour figure. That is substantial contribution directly by Mr. Sutherland to farm safety in light of his other responsibilities with respect to his dairy business.",2_2009nspc21.txt,"The defendant farmer pled guilty to failing to take every precaution that was reasonable in the circumstances to ensure the health and safety of persons in the workplace, after a young employee drowned in a manure pit that was not properly secured due to a damaged barricade having been removed while a new one was on order.

BETWEEN: PAUL WINSTON BOUDREAU and HER MAJESTY THE QUEEN Respondent William Brian Smith and Kevin Drolet for the Appellant Dana Giovannetti for the Respondent Appeal Heard: November 20, 1991 Judgment Delivered: November 20, 1991 THE COURT: Appeal allowed, verdict set aside and new trial ordered on the indictment, per oral reasons for judgment of Hallett, J.A.; Jones and Chipman, JJ.A. concurring. The reasons for judgment of the Court were delivered orally by: HALLETT, LA.: This is an appeal from a conviction of first degree murder. We agree with counsel that the trial judge\'s instruction to the jury contained several serious errors; the most serious being the instruction as to the requisite intent for murder. The trial judge failed to instruct the jury that nothing short of the accused\'s subjective foresight of death can found a conviction for murder (R. v. Martineau (1990), 1990 CanLII 80 (SCC), 58 C.C.C. (3d) 353). Furthermore, the instruction given could have left the jury with the impression that the appellant could be convicted of murder if it was proven beyond reasonable doubt that he attacked Smith and was merely careless whether he killed him or not. Secondly, on the evidence adduced at trial, the jury should not have been instructed that they could return a verdict of first degree murder by the application of s. 231(5) of the Criminal Code (see R. v. Pare (1988), 1987 CanLII 1 (SCC), 38 C.C.C. (3d) 97 at n. 108). In addition to the errors already mentioned, the instructions on the defence of drunkenness were not adequate and there were errors in the jury selection process. Because of these errors the verdict cannot stand. The appeal is allowed, the verdict is set aside and a new trial is ordered on the indictment. J.A. Concurred in: Jones, J.A. Chipman, J.A.

PUGSLEY, J.A: This is an appeal by the young offender who was convicted of nine charges of break and enter and one charge of assault. He submits that the Youth Court judge erred in law, in concluding that the statements taken from him by the R.C.M.P. on March 3, 1992 were voluntary statements, and erred, as well, in finding that the statements had been taken in compliance with the provisions of s. 56 of the Young Offenders Act. He does not appeal the finding of guilt on two of the convictions, but submits that the balance of the eight convictions are based solely on the impugned statements. The Youth Court judge found, and counsel agree, that if the statements are not admissible, then there is no evidence of guilt on the remaining eight charges. (1) The appellant, and his girlfriend L., were living in trailer, maintained by the appellant's sister C,, at [name of town changed]. At 12:39 hours on March 3, 1992, Constables Deveau and Coughlin of the local R.C.M.P. Detachment attended at the trailer and took the appellant into custody. The appellant was placed under arrest for break and enter on the previous evening into the office of local lawyer. The appellant was given his rights to counsel, as well as police warning. (2) The appellant was taken to the police station in [name of town changed] arriving about 12:40 hours where he remained until approximately 16:00 hours. (3) In the interview room, shortly after arrival at the station, Constable Deveau produced form, apparently devised by the R.C.M.P., to be used as guideline to explain the rights afforded to young person under s. 56 of the Act, and if applicable and the young person were so inclined, to be signed as waiver pursuant to s. 56(4). The appellant signed the form and wrote the following: ""Last night was home with C. and L. and we watched few movies and went to bed about 3:00 o'clock in the morning."" (4) Constable Deveau remained in the interview room with the appellant for further 15 minutes to discuss ""off the record"" as they had on number of occasions in the past, the appellant's involvement in recent crimes in the area. During the course of the ""discussion"", the appellant admitted to Constable Deveau that he was responsible for the crime for which he had just been charged, notwithstanding his written exculpatory statement given few minutes earlier. Constable Deveau testified that this admission, in the light of the ""off the record"" nature of the discussion, did not constitute evidence against the appellant. (5) Constable Deveau then left the interview room. He was replaced by Constable Coughlin who advised the appellant that, he was under investigation for break, enter and theft at the [name of school changed]. The appellant was not placed under arrest for this offence. Constable Coughlin produced fresh copy of the s. 56 form. The appellant signed waiver of the right to speak to counsel, and to have counsel present, during the giving of the statement, but shortly thereafter the appellant requested to speak to lawyer. He was taken to an adjoining room where he used telephone to complete the call in private. At 13:25 hours, the appellant returned to the interview room and advised Constable Coughlin that he had spoken to his lawyer, who was going to get in touch with the Crown prosecutor to inquire about having the appellant released. Prompted by an inquiry from Constable Coughlin at 14:38 hours the appellant replied that he was not going to give statement. Constable Coughlin was aware that the appellant was still waiting to hear from his lawyer. (6) Constable Coughlin was replaced by Constable MacDonald at 14:40 hours. He advised the appellant that he had evidence to indicate that the appellant was involved in break and enter at the [name of place changed] and break in at the airport in [name of town changed]. The appellant refused to give statement in connection with either matter. (7) At approximately 15:00 hours, the appellant was placed in cell. Shortly thereafter, he asked Constable Coughlin and another officer, if they would release him in consideration of disclosure by the appellant of the names of ""the big hash dealers"" in [name of town changed]. The police rejected the proposal. (8) At approximately 16:00 hours, the appellant was taken to the courthouse in [name of town changed] to be remanded. He was transported in police car by Constables Coughlin and Ott, but they were also accompanied by the appellant's girlfriend L. who had been arrested by the police an hour earlier. Although the appellant had been advised by Constable Coughlin that he was under investigation for the break and enter at the [name of school changed], the appellant was not charged with that offence. Upon inquiry by the appellant as to why L. was in the police car, Constable Coughlin advised that she was being charged with the break and enter at the [name of school changed]. The appellant became extremely upset upon hearing this news. (9) While waiting for the justice of the peace, in his chambers at the courthouse, the appellant testified that Constable Coughlin then said to him: ""You are pretty upset. If you are willing to give statement admitting to everything, I'll think twice about entering information on L.."" Constable Coughlin's recollection of this conversation is, as follows: ""If you couldn't tell me otherwise, she was being charged ... if you'd given me statement like contrary to the proof that we had if (the appellant) had something to say that was contrary to our evidence, or didn't support her evidence, that she may not be charged ..."" The trial judge found that ""there was something conveyed to [the appellant] that would have caused him to consider whether by giving statement, he could give benefit to his girlfriend L."". (10) Constable Deveau, seeing that the appellant was upset, invited the appellant to have cigarette in the police car outside the courthouse. While sharing the front seat, the appellant stated that he was thinking of giving statement and, according to the appellant, Constable Deveau responded: “Well it would be in your best interests because if you were to open up about all of the charges, the judge probably wouldn't give you too much more time for them all than he would for three of them only ... and then you wouldn't have to worry about them coming and haunting you in the future when you get released. ... it would be best for me to open up about all of the charges and get them dealt with while was young offender instead of having to worry about them after got released because I'd more likely be an adult when was released."" Constable Deveau testified that he only told the appellant that he could not give an answer to him as to what kind of sentence he would get but that it was entirely within the control of the court. The trial judge concluded: ""[The appellant] was the one who brought up the possibility of giving statement, and although no doubt Constable Deveau did go on to discuss what the possible outcome might be, how court might handle it, and there is suggestion made by Constable Deveau and by Constable Coughlin that in situation where person makes confession to number of crimes at once it's quite likely that the outcome, in terms of sentence, would be less onerous than if they were dealt with one at time ... if there were no admission, if he was convicted at trial on the presentation of other evidence. There's no doubt there were such conversations; nevertheless, in my view, this was not imposed on [the appellant] in any sense ... don't find that anything that was said to him .. was blatantly untrue; in fact, think that anyone with experience in the justice system would have to acknowledge that it's been explicitly acknowledged on sentencing that the giving of confession in the dealing with charges at once, plea of guilty and so forth, are proper considerations to take into account in mitigating sentence. This was conveyed to him. don't see anything improper in that ..."" (11) At 17:00 hours upon being returned to the police station, the appellant advised Constable Coughlin that he wanted to see his sister C., his girlfriend L., his former girlfriend M.G. and his friend C.H., in private so that he could discuss with them giving statement to the police concerning the break and enter at the [name of school changed]. This request was granted. After an interval, Constable Coughlin returned to the group to determine whether or not the appellant was ready to give statement and according to L., Constable Coughlin told [the appellant] that A... if he gave statement and cooperated he would recommend that he be given lighter sentence, two years instead of three. can't remember his exact words. It was something to that effect ... if you cooperate we'll recommend ... something like that ... that you'll get less of sentence you'll get two years instead of three."" The recollection of the appellant's sister, C., with respect to this conversation is as follows: ""'[Cnst.] Coughlin said that if [the appellant] were to cooperate with him and give the statement that it would be probably easier on him ... and asked him ... said 'well' ... he said 'Right now he's looking at three to ten years'. He said if he gives statement he'll probably only get two as long as he cooperates with us, and asked him ... said, 'Well, what's his guarantee?' He said there is no guarantee. It depends on the judge, and said 'Well why should he give you the statement if if he's got no guarantee?' And he said, 'Well, if he gives statement, I'll help him out' He said 'I'll put good word in for him.'"" The trial judge then questioned the witness on this point: ""Q. You said that now [the appellant's] looking at three to ten years and then there was somebody said if he gave statement he'd be looking at two years. Who was it that ...? Coughlin. Q. According to your evidence, said that? It was Constable Coughlin? Q. So if he gave statement he'd be looking at two years or something like two years .. Q. Is the way you recall it? A. If he cooperated he'd be looking at less time and he said anywhere from year to two years. He said at the most you'd get two years if you cooperate."" Her brother then wrote out statement in long hand implicating himself in variety of crimes in the [name of town changed] area. C.H.'s only recollection is that Constable Coughlin's attitude was: ""It would help yourself out give the statement get it over with you know be easy on yourself."" The appellant was ""pretty sure"" that there was discussion with Constable Coughlin concerning sentence before he committed pen to paper ""but can't say for sure it there was or not"" Constable Coughlin denies holding out any inducement with respect to assisting the appellant to obtain lesser sentence in consideration of an inculpatory statement. M.G.., who was present throughout the entire interview which commenced at 17:11 and concluded at 19:42 hours, did not corroborate the evidence of the appellant's sister or his girlfriend. The trial judge did not deal with this conflict in his decision and made no findings of credibility with respect to this issue. (12) After completing statement in writing before Constable Coughlin wherein the appellant acknowledged his direct involvement in ten crimes in the [name of community changed], the appellant then completed second statement in front of Constable Deveau concerning the only charge on which he had been arrested (the break and enter at the lawyer's office). During the course of giving the statements to Constable Coughlin at 17:11 hours and Constable Deveau at 19:50 hours, the appellant was accompanied throughout by M.G., an adult of his choice, and for substantial period of time, his sister C.. ISSUE: While a number of issues have been raised by the appellant, the critical matter in dispute is whether or not the statements taken at 17:11 hours and 19:50 hours were voluntary statements. statement given to police officer is only admissible if it is voluntary statement. This requirement is imposed, not only by the Young Offenders Act (s. 56(2)(a)) but also by the common law. The test enunciated by Lord Sumner in Ibraham v. R. (1914), (A.C. 599) at p. 609: ""It has long been established as positive rule of English criminal law that no statement by an accused is admissible in evidence against him unless it is shown by the prosecution to have been voluntary statement, in the sense that it has not been obtained from him either by fear of prejudice, or hope of advantage, exercised or held out, by person in authority."" has been adopted by the Supreme Court in R. v. Rothman (1981), 1981 CanLII 23 (SCC), S.C.R. 640. At 13:15 hours the appellant consulted counsel by phone and, at the conclusion of the call, advised Constable Coughlin that he was waiting to receive additional advice from counsel. At 14:38 hours the appellant advised Constable Coughlin that he was still waiting to receive counsel's advice, and accordingly, did not wish to give statement. At 17:11 hours the appellant advised Constable Coughlin that he was prepared to give statement acknowledging his participation in various crimes recently committed in the [name of town changed] area. The appellant had not, to the knowledge of the police, spoken to counsel in the interim. What prompted the change in the appellant's position? There are, in my opinion, two matters which could have influenced his decision: 1. the inducement offered by Constable Coughlin not to charge the appellant's girlfriend, L.. 2. the alleged inducements, concerning the participation of the police, in recommending lighter sentence in the event the appellant confessed to all of the crimes in which he was involved. With respect to the first issue, the trial judge, found that something was conveyed to the appellant ""that would have caused him to consider whether by giving statement he could give benefit to his girlfriend L.."" Notwithstanding this finding, the trial judge did not exclude the statement because he felt the offer did not have much of an impact on the appellant's decision. The trial judge stated that the appellant ""maintained his anger towards the police and felt L. would beat the charge anyway."" This conclusion is supported by the appellant's failure to comment on this topic during his trial evidence. The appellant did not, at any time, suggest that Constable Coughlin's offer was the impetus to give the written statement. The matter that is most troublesome, however, is the evidence dealing with the statements allegedly made by Constable Coughlin that if the young offender were to cooperate that he (Constable Coughlin) would help him out ""to secure lesser sentence."" The evidence given by the appellant\'s sister on this point was raised during the course of her cross‑examination by the appellant\'s counsel, and also confirmed in her responses to questions from the Court. Evidence of a similar nature was given by the appellant\'s girlfriend L.. The trial judge, in the course of careful review of the evidence, unfortunately, did not make any findings of fact or determinations of credibility on this essential matter. If the evidence of the appellant\'s sister and girlfriend was accepted, then the inducement was clearly established, and the Crown, in my view, would have failed to prove, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the statements were voluntary. This was critical issue. It is the primary duty of trial judge to make findings of fact and determinations of credibility. (See Matthews J.A. on behalf of the Court in Foster v. R., May 1993, unreported.) An appellate court should not attempt to guess what those conclusions might be in the absence of such findings. The failure by the trial judge to make any finding with respect to this issue was, in my opinion, a palpable and overriding error. I would therefore allow the appeal and order a new trial with respect to the eight charges which were based solely on the impugned statements. Pugsley, J.A. Concurred in: Matthews, J.A. Chipman, J.A.

(orally) [1] This is an appeal from a dismissal of an application to quash the decision of Arbitrator Ish interpreting an agreement entered into between the appellant and respondent. [2] The judgment centered on clause governing retroactivity of pay: NOTE ON RETROACTIVITY All employees on staff at September 3, 1999 shall be eligible for retroactive wage adjustments based on all paid hours with any employer. Employees who have retired from any employer during the term of the agreement shall be eligible for retroactive wage adjustments based on all paid hours up to and including the date of retirement. [Collective Agreement January 1, 1998 to March 31, 2001 at p. 67] The respondent suggested, and the arbitrator accepted, that the phrase “any employer” referred to the employer for whom the employee was working on September 3, 1999. On the other hand, the appellant had argued that the employee was entitled to retroactive pay from every employer for whom he had worked during the period. [3] The arbitrator found the phrase in question to be ambiguous and outlined the reasons why each of the competing interpretations might be chosen. He then concluded, in his ratio, as follows: As result of these competing aids to interpretation, do not find that the phrase “any employer”, in the context of this collective agreement, is an unambiguous one. am unable to resolve the ambiguity by reference to the evidence of negotiation history, which was minimal and, in my view, not persuasive. As result, am left in the position of an equal balance between the competing interpretations, which would lead me to the conclusion that the grievance fails because the burden is placed upon the union to convince the arbitrator on balance of probabilities that its interpretation is the correct one. Alternatively, the other provisions of the collective agreement would suggest that total provincialism was not intended by the parties, also lead one to the determination that the grievance fails because the balance has shifted in favour of the employer’s argument. On either view, have come to the conclusion that the union has not met the burden of proof placed upon it on the balance of probabilities test. Therefore, in conclusion, the grievance is dismissed. [Award of Arbitrator Dan Ish, Q.C., July 4, 2001 at p. 5] [4] We note that if the arbitrator was of the view, in the first portion of the paragraph, that analysis of one clause, using one tool, extrinsic evidence, and onus would have been sufficient ratio to support his conclusion he was in error and indeed patently unreasonable error. This is an incorrect proposition of law. [5] However, he then went on, in the alternative, to rely on the other provisions of the agreement; that is, he used one of the appropriate, and, indeed, first tools of statutory interpretation for an ambiguous phrase, that is to interpret it in the context of the entire agreement. [6] For this alternate ratio we agree with the conclusion of the chamber judge in the Court of Queen’s Bench. That is, this interpretation was a possible interpretation as evidenced by the earlier analysis of Arbitrator Ish. While it may not be the one that any of us would have chosen had we been given his choices at first instance, it is a possible interpretation on the analysis, legal and grammatical, of the entire agreement, and accordingly we cannot find that it is patently unreasonable. Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed with costs in the usual way on double Column V.",5_2004skca52.txt,"This was an appeal from a dismissal of an application to quash the decision the arbitrator interpreting an agreement entered into between the appellant and the respondent.

Palmer, 1979 CanLII (SCC), [1980] S.C.R. 759 should be applied in considering whether or not to receive evidence on an appeal of an order for permanent custody made pursuant to the Children and Family Service Act. The same rule should apply with respect to an appeal from an order refusing to terminate an order for permanent care and custody. The principles for the reception of fresh evidence were stated by McIntyre J. in R. v. Palmer at p. 775: A(1) The evidence should generally not be admitted if, by due diligence, it could have been adduced at trial provided that this general principle will not be applied as strictly in criminal case as in civil cases: see: McMartin v. The Queen. (2) The evidence must be relevant in the sense that it bears upon decisive or potentially decisive issue in the trial. (3) The evidence must be credible in the sense that it is reasonably capable of believe, and (4) It must be such that if believed it could reasonably, when taken with the other evidence adduced at trial, be expected to have affected the result."" In the S.M.S. case (para. 27) this court also decided that the procedure to be followed in dealing with an application to adduce fresh evidence should be as established in R. v. Nielsen and Stolar, 1988 CanLII 65 (SCC), [1988] S.C.R. 480: AThe fresh evidence rule has been stated many times and is summed up in R. v.

Considering the principles set forth in the S.M.S. case and, in particular, the criteria for the admission of evidence on appeal as enumerated in the Palmer decision we are of the opinion that the evidence should not be received. The various pieces of evidence sought to be admitted fit into one or more of three categories: (I) the evidence was either available at the trial and was not adduced; or (ii) is evidence that is repetitious of evidence given at the trial and is not new; or (iii) is evidence that, taken with the evidence adduced before Judge Daley, could not be expected to have affected the decision not to terminate the order for permanent care and custody of the appellant\'s son M..

March 23, 1994The Director of the Labour Standards Branch of the Department of Labour issued a certificate pursuant to s. 60 of The Labour Standards Act, R.S.S.
1978, c. L-1 (the ""Act""), stating that the City of Regina (the ""City"") owed its transit employee, Albert Morgan, $511.08 in wages.
At the hearing, the Director filed a March 8, 1994, letter reducing the assessment to $318.41 (including annual holiday pay).
The City brings this application to review the assessment.
By ss.
10(1) and 6(2) of the Act, an employer is required to pay an employee at the rate of time and one-half for every hour worked in excess of 32 hours in any week containing a public holiday (""holiday"").
The Director contends that from April, 1990, to January, 1994, there were five such weeks in which Morgan worked 40 hours but was not paid overtime for the eight excess hours.
The hours in question were worked on April 12 and November 17, 1990, July 6, 1991, and January 4 and December 31, 1992.
It is noted that none of these days is a holiday, but is the day in the week containing a holiday when Morgan worked the eight excess hours.","The plaintiff and defendant entered into an oral contract for the development and sale of land.

If the answer to No. above is yes, what is the appropriate amount? FINDING: There was an oral agreement for the payment of a fixed commission, there were definite terms, that the oral agreement was enforceable but in the alternative an award of unjust enrichment was made to compensate for work done. [1] This is an action by the Plaintiff, Ciaussen Walters and Associates Limited against David A. Murphy and Sonia Murphy for damages for breach of contract or in the alternative claim for unjust enrichment and/or quantum meruit. [2] At the end of the trial, the Plaintiff asked to withdraw his claim against the Defendant Sonia Murphy. Same was granted. As to costs which were sought by defence counsel, reserved upon that issue until later date. 1. Was there an oral agreement for payment of fixed commission between the parties? 2. If there was an oral agreement, what were the terms? 3. If there was an oral agreement, is such an agreement enforceable by the Plaintiff? 4. In the absence of an enforceable agreement between the parties, is the Plaintiff entitled to recover from the Defendants based upon quantum meruit or unjust enrichment? 5. If the answer to No. above is yes, what is the appropriate amount? [3] The Plaintiff carries on business as licensed real estate brokerage firm with an office in Lunenburg. Tony Walters is the President of the Company. He is licensed real estate broker. His company began to build marketing reputation of innovative ideas. [4] The Defendant is retired heart surgeon and resides with his wife, Sonia, at Halifax. [5] The Defendant began to reside at Kingsburg, Lunenburg County as seasonal resident in 1973. 0ver the years he acquired many parcels of land until he eventually owned approximately 100 acres in an area known as ""Hell Point"" or the ""Hell"". This land was close to the village of Kingsburg. The transactions were negotiated privately between Mr. Murphy and the various owners of the lots. Title to all parcels of land vested in Mr. Murphy. [6] The intention of David Murphy with respect to the lands he acquired was to develop retirement farm. For period of time the Defendants had substantial number of sheep on the land; however, by 1990 there was serious problem with coyotes. Up until that time David Murphy had fertilized, ploughed, mowed and grazed portions of the land and had fencing erected. [7] By 1995 the Defendants entered into discussions withNature Conservancy of Canada and the Province of Nova Scotia and explored the possibilities of donating the land. [8] During the course of dealings with the Province of Nova Scotia, appraisals were carried out by two appraisers, one of which was Hardy Appraisals who did subsequent appraisal for the Plaintiff after this action was started. [9] Mr. Murphy did not donate the land as desired because of possible tax implications. [10] 0n the recommendation of Peter McCurdy, who is neighbour and friend of Mr. Murphy, Mr. Murphy telephoned Mr. Walters on November 26, 1996 and indicated he was interested in selling the land in question. Mr. Walters was familiar with this land. [11] The first meeting between Tony Walters and Mr. Murphy took place on December 2, 1996. Mr. Walters says this meeting took place at the Murphy home at Kingsburg whereas Mr. Murphy said this meeting took place at Mr. Walters' office at Lunenburg. Mr. Walters said when he met with them at Kingsburg, Mr. Murphy's daughter Deirdre was present for part of the meeting. Deirdre and Mr. Murphy say this was not possible as December is Deirdre's birthday which was celebrated at her parents home at Halifax. Also in her evidence, Deirdre said she first met Mr. Walters at her parents home in April 1997. She also told the Court on that day she was in the Court of Appeal. [12] There is another problem as Mr. Walters says he made an arrangement for Mr. Murphy to see David MacDonald. All seem to agree that meeting was at PM well after the 11 AM meeting between he and Mr. Murphy. The office of Mr. MacDonald was nearby. [13] Having heard the evidence, am satisfied someone is honestly in error. find the meeting of December 2, 1996 took place in Lunenburg at the office of Mr. Walters. [14] At that meeting Mr. Murphy brought with him aerial photographs, deeds and old documents. Mr. Murphy discussed selling it as single lot whereas the suggestion of Mr. Walters was to develop it. Development of the land caused Mr. Murphy real problems as he wanted to keep the land in tact and certainly did not want any development as he had seen in other areas. It was at this meeting Mr. Murphy said he was busy, that he was not developer, nor did he have the expertise, to which Mr. Walters replied he could do the development for him. Mr. Walters told him they would need surveyor to see what could be done as any proposed sub‑division had to pass the Planning Board. Two surveyors were discussed with Mr. Murphy deciding that Mr. Becker would do the survey work. [15] At this meeting commission fees were discussed. Mr. Walters told Mr. Murphy if there was direct or bulk sale his commission was 6% but if he got involved in the sub‑division his fee would be 10% of the total sales when the sales took place. Mr. Murphy disputes that this conversation took place. [16] At the December 2, 1996 meeting there was discussion about needing lawyer to help with the legal issues of the project. Mr. Walters suggested Mr. Murphy should go and see David MacDonald as he had done lot of work for him and he did good work. Mr. Murphy did go to see Mr. MacDonald later that afternoon. [17] Discussion also included the need for Mr. Murphy to talk to his accountant re the HST and any income tax implications. [18] 0n December 9, 1996 Mr. Murphy, Mr. Walters and Mr. Becker met at the office of the Plaintiff at Lunenburg. The purpose of this meeting was to acquaint the surveyor with the proposed sub‑division and see if it would meet planning approval. Mr. Becker was of the opinion it could be done but they would have to go through some hoops to get there. [19] Very little was done through the winter of 1996 with the exception of Mr. Walters walking the land. [20] Mr. Murphy and Mr. Walters met on the property in April 1997. At this meeting, Mr. Murphy queried Mr. Walters about the cost to which Mr. Walters replied his cost was 10%. Mr. Murphy said Mr. Walters told him for the 10% he could help get bids, help to get the road in, lay out the lines and work with the surveyor. Mr. Murphy said he told Mr. Walters it sounds good but wanted to talk to his family. Mr. Murphy testified he thought the commission was bit pricy. He also testified at that time he hadn't clue about value but he did have ball park figure in mind. During these or prior discussions, Mr. Walters told Mr. Murphy to shop around with other real estate brokers to see if they would do it for less. [21] After this meeting on the property, Mr. Walters and Mr. Murphy met at Mr. Murphy's house where much of what was said on the hill was repeated by Mr. Walters. Both Deirdre and her husband, Robert, were at the Murphy home. Deirdre was present for part of the meeting. She was not present when the commission was discussed. There was discussion as to how Mr. Walters would market the land and that it would be sold in large lots with proper set backs. There was also discussion about the value of Mr. Walters company in selling this property. Mr. Murphy testified it was an amicable meeting. He noted his wife had queried Mr. Walters about the 10% to which Mr. Walters replied rather abruptly 10% is my commission. Mr. Murphy told the Court he did not object to the 10% at that meeting nor did he query it. At this time Mr. Murphy told the Court it was up to him after the meeting to get in touch with Mr. Walters. Mr. Murphy did call Mr. Walters within the week at which time he told him they were going ahead. Once Mr. Murphy told Mr. Walters they were going ahead, Mr. Walters said ""I'll call Mr. Becker and we will go out and lay out the lots."" [22] new road had to be constructed. Getting bids for the road was left to Mr. Walters. After obtaining bids, Mr. Mailman's quote was recommended by Mr. Walters to Mr. Murphy. Exhibit Tab sets out the tender and its acceptance by Mr. Murphy. It reads as follows: “BERNARD L. MAILMAN PR0JECTS LTD. R.R.2, BRIDGEWATER, N.S. B4V 2W1 (902) 543‑3936 Walters P.0. Box 428 Lunenburg B0J 2C0 ATT: Tony Walters RE: Dr. Murphy Job Quote for road as discussed $14,946.44 HST 2,241.97 $17,188.41 We have priced job for 6‑12"" culverts.

Add gravel as necessary to make repairs to present road D.A. Murphy"" [23] 0verseeing of the road construction was left under the direction of Mr. Walters. When it was completed, everyone was happy with its construction, including Deirdre and her husband. [24] Mr. Walters went upon the land and with flagging tape laid out the lots and tied them into the new road. With the assistance of Mr. Murphy, set backs were also developed for each lot. With the assistance of Mr. Becker, Exhibit Number Tab 32 was developed as preliminary plan. This plan resulted from the work of Mr. Walters and to some extent that of Mr. Murphy. This plan was prepared showing the position of the new road tying in the lots. It is to be noted Mr. Becker testified ""where the lots were laid out took my instructions from Mr. Walters"". It is to be noted how closely Exhibit Number Tab 32 comes to the final approval of the plan as contained in Exhibit Number Tab 36 or appears in Exhibit Number 4. [25] As to the strategy regarding boundaries, Paragraph of Exhibit Number Tab 7, which is contained in letter from Mr. Murphy to Mr. Walters, the following appears: ""A few questions as to lot strategy regarding boundaries leave this up to your wisdom. Bob has the questions."" [26] In August 1997 Mr. Murphy went to his neighbours to alert them he was selling his property and there would be some noise and dirt. He went to the home of Dwoone Massie, wife of Mr. Dexter, counsel for the Plaintiff and told her about selling his property. She testified as follows: ""He said Tony would be supervising construction of the road and he said Tony will be selling the properties. He said he hired Tony. told him didn't know Tony would do that. He told me if there was problem with anything, should phone Tony not the Murphys."" [27] In his evidence, Mr. Murphy told the Court this conversation in part resulted from telephone call from Mr. Dexter complaining about the noise. [28] Up to the 5th of November, 1997, the parties worked amicably together. Everything seemed to be going well. 0n November 5, 1997 Mr. Walters took David MacDonald, his wife, Barbara Claussen to the home of Mr. Murphy. Together they all went to the lot at ""Hell Point"". There was conversation with Mr. MacDonald by Mr. Walters and Mr. Murphy about covenants that would appear in any deeds for property sold. It was left with Mr. MacDonald to review set of covenants supplied or to be sent by Mr. Murphy and to draft suggestions. Mr. Murphy said at this meeting he was becoming uneasy with the presence of Barbara Claussen, another real estate agent and Mr. MacDonald. He told the Court he was also concerned he had not received any agreement in writing from Mr. Walters and about the settlement of the commission. [29] Mr. Walters testified from his point of view his work was completed on constructing the road and laying out the lots for Mr. Becker to survey and present to the Planning Board unless Mr. Becker came back and said they couldn't do as configured. accept this evidence of Mr. Walters that his work in this area was completed save problems Mr. Becker may need resolved. [30] Shortly after this meeting of November 5, 1997, Mr. Murphy phoned Mr. Walters to advise him there was to be meeting in Halifax at the office of his daughter, Deirdre on November 13, 1997. He told Mr. Walters the purpose of the meeting was to generate some comment about contract for the sale of the land. Present at that meeting were Mr. Walters, Deirdre and her husband, Robert. Mr. Murphy was not present. Mr. Murphy's absence at such critical time gives the Court some real cause of concern particularly where he was so closely connected to the transaction and had dealt with Mr. Walters almost exclusively on all issues. really didn't accept his excuse of being busy. got the reading the meeting was planned to be that way as where he set up the meeting with Mr. Walters he could have picked non‑scheduled day to permit his presence. [31] All agree the meeting was professional, appropriate and cordial until near the end when the 10% was discussed and what costs was to be included in this amount. Mr. Walters told them he had certain responsibilities and that at that time they were all done. He told them they were only that far from going to the market and depended upon Mr. Becker getting approval. At this time no one told Mr. Walters the approval could not be obtained or that there was problem. [32] On November 13th, Deirdre Murphy told Mr. Walters she had no intention of re‑negotiating the 10% but it was concern upon which Mr. Walters replied he had deal with her dad for 10% and that was his commission. Deirdre told him he should not take position of 10% or there may be no need of going further. She conveyed to Mr. Walters if he didn't back off the 10% it might be no need to go further. The question was raised as to whether he would get the listing. Dierdre Murphy said there was no discussion of any break‑down of the 10%. There does appear at Exhibit Number Tab 15 Page 35 which are Robert's notes which reads as follows: ""Rational basis for 10%. 6% for nothing but MLS and no other input."" [33] At the time of the November 13, 1997 meeting Deirdre knew the road had been completed but was not familiar with any of the other work Mr. Walters had completed. [34] As an outcome of this meeting, Mr. Walters was to prepare and forward to them an overview of the marketing services provided by the Plaintiff Company. This Mr. Walters did by letter to Mr. David Murphy dated November 17, 1997 found at Exhibit Number Tab 16. Three paragraphs of that letter are important. They are found at page 41 and 45 respectively and appears as follows: ""The issue of AA Walters' commission came up in the discussions with Deirdre and Robert. 0ur agreement was 10% commission, inclusive of the project management, with the provision that if at any time you were not satisfied with our firm you could notify me and if we could not remedy the situation to your satisfaction then we would withdraw from the project. 0ur time and fees are purely on contingency basis. If you are satisfied with our work, wonder why we are asked to negotiate the commission again after so much of the project has been completed and the properties are essentially ready to market. The commission not only compensates us for our know‑ledge and expertise but, importantly, allows us to provide high level of marketing services. As you and your family discuss the value of our recommendations and services please consider the following discussion and the import­ance, in your opinion, of the role of AA Walters Limited in creation of value and the future marketing of the Hell Point properties. Listing Agreement AA Walters Limited commission is 10%, inclusive of the project management. The commission is subject to HST. All cooperating brokers are compensated from this commission."" [35] On November 24, 1997 Mr. Murphy wrote Mr. Walters stating: ""Dear Tony want to thank you for taking the time to meet with Deirdre and Robert the other day. They enjoyed meeting with you and went away with better under‑standing of your perspective on this project. This is just note to say that we received your delivered docu­ment concerning your proposed marketing plan for Hells Point. It was much appreciated and well con­sidered. We are still in the process of mulling over the options and we will let you know as soon as possible. We look forward to talking to you then."" [36] By letter dated November 24, 1997 Mr. Murphy wrote the following letter to Fran Shea, another real estate broker: ""Dear Ms. Shea, As you probably know, we are planning to sell portions of our property on Hells Point in Lower Kingsburg. new road has been installed and the survey work is almost complete. As yet we have made no formal contractual commitments to list our real estate. We would appreciate your opinion as to how your firm might market this land and what sort of contractual arrangements including sales commission, terms of listing agreement, and marketing plan you might propose. As courtesy, we would kindly ask that our request be kept in confidence until such time as the matter is formalized. Thank you for looking at our proposal and we look forward to hearing from you."" [37] It is to be noted Fran Shea previously had been real estate agent for AA Walters, the Plaintiff former Company. The word confidence was underlined when she received it. Mr. Murphy told the Court he had written to Fran Shea as Mr. Walters had previously suggested he do if not satisfied with Mr. Walters. In his evidence, he told the Court he did not want Mr. Walters to know he had written to Ms. Shea. He said at this time he wanted Mr. Walters to come down on the 10%. He felt it was negotiable. He also said the first time Mr. Walters knew it was problem was when he met with his daughter and husband in Halifax. [38] In response to Mr. Murphy, Fran Shea wrote Mr. Murphy on November 27, 1997. It appears as follows: ""Dear David, Thank you for your letter of November 24, 1997. am pleased to inform you that Tradewinds will be operating from our Lunenburg office as of December 5th. As you know am very familiar with the land in Lower Kingsburg area and have been involved with almost all of the twenty plus transactions that have taken place there in the last four or five years. This year my listings on the Beach Hill have sold and have sold the Lorraine Mossman house on the beach. When Jon Allen and joined Tradewinds all of our Kingsburg vendors kept their properties listed with us. Re: The marketing of the lots on Hells Point. would be more than pleased to meet with you at your convenience and discuss marketing plan (I've been thinking about it for the last year). There is too much information to cover in letter and of course there is material that you should see‑‑our catalogue, new listing brochures, internet site, ad placements, etc. The commission structure is also negotiable. As there are several lots to be sold, Tradewinds would be prepared to charge only six percent commission, with side agreement at reduced rate for any clients that you personally introduce to the property. This is also open for discussion. may be reached at the Lunenburg office after the 5th of December. 0f course you are welcome to call my cell (902‑527‑6643) or my home (902‑688‑3172) at any time. look forward to hearing from you."" [39] On January 8, 1998 Ms. Shea wrote to Mr. Murphy by e‑mail. Both her letter and Mr. Murphy's reply appear as Exhibit Number 5. They are as follows: ""Dear David, Thought that would touch base and inquire whether you have made decision re: the marketing of your land on Hells Point. My office number is 902‑634‑1250. Fran Shea Tradewinds Realty Inc Chester, Nova Scotia Home 902‑688‑3172 Fax 902‑275‑2215 Thanks for the follow up no we haven't made decision on the marketing of the point yet although we were very favorably impressed with the tentative figures you men­tioned in the letter. What is the hold up is the step wise red tape involved in converting so many little and big pieces of land with seven deeds into something that is acceptable to planning and also the bottom line health. Bob Becker and are making pretty good progress and should have some hint of finality by late February. We will certainly be in touch. was in Toronto yesterday talking to Dr. Chris Feindel and your name came up..it sounds like he also will be giving you call. Yours sincerely David murphy... Love this e‑mail‑‑I don't need to worry about capitals and punctuation."" [40] 0n December 3, 1997 Mr. Walters wrote to David Murphy. This letter appears at Exhibit Number Tab 23: ""Dear Dave: Our catalogue was sent to the printers while we were still of the understanding that AA Walters was the listing broker for your Hell Point properties, therefore, the lands have been included. How should we respond to inquiries? Advertising, production of brochures, placement in the Who's Who web site etc. are on hold until we hear from you. assume this is your wish. Please let me know how you want to proceed. If you are in Kingsburg this weekend please stop by our open air Nikolaus Celebration in Lunenburg. AA Walters is sponsoring the event for local children and in support of Christmas Daddies. It's for children of all ages! With kindest regards, Tony Walters."" [41] 0n December 11, 1997 Mr. Walters wrote to Mr. Murphy. It appears as Court Exhibit Number Tab 24. It reads as follows: ""11 December 1997 Dear Dave and Sonia: There have been number of distressing events over the past several weeks, some of which referred to in previous correspondence. 0n 13 November met with Deirdre and Robert at which time they both advanced the position that AA Walters commission of 10% was the subject of further negotiation and that even our role as exclusive listing broker was in question. was quite surprised because Deirdre was present at our first meeting at your house in Kingsburg at which time we all discussed the 10% commission which would be inclusive of project management and payable upon the sale of the lots. 0n that day no decision was made about AA Walters Limited managing the development and the sale of your property. Sonia was not there and you said that you would have family meeting and then let me know your decision. Some time later received telephone call from you confirming that the family had decided to proceed and AA Walters was hired. The 10% commission was confirmed by you at that time. We proceeded in good faith. 0ur agreement was as follows: AA Walters Limited and Tony Walters would be responsible for management and development, and the exclusive listing and sale of your lands at Hell's Point. We agreed that AA Walters Limited would be compensated for its service both in the develop­ment of the lands in question and the sale of the lots on the basis of commission of 10% of the selling price of the lots payable upon the completion of each sale. We further agreed that if at any time you were not satisfied with our work you could notify me and if we could not remedy the situation then AA Walters would withdraw from the project. 0ur agreement was straightforward and clear. At no time subsequent to that did have any indication that you were not satisfied with our work. In fact, on numerous occasions when we were on the property together and on the telephone you expressed your delight with the way things were proceeding. Deirdre said to me during one of our meetings in Kingsburg that she and Robert had walked the new road and how pleased every‑one was with its design and construction and the overall development concept. Never, never was there single complaint. So, perhaps you can understand my surprise when the subject of our commission, and even our firm's continued involvement with the project, came up at my meeting with Robert and Deirdre. became more concerned when received your fax dated 24 November in which you said: ""We are still in the process of mulling over the options and we will let you know as soon as possible."" Then after my ‑3 December letter to you, received your telephone call stating the subdivision of the lots had encountered difficulty and everything was on hold. Given the statements made by Deirdre, as your daughter, and Robert acting on our behalf and speaking for you as your solicitor, and your statements to me, can only conclude that you are telling me that you do not intend to be bound by the terms of our agreement. Please provide me with written confirmation of your intentions within seven days. If you do intend to abide by the terms of our agreement please forward to me all documentation with respect to the subdivision application and the problems which you referred to in our telephone conversation and will meet with Robert Becker and the planning office to see how the issues can be resolved. With kindest regards, Tony Walters"" [42] Mr. Murphy was very concerned Mr. Walters had put time stipulation on this matter. No request was ever made by Mr. Murphy to Mr. Walters to assist in the solving of any problems concerning the sub‑division as Mr. Walters had noted in the last paragraph of this letter. [43] On December 19, 1997 Mr. Murphy wrote to Mr. Walters. It appears in Exhibit Number Tab 25: ""Dear Tony: RE: Hell's Point Property, Nova Scotia Thank you for your letter dated December 11, 1997 which received on Monday. As courtesy am responding within your stated time limit of one week. am sorry if caused you any distress in our negotiations. am also sorry if you believe that have mislead you into thinking, mistakenly, that we had agreed that you would be the exclusive developer and agent for our property. You must realize that am not business man and that depend on the advice of numerous professional advisors such as accountants and lawyers, prior to making significant commitments such as the sale our property at Hells Point. In our discussions you said that you were more comfortable with verbal agreement but that on occasion you would proceed with written agreement. expressed that wanted to arrange ""meeting of the minds"" on paper, such that numerous key terms could be negotiated and committed to on paper. wanted input from lawyers, accountants, and other agents prior to signing the proposed written agreement. In gathering information from these profess­ional sources, learned that there were numerous fundamental terms and issues which we had not even discussed. That is when arranged for you to meet with Robert Kapanen and my daughter, Deirdre, and that why's am seeking input from various other professionals including those who deal with real estate sales. Your letter imposes deadline of one week for me to respond to your proposal of 10% commission on sales. This rate has always been matter for discussion, and had wanted to clarify other terms prior to committing to written agreement. At the present time the sale of the lands is on hold until we complete our deliberations and obtain more information, at which time we would like to continue talking with you if you so wish. Yours very truly, David Murphy"" [44] Both Mr. Murphy and Mr. Becker did meet with the Planning Authority. In order to reach approval, it was necessary to re‑configure the lots in three different phases but as Mr. Becker said when approval came the plan as shown in Exhibit Number Tab 32, resulting from the work of Mr. Walters, was strikingly similar to Exhibit Number the final plan approved by the Planning Board. [45] After the sub‑division was approved, the property was listed for sale with Mr. Ducicworth. Four of the lots have been sold for total of $875,000.00. There are three lots yet to be sold set at prices of $300,000.00, $350,000.00 and $500,000.00 respectively. [46] Before the land was sub‑divided, Ms. Girvan, another realtor, had hinted the property was worth $850,000.00 in bulk sale. [47] With the letter of December 19, 1997, all contact between Mr. Murphy and Mr. Walters re Hell Point came to an end. [48] Was there an oral agreement for payment of fixed commission between the parties? find there was. find there was an oral agreement between the Plaintiff and the Defendant for the payment of fixed commission of 10%. find at the first meeting on December 2, 1996 the parties discussed the sale of the property as bulk sale for which commission of 6% was to be charged. find they discussed the sub‑division of Hell Point and what Mr. Walters' duties would be. If he were to lay out the sub‑division and prepare it for Mr. Becker to get planning approval and sell the property, he was to be paid 10%. find Mr. Walters was not to lay out and prepare this sub‑division in anticipation of getting the property to sell. At that time, both parties knew what Mr. Walters' role was going to be and the difference between the 6% for sale of bulk land and the 10% was to cover the development work by Mr. Walters to lay it out for sub‑division approval with the thought always in mind of keeping that property as prestigious and undisturbed area. To lay this area out to comply with the desire of Mr. Murphy and to meet Planning Board approval was no small matter and required someone with appropriate expertise and concern for the eventual development. 1) find the terms of this agreement were discussed between Mr. Walters and Mr. Murphy on December 2nd, 1996 at Mr. Walters' office at Lunenburg on December 9th, 1996, at the same office with Mr. Murphy, Mr. Walters and Mr. Becker present; out on ""Hell Point"" between Mr. Walters and Mr. Murphy in April, 1997 and at the home of Mr. Murphy in April, 1997. [49] At that meeting in April, 1997, the 10% and the work Mr. Walters was to perform were all on the table. Mrs.. Murphy raised the amount of 10% and Mr. Walters responded. Mr. Murphy did not comment at this time about the amount of commission. That meeting was an amicable one. The meeting ended with Mr. Murphy wanting to discuss it further with the family after which he was to get back to Mr. Walters. Later that week, Mr. Murphy called Mr. Walters and told him they were going ahead. In my notes, the following comment appears ""once told him we were going ahead, he said I'll call Becker and we will go out and lay out lots"". [50] At that point, the oral contract was consummated and the work that eventually led to sub‑division approval was commenced. fmd the parties worked closely and amicably together. This continued right up to November 5, 1997. [51] Up to November 5, 1997 Mr. Murphy and his family were pleased with the road and the work Mr. Walters had done. [52] further find Mr. Murphy breached the oral agreement by his letter of December 19, 1997 and by his actions both before and after that date. [53] If there was an oral agreement, what were its terms? find the following were its terms. (a) to develop concept and strategy for the develop- ment, sub‑division and marketing of the land at ""Hell Point"". (b) to manage and be responsible for the laying out of the sub‑division of the land to bring it within the approval of the Planning Board. (c) to manage and be responsible for the laying out and construction of road running over the land to accommodate the lots in the sub‑division. (d) to meet with the Defendant, his surveyor, accountants and solicitor. (e) to market the land for sale on an exclusive basis. (f) for this work the Plaintiff was to be paid commiss­ion of 10% which work included the preparatory work to allow the surveyor to present it to the Planning Board for approval and the actual sale of the property. Mr. Walters was to be paid upon sale of the land. [55] If there was an oral agreement is such an agreement enforceable by the Plaintiff? [56] In this case, find the Real Estate Brokers Licensing Act has no application because the agreement was made in April, 1997 after this Act was repealed on January 21, 1997. [57] find the Real Estate Trading Act, Chapter 28, 1999 R.S.N.S. applies to this agreement. Section 31 of the Real Estate Trading Act reads: Requirements respecting agreements 31(1) Every agreement entered into by licensed person for the purchase or sale of real estate shall (a) contain an expiry date; and (b) be executed by all parties to the agreement, and the licensed person shall, upon execution, provide true copy of the agreement to each party to the agreement. (2) An agreement is not invalid by reason only that it does not comply with subsection (1) but, where licensed person, acting in bad faith, does not comply, the licensed person may not recover any commission under the agreement with respect to the trade. [58] Section 31(2) provides an agreement is not invalid by reason it does not comply with s. 31(1). It goes on to say ""but, where licensed person, acting in bad faith does not comply, the licensed person may not recover any commission under the agreement with respect to the trade"". In the converse it is saying if you have an agreement such as here the licensed agent may recover the commission under the agreement, if that person is acting in good faith. find Mr. Walters was licensed agent, was acting in completely good faith and he is entitled to his commission. [59] The next question is does this agreement fall within the terms of the Statute of Frauds, Chapter 442 R.S.N.S. Section reads: 7(a) No action shall be brought (e) upon any agreement that is not to be performed within the space of one year from the making thereof, unless the promise, agreement or contract upon which the action is brought, or some memorandum or note thereof, is in writing, signed by the person sought to be charged therewith or by some other person thereunto by him lawfully authorized. R.S., c. 290,s.6."" [60] As to the duration of the agreement, the evidence sets forth Mr. Walters said: ""I looked at it as long term project. said we shouldn't push it. There was time frame of years. said you need to talk to your accountant. 0ne was sales tax and also his personal tax. told him lets do good job"". Mr. Murphy seemed to go along with these comments. [61] As to agreements that falls within and without the Statute of Frauds supra Fridman on The Law of Contract 3rd edition at page 214 say: (iii) Contracts not to be performed within year This is strange category. It might be thought that contracts which bound one person to guarantee another's debt and contracts relating to land were clear instances of the need to establish liability by some form of writing. To extend the Statute to all contracts, whatever their subject‑matter, if they involve longer period than year for their completion, seems an unnecessary extravagance. Perhaps the situation at common law, long since changed, by which the parties to contract (although potentially the best witnesses) were excluded from giving testimony, may explain this inclusion within the Statute of Frauds. Furthermore, the chances of false or perjured evidence, or merely mistaken evidence, when the contract had been made some years before the litigation to which it gave rise, were high (although if the contract were within the Statute it did not matter that the action arose the day after the contract was made, and, if such thing were possible, the case was heard the very next day, that is, while recollection was still fresh and clear). It suffices to say that, perhaps because of the strangeness of the statutory provision, and the dislike of the courts of the technical defence of the statute succeeding where it lacked merit, the decisions reveal peculiar inter­pretation of the phrase ""not be be performed within year"". To begin with there are clear instances where con‑tract is for more, or, as the case may be, less than year. Thus the contract, from its terms may be incapable of being performed by either party within the year from its making. This is exempli­fied by the old English case of Boydell v. Drummond, which concerned subscription to forthcoming edition of Shakespeare that would have taken longer than 12 months to appear. Or the contract cannot be performed by one of the parties within the year and it does not manifest any intention that the other party should fully perform his side of the bargain within the year. Thus contract for two‑year period under which one party agrees to take orders for, and sell to customers the maximum volume possible of the other party's product was within the Statute. So was contract under which the plaintiff was to pursue training as nurse in the defendant's hospital for two years. So, too, was contract of employment under which the employee's salary was to rise from $700 per annum to $1,000 per annum by annual increases. Another example is provided by contract for perpetual term under which one party was to pay the other $10,000 per year for ten years. 0n the other hand the contract may be intended to be performed and may actually be performed by one party within the year. Thus in Spencer v. Spencer, in which there was promise to convey land in return for promise to support for life, it was held that the contract was one to be performed with‑in the year, as the conveyance would clearly occur within the requisite period; so, too, where the contract is one of service for one year commencing the day after that on which the contract is made. In contradistinction, however, are cases where it is not clear whether the contract is to be performed within or beyond the statutory period. If the contract is for an indefinite period which (according to circumstances that may or may not occur) may or may not be coterminous with the statutory year, then the contract is not within the Statute of Frauds. 0n the other hand, if the contract is so worded as to show distinctly that the parties contemplated the duration of the contract for definite period of more than one year, although it contains an express or implied term by which it may be terminated within the year, then the contract is within the Statute. As Lord Alverstone said in the leading case of Hanau v. Ehrlich, which has been approved and followed in Canada. ...if there is no mention of time, and the time is uncertain, the agreement is not within the Statute... if the time mentioned is more than one year, but there is power to determine, the agreement is within the Statute. In the words of Kerwin J. of the Supreme Court of Canada, the Statute does not apply if it is possible that the provisions can be performed or are not incapable of being performed within year. Thus, where there was contract of employment to last the life of the employee, though the employee could terminate at any time if not satisfied with the salary or bonuses, it was held that the contract, was not within the Statute because it might be wholly performed within year, since the employee might terminate it, or might die (a lugubrious thought which was instrumental in another case involving contract for the support of child who, it was said, might not live for more than one year). As Mackay J.A. said, ... {t}he statute has no reference to cases in which the whole contract may be performed within one year, but there is no definite provision as to its duration, even though it may appear as fact that the performance has extended beyond that time;...where the contract is such that the whole may possibly be performed within year and there is no express stipulation to the contrary, the statute does not apply.. So, too, an agreement to pay stated price for milk from herd of Guernsey cows, in consideration of the owner of the herd taking stock in dairy company, was not within the Statute, despite the vagueness of the period, since the owner might sell the herd within the year, have no milk to deliver, or could die before the year was out. Where one contracting party obliged himself not to do certain thing, no time limit being mentioned, and where one party made promise to many, without mentioning when the marriage was to take place, the Canadian court accepted the principles laid down in Hanau v. Ehrlich, which involved an employ­ment contract for two years that could have been terminated at any time. Similarly, in Boutilier v. Everett, contract of loan was an agreement capable of being performed within year from its making because the borrower was at liberty to pay off the loan at any time; therefore, he could have paid it within year. The Statute did not apply. It would seem, therefore, that, in the absence of some definite stipulation as to time, which undoubtedly decides the issue, and leaves no room for judicial manoeuvres, there is considerable scope for interpretation of contractual terms as to duration or the time of performance, in such way as to provide maximum flexibility and allow the courts to prevent the abuse of the Statute."" [62] In Boutilier v. Everett, 1979 40 N.S.R. 2nd 527 (N.S.T.D.) C.J. Cowan said this: ""At the commencement of the hearing, the defendant applied for leave to amend the statement of defence, by pleading that the transactions with regard to the three amounts in question came within the terms of s. 6(e) of the Statute of Frauds, R.S.N.S. 1967 c. 290, which provides as follows: No action shall be brought: (e) upon any agreement that it is not to be per‑formed within the space of one year from the making thereof; unless the promise, agreement, or contract upon which the action is brought or some memorandum or note thereof is in writing signed by the person sought to be charged there‑with or by some other person thereunto by him lawfully authorized. Counsel for the plaintiff objected that the application was made too late and that such an application should not be granted at the present time. am of the opinion that the amendment should not be permitted at this late date, but also express the opinion that, even if it were pleaded, the agreements in question were not such as come within the provisions of the statute. As understand the arrangement, it was that loans of cash were made by the plaintiff to the defendant and the defendant agreed to make certain payments. The initial arrangement was that he would pay $300.00 per month and the additional advances were merely added on to the amount originally advanced. The authorities indicate that the statute does not render unenforceable agreements which are capable of being performed within the space of one year from the making. In this case, it appears to me that the agreement between the plaintiff and the defendant was one that was capable of being performed within the year. The defendant was at liberty to pay off the loans at any time. also find that if, as happened, the defendant did not make the monthly payments which he promised to make, the plaintiff was entitled to require payment of the full amount of the advances, less payments on account of principal to date. The loan can, therefore, be called in before one year in the case of default and there was default within the year. therefore find that the section of the Statute of Frauds referred to does not apply in the present case and that, if the amendment were allowed, it would not render unenforceable the agreements in question. [63] In this agreement, it was contemplated for tax reasons suggested by Mr. Walters this agreement could go as long as 5 years but there was nothing preventing it being performed completely within one year. The contract came into being in April, 1997. By November 5, 1997 the road was in and all of Mr. Walters' work was performed save what Mr. Murray and Mr. Becker needed. It remained for Mr. Becker to obtain sub‑division approval which even though took some time could have been done sooner if preference had been given to the project. It is noted the lots already sold had sold very quickly with little or not advertisement. It is noted by Mr. Walters' letter of December 3, 1997 he had already included the advertisement of the land in his catalogue. [64] It is also noted in Mr. Murphy's letter of January 8, 1998 to Ms. Shea he stated they should have some hint of finality by late February. The only reason this agreement could have taken over the year was really for tax purposes which did not seem to overly concern Mr. Murphy at this time. [65] find this oral agreement did not offend the Statutes of Frauds as it was capable of being performed in one year. [66] I therefore find the oral agreement entered into between the Plaintiff and the Defendant was not only valid but enforceable insofar as the commission for 4% of the lands sold by Mr. Duckworth. The 4% represented the development work done by Mr. Walters. [67] Four lots have been sold for total of $875,000.00. The Plaintiff is awarded 4% of $875.000.00 for a sum of $35,000.00. [68] ISSUE #4 Should I have erred in my fmding in the alternative, the Plaintiff is entitled to an award either in a claim for unjust enrichment and/or quantum meruit. [69] In Sorochan v. Sorochan (1986) 29 D.L.R. (4th) the Supreme Court of Canada articulated the three requirements which must be satisfied in order to found an action for unjust enrichment: (1) an enrichment (2) corresponding deprivation and (3) the absence of any juristic reason for the enrichment [70] The Defence concedes the services provided to Mr. Murphy by the Plaintiff were of benefit to him. It is also noted the services done by the Plaintiff were satisfactory to Mr. Murphy. [71] find there was an enrichment to the Plaintiff and corresponding deprivation to the Defendant. The Defendant as agreed obtained benefit from the services of the Plaintiff while the Plaintiff lost all of his effort to build the road and lay out the lots to comply with the Planning Board and yet keep their presence as desired by Mr. Murphy. [72] As to the third condition in Campbell et al vs. Campbell, Borins J.A. for the 0ntario Court of Appeal set forth what was required to satisfy such requirement. At Page 794 he stated: ""Thus, what is at the heart of the third requirement is the reasonable expectation of the parties, and whether it would be just and fair to the parties considering all of the relevant circumstances, to permit the recipient of the benefit to retain it without compensation to those who provided it."" [73] The benefit conferred by the Plaintiff to the Defendant falls within the third requirement. The Plaintiffs services were both requested and encouraged by the Defendant. It would be unfair and unjust to permit the Defendant to retain this benefit without compensation to the Plaintiff. Issue #5 The only question is the quantum of damages. The Defendant is of the opinion this award should not be great. The Plaintiff counsel argues that the Plaintiff is entitled to the 4% agreed to in the oral contract. [75] The Plaintiffs services not only benefited the Defendant for the land already sold but the three lots still unsold on which the Defendant has set price of $1,500,000.00. He may not obtain that price but it does give value the Defendant believes is the worth of the remaining land. These values are in line with the land already sold. [76] The services of the Plaintiff greatly enriched the value of the Defendant's property. Here the task of Mr. Walters was not only to lay out this land to get sub‑division approval, but to keep the property prestigious and as an undisturbed area. As said earlier, to lay this area out to comply with the desire of Mr. Murphy and to meet Planning Board approval was no small matter and required someone with appropriate expertise and concern for the eventual development. You cannot just count hours. You also have to consider the expertise of Mr. Walters. [77] This expertise was sought after when Mr. Murphy first approached Mr. Walters. Mr. Walters did his work and never was there any complaint except over the question of the commission and that did not come from Mr. Murphy personally to Mr. Walters before November 13, 1997. All the Plaintiffs work has been completed on the development. It is not usual to set a commission fee in an unjust enrichment case but here the 4% was an amount both parties agreed for the development work. In my opinion, it is better to place figure based on what the parties thought the work was worth rather than place figure at random when the Court has no real amount upon which to set value. It is hard to quantify Mr. Walters' expertise in this area considering the work he had to do of taking all the lots and configuring them to meet Planning Board approval. [78] All of the land has not been sold but the Plaintiff's services have enriched same as well as it enriched the land already sold. [79] When one considers the Defendant purchased this land for somewhat over $200,000.00 for which he has already received $875,000.00 with three valuable lots remaining, it can be seen the Plaintiff's work greatly enriched its value. [80] When consider under the contract the Plaintiff is entitled to 4% of the land already sold and the fact there are remaining three lots which the Defendant considers are worth over one million dollars, am of the opinion to award less than the $35,000.00 for unjust enrichment would be inappropriate and unjust. [81] On the claim for unjust enrichment, set the amount at $35,000.00. [82] set the rate for pre judgment interest at 4.4% per annum. [83] Any determination on costs will be reserved as indicated would hear the parties at later date re the dismissal of the claim against Mrs. Murphy. encourage the parties to settle the issue of costs, otherwise ask they each submit short briefs after which will make determination. DATED this 9th day of March, 2001.",6_2001nssc105.txt,"The plaintiff and defendant entered into an oral contract for the development and sale of land.
The plaintiff brought an action to recover its commission on the contract.
Plaintiff awarded commission of 4% as agreed to by the terms of the oral contract; in the alternative, the plaintiff is entitled to an award for unjust enrichment to compensate for the work done.
Although the agreement could have went on longer, there was nothing preventing it from being performed completely within one year and thus the oral agreement was not only valid, but also enforceable.
An award for unjust enrichment would be calculated using the commission rate agreed to by the parties."

Counsel: Lori L. Gollan for the Appellant Tiffany M.

(Orally) [1] We do not need to hear from you, Ms. Paulsen. [2] We are all of the opinion that this expedited family law appeal must be dismissed. [3] The appellant Nicole Clavelle appeals from an order of Ryan-Froslie J. which directed that Danelle, the daughter of the parties, shall attend kindergarten in Saskatoon during the seven week period before the trial fixed for February 21, 2005. For convenience we reproduce the following passages from her written reasons: pre-trial management conference is set for October 5, 2004, after which trial date will be set. It is likely that the trial will proceed in December, 2004 or January, 2005. It must be kept in mind that the application for variation does not relate to final order, but rather an interim one. Interim orders are meant to be temporary until the matter can properly be adjudicated. Counsel for both parties acknowledged in argument that joint custody with an equal sharing of time should continue pending trial. As such, there is no need to vary the interim order. The real issue is where Danelle will attend kindergarten. As indicated above, this matter will be proceeding to trial within the next three to four months. Subject to the parties reaching different agreement, there shall be an order that Danelle continue in kindergarten in North Battleford up to and including December, 2004. Commencing in January, 2005, Danelle shall attend kindergarten in Saskatoon. The evidence discloses that Danelle is happy, well-adjusted child. do not anticipate any problems with her adjusting to change in schools in January and it will give her the opportunity to make friends in both of the communities where her parents reside. Mr. Clavelle’s move to Saskatoon will impact the terms of the final order with regard to the parenting issue. Danelle’s primary residence, and where she will attend school, will need to be resolved prior to her entering Grade 1. That is matter that should be left to the trial judge. The parties indicated they would be able to work out an equal sharing of Danelle’s time once they know where she will be attending kindergarten. If they are unable to do so, they shall have leave to bring this matter back before me by telephone conference within 30 days. If the matter is brought back before me, Danelle’s proposed school schedules, as well as any extra-curricular activities and the parties’ work schedules, should be provided. [4] This order is essentially discretionary order in protracted family law litigation. In such circumstances the Court should not interfere with discretionary order unless it is clearly wrong or is founded on wrong principle of law. The controlling standard of review is succinctly stated by Cameron J.A. in Attorney General of Canada v. [L. (G.)] 2004 SKCA 137 (CanLII): [17] The order was made in the exercise of discretionary power, fact that serves to narrow the basis for intervention on appeal: Only if the chambers judge abused his discretion by acting on some wrong principle, by disregarding some material matter of fact, or by failing to act judicially, is the Court of Appeal at liberty to interfere. Either that or the result must be so plainly wrong as to invite intervention on that basis: Rimmer v. Adshead, 2002 SKCA 12 (CanLII), [2002] W.W.R. 119. Also see Boston v. Boston, 2001 SCC 43 (CanLII), [2001] S.C.R. 413 at para. 73. [5] Applying this test to the impinged order we find that no such error has been demonstrated. Accordingly the appeal must stand dismissed. [6] The award of costs in Queen’s Bench that was challenged on this appeal must be affirmed for the same reason. [7] We cannot part from this case without observing that enormous resources have been expended by the parties in contest to determine where the child Danelle shall attend kindergarten for two days per week during seven week period before trial. We observe that the interest of the parties and their daughter Danelle would have been better served if they had devoted their time and resources to much earlier trial of this matter in Queen’s Bench. This action which was commenced in 2002 is finally proceeding to trial on February 21, 2005. While the order made may be of some inconvenience to the parties this does not constitute reversible error. [8] It is not our function to “fine tune” orders of this nature particularly when they are of such short duration. We have reviewed the voluminous affidavit evidence in the record and find no misuse of judicial discretion. The order under attack is considered attempt to manage the situation for short period before trial. [9] Furthermore, this Court has signalled its reluctance to interfere with the discretion of a chambers judge when dealing with matters of this nature. In Foss v. Foss (1991), 1991 CanLII 7937 (SK CA), 31 R.F.L. (3d) 367 (Sask. C.A.), Madam Justice Gerwing, speaking for the Court at p. 368 stated: Two general comments should be made with respect to this type of application. First, this Court is extremely reluctant to interfere with the discretion of chamber or trial judge with respect to questions of interim maintenance. Second, the most desirable thing in almost every instance is to proceed as rapidly as possible to trial so that the matter can be determined finally after full examination of all of the relevant evidence. Also see Lapoor v. Navidi (2000), 2000 SKCA 95 (CanLII), 14 R.F.L. (5th) 125. [10] We dismiss this appeal with costs on double Col. 5. [11] The respondent’s motion under Rule 15 is now moot. Accordingly it is dismissed as moot with no costs to either party. [12] Since we addressed the appeal proper on its merits, the motion to “quash” is dismissed as moot with no costs to either party.",6_2004skca168.txt,"The appellant appeals from an order that directed that the daughter of the parties shall attend kindergarten in Saskatoon during the 7 week period before trial.

INTRODUCTION[1] This is a high-conflict family law matter.
The mother wants to change her residence (and that of the two young children) presently, which amounts to an application to change residence on an interim basis.
The father has a significant history of criminal behaviour, is presently incarcerated and will be for at least the balance of this calendar year.
He opposes the move, and in any event wants access.
The parties have come to this court to determine what should happen on an interim basis.
II.
FACTS[2] The parties married October 11, 2008, and separated in April 2011.
It was the first marriage for each.
[3] There is little utility in reviewing the events within the marriage in exhaustive detail.
Suffice it to say that from the outset, the marriage was tempestuous.
Within months of the marriage the father was charged criminally and served time in jail.
When this action was commenced in spring 2011, the mother had to obtain an ex parte order returning the boys to her care.
The father has issues with substance abuse and anger management.
Unfortunately, for a variety of reasons this report was not completed until February 2013.","Where the petitioner demonstrated that she did not upgrade her education during the marriage as a result of her attempts to become pregnant and thus there was a causal connection between the petitioner's need and the marriage,

Smith Petitioner/Applicant: and Peter Allan Smith Respondent HEARD: Before the Honourable Chief Justice Constance R. Glube, Trial Division in Chambers at Halifax, Nova Scotia, August 3, 1990. DATE: August 15, 1990 COUNSEL: Mark T. Knox, for the Petitioner/Applicant Katherine A. McDonald, for the Respondent 1990 1201‑43833 IN THE SUPREME COURT OF NOVA SCOTIA TRIAL DIVISION BETWEEN: Debbie A. Smith Petitioner/Applicant and Peter Allan Smith Respondent GLUBE, C.J.T.D.: This is an application by Debbie A. Smith for interim maintenance. The parties were married on April 9, 1983. Peter Smith left the matrimonial home in July of 1989. There are no children of the marriage. Ms. Smith has been employed at K‑Mart as clerk for fifteen years. Her income is $8.65 per hour for total of $950.00 per month. Mr. Smith is employed by Public Works Canada. His annual salary is $36,817.00. Due to unusual personnel circumstances, he worked considerable overtime in 1989 which brought his income up to $48,000.00. This overtime is non‑recurring event. Ms. Smith wishes to upgrade herself so that she can obtain more lucrative employment. Mr. Smith had concerns during the marriage that she was underpaid. She claims that during their marriage, she spent a lot of time under medical care in an effort to become pregnant. At the time of separation she was pregnant, however, she suffered miscarriage. She claims that it was agreed that if she had child, she would not continue her employment. Ms. Smith claims that she has some particular expenses occurring at this time. She wishes to enroll in Certified General Accounting Course, which may be obtained either through correspondence or at St. Mary's University and would take three to four years to complete. The cost at St. Mary's is $650.00 per year. She would continue her employment while taking the course. She claims that motor vehicle which .she received in the division of property has stopped working and is too costly to repair. She is looking to replace that motor vehicle. Also, that upon the sale of the matrimonial home she resided with relatives. She has now found accommodation for herself and her dog at monthly rental of $595.00. Ms. Smith, in her affidavit, recognizes that she is not entitled to maintenance indefinitely, but instead is seeking lump sum or periodic term of maintenance to allow her to upgrade her education so that she will become financially independent. She is seeking $500.00 month on an interim basis. Mr. Smith disputes her entitlement to any maintenance. He claims he has maintained her from the time of separation until the house was sold on July 19, by paying all the household expenses including light and power, totalling $16,135.00. Ms. Smith claims that out of some of these funds she paid some bills relating specifically to Mr. Smith. He claims she received $17,683.00 as her share of an equal division upon the sale of the matrimonial home and that this money should be invested to provide income. He submits that an award of interim maintenance should not be made on the facts before the court, as there was not time to present all the facts and there is serious question as to whether her inability to earn money can be attributed to her being married. He claims she is neither entitled to nor does she need interim maintenance. The court has the power to grant lump sum in lieu of or in addition to periodic sums on an interim basis (s.15(3) Divorce Act 1985). Section 15(5) of the Divorce Act sets out the factors to be considered by the court and s.15(7) sets out the objectives of support order. accept that there should be some causal connection between the applicant's need and the marriage or cohabitation period. The parties have very disparate incomes. After examining Mr. Smith's financial statement, it would appear that he could afford to pay interim maintenance. The question is whether or not Ms. Smith is entitled to receive any payment. On the one hand, thorough review of the facts is necessary to reach final conclusion as to whether or not Ms. Smith's economic disadvantage arises from breakdown of the marriage. On the other hand, promoting economic self‑sufficiency is another objective which the court will seek to effect even on an interim award. The factors to be considered are the means, needs and other circumstances of each spouse including the length of time the parties cohabited. The parties lived together as husband and wife for just over five years following the marriage, however, there was period of two additional years prior to marriage when the parties resided together as common law spouses. In my opinion, Ms. Smith should attempt to upgrade her education. agree it is doubtful that she will be entitled to maintenance for any lengthy period of time. In my opinion, it is inappropriate to award the requested amount of $500.00 month maintenance until this matter is resolved. propose to award nominal amount plus small lump sum with the understanding that the court could well take that into account if on the hearing of the divorce it is determined that Ms. Smith is entitled to periodic maintenance for period of time. Ms. Smith will no doubt have to invest her proceeds from the matrimonial home so that she receives monthly income. On an interim basis, she will probably not be able to afford to replace her car. To move matters along towards the goal of financial independence and considering the means, and needs, and circumstances of each spouse, acknowledging that this may not be the basis for a lump sum or monthly periodic maintenance being made at the time the divorce is heard, I find there is some causal relationship between Ms. Smith\'s attempts to become pregnant and the fact that she did not upgrade her education during the marriage. I award the sum of $100.00 per month interim maintenance. The first payment is payable immediately, and thereafter on the first day of each month until final determination is made. In addition, award the sum of $650.00 to be made to Ms. Smith upon her producing statement from the Registrar of St. Mary's University or such other body providing correspondence course for Certified General Accounting showing that she has enrolled and has been accepted in course to commence in the fall of 1990. urge the parties to proceed to trial with the issue of maintenance at the earliest opportunity, particularly as this appears to be the only outstanding issue.

The mobile home, and its contents, were insured with the defendant who has denied liability on the policy alleging that the plaintiff deliberately started the fire, or caused it to be started.
The plaintiff testified that he was awakened shortly before 6:00 a.m. by a buzzing noise from the smoke detector.
He found the mobile home already to be in flames and rushed to his grandparents' house to have them call the fire department.
He testified that when he returned to the mobile home, his brother, who also lives on the farm site, was present and they both attempted to gain access to the home but were prevented from doing so by the heat of the fire and heavy smoke.
Constable Bell of the Moosomin detachment of the R.C.M.P.

In that statement the plaintiff stated the following:Smoke detector buzzed a few times and it woke me up.

Abrametz for the plaintiff (respondent) D.A. Racine for the defendant (applicant) FIAT GEREIN, J. July 18, 2006 [1] This is an application for an order striking out the plaintiff’s claim in defamation. I decline to grant the order. THE APPLICATION [2] The application is brought pursuant to Queen’s Bench Rule 173 which provides: 173. The Court may at any stage of an action order any pleading or any part thereof to be struck out, with or without leave to amend, on the ground that: (a) it discloses no reasonable cause of action or defence, as the case may be: (c) it is scandalous, frivolous or vexatious; (e) it is otherwise an abuse of the process of the Court; and may order the action to be stayed or dismissed or judgment to be entered accordingly or may grant such order as may be just. Unless otherwise directed, the offending party shall pay double the costs to which the other party would otherwise be entitled. The grounds in support of the application, as set out in the notice of motion, are these: 1. The Plaintiff’s Statement of Claim discloses no reasonable cause of action. The Statement of Claim does not provide any details of the incidents such as time, place, and audience relating to the alleged defamatory statements. The Statement of Claim does not allege that any of the statements were published by the Defendant. The facts as pleaded would not constitute defamation in law even if proven to be true. 2. The claim is scandalous, frivolous and vexatious. The Plaintiff fails to plead the means by which the statements were made or the dates when, and locations where, such statements were made thus depriving the Defendant of the ability to identify the acts or omissions or the incidents that are alleged to constitute cause of action. The Plaintiff fails to plead any facts as to the dates on which these statements were supposed to have been made, and deprives the Plaintiff of the ability to address the applicable limitation period. 3. As the Plaintiff fails to address the most basic elements of cause of action in defamation, the claim lacks substance and merely serves to scandalize and annoy the Defendant. As such, the Statement of Claim in its entirety is scandalous, frivolous and vexatious and otherwise an abuse of the process of this Honourable Court. While the grounds are set out in three paragraphs, the first two largely say the same thing: that the statement of claim discloses no reasonable cause of action. The last speaks of the claim being scandalous, frivolous and vexatious and an abuse of process. [3] The affidavits of several individuals, including the defendant, have been filed in support of the application. In each of them certain conduct of the defendant is described in some detail. However, they make no reference to the alleged defamatory remarks. THE STATEMENT OF CLAIM [4] This statement of claim alleges malicious defamation on the part of the defendant. The important paragraphs are these. 5. The Defendant, May Henderson, has verbally stated the following and thereby did so publish with respect to the Plaintiff, Winston McKay, to the Saskatoon Indian Metis Friendship Centre board members including Lorraine Hessdorfer, Pat Caron, Shauna Trotchie, Kelly Pruden, Julia M. Durocher, F. Maurice and Rick Daniels on or about the first week of June, 2005; (a) “Winston McKay has been verbally abusive to me for over year”; (b) “Winston McKay’s verbal abuse against me has escalated to physical abuse”; (c) “Winston McKay has harassed employees of the Saskatoon Indian Metis Friendship Centre” and particularly that “he has harassed me”. (d) “Winston McKay has guns and is violent and am afraid he will shoot me”. (e) “Winston McKay should be committed” (meaning to psychiatric treatment). 6. The foregoing statements made by the Defendant, May Henderson, with regard to the Plaintiff, Winston McKay, are untrue and are meant and understood to mean that the Plaintiff, Winston McKay, is untrustworthy, dishonourable, violent, brutish, misogynist and dangerous. 7. The Plaintiff states that, May Henderson’s actions constitute repeated attempts at character assassination of Winston McKay have led to his unjust and wrongful dismissal from the Board of the Saskatoon Indian Metis Friendship Centre. The Plaintiff states the Defendant has breached her duty of care to refrain from defaming the Plaintiff. Alternatively, the Plaintiff states the Defendant was negligent in that regard. 8. The statements made by the Defendant have alleged criminal misconduct, and he has suffered damages thereby. 9. The statements made by the Defendant, May Henderson, were malicious, highhanded and calculated to disparage the Plaintiff in his profession, calling and trade carried on by him at the time they were made. The statements have brought the Plaintiff, Winston McKay’s reputation into disrepute in the Indian and Metis community in Saskatoon, and have undermined his intention to seek an elected position as member of the Saskatchewan Legislative Assembly. The plaintiff then goes on to claim damages in excess of $25,000.00. [5] In Sagon v. Royal Bank of Canada et al. (1992), 1992 CanLII 8287 (SK CA), 105 Sask. R. 133 (C.A.), at p. 139, the test to be applied on applications such as this was set out as follows. In determining whether claim should be struck as disclosing no reasonable cause of action, the test is whether, assuming the plaintiff proves everything alleged in his claim, there is nevertheless no reasonable chance of success, or to put it another way, no arguable case. The court should exercise its jurisdiction to strike on this ground only in plain and obvious cases and where the court is satisfied that the case is beyond doubt: Contrary to the submissions of counsel for the defendant, all the essential elements of a claim in defamation are set out. That being so, a reasonable cause of action is disclosed and the quoted test has not been met. [6] At the hearing of the application counsel for the defendant argued that the claim should be dismissed because the defendant can claim qualified privilege. description of that privilege is found in The Law of Defamation In Canada by Raymond E. Brown; 2nd ed., 1994, Thomson Canada Limited, vol. pg. 673. The defendant must establish that the words spoken or written were published on lawful occasion, that is one “fairly warranted by some reasonable occasion or exigency”. There must be some mutuality of interest or duty between the publisher and recipient. Reciprocity of interest is essential. It must be shown that the publisher had some duty or interest in making the communication, and those to whom it was made had some interest in receiving it, or at least he or she was acting on behalf of someone who had such an interest. However, it must not involve the satisfaction of some duty or interest which is unlawful or contrary to the public interest. See also Haight-Smith v. Neden (2002), 2002 BCCA 132 (CanLII), 211 D.L.R. (4th) 370 and McLoughlin v. Kutasy, 1979 CanLII 39 (SCC), [1979] S.C.R. 311. [7] There may be merit to the defendant’s claim, but it cannot be dealt with in this application. While several affidavits were filed, none of them speak to the circumstances wherein the impugned remarks were made. Most importantly, there is no assertion by the defendant that the remarks were made in the course of her duties or were received by persons with a corresponding duty. [8] recognize that the statement of claim speaks of the remarks being made to board members. However, that phrase may only be descriptive of the persons. In any event, it does not establish that the persons were carrying out some board function at the relevant time. [9] Furthermore, the statement of claim alleges malice. The plaintiff must be afforded an opportunity to establish that. Counsel for the defendant submits that the affidavits filed serve to negative malice. do not agree. Accordingly, cannot say the claim is vexatious or frivolous. [10] further and final submission was made by counsel for the defendant purportedly based on the decision in Mitchell v. Gilpin (2004), 2004 SKQB 311 (CanLII), 250 Sask. R. 246 (Q.B.). The circumstances of that case were markedly different than in this case before me. The plaintiff, Mitchell, was teacher about whom complaints had been made. In the end, Mitchell’s contract of employment was terminated for reasons other than the complaints. She sought redress in respect of the termination and when she was unsuccessful she commenced an action for defamation. [11] On an application to strike the claim, it was decided that the complaints of the defendant related to the workplace and were dealt with in accordance with the regime established for the purpose of dealing with workplace problems. That being so, it was held that it would be an abuse of process to permit the plaintiff to pursue the same matter in this forum. Therefore, the claim was struck. [12] In the instant case, there is no evidence before me about the circumstances surrounding the several remarks. do not even know that the defendant made the remarks, let alone any reason for doing so. Accordingly, it cannot be said that she fits within situation like that in the Mitchell case. It follows that this submission must be rejected. [13] In the result, the application is dismissed. The plaintiff will have his costs which are fixed at $400.00 in any event of the cause.",7_2006skqb322.txt,"FIAT: This is an application for an order striking out the plaintiff's claim in defamation pursuant to rule 173 of the Queen's Bench Rules.

Canada (Attorney General), 2011 NSSC 184 Date: 20110512 Docket: Hfx.No. 311509 Registry: Halifax Between: Daniel Innocente v. Attorney General of Canada DECISION Judge: The Honourable Justice Kevin Coady Heard: April 7, 2011, in Halifax, Nova Scotia Decision: May 12, 2011 Counsel: J. Walter Thompson, QC, for the plaintiff Sarah Drodge, for the defendant By the Court: [1] The Defendant Attorney General of Canada (AGC) moves for an order for summary judgment on the pleadings pursuant to Civil Procedure Rule 13.03 (1)(a) and (c) on the grounds that: 1) The statement of claim discloses no reasonable cause of action; and 2) The statement of claim otherwise makes claim that is clearly unsustainable when the pleading is read on its own. BACKGROUND: [2] In 1996 the Plaintiff was charged with seven drug and weapons related offences. In 1997 he was charged with possession of proceeds of crime and possession of narcotic for the purpose of trafficking. Prior to being charged in 1996, the AGC obtained search warrant and restraint order from this court pursuant to section 462.32 and 462.33 of the Criminal Code of Canada. These orders prohibited the Plaintiff from disposing of or otherwise dealing in any manner with any interest in his residential property at 47 Granite Cove Drive, Five Island Lake, Nova Scotia. [3] number of these charges were stayed on November 17, 2001. However in 1999 Mr. Innocente was tried and convicted of conspiracy to traffic in cannabis resin and sentenced to seven years imprisonment. [4] On May 21, 2009, the Plaintiff filed statement of claim against the AGC alleging that he suffered damages as result of the “improper withholding of his real and personal property” by the Defendant. In response the AGC brought motion for summary judgment on the pleadings. The motion was heard by Justice LeBlanc in September 2009. [5] Justice LeBlanc dismissed the statement of claim in its entirety but without prejudice to the Plaintiff’s right to file an amended statement of claim. In reaching his decision he found that the statement of claim “as presently framed does not make out cause of action.” On January 6, 2011, Mr. Innocente filed an amended statement of claim. In response the AGC brought this motion claiming that the renewed motion still does not disclose reasonable cause of action and provides insufficient details of the claim. [6] It is not disputed that the AGC undertook, as part of the 1996 warrant and restraint orders, to comply with any court order as to damages and costs sustained by Mr. Innocente as result of the restraint order. Section 462.32(b) states as follows: Before issuing warrant under this section, judge shall require the Attorney General to give such undertakings as the judge considers appropriate with respect to the payment of damages or costs, or both, in relation to the issuance and execution of the warrant. [7] Section 462.33(7) states as follows: Before making an order under subsection (3), judge shall require the Attorney General to give such undertakings as the judge considers appropriate with respect to the payment of damages or costs, or both, in relation to (a) the making of an order in respect of property situated within or outside Canada; and (b) the execution of an order in respect of property situated within Canada. [8] Mr. Innocente submits that after the criminal proceedings were over, the AGC did not seek forfeiture or any remedy pursuant to section 462.32 and 463.32 of the Criminal Code or any remedy with respect to the seized property. He submits that in 2004 the AGC applied for and was granted an order revoking the 1996 orders of warrant and restraint. He argues that by that time he lost his house to foreclosure and his personal property was returned in “dilapidated stated.” Mr. Innocente describes his claim as follows at page of his brief: Mr. Innocente, in this action, claims damages and costs in relation to the issuance and the execution of the restraint order on his real property and the warrant for the seizure of his personal property. He says the restraint and the seizure became improper because without proceeding to forfeiture the restraint and forfeiture lost all purpose and foundation. He says that the restraint obtained by the Attorney General caused the sale of his real property at substantial loss and after eight years, substantial depreciation of his personal property. The personal property was listed. He says, in summary, that the Attorney General is liable under its undertaking because the Attorney General never proceeded with forfeiture on his conviction for the Henneberry conspiracy and all other charges were either stayed, withdrawn or dismissed. POSITION OF THE APPLICANT DEFENDANT: [9] The AGC argues that there is no recognized cause of action because Mr. Innocente does not attack the validity of the 1996 warrant and restraint order. It is the view of the AGC that such challenge is the only avenue available to Mr. Innocente. The AGC points out that these orders do not terminate upon conviction and relies on sections 462.33(10) and 462.35 of the Criminal Code to support this position. reading of these sections establish that restraint order may survive conviction. [10] The AGC points out that Justice LeBlanc, on the previous summary judgment application, found as follows at paragraph 32: An undertaking to respond in damages and costs results from the making and the execution of special warrant and detention order. It does not appear that the undertaking gives rise to claim other than by way of attack on the making or execution of the special warrant or restraint order. [11] The AGC argues that the amended statement of claim does not change this fact and, as such, should be struck. [12] Additionally the AGC argues that the statement of claim does not disclose sufficient material facts to enable the AGC to discern the basis of the Plaintiff’s claim for damages. They submit that Mr. Innocente does not plead how the AGC caused him to sell his property at substantial loss or how the restraint order affected that event. The AGC also submits that Mr. Innocente does not plead what the “dilapidated state” of his personal property means or what property he is referencing. [13] Additionally the AGC argues that Mr. Innocente’s characterization of this action as “novel claim” does not necessitate trial. They submit that the law is settled that claim does not automatically survive motion to strike simply because the claim is novel or unprecedented. The AGC relies on the following cite from Syl Apps Secure Treatment Centre v. B.D., 2007 SCC 38 (CanLII), [2007] S.C.R. 83 at paragraph 19: Both the majority and dissenting reasons acknowledged that imposing such duty of care would represent novel duty at law. The benefit of making determination on Rule 21 motion about whether such duty should be recognized, is obvious. If there is no legally recognized duty of care to the family owed by the defendants, there is no legal justification for protracted and expensive trial. If, on the other hand, such duty is accepted, trial is necessary to determine whether, on the facts of this case, that duty has been breached. [14] It is the position of the AGC that terming this action “novel” does not allow the plaintiff to avoid the rules concerning pleadings. POSITION OF THE RESPONDENT PLAINTIFF: [15] Mr. Innocente acknowledges that the charges laid against him may sustain seizure and restraint order under the Criminal Code. He further acknowledges, for the purpose of this action, that the 1999 seizure and warrant were properly obtained and does not challenge the process by which they were authorized. [16] Mr. Innocente argues that Justice LeBlanc was wrong when he stated “it does not appear that the undertaking gives rise to claim other than by way of attack on the making or execution of the special warrant or restraint order.” It is of some note that Mr. Innocente has not appealed Justice LeBlanc’s ruling on the first summary judgment application, given his position on this application. It is also of note that Mr. Innocente was convicted of conspiracy to traffic and sentenced to seven years imprisonment. He hangs this claim on the fact that the crown did not push the matter all the way to forfeiture and, instead, returned it to him in 2004. [17] Mr. Innocente has not provided authority for his position that recovery pursuant to these undertakings does not require an attack on the validity of the enabling orders. He does not provide authority for his position that failure to proceed to forfeiture triggers these undertakings. The AGC has not provided clear authority that Mr. Innocente’s positions are wrong in law. The fact that the crown can extend these orders does not settle the above stated issues. While the undertakings are founded in the Criminal Code, they amount to contract between the crown and the offender. Section 462.32(4) of the code imposes duty on the crown to take “reasonable care to ensure that the property is preserved.” This is an indication of the will of parliament to provide the citizen with some protection when the state seizes property before conviction. [18] have not been provided with the details of these undertakings. have no evidence as to whether they are standardized or vary from case to case. Nonetheless, it seems clear to me that the undertaking creates cause of action. This does not suggest that Mr. Innocente’s cause of action has any merit, only that it exists. [19] Mr. Innocente further argues that he has provided sufficient details in his statement of claim to enable the AGC to discern the basis of his claim for damages. He submits that greater detail will emerge as the action proceeds through discovery examination. He states that there is nothing novel about his action given it is rooted in legislation. THE CAUSE OF ACTION: [20] I have concluded that Mr. Innocente has a cause of action arising from the statutory undertakings given by the AGC in 1996. While this is a significant factor, it does not necessarily defend against this summary judgment application based on the pleadings. PARTICULARS OF DAMAGES: [21] The AGC argues that notwithstanding finding a cause of action, the plaintiff’s amended statement of claim does not plead sufficient material facts to comply with the rules. The following rules address the sufficiency of claim: 4.02(4) The statement of claim must notify the defendant of all the claims to be raised by the plaintiff at trial, conform with Rule 38 Pleading, and include each of the following: (a) description of the parties; (b) concise statement of the material facts relied on by the plaintiff, but not argument or the evidence by which the material facts are to be proved; (c) reference to legislation relied on by the plaintiff, if the material facts that make the legislation applicable have been stated; (d) concise statement of the remedies claimed, except costs. 38.02 General principles of pleading (1) party must, by the pleading the party files, provide notice to the other party of all claims, defences, or grounds to be raised by the party signing the pleading. (2) The pleading must be concise, but it must provide information sufficient to accomplish both of the following: (a) the other party will know the case the party has to meet when preparing for, and participating in, the trial or hearing; (b) the other party will not be surprised when the party signing the pleading seeks to prove material fact. (3) Material facts must be pleaded, but the evidence to prove material fact must not be pleaded. 38.03 Pleading claim or defence in an action (1) claim or defence in an action, and claim or defence in counterclaim, crossclaim, or third party claim, must be made by statement of claim that conforms with Rules 4.02(4) and 4.03(5), of Rule Action, or statement of defence that conforms with Rule 4.05(4) of Rule 4. (2) The following additional rules of pleading apply to all pleadings in an action: (a) description of person in pleadings must not contain more personal information than is necessary to identify the person and show the person’s relationship to claim or defence; (b) claims or defences may be pleaded in the alternative, but the facts supporting an alternative claim or defence must be pleaded distinctly; (c) pleading that refers to material document, such as contract, written communication, or deed must identify the document and concisely describe its effect without quoting the text, unless the exact words of the text are themselves material; (d) pleading that alleges notice is given must state when the notice was given, identify the person notified, and concisely describe its content without quoting the text, unless the exact words of the text are themselves material. (3) pleading must provide full particulars of claim alleging unconscionable conduct, such as fraud, fraudulent misrepresentation, misappropriation, or malice. [22] The AGC submits that the amended statement of claim gives no indication as to how they allegedly caused damages in respect to his real and personal property. [23] am unaware that Justice LeBlanc found that the original statement of claim was deficient in this respect. He described the AGC position at paragraph 13: [13] Among the alleged deficiencies identified by the Attorney General in the pleading are the absence of “material facts to explain what relevance the restraint order had on [Mr. Innocente’s] decision to sell his house or on the value of his house when he sold it in June 2002;” the lack of specifics on “what personal property was allegedly seized, or when it was returned,” or, for that matter, “what exactly, if anything, he claims happened to his personal property” during the period it was seized, or whether the claim “is based solely on the alleged deterioration and loss of value” of the personal property. [24] Justice LeBlanc went on to say at paragraph 34 that “given this lack of clarity, the plaintiff’s assertion that he is entitled to damages ... is dubious.” [25] now must look at the amended statement of claim to determine whether it offers any more detail than the original. have reviewed the amendments in paragraph through 12. find these paragraphs to be nothing more than history of the 1996-2004 legal proceedings. These paragraphs add nothing about the alleged real estate loss or the dilapidation of personal property. There is nothing stated that would answer any of the questions asked in paragraph 13 previously referenced. [26] The next amendment is paragraph 16 which states: 16. Mr. Innocente says that in 1995, the Defendant conducted an analysis of his net worth and concluded that his net worth was $750,000.00. He says that by the time the order restraining and seizing his property of June 24, 1996 was revoked, his net worth had been diminished to nothing. [27] This amounts to nothing more than bald statement without any supporting details. I conclude that the amendments add nothing to the statement of claim that was before Justice LeBlanc. [28] Civil Procedure Rule 13:03 sets out the principles governing summary judgment on the pleadings: (1) judge must set aside statement of claim, or statement of defence, that is deficient in any of the following ways: (a) it discloses no cause of action or basis for defence or contest; (b) it makes claim based on cause of action in the exclusive jurisdiction of another court; (c) it otherwise makes claim, or sets up defence or ground of contest, that is clearly unsustainable when the pleading is read on its own. (2) The judge must grant summary judgment of one of the following kinds, when pleading is set aside in the following circumstances: .... (b) dismissal of the proceeding, when the statement of claim is set aside wholly; .... (d) dismissal of claim, when all parts of the statement of claim that pertain to the claim are set aside. (3) motion for summary judgment on the pleadings must be determined only on the pleadings, and no affidavit may be filed in support of or opposition to the motion.... [29] Hamilton J.A. described the test under the former Rule 14.25 (1972) which was replaced by Rule 13.03. In MacQueen v. Ispat Sidbec Inc., 2007 NSCA 33 (CanLII) she stated at paragraph 8: All parties agree that pleading should only be struck if it is “plain and obvious” that the claim does not disclose cause of action; that the action is “obviously unsustainable.” This test was recently approved by this Court in Mabey v. Mabey (2005), 2005 NSCA 35 (CanLII), 230 N.S.R. (2d) 272 (N.S. C.A.): [13] It is well settled that the test pursuant to Rule 14.25(1)(a) is that the application will not be granted unless the action is “obviously unsustainable.” In considering an application to strike out pleading it is not the court’s function to try the issues but rather to decide if there are issues to be tried. The power to strike out pleadings is to be used sparingly and where the action raises substantial issues it should not be struck out: Vladi Private Islands Ltd. v. Haase et al. (1990), 1990 CanLII 2418 (NS CA), 96 N.S.R. (2d) 323, 253 A.P.R. 323 (C.A.). An application for variation should not be struck out unless it is certain to fail, or it is plain and obvious that it will not succeed. Neither the length and complexity of the issues, the novelty of the cause of action, nor the potential for the respondent to present strong defence should prevent the applicant from proceeding with his or her case: Hunt v. Carey Canada Inc., 1990 CanLII 90 (SCC), [1990] S.C.R. 959, 117 N.R. 321. [30] Civil Procedure Rule 13:03(1) states that statement of claim must be set aside for “any” of the three enumerated grounds. rely on the third ground to conclude that this action must be set aside because it is “clearly unsustainable when the pleading is read on its own.” [31] find that Mr. Innocente’s claim is clearly unsustainable. Accordingly his amended statement of claim is dismissed with costs to the AGC in the amount of $500.00.",7_2011nssc184.txt,"Rule 13.03 – Summary judgment on pleadings, motion granted on the basis of Rule 13.03(1)(c)).
While the claim discloses a possible cause of action based on the Attorney General's statutory undertakings, this alone doesn't decide the matter.
The amendments add nothing by way of necessary detail to the claim, which doesn't plead sufficient material facts to comply with the Rules on pleadings (see Rule 4.02)."

Publishers of this case please take note that s. 59 (2) of the Children's Services Act applies and may require editing of this judgment or its heading before publication.

The reasons for judgment of the Court were delivered orally by: MACDONALD, J.A.: The appellant was convicted after trial in the County Court Judge's Criminal Court for District Number Two on bill of indictment alleging that he sexually assaulted his stepdaughter between July 1, 1987 and August 31, 1989. The girl was 11 years old when the alleged assaults began. The child's testimony was that the sexual acts took place primarily at her home, usually on Friday nights when her mother was working and her sister had gone to visit her brother and his girlfriend. The complainant said that the sexual activities started out as fondling and eventually to full sexual intercourse. She also testified that the appellant attempted anal intercourse with her but she said she thought that he was unsuccessful. The complainant also testified that the appellant had intercourse with her at cottage. The complainant's mother, sister, brother and the latter's girlfriend flatly contradicted the complainant as to the time she says the acts took place. Her sister testified that except for two Fridays during the time in question she was home every Friday night with the complainant and nothing untoward occurred. There was no contradiction of the complainant's testimony of the sexual assault at the cottage. The appellant's defence was complete denial of the allegations. Two medical doctors gave evidence from which the reasonable and rational conclusion could be drawn that the complainant had had sexual intercourse, both vaginal and anal, on numerous occasions. The Crown also called social worker trained in counselling families and children. She was qualified by the court to give opinion evidence with respect to recognizing, accepting and counselling with respect to symptoms of child sexual abuse. She testified that she interviewed the complainant and others involved in the case and concluded that the child exhibited many of the symptoms often found in children who have been sexually abused, such as depression, attempts to block out recollection of events, low self‑esteem, lack of trust in others and an inability to be specific as to details. In R. v. G.B. et al (1988), 1988 CanLII 208 (SK CA), 65 Sask.R. 134 at 149, Wakeling, J.A., said: think it can now be taken that evidence of an expert, in the nature of that given by Dr. Wollert as to the psychological and physical conditions which frequently arise as result of sexual abuse of child, is admissible. It provides assistance to the trial judge in concluding whether an assault has occurred."" On appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada, R. v. B.(G.), 1990 CanLII 115 (SCC), [1990] S.C.R. 57, 56 C.C.C. (3d) 161, Madame Justice Wilson, speaking for the court said (p. 220): ""... agree with Wakeling J.A.'s conclusion that the expert evidence in this case was well within the bounds of acceptable and admissible testimony and that in cases of sexual assault against children the opinon of an expert often proves invaluable."" On this point, see also R. v. Lavallee, 1990 CanLII 95 (SCC), [1990] S.C.R. 852, C.R. (3d) 329 at 357. In our opinion, the evidence of the social worker in this case was admissible. It provided assistance to the trial judge in concluding whether an assault had occurred. The trial judge reviewed the evidence in detail and referred specifically to the testimony of the other members of the complainant's family that contradicted her evidence that the sexual assaults occurred on Friday night at her home. In R. v. B.(G.), supra, Madame Justice Wilson said (pp. 219‑220): ""...While children may not be able to recount precise details and communicate the when and where of an event with exactitude, this does not mean that they have misconceived what happened to them and who did it. In recent years we have adopted a much more benign attitude to children\'s evidence, lessening the strict standards of oath taking and corroboration, and I believe that this is a desirable development. The credibility of every witness who testifies before the courts must, of course, be carefully assessed but the standard of the \'reasonable adult\' is not necessarily appropriate is assessing the credibility of young children."" It is probable that the complainant was not sexually molested every Friday night by the appellant. The last referred to comments of Wilson, J., are relevant to the present case. It follows, in our view, that even though the complainant must have been mistaken as to the number of Friday nights she was sexually molested, such misconception on her part, under all the circumstances of this case, does not destroy her credibility. The trial judge noted that the evidence of the complainant had been consistent and given in reasonable manner. He said that if the evidence was only that of the appellant and the complainant ""it would be something of standoff"". He went on, however, to refer to the evidence of the social worker and of the two medical doctors. He then found that the complainant had given her evidence in creditable manner and one worthy of belief and proceeded to convict the appellant. The one rather disturbing feature of this case is that the Crown called as witness Miss. V. who was counsellor at the junior high school attended by the complainant. Miss. V. testified that on September 8, 1989, the complainant came to her office in rather distraught condition. After being questioned by Miss. V., the complainant said she was having difficulty with her stepfather. In response to direct questions put to her by Miss. V., the child said that her stepfather had touched her breasts and inside her pants. She said that that had been going on for several years. Those were the only details of sexual assault that she gave to Miss. V.. Defence counsel objected to the evidence of Miss. V. on the ground, as understand the record, that it related to period of time outside the time frame of the information. The learned trial judge, however, ruled that the evidence of Miss. V. was admissible, not to prove the commission of the offence, but as going to the credibility of the complainant. Miss. V. was competent to testify regarding the complainant's emotional state. Her evidence, however, of what the latter told her was hearsay and inadmissible. The trial judge therefore, in our opinion, erred in law in allowing such evidence and as treating it as relevant to the complainant\'s credibility if, in fact, that is what he actually did. Other passages contained in the record and in the decision clearly indicate to us that the trial judge was aware that any evidence that could be categorized as ""oath helping"" was not to be considered. The question then is whether the admission of the hearsay evidence of Miss. V. was an error so grave as to call for a quashing of the conviction. After consideration of the entire record, we have concluded that it does not. We have reached this conclusion for the following reasons. The medical evidence establishes beyond doubt that the complainant had been the victim of repeated acts of both vaginal and anal intercourse. These were sexual assaults. The only issue, therefore, was the identity of the person who had committed such sexual assaults. The trial judge found that the complainant's evidence had been consistent throughout and had been given in reasonable manner ""worthy of belief"". It is to be noted that the sexual assaults with which we are here concerned are really the acts of intercourse, yet all the complainant told Miss. V. was that her stepfather had touched her breasts and inside her pants. Finally, the learned trial judge found that over the time frame covered by the information he was left ""in little doubt that opportunities could and did present themselves for E.L.H. to have had relationship with [the complainant]."" Although such opportunity may not have been exclusive, it appears that it was close to being so. The trial judge went on to say that ""the evidence is that she (the complainant) was kept close to home ... and apparently it was very strict home. The mother did not allow [either the complainant or her sister] to be absent from home, did not allow them normal social interchange with other young people ..."". The trial judge then went on to say that he believed the evidence of the complainant as to the fact that there were times when she was alone with her stepfather. Under the circumstances, we would therefore invoke the curative provisions of s. 686(1)(a)(iii) of the Code and hold that the error of the trial judge in admitting in evidence what the complainant told Miss. V. did not result in any substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice. In Yebes v. The Queen, 1987 CanLII 17 (SCC), [1987] S.C.R. 168, 36 C.C.C. (3d) 417, the Supreme Court of Canada said that the function of the Court of Appeal was to determine on the whole of the evidence whether the verdict is one that properly instructed jury, acting judicially, could reasonably have rendered. The court went on to say that while the Court of Appeal must not merely substitute its view for that of the jury, in order to apply the test the court must re‑examine and, to some extent, reweigh and consider the effect of the evidence. This we have done and have concluded that the verdict of the trial judge was one that he could reasonably have reached on the evidence before him. In result, the appeal against conviction is dismissed. J.A. Concurred in: Hallett, J.A. Chipman, J.A. CANADA PROVINCE OF NOVA SCOTIA 1990 S.C.C.

No. 339 of 2013 Judicial Centre: Prince Albert BETWEEN: JEAN RICHER and LESLIE SINOBERT, and THE ATTORNEY GENERAL OF CANADA, Counsel: Jean Richer and Leslie Sinobert appearing on their own behalf Christopher J. Bernier appearing for the respondent JUDGMENT DOVELL J. November 6, 2013 [1] The applicants, Jean Richer and Leslie Sinobert, (hereinafter referred to as “Richer” and/or “Sinobert”) have brought an application for writ of habeas corpus with certiorari in aid, seeking unconditional release from the Riverbend Minimum Institution in Prince Albert, Saskatchewan, due to “threat” to their respective liberties claiming that the Correctional Service of Canada has violated their rights under the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms (the “Charter”) in not allowing them to reside in common housing unit so that they can participate in their long-standing, same-sex relationship outside of the public domain. A. Preliminary Request [2] Prior to this application being heard, Richer requested that the Court allow him to represent Sinobert “as he has no ability to represent himself, having suffered three strokes since 1993 and suffers the effects from mercury poisoning (Minamata disease) and its effects, for which he has suffered with for his 62 years of life”. [3] It was obvious from the evidence the Court received concerning Sinobert’s physical and mental health and the Court’s observations of Sinobert during the application that he was suffering from some kind of disability. Rule 2-34 of The Queen’s Bench Rules requires that party with disability be represented by lawyer. However, in the unique circumstances of this case, with Sinobert consenting and the respondent not really taking issue with Richer’s request, the Court allowed Richer to make submissions to the Court on Sinobert’s behalf as well as his own. That proved to be beneficial for everyone as towards the end of the argument Sinobert had to be assisted by court official for blood sugar related situation that had culminated during the application. B. Background Facts [4] Most of the facts in this matter are not in dispute. Both Richer and Sinobert had been serving their “life” or “indeterminate” sentences at the medium security Saskatchewan Penitentiary until they were both transferred this year to the minimum security Riverbend Annex; Sinobert on April 9, 2013 and Richer on May 14, 2013. Richer and Sinobert are both residing in housing units at Riverbend; Sinobert residing in housing unit specifically designated for individuals with mental health issues. [5] On May 21, 2013, Richer submitted an Inmate’s Request requesting that he and Sinobert be allowed to reside together at Riverbend in the same housing unit. [6] Pursuant to policies of the Correctional Service of Canada and as contained in the Riverbend Inmate Handbook, on June 5, 2013, Darcy Begrand, Manager of Assessment and Intervention, responded to the May 21, 2013 Inmate’s Request as follows: No promises were made that you could move into Sinobert’s house. His house is specifically for inmates with Mental Health needs. You and Sinobert have ample opportunity to visit socialize in the AM, after work, on weekends, outside of the Minimum Security houses. [7] The Inmate Handbook outlines the institutional policy that all offenders are not allowed in housing units other than their own, but are to visit in common areas such as the multi-purpose building, the gymnasium and recreational areas, the cultural centre or outside the individual housing units. [8] Rather than bringing grievance under the Offender Complaint and Grievance Process as is outlined in Commissioner’s Directive 081, Richer wrote to the Deputy Regional Commissioner, Brenda LePage, on June 14, 2013 requesting meeting to discuss his concerns that he had not been allowed to reside or have private visits with Sinobert. [9] Attached to his June 14, 2013 letter was copy of his previous letter to her of May 26, 2013, and copy of first-level grievance response dated July 27, 2007, which had been provided to Richer in response to grievance he had filed in 2007 when he and Sinobert had been at the medium security Saskatchewan Penitentiary. Richer’s grievance in 2007 was in regard to the same issues that were outlined in his May 21, 2013 Inmate’s Request. [10] In response to Richer’s June 14, 2013 letter, Joan Dunajski, Regional Director, Communications and Executive Services, on July 3, 2013 wrote to Richer indicating that his concerns should be addressed through the Offender Complaint and Grievance System as it was the established process for offenders’ redress when they felt they had been treated unfairly, or in manner that was not consistent with the Correctional Service of Canada legislation and policies. Ms. Dunajski also informed Richer that the most fair and expedient resolution of offender concerns began with first‑level grievance and that his concerns could be addressed through that forum. [11] Notwithstanding that direction, Richer, who is familiar with the grievance process as he has in the past made use of it on numerous occasions, has not made first‑level grievance with regard to the concerns as contained in this application. [12] On July 13, 2013, Richer was located in Sinobert’s Riverbend housing unit and was charged with the disciplinary offence of being in housing unit other than his own. Richer was convicted of that offence and fined $5.00. Although institutional charges may sometimes lead to security reclassification of an offender, Richer has remained assessed as minimum security offender and has continued to be housed at minimum security Riverbend Institution. [13] Rather than following the Offender Complaint and Grievance System, both Richer and Sinobert chose to bring habeas corpus application to this Court in September 2013. [14] As at the time of the application being heard both Richer and Sinobert continued to be housed at minimum security Riverbend Institution in separate living units, neither having had their security levels reclassified and neither having filed first‑level grievance. The Court assumes that neither of the applicants’ situations have changed for the purpose of rendering this decision. Analysis [15] Although this Court and the Federal Court have concurrent jurisdiction to grant the remedies of habeas corpus and certiorari in aid of habeas corpus, in this case the Court has concluded that it must decline its jurisdiction to grant a remedy on the application guised as a habeas corpus application. [16] Our Court’s jurisdiction to grant remedies against federal institutions and decision-makers is narrow. It is not for this Court to determine the reasonableness of the administrative decisions made by the Correctional Service of Canada within the confines of its jurisdiction. Habeas corpus cannot be used to review the decision of the Correctional Service of Canada declining housing reassignment request or the policy that all inmates found in housing unit other than their own will be subject to disciplinary charges. [17] The applicants are seeking to challenge administrative decisions of the Correctional Service of Canada which do not impact their residual liberty. While Richer and Sinobert have framed their application under the pretence of habeas corpus, the true character of the remedies being sought by them is a writ of certiorari, prohibition or mandamus. These remedies fall within the exclusive jurisdiction of the Federal Court of Canada through a judicial review process. [18] Thus, habeas corpus cannot be used to review the way the Correctional Service of Canada manages an inmate’s sentence as is the case here. Habeas corpus is guarantee of liberty, not channel for drawing our Court into the day-to-day management of prison. [19] Rather than bringing this application to this Court, the applicants should have followed the grievance process on the issue of housing assignments. Richer knows full well the process as he followed it in 2007. In his letter to Brenda LePage of June 15, 2013, Richer enclosed copy of the first-level grievance response he received when he grieved decision in 2007. It is not that Richer does not know the proper procedure; he has chosen not to follow it as he finds the grievance process frustrating and time consuming. It may very well be all those things, but it is process that must be followed as opposed to applying to this Court for remedy. The grievance process must be followed by the applicants with view to eventually bringing judicial review application to the Federal Court if no favourable responses are obtained by them before then. [20] In the event the Court had assumed jurisdiction over this habeas corpus application, the application for habeas corpus would have failed in any event. On the materials before the Court, the applicants have not established any deprivation of liberty, and the respondent has established that any possible deprivation of liberty is lawful. Not every constraint on an inmate amounts to “deprivation of liberty”. Conclusion [21] For all the reasons as outlined in this decision, the application of the applicants is dismissed with costs to be taxed. J. M. L.

Saskatoon Appeal File: 1890 Reasons by: The Honourable Mr. Justice Tallis In concurrence: The Honourable Chief Justice Bayda and The Honourable Madam Justice Jackson Tallis J.A. The defendant Margaret Bennett appeals from a judgment for damages pronounced in Queen\'s Bench. Following a jury trial of this action for damages for personal injuries and loss sustained in an automobile collision, judgment was pronounced on 13 May 1994 awarding damages of $409,251.18 to the respondent plaintiff. Since liability was admitted by the defendant (appellant) the trial was limited to assessment of damages by the jury. As starting point we recite the verdict form and the jury's answers to the questions submitted to them:[1] A. NON-PECUNIARY DAMAGES: 1. At what amount do you assess the non-pecuniary loss of the Plaintiff, for pain and suffering and loss of enjoyment of life? 60,000.00 2. At what amount, if any, do you assess the Plaintiff's past loss of homemaking 0.00 B. PECUNIARY DAMAGES: 1. At what amount, if any, do you assess the Plaintiff's past loss of earnings. 1,568.00 2. At what amount, if any, do you assess the Plaintiff's future loss of earnings. $337,130.00 3. At what amount, if any, do you assess the Plaintiff's future loss of homemaking 5,000.00 The parties agreed to special damages of $5,553.18. Accordingly, the learned trial judge directed that judgment be entered for $409,251.18 together with pre-judgment interest of $16,686.00 for total of $425,937.18. The appellant limits her challenge to the ""future loss of earnings"" component in the amount of $337,130.00. In her cross-appeal the respondent challenges the trial judge\'s instruction to deduct sick leave benefits which were used in consequence of her injuries from the past loss of earnings component. GROUNDS OF APPEAL Appellant's counsel advances the following grounds of appeal: 1. The Learned Trial Judge erred in law in admitting the evidence of Douglas Kalesnikoff as expert opinion evidence which resulted in substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice. 2. The Learned Trial Judge erred in law in failing to caution the Jury regarding the weight to be given evidence of Douglas Kalesnikoff. 3. The Jury's finding of the future loss of income capacity was so inordinately high that it is perverse, wholly out of all proportion, unsupported by the evidence and unreasonable. We note that in the absence of agreement between the parties this Court has no jurisdiction to assess the damages, should it be decided that the award cannot stand. Since there is no such agreement, we are limited to dismissing the appeal or ordering new trial if we find merit in the appeal: see Quintal v. Datta, 1988 CanLII 5084 (SK CA), [1988] W.W.R. 481 (Sask. C.A.) and Rieger v. Burgess, 1988 CanLII 209 (SK CA), [1988] W.W.R. 577 (Sask. C.A.). FACTUAL BACKGROUND Since the appellant's complaints must be passed upon in factual and procedural context, we find it convenient to first review the relevant factual background. On 20 August 1990 the respondent Ruth Graff was injured while riding as passenger in the appellant's vehicle. This vehicle was involved in collision with the ""Thompson"" vehicle at the intersection of 22nd Street and Diefenbaker Drive in Saskatoon. At the time of trial Ruth Graff was 45 years of age. Following graduation from high school in 1967, she attended the College of Education for one year. She then moved to Vancouver where she met and married Art Graff. She and her husband have raised two children. Before the collision the respondent enjoyed excellent health. She was an industrious person who worked outside the home after the children attained school age. When the family moved to Saskatoon, she obtained employment as resident attendant or nursing aide in nursing home. She later attended Kelsey Institute where she realized her ambition to qualify as registered nurse. While studying at Kelsey, she worked on weekends to supplement the family income. Following her graduation as registered nurse in 1983, she first worked in that capacity at St. Anne's nursing home. After few months, she obtained employment at the Royal University Hospital. In July 1985 she obtained nursing position on the neuro-surgery ward and was so employed at the time of the collision. As result of the collision, she sustained multiple injuries including concussion, whiplash, fractured ribs, contusions and abrasions. She was rendered unconscious and remained in state of post-traumatic amnesia for approximately four hours. The most serious consequence was ""closed"" head injury. Although we will refer in more detail to the medical evidence, we observe that the respondent and her medical advisors attributed significant cognitive, emotional, behavioural and physical deficits to this traumatic brain injury. Ruth Graff returned to work approximately four months after the collision. At time of trial, she was still working as nurse at the University Hospital but testimony from number of fellow employees and medical advisors cast serious doubt on her ability to continue in nursing as career. This aspect of the evidence will be canvassed in greater detail when we consider the grounds of appeal. We now turn to consideration of the grounds of appeal. Ground Admissibility of Expert Opinion Evidence. This complaint must be considered in factual and procedural context. In calculating damages, it is assumed, that if the injured person had not been disabled, she would have continued to work and to receive salary or wages at periodic intervals until retirement, lay-off, disability or death. An award for impaired earning capacity is intended to compensate the injured person for the diminution of that stream of income. In theory the award could take the form of periodic payments but in this province it has traditionally taken the form of lump sum, paid at the conclusion of litigation.[2] The appropriate lump sum cannot be calculated without first examining the stream of income it purports to replace. The lost stream's length cannot be known with certainty; contingencies such as illness, death, disability or unemployment could intervene. However, not all contingencies are negative. Each annual instalment in the lost stream of income comprises several elements. The most significant is, of course, the actual salary or wage. In addition the employee may have enjoyed certain fringe benefits such as shift differential, sick leave credits, uniforms and various other entitlements that are often specified in collective bargaining agreement or contract of employment. However, the estimate of loss from diminished earning capacity in the future need not be based solely on the salary which person was earning at the time of her injury. With the passage of time an individual often becomes more valuable to her employer. To reflect this heightened value, she will often receive ""seniority"" or ""experience"" raises or even promotions. Furthermore, the salary or wages of class of employees may increase over time even in theoretical inflation-free economy. Although the notion of damage award representing the present value of the lost stream of earnings engages some far-reaching economic considerations and contingencies, the two basic elements that determine its calculation can be stated. They are: (1) the amount that the person would have earned during each year she could have been expected to work after the injury; and (2) the appropriate discount rate, reflecting the essentially risk-free available investment. Even in an inflation-free economy the award for damages to replace the lost stream of income cannot be calculated simply by totalling the sum of periodic payments. When the lump sum award is notionally invested, it will earn additional money. Accordingly, where it is reasonable to suppose that interest may be earned on the award, if invested, the ascertained future benefits must be discounted in calculating the award. Speaking generally, the trier of fact will consider the various contingencies in estimating the amount that the person would have earned but for the injuries, and apply the controlling rate to each of the estimated instalments in the lost stream of income and then add up the discounted instalments to determine the total award. In this case, the plaintiff Ruth Graff was still working at the time of trial as registered nurse at the University Hospital. However, there was evidence before the jury that her nursing career was in serious jeopardy. This appeal was argued on the footing that loss of future earnings was the functional equivalent of loss of future earning capacity. The terms were used interchangeably at various times but, since no issue was raised, we simply refer to our discussion of this question in Seip v. South Saskatchewan Hospital Centre (1992), 1992 CanLII 8228 (SK CA), 97 Sask. R. 39 at 54 to 60. In the case now under consideration the question posed to the jury focused on the plaintiff's future loss of earnings, although the trial testimony was primarily directed to ""loss of earning capacity"". In Andrews et al v. Grand Toy Alberta et al, 1978 CanLII (SCC), [1978] S.C.R. 229 at 251 Dickson J. (as he then was) articulated loss of earning capacity in this way: We must now gaze more deeply into the crystal ball. What sort of career would the accident victim have had? What were his prospects and potential prior to the accident? It is not loss of earnings but, rather loss of earning capacity for which compensation must be made: The Queen v. Jennings, supra. capital asset has been lost: what was its value? This approach was applied in Earnshaw v. Despins (1990), 1990 CanLII 596 (BC CA), 45 B.C.L.R. (2d) 380 (C.A.) at 399 where Southin J.A. stated: In my opinion, the true questions the jury must address in claim such as this are: 1. Has the plaintiff's earning capacity been impaired to any degree by his injuries? 2. If so, what amount in the light of all the evidence should be awarded for that impairment? ... In catastrophic injury cases, the whole of the capital asset is lost. But there may be much less serious injuries which cause permanent impairment although the loss cannot be determined with any degree of exactitude. In Pallos v. Insurance Corp. of British Columbia (1995), 1995 CanLII 2871 (BC CA), 100 B.C.L.R. (2d) 260 (C.A.) Finch J.A. writing for the majority expressed the test for loss of income earning capacity in this way at pages 269-271: ... The plaintiff's claim in this case, properly considered, is that he has permanent injury, and permanent pain, which limit him in his capacity to perform certain activities and which, therefore, impair his income earning capacity. The loss of capacity has been suffered even though he is still employed by his pre-accident employer, and may continue to be so employed indefinitely. ... In sum, there is no clear medical evidence that the plaintiff has diminished ability to earn income in the future, or, if so, the extent to which that ability is diminished. On the other hand, there is uncontradicted medical evidence of partial permanent physical disability which could have an effect on his capacity to work, and on his employability. would conclude that his earning capacity had not been reduced, even though he presently earns more than he did before he was injured. Applying the test referred to in Kwei v. Boisclair (supra) to the uncontradicted medical evidence and the plaintiff's work history, think the only reasonable conclusion is that the plaintiff was rendered: less capable from earning income from all types of employment; less attractive as potential employee to new employers; unable to take advantage of all job opportunities previously open to him; and less valuable to himself, as person capable of earning income in competitive labour market. Given the appellant's position at trial and on appeal we assume that the trial proceeded on the footing that the final assessment of damages would be the same regardless of terminology or approach. However, in future cases of this nature consideration might well be given to jury question that focuses on ""loss of earning capacity"" rather than ""future loss of earnings"". In laying the foundation for the ""loss of future earnings"" component, learned counsel supplemented the plaintiff's oral testimony concerning her work record with relevant documentary evidence that included: 1. past payroll records from Royal University Hospital for the period from 19 August 1990 to 29 December 1990 with particulars of hours and sick leave benefits; 2. copies of collective bargaining agreements between Saskatchewan Union of Nurses and Health Care Association; 3. 1990 calendar documenting schedule shifts of the plaintiff; and 4. income tax returns of the plaintiff for years 1988 to 1993. Following this background testimony counsel for the respondent plaintiff called Mr. D. Kalesnikoff, chartered accountant (and forensic accountant), to calculate the future income stream based on present value earnings. Since the parties called no expert evidence concerning predicted future rates of inflation, the interest rate that could be appropriately used to discount future earnings to present value, or the possible connection between inflation rates and interest rates, Queen's Bench Rule 284B governs. It reads in pertinent part: 284B(1) Except where there is evidence to the contrary: (a) the life expectancy of an individual as set forth in the table in Form 23A is admissible in evidence; (b) three per cent per annum is admissible in evidence as the rate of interest to be used in determining the capitalized value of an award in respect of future pecuniary damages to the extent that it reflects the difference between estimated investment and price inflation rates; and (c) the value of one dollar per year as set forth by the respective periods shown in Form 23B, is admissible in evidence. (3) Notwithstanding Subrule (1), Form 23A is not conclusive as to life expectancy and the health and habits of the individual and any other relevant fact or circumstance may be considered by the court in determining life expectancy. This Rule was enacted to avoid the cost of calling actuarial evidence on such matters. It was clearly designed as cost saving measure in the litigation process in Queen's Bench and enables counsel to put forward calculations based on proffered factual underpinnings. We refer to the following passage in Seip, supra at p. 55 (paragraph 25) to illustrate its application: At trial plaintiff's counsel made the following written submission: ""(ii) Future Loss of Income ""Elaine is presently 35 years old. If we assume normal retirement age of 65 years, Elaine has working life expectancy of 28 years. If we utilize the approved discount of 3%, loss of future income is calculated as follows: Annual Income for Step Nurse $19.53 40 hours 52 weeks $40,622.40 19.02074 (present value of $1 using 3% discount rate over 28 years) $40,622.40 ""We rely upon rule 284B of the Rules of Court for the approved discount rate and life expectancy. In the absence of evidence to the contrary, rule 284B provides that 3% is an approved discount rate, (real investment rate or the difference between historical investment rates and inflation rates). The Supreme Court of Canada approved this method of calculating future loss of income in Andrews, supra. We admit the Form 23A 23B tables into evidence as provided by rule 284B. ""If we assume that Elaine can work three days per week, five hours per day, at salary of $700 per month (Weight Loss Centre income) her revised future loss of income is calculated as follows: Lost Annual Nursing Income $40,622.40 Weight Loss Centre Income 8,400.00 Balance: $32,222.40 x19.02074 Revised Future Income Loss: 612,893.89 ""The assumption that Elaine can work three days per week, five hours per day, is highly optimistic, given her post injury work record and the opinion of Margaret Friesen that, in many ways, she is presently working beyond her physical capabilities. Also, her present job may not continue indefinitely."" Before this Court, learned counsel advanced the same argument although he conceded that minor deduction in the neighbourhood of 10 to 15% for contingencies should be made when computing the final figure. In attacking the award of $75,000 learned counsel took the mathematical calculation of $612,893.89 as starting point and then contended that the trial judge had effectively made an 88% deduction for contingencies. In making his calculations Mr. Kalesnikoff utilized Queen's Bench Table 23A and 23B for life expectancy and discount rates. For convenience we reproduce the tabulation prepared by Mr. Kalesnikoff.[3] Ruth Graff Present Value of Future Earnings Capacity Adjusted for Mortality May 1, 1994 to December 31, 2013 Earnings assumed to occur at the midpoint of each period Earnings Discount Adjustment Discounted Age Annual Number of for the Factor for Earnings Cumulative Year Dec Earnings Months Year @3% Mortality Capacity Total 1994 46 43,500 29,000 .9901 .99790 28,653 28,653 1995 47 43,500 12 43,500 .9662 .99558 41,844 70,497 1996 48 43,500 12 43,500 .9381 .99303 40,522 111,019 1997 49 43,500 12 43,500 .9108 .99022 39,232 150,250 1998 50 43,500 12 43,500 .8843 .98713 37,971 188,221 1999 51 43,500 12 43,500 .8585 .98374 36,740 224,961 2000 52 43,500 12 43,500 .8336 .98004 35,536 260,497 2001 53 43,500 12 43,500 .8093 .97601 34,360 294,858 2002 54 43,500 12 43,500 .7858 .97165 33,211 328,069 2003 55 43,500 12 43,500 .7629 .96692 32,088 360,157 2004 56 43,500 12 43,500 .7407 .96179 30,989 391,146 2005 57 43,500 12 43,500 .7191 .95623 29,913 421,060 2006 58 43,500 12 43,500 .6982 .95018 28,859 449,919 2007 59 43,500 12 43,500 .6779 .94364 27,826 477,745 2008 60 43,500 12 43,500 .6582 .93655 26,814 504,559 2009 61 43,500 12 43,500 .6390 .92886 25,820 530,378 2010 62 43,500 12 43,500 .6204 .92051 24,843 555,221 2011 63 43,500 12 43,500 .6024 .91144 23,882 579,103 2012 64 43,500 12 43,500 .5848 .90164 22,938 602,041 2013 65 43,500 12 43,500 .5678 .89103 22,009 624,050 Total 624,050 Although learned counsel for the appellant objected to the admissibility of this tabulation, the learned trial judge admitted it into evidence before the jury. Learned counsel challenges the admissibility of this tabulation and Mr. Kalesnikoff's analysis of it on the ground that it was admitted into evidence with the label of expert opinion attached to it. She contends that Mr. Kalesnikoff was permitted to present under the ""guise"" of expert opinion evidence what was essentially mathematical calculation matter that does not require the services of an expert forensic accountant. In the circumstances of this case, she contends that he was not bringing any expert opinion evidence to assist the jury in making factual determinations and accordingly should have not affixed his imprimatur as an expert to P16. Learned counsel for the appellant accepts that expert witnesses may be able to assist the jury in certain cases where the assessment of the loss is complicated: see Engel v. Salyn, 1993 CanLII 152 (SCC), [1993] S.C.R. 306 at 313. However, in this case she stresses the relative ease with which the calculation can be made and submitted that the plaintiff's argument on future loss of income should not have been put to the jury in the guise of expert testimony. When dealing with the admissibility issue the learned trial judge recognized the need to control the scope of Mr. Kalesnikoff's testimony. During his introductory testimony Mr. Kalisnikoff testified as to his expertise in calculating economic loss. But he was not permitted to range into fields that were essentially for the jury. Although the trial judge permitted the witness to testify as to certain mathematical calculations and place them before the jury (Exhibit P-16), the judge restricted this testimony. This is made clear in the text of his ruling.[4] Yes, considered the briefs, and as the determination of percentage of disability is technical and medical matter, and as no such evidence has been brought before the Court, it would be inappropriate for Mr. Kalesnikoff to provide calculations provide calculating assistance, which he's clearly capable of providing, as it might tend to confuse the jury as to the state of the evidence. don't think he should be suggesting level of disability in respect of which there has been no testimony. Also, there has been no evidence of future incapacity to earn income of specific nature. The plaintiff has worked, apparently to the satisfaction of her employers, for three and half years, and I've heard no evidence that she could not continue, although she has testified as to her discomfort. As well, if ever she left the present employment there is every possibility that this competent woman would be able to continue to provide useful service as nurse of another type. She is on the evidence far from being totally disabled. Accordingly, would consider testimony on the assumption that she is totally disabled to be inadmissible, as the need of the jury for assistance in that area has not been demonstrated. The housekeeping capacity is in about the same situation. We have no testimony as to what these duties amount to, how long they would take, et cetera. How then can Mr. Kalesnikoff testify without suggesting scenario, scenario which is not, until now at least, supported by any evidence other than that of the plaintiff's discomfort? Accordingly, would place severe restrictions on Mr. Kalesnikoff. don't challenge his professional capabilities. don't think Ms. Prisciak challenges his professional capabilities in any way. MS. PRISCIAK: No, My Lord. THE COURT: She is merely seeking to avoid the presentation of argument through the mouth of this witness, and there is tendency once person is established as an expert, to accept the fact that his expertise extends perhaps to deciding how much housekeeping house needs, which he hasn't claimed any expertise on at all. So in that sense would accept the argument of Ms. Prisciak, and reject testimony, although haven't seen the report that's to be testified upon. have no doubt it's on the Court file, but didn't have it before me. Consequently, I'm not just sure whether I've excluded all of the evidence that was to be tendered, or just part of it. The tabulation (P-16) and explanatory testimony did not go far beyond the limited scope of mathematical calculation permitted by the learned trial judge. Accordingly the admission of this evidence did not impermissibly invade the province of the jury in this damage assessment. This point was clearly established in the following cross-examination of Mr. Kalesnikoff.[5] Mr. Kalesnikoff, when you were doing ‑‑ you've made number of calculations, one was for the past loss of income and one was for the future loss of income? If could clarify, did calculation on the past loss of earnings capacity. On the future, the calculation that I've done is the present value of the earnings capacity, not the loss, the loss is another matter. Right, the loss is matter for the jury to decide? Exactly. There is no dispute as to the criteria for expert testimony. In Roberge v. Bolduc, 1991 CanLII 83 (SCC), [1991] S.C.R. 374 L'Heureux-Dube J. states at p. 429: In my view, the trial judge was right. Expert evidence is admissible provided that the expert is qualified and his or her testimony is necessary or useful to assist the court in the determination of technical or scientific matters. In the straightforward circumstances of this case, the ""expert"" services of chartered accountant"" or ""forensic"" accountant were not required to make the calculations that were placed before the jury. Given the Queen's Bench Tables and the documentary evidence, these calculations did not require expert opinion evidence. Accordingly, the tabulation could have been made in much the same way as in Seip, supra. Although Mr. Kalesnikoff made the calculations in P-16, we cannot characterize his testimony as ""expert opinion"" evidence in this case. Accordingly the tabulation was not objectionable because similar calculations could have been made by counsel or the trial judge: See C.L. Smith and J.C. Bouck, Civil Jury Instructions (Vancouver: Continuing Legal Education Society of British Columbia 1994) CIVJI 9.32. In this case the calculations involved relatively simple mathematics. Tabulations of this nature could easily be prepared in advance and tendered pursuant to pre-trial stipulation. Furthermore one should not overlook the availability of computer programs for this purpose. We observe that in Shuparksi v. Mair (N.W.T.S.C. January 18, 1995) Hetherington J.A. relied on software program (Support Works 1.0) to assist her in calculating the effect of interest on child support payments payable by the respondent. Given the nature of the case before us, we reject the appellant's contention that the admission of the tabulation and explanation of it by Mr. Kalesnikoff resulted in any miscarriage of justice. No substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice has been demonstrated but in the circumstances of this case, we would, if necessary, invoke Rule 39 with respect to any alleged error: see Terrie's Plumbing Heating Ltd. v. Grosvenor Fine Furniture (1982) Ltd., 1993 CanLII 6611 (SK CA), [1994] W.W.R. 275 (Leave to S.C.C. denied January 26, 1994). We reject the appellant\'s first ground of appeal. Before parting from this issue, we observe that the taxation of expert witness fees is not before us. However, this question should not be overlooked in taxing costs because the services involved in case of this nature do not merit the assessment of expert witness fees. GROUND The Learned Trial Judge erred in law in failing to caution the Jury regarding the weight to be given evidence of Douglas Kalesnikoff. The appellant contends that the learned trial judge should have specifically directed the jury on the limited purpose for which Mr. Kalesnikoff's testimony could be used as well as the weight that might be given to it. In dealing with this aspect of the case the trial judge gave the following instructions:[6] will deal in specific terms with the award you may be making in this case in moment, but first want to give you some specific advice which will be relevant if you decide to compensate the plaintiff for loss of income‑earning capacity. Her loss of future income, or her loss of future income‑earning capacity will be determined by first the degree of her disability, the extent to which she will in the future see her income reduced as result of her injury. Secondly, the length of her working life expectancy. This is drawn from actuarial tables, and is statistical average. The discount rate of interest, this is, in effect, discount from bulk award to offset the value of the interest which lump sum payment could earn over the period of her working life. believe the report of Mr. Kalesnikoff will be of assistance in deciding how to make this calculation. Other contingencies: there are contingencies in life, illness, job loss, accident, can reduce earning capacity. Some times if these risks in every day economic life are taken into consideration, small percentage deduction from the gross or net award of pecuniary damages is made. You must remember, however, that such risks are often insured against through unemployment insurance or other protective programs, so that the adjustment is usually not large percentage. suggest that the precedents would support in this case, where mortality has already been considered, deduction in the order of 10 to 12 per cent. This instruction was followed with review of the relevant evidence. The learned trial judge left the truth of the respondent's post injury history for the jury to determine. From reading the charge as whole, he made it clear that the weight of the respondent's evidence as well as the supporting medical and non-medical evidence was solely for the jury. Although the trial judge did not specifically focus on the need to weigh and consider the assumptions underlying Mr. Kalesnikoff's calculations, we find no reversible error in the circumstances of this case. It would have been preferable for the trial judge to have instructed the jury as to the importance of their primary findings of fact, as necessary foundation for their making any calculations or assessment; however any such deficiency was canvassed by learned counsel for the respondent. We refer in particular to the following passages reproduced from Mr. Halyk's address to the jury:[7] Now with respect to what the nurses said who worked with Ruth with respect to her ability to continue in the future, and if there is any one person in this room who wants to continue working in the future it's Ruth Graff, think she told you that, she would like to continue working. The other side of the coin is, and the important side of the coin is, can she continue working as nurse, and my respectful submission, as the evidence indicates with the greatest of respect to Ruth, that that's not very likely that she's going to be able to continue working. Now whether she can get through another month, another six months, another year, don't know. guess that's what you people have to decide, because it's important you decide what the probability is. Nobody, don't think, can predict the future, at least nobody in this room, with total accuracy, and that's why what you have to look at is the probability, the simple probability as to whether she will be able to keep working. If it's probable that she will not be able to keep working her normal life working expectancy, then she is entitled to an award, she is entitled to be compensated, and that's why we had the evidence of Mr. Kalesnikoff, so you don't have to go into the jury room and start pulling numbers out of the air. We have tried to help you by giving you the appropriate numbers. Now how you apply those numbers is entirely up to you as to whether ‑‑ if it was worst case scenario and something over $600,000.00, if she couldn't work from now until 65, that's what she would be entitled to, and entitled to in law in every sense of the word, but if you say, no, she'll be able to get through another year or two, then it's something less and the tables will help you. If you say not only that, but, sure, she's not going to be able to work as nurse any more, because the evidence is pretty clear, the probability of that is pretty remote that she will be able to work as nurse, but we think she should go and do something else, maybe she could work in some other type of facility, she's not going to earn the same kind of money or whatever else, then you plug that in, and that's why we helped you, we thought, we tried to help you with the evidence from Mr. Kalesnikoff again. It's simply if you say, well, she'll earn two‑thirds less the rest of her life and she'll be able to work until 55 instead of 65, well, you can just take those figures and make the appropriate adjustments, but that is the key part of this case, with the greatest of respect, your decision as to the future loss of earnings, or the probability of future loss of earnings is the key to the whole thing in terms of the appropriate award in terms of the large amounts of money that Ruth Graff is entitled to. We reject this ground of appeal because any alleged non-direction does not amount to reversible error. GROUND The Jury's finding of the future loss of income capacity was so inordinately high that it is perverse, wholly out of all proportion, unsupported by the evidence and unreasonable. The controlling standard of review with respect to damage awards has been expounded in number of cases in this province. For the purposes of this appeal we need only refer to Seip, supra, where the Court stated at pp. 43 44 and 59: The principles that should be observed by an appellate court in deciding whether it is justified in disturbing the finding of court of first instance as to quantum of damages were articulated by Viscount Simon in Nance v. British Columbia Electric Railway Co. Ltd., 1951 CanLII 374 (UK JCPC), [1951] A.C. 601; [1951] All E.R. 448; [1951] All E.R. 448; [1951] D.L.R. 705; W.W.R. (N.S.) 665; 67 C.R.T.C. 340 at 613-614: ""Their Lordships now turn to the question of quantum of damages. As already stated, the jury awarded the plaintiff $35,000. The three members of the British Columbia Court of Appeal were unanimous, for different reasons, in holding that this figure could not stand. The Chief Justice was for reducing it to $20,000 (subject to further reduction to $12,000.00 in respect of contributory negligence which he found proved); Sidney Smith, J.A., who did not find contributory negligence proved, would have awarded $12,000; and O'Halloran, J.A. would have left the figure to be determined at new trial on materials more adequate than those available at the actual trial. ""In those circumstances two distinct questions arise: (1) What principles should be observed by an appellate court in deciding whether it is justified in disturbing the finding of the court of first instance as to the quantum of damages; more particularly when the finding is that of jury, as in the present case. (2) What principles should govern the assessment of the quantum of damages by the tribunal of first instance itself. (1) The principles which apply under this head are not in doubt. Whether the assessment of damages be by judge or jury, the appellate court is not justified in substituting figure of its own for that awarded below simply because it would have awarded different figure if it had tried the case at first instance. Even if the tribunal of first instance was judge sitting alone, then, before the appellate court can properly intervene, it must be satisfied either that the judge, in assessing the damages, applied wrong principle of law (as by taking into account some irrelevant factor or leaving out of account some relevant one); or, short of this, that the amount awarded is either so inordinately low or so inordinately high that it must be wholly erroneous estimate of the damage (Flint v. Lovell, approved by the House of Lords in Davies v. Powell Duffryn Associated Collieries Ltd. The last named case further shows that when on proper direction the quantum is ascertained by jury, the disparity between the figure at which they have arrived and any figure at which they could properly have arrived must, to justify correction by court of appeal, be even wider than when the figure has been assessed by judge sitting alone. The figure must be wholly `out of all proportion'. (per Lord Wright, Davies v. Powell Duffryn Associated Collieries Ltd.)"" (footnotes omitted) [12] The ""Nance test"" has been adopted in Canada. In Bunce v. Flick et al., 1991 CanLII 7975 (SK CA), [1991] W.W.R. 623; 93 Sask R. 53; W.A.C. 53 (C.A.) Sherstobitoff, J.A., succinctly summed up the controlling principle in the following passage at p. 631: ""A court of appeal, before interfering with an award of damages, must be satisfied that it was `either so inordinately low or so inordinately high that it must be wholly erroneous estimate of the damage': Nance v. British Columbia Electric Railway 1951 CanLII 374 (UK JCPC), [1951] A.C. 601; [1951] All E.R. 448; W.W.R.(N.S.) 665; 67 C.R.T.C. 340; [1951] D.L.R 705 (P.C.). It cannot act because its own view of the evidence would result in different conclusion. It can intervene only where there was no evidence upon which the judge could act, or where he acted upon mistake or wrong principle, or where the result was wholly erroneous. Woelk v. Halvorson, 1980 CanLII 17 (SCC), [1980] S.C.R. 430; [1981] W.W.R. 289; 14 C.C.L.T. 181; 114 D.L.R. (3d) 385; 24 A.R. 620; 33 N.R. 232 and Watkins v. Olafson, [1989 CanLII 36 (SCC), [1989] S.C.R. 750.]"" [36] In our opinion the learned trial judge was entitled to reject the pure mathematical approach propounded by the plaintiff. He was obliged to weigh and consider the various imponderables such as the availability of employment, the effect of Crohn's disease as well as other contingencies of life. In the circumstances of this case the cloak of mathematics cannot give an air of scientific accuracy to decision that is fundamentally one of judicial assessment rather than mere calculation. On the evidence adduced in this case, one cannot discard the ""crystal ball"" and opt for pure mathematical approach. [37] Although Keizer v. Hanna and Buch, 1978 CanLII 28 (SCC), [1978] S.C.R. 342; 19 N.R. 209; involved damages in fatal accident case, the following words of Dickson, J., at p. 351 are instructive: ""At the end of the day the only question of importance is whether, in all the circumstances, the final award is fair and adequate. As an initial matter, we observe that there is no suggestion in the record that the jury was attempting to give the plaintiff perfect compensation by making simple mathematical calculation: see for example Taylor v. University of Saskatchewan (1955), 1955 CanLII 208 (SK CA), 15 W.W.R. 459. (Sask. C.A.) If the jury had awarded $624,050.00, an amount equal to the present value of the plaintiff's total future earnings under the governing collective bargaining agreement, on the assumption that she would work to 65, then there would be serious question in light of Taylor, supra. However, the amount awarded was $337,130.00. It is fair inference that the jury considered the plaintiff's earning capacity to have been significantly diminished but not completely lost. In passing upon this ground of appeal we observe that there was non-medical and medical testimony of brain injury sequelae in the case of Ruth Graff. The weight of such evidence was question solely for the jury and in his instructions the learned trial judge left the issue with them. The instructions were not weighted in favour of the plaintiff. On fair reading of those instructions, one can say that the trial judge fairly raised the factors that had been stressed by counsel for the appellant when dealing with credibility of the various witnesses including the plaintiff and her co-workers. The trial testimony focused not so much on the physical and motor sequelae as on other sequelae. The medical history stressed the cognitive sequelae and the non-medical testimony of co-workers and others emphasized the behavioural and emotional sequelae. Six medical doctors testified about their roles in Ruth Graff's treatment and about her medical problems. Dr. L. Klein, neuro-surgeon who had seen her on 21 August 1990, the day following the collision, stated that based on his observations he concluded that she had sustained moderate to severe head injury.[8] Dr. P. Davidson, neurologist who attended her on 25 February 1991, observed that her problems with poor memory, weak concentration and attention, and easy distractibility were consistent with head injury sustained in an automobile collision. Dr. Davidson testified that people who become unconscious at the outset of an injury, as had Ruth Graff, are much less likely to recover from their injury with the passage of time.[9] Dr. Boey, general practitioner, testified about the symptoms of forgetfulness, poor concentration and difficulty expressing herself outlined to him by Ruth Graff on 29 January 1991. Dr. S. Paniak, clinical neuropsychologist whose expertise is in the diagnosis, assessment and treatment of the effects of brain injury on behaviour and thinking, examined Ruth Graff on 24 and 25 April 1991 and again two years after the collision on 22 August 1992. In his testimony at trial he primarily focused on the cognitive sequelae. His first evaluation demonstrated significant deficits in the areas of divided attention (the ability to consider two or more pieces of information at time), of incidental memory (the ability to remember new information spontaneously), and of problem solving and reasoning. In addition, Ruth Graff suffered from fatigue and was more susceptible to anger and stress. Dr. Paniak re-examined her on 22 August 1992. He testified that once two years elapse, patients are unlikely to recover further from the effects of brain injury.[10] Two years post-injury is generally when deficits are considered permanent after this type of head injury. During his last examination Dr. Paniak found that Ruth Graff's ability to express herself and to think quickly and efficiently and her incidental memory all showed improvement. However, she continued to suffer from emotional sequelae an inability to control her emotions. He testified that her powers of concentration and rapid thought were permanently impaired and her problem solving and reasoning skills, were, as compared to people of similar age and education, ""almost off the bottom of the scale"". In dealing with the vocational aspects of her employment, Dr. Paniak testified that it would undermine her work performance. He pointed out that she might exhibit these deficiencies less in low stress, part-time nursing position. The testimony of the other two medical practitioners called as witnesses was consistent with the medical testimony of their colleagues. Five of Ruth Graff's co-workers in nursing at the hospital gave evidence of her pre-injury state and decreased competence as nurse following the injury. Each of them testified in detail as to her capable nursing skills before the injury. During their testimony serious questions were raised about her ability to continue as nurse. This concern was reflected and illustrated in the following testimony of Ms. Shawna Lewis:[11] Ruth isn't the same person any more. Where she was very talkative, outgoing, energetic person she is more on the withdrawn side. She is very emotionally labile. You can be talking to her one moment and in the next moment she is crying for no apparent reason. She panics easily. In stressful situations she would previously be able to priorize her care and change it and do whatever needed to be done for these people. Now she becomes very frustrated. She flies off the handle quite easily with patients and other staff members. She is forgetful at times. You can be giving her report on patient and you know she is not paying attention to you, she is asking you the same questions you've already answered. Physically, she seems like she is tired all the time. She falls behind in her work, leaving the rest of us to pick up the slack. do not believe that she is safe worker, and would not want her taking care of one of my family members now. During their testimony her co-workers referred to errors in her work and acknowledged covering for those errors. As well, Ruth Graff and her sister-in-law Sharon Woytiuk testified about post-injury effects. In this case, the appellant did not call any medical evidence to contradict the testimony of the plaintiff's medical witnesses. This is significant because under s. 50(1) of The Queen's Bench Act, defendant may apply for an ""independent"" medical examination and later apply to have that medical examiner called as witness under the provisions of s. 50(7).[12] The jury was required to weigh and consider both the medical and non-medical testimony. Learned counsel for the defendant stressed the issue of credibility and the need to determine the truth of Ruth Graff's testimony to the effect that her alleged problems were attributable to the injuries sustained in the collision. At the end of the day this issue and the consequent assessment of her losses fell to be determined by the jury. It is fair inference from the record that the jury accepted the testimony of Ruth Graff and witnesses called on her behalf. The jury could not have assessed the ""future loss of earnings"" at $337,130.00 unless they accepted the evidence that she had suffered significant loss of earning capacity. The trial record discloses ample evidence to support this finding. Applying the controlling standard of review, we cannot say that the award in issue was so inordinately high that it must be set aside and a new trial ordered. The principles stated by the Supreme Court of Canada in Warren v. Gray Goose Stage Ltd., 1937 CanLII 52 (SCC), [1938] S.C.R. 52 are apposite. In that ""closed"" head injury case, this Court allowed an appeal on the ground that the general damage award was excessive. On further appeal the Supreme Court restored the jury award and in the following passages at (pp. 55-57), it emphasized the role of the jury: The main proposition advanced by counsel for the defendant before us was that on the evidence no causal relation is proved between the headaches and the accident that the evidence is so vague that it could not reasonably be concluded that the headaches were the direct result of the accident. But there was some evidence, if believed, sufficient to connect the headaches with the accident. The weight of the evidence was question solely for the jury and in an admirably clear and direct charge the learned trial judge put that question to the jury as ""the big question"" to be decided by them. If you find he was not suffering from headache before the accident and that he struck his head on the occasion in question against the back of the front seat of the car and has been suffering headaches since then, it would be fair inference that it was the blow on the head from the back of the front seat that caused them; and in that case the evidence of Dr. McConnell would be of some importance. But before using the evidence of Dr. McConnell at all you must find that the headaches did not exist before the accident and that he did not suffer from headaches before the accident. Because the evidence of Dr. McConnell is not going to be of any assistance to you in coming to conclusion as to whether he had these before or after. He says: ""Assuming the truth of his history""; that is, assuming the truth of what the plaintiff tells him, then he says: ""The condition found could be due to the accident"". But he also says ""The condition which found may have existed long before the accident."" So that as to whether he was suffering from those injuries before the accident or whether they commenced after the accident, the evidence of Dr. McConnell does not help you one way or the other. If you find they were non-existent before the accident, then you consider the evidence of Dr. McConnell he found the third ventricle was slightly larger than normal, that the left frontal region was abnormal, there was larger space than normal, and that they were liable to cause headaches. The jury could not have assessed the general damages at $5,000 unless they had accepted the plaintiff's evidence that the headaches were the direct result of the accident because the other complaints of the plaintiff were admittedly of trifling significance. The jury's finding of liability, affirmed as it was by the Court of Appeal, must stand. Once liability has been established, any views as to the weakness of the evidence regarded from the point of view of liability (the weight of which evidence, we repeat, was for the jury) must not influence the Court on the amount of compensation for the injuries. While it may be that the general damages were awarded on generous scale, there was no firm ground, in our opinion, on which the Court of Appeal was entitled to set aside the jury's assessment. This was essentially case for jury and it is quite impossible for the Court to say that the amount of the damages fixed by the jury was so large that the jury reviewing the whole of the evidence reasonably could not properly have arrived at that amount. Lord Wright in the House of Lords in Mechanical and General Inventions Co. v. Austin said: The appellate court is never the judge of fact in case where the constitutional judge of fact is the jury. For the appellate court to set aside the verdict of jury as being against the weight of evidence, merely because the court does not agree with it, would, in my judgment, be to usurp the functions of the jury and to substitute their own opinion for that of the jury: that would be quite wrong. Much more is necessary in order to justify the setting aside of jury's verdict where there is some evidence to support it. And at p. 377: The jury were, as the Lord Chancellor explains, properly directed and had all the facts fully before them. In considering their award on damages, that view of the evidence most favourable to their finding must be taken, not the view most adverse to it, if or where two views are competent. It is true that the damages awarded ran into big figures, but damages cannot be treated as excessive merely because they are large. Excess implies some standard which has been exceeded. The authorities are numerous but we might usefully refer to the judgment of the Privy Council in McHugh v. Union Bank of Canada. That was an Alberta case. Beck, J., sitting without jury, assessed the damages (a mortgagee's negligence case) at $2,800. The Albert court of appeal set aside the assessment but granted to the plaintiff the option to have it referred back to the clerk of the court at Calgary to take an account within prescribed limits of what damage, if any, the plaintiff had suffered by the negligence of the defendants. Upon appeal to this Court, the majority (Duff and Anglin JJ. dissenting) affirmed the order permitting reference at the plaintiff's option but varied the directions as to the mode of assessing the damages. Upon further appeal to the Privy Council, the assessment made by the trial judge was restored. Lord Moulton, who delivered the judgment of the Board, said at p. 309: The tribunal which has the duty of making such assessment, whether it be judge or jury, has often difficult task, but it must do it as best it can, and unless the conclusions to which it comes before the evidence before it are clearly erroneous they should not be interfered with on appeal, inasmuch as the courts of appeal have not the advantage of seeing the witnesses matter which is of grave importance in drawing conclusions as to quantum of damage from the evidence that they give. Their Lordships cannot see anything to justify them in coming to the conclusion that Beck's assessment of the damages is erroneous, and they are therefore of opinion that it ought not to have been disturbed on appeal. The importance of that case lies in the fact that the assessment had been made by the trial judge himself and the court of appeal had jurisdiction to rehear the case and to substitute their findings for his findings. But notwithstanding that both the court of appeal of Alberta and the Supreme Court of Canada had seen fit to set aside the assessment of damages made by the trial judge, the Privy Council restored the assessment. That course undoubtedly would not have been taken had the Privy Council not concluded that the two appellate courts below had erred in principle in interfering with the assessment made by the trial judge. In the case before us, however, the damages had been assessed by jury and the Court of Appeal had no jurisdiction in respect of the amount awarded to rehear the case and control the verdict of the jury. The court is not court of review for that purpose. If, viewing the evidence as whole, the Court of Appeal can see plainly that the amount of damages is in law indefensible, or that the trial has been unsatisfactory by reason of misdirection or wrongful admission or rejection of evidence, or if it is demonstrable that the jury have or must have misunderstood the evidence or taken into account matters which could not legally affect their verdict, the court may grant new trial for the reassessment of the damages. Accordingly we reject this ground of appeal and dismiss the within appeal with costs on double column V. CROSS-APPEAL The respondent challenges the trial judge's ruling with respect to payment for sick leave credits used as result of the injury and contends that Cunningham v. Wheeler, 1994 CanLII 120 (SCC), [1994] S.C.R. 359 mandates full recovery for such loss. Although Mr. Morrison mounted an extensive argument for the respondent's position on this point, Mr. Halyk in his concluding remarks made it clear that his instructions from the respondent were to preserve the integrity of the jury award and not risk new trial over relatively minor sum when viewed in the context of this case as whole. In the light of that submission we do not find it necessary or advisable to deal specifically with this point. Furthermore, on the facts of this case, there is real likelihood that the overall award includes some allowance for loss of number of accumulated sick days. In his instructions to the jury, the learned trial judge stated:[13] ... Her anticipated or probable future loss, if any, is something which you, assisted by some charts for calculation purposes, will have to work out. I'll say more about this in moment. It is possible, too, that you will wish to award something for the loss of number of accumulated sick days, and while it is quite clear, think, that accumulated sick days do not have the same value as full day's pay, you may wish to give consideration to awarding some amount as compensation for the loss of those days. During the course of their deliberations, the jury asked question concerning disability benefits. It was doubtful that this question was intended to refer in any way to sick leave benefits but in the discussion between the presiding judge and counsel reference was made to sick leave. In order to place the matter in perspective we reproduce the following extract from the record:[14] THE COURT: guess you've received copy of the question that has been asked. My essential inclination is that the disability benefits would not be affected by the amount of an award that was made. Does anyone disagree with that? MS. PRISCIAK: No. THE COURT: All right. MR. HALYK: But, with respect, My Lord, think this is little broader issue by the question. It's an issue was trying to address earlier. This issue of disability benefits, they should be instructed it plays no part whatsoever either way with respect to the matter, that is, in terms of either reducing the award for ‑‑ THE COURT: They should ignore the disability benefits set out in the contract. MR. HALYK: Totally. THE COURT: Okay. I'll tell them that. Bring them in. MR. HALYK: In all respects. THE COURT: Well, I'm not going to mention sick leave, because we've already dealt with that. MR. HALYK: No but in ‑‑ what I'm saying is it shouldn't be considered in any respect of anything in terms of their award. THE COURT: Okay. Well, think ‑‑ I'm not sure there is any other respect but what they're asking here is there? MR. HALYK: Well, here ‑‑ they're asking here, are disability benefits as outlined in the Collective Agreement reduced by the award, in other words what they want to know is if the award of damages here will affect her disability benefits. THE COURT: Yes. Well, the answer is no. MR. HALYK: But the other side of the coin is, should they consider in future award the disability benefits she might receive. In other words, the reverse. THE COURT: Oh, okay, well, we'll cover that, too. MS. PRISCIAK: But that's not the question, My Lord, mean the question is very straightforward. THE COURT: Yes, I'll just answer the question, but will probably tuck something in along the lines that you mentioned. MR. HALYK: Just no either way in any situation. THE COURT: Well, bring them in. MR. HALYK: Anyway, whatever. THE COURT: have been asked the question, Are disability benefits as outlined in the Collective Agreement reduced by the award of damages for future loss of earnings?"" The answer is no, the disability benefits in the contract should not affect your order, nor will your order affect the disability benefits. Unless there is something else, that's what we were called for. In the circumstances of this case, we need say no more about this issue. In light of Mr. Halyk\'s submission we dismiss the cross-appeal without costs. DATED at the City of Regina, in the Province of Saskatchewan, this 25th day of August, A.D. 1995.

Murphy for the appellant Denise C. Smith for the respondent Appeal Heard: January 23, 1992 Judgment Delivered: January 23, 1992 THE COURT: Leave to appeal permitted, the appeal allowed, the conviction set aside and new trial ordered per oral reasons for judgment of Matthews, J.A.; Clarke, C.J.N.S. and Freeman, J.A. concurring. The reasons for judgment were delivered orally by: MATTHEWS, J.A.: The appellant, on March 26, 1991, was found guilty of break and enter into lobster car situate at Metaghan wharf and the theft of lobsters therefrom. He now appeals from that conviction. The main issue on appeal is whether the trial judge erred in admitting into evidence a statement by the appellant to an R.C.M. Police officer without holding a voir dire. The constable made notes of conversation he had with the appellant respecting some of the circumstances surrounding the offence. The trial judge agreed with the submission of Crown counsel that the conversation should not be admitted into evidence because of an alleged inducement. Whether Crown counsel was correct in his submission is not in issue on this appeal. There was no voir dire held to determine if the statement was voluntary. The trial judge refused to permit the constable to read his notes into the record however, over the objection of defence counsel the constable did testify as follows: ""CORPORAL OLDFORD: Okay, following my conversation with Kevin Doucet had talked with Meteghan R.C.M.P. members, mainly Constables Turcotte and Doucette and informed them of several places that they should look for stolen lobsters and informed them of numerous people that had purchased the lobsters based on the information that had received. further advised them of the price that was paid for the lobster and the quantity of lobsters purchased. Further to that advised them of the time of day the lobster were purchased and for some parties the location the purchase was made. also advised him at the same time that my information was that there were axes used in the commission of the offence that were in the ocean, in the water near the scene and also informed them that crates the lobsters had been in are in the ocean and that the lobsters had been sold live to certain people and had addresses for some of the people. None of which knew myself, didn't know any of the people."" The trial judge in effect permitted into evidence what he previously said he would not allow: the conversation between the constable and the appellant. That should not have been done without a voir dire to determine if the statement was voluntary. See Erven v. The Queen (1978), 1978 CanLII 19 (SCC), 44 C.C.C. (2d) 76 (S.C.C.) 25 N.R. 49. In rendering his decision the trial judge said: ""The evidence of the Crown witnesses also establish that there was an axe found in the water by Corporal. Brian Oldford of the Ident Section and it's been established by exhibit here today that the paint samples taken from the axe as well as from the door would indicate that the axe was used to gain access to the lobster car and thus to the amount of lobsters in the car floating near the wharf at Meteghan, Digby County, Nova Scotia."" ... ""The crucial evidence think that comes out in cross examination is the tying in of the axe from Corporal Oldford and the finding of the axe in the water near the car which was found as result of conversation with Corporal Oldford and the defendant, Kevin Doucet. ... I'm satisfied by this tying in of the axe through Doucet through Corporal Oldford that Mr. Doucet was in fact the person who did break and enter the certain place, to wit, the lobster car at Meteghan wharf and did commit the indictable offence of theft and find him guilty of the offence as charged."" In fact the axe was not found in the water by Corporal Oldford or as result of his conversation with the appellant. It was found there by the owner of the lobster car before that conversation took place. That the trial judge misconstrued that and other evidence is not the only problem. The fact is that he relied upon the inadmissible conversation between Corporal Oldford and the appellant which he termed crucial, to reach his conclusion of guilt. In doing so he erred. We permit leave to appeal, allow the appeal, set aside the conviction and order a new trial. J.A. Concurred in: Clarke, C.J.N.S. Freeman, J.A.

The girl was 11 years old when the alleged assaults began.
The complainant said that the sexual activities started out as fondling and eventually to full sexual intercourse.
The complainant also testified that the appellant had intercourse with her at a cottage.

IN THE QUEEN'S BENCH FAMILY LAW DIVISION JUDICIAL CENTRE OF SASKATOON IN THE MATTER OF AN APPLICATION UNDER THE CHILD AND FAMILY SERVICES ACT IN RESPECT OF: [C.C.], born February 24, 1992 Leslie Belloc-Pinder for the Department of Social Services Nicholas Stooshinoff for the mother Graham Dove for the father JUDGMENT BLACKLOCK LINN J. September 26, 1996 This hearing concerns the future of a four and one-half year old girl, [C.C.], who is presently infoster care. The Department is requesting a permanent orderpursuant to s. 37(2) of The Child and Family Services Act,S.S. 1989-90, c. C-7.2. The parents would like to have thechild returned to their care, or alternatively, to have thechild remain with the present foster family on a long-termbasis. The parents, [L.C.] and [J.C.], cared for the child during her first year with the help of parent aide, [F.S.]. Although they needed lot of help, they were able to provide [C.C.] with her physical needs and were bonding with the child. Ms. [F.S.] had serious concerns, however, with the stormy relationship between the parents. The father is 48 years of age and the mother is 24 years of age. The parents were ""constantly arguing"" according to Ms. [F.S.], and the father was emotionally abusive to the mother, calling her ""stupid"" and ""mentally slow"". As the baby got older (four or five months) the parents had much more difficulty managing her. As well, their domestic problems escalated. At one point, due to the father's abuse, the mother left the home for short time. Ms. F.S.] felt the couple needed time to stabilize their relationship and suggested s. agreement. The parents agreed and the child came into care on November 30, 1993. Ms. [F.S.]'s main concerns at that time were two-fold: (1) that the mother needed great deal of help to care for the child, and indeed was not able to do so on her own, and (2) Ms. [F.S.] did not like the way the father treated the mother and felt that he was ""hindrance"" to the mother in many ways. Other Department witnesses, Cornell Beuker and Laura Haye also testified to serious difficulties in the relationship between the parents and the difficulty that the mother had in caring for the child on her own. The child has now been in the [P.] foster home for nearly three years. The [P.]'s initially cared for [C.C.] under the s. agreement, and then following her apprehension in January, 1995. Clearly, the child is doing very well with the [P.]'s and is receiving excellent care. [C.C.] has been diagnosed as having attention deficit hyperactive disorder and is presently on ritalin two times week with very positive results. The natural parents have access every Friday afternoon for two hours and those visits seem to go well. Fortunately, the [P.]'s have good relationship with the parents and they freely share information with each other. The Department tried longer visits over this past summer, but they have been terminated as result of [C.C.] exhibiting some negative behaviour after the weekend visit. Apparently, the child was slapping herself and saying that her mother had slapped her during the visit. The mother denied this in her testimony and provided another explanation for the child's behaviour. The parents both testified, stating that they wished to have [C.C.] returned to them. They were married in November, 1995 and both say that their relationship is much better than when [C.C.] was in their care. However, the parents also acknowledge that [C.C.] is doing very well in the [P.] foster home, and that if she is not to be returned to them, then they would like her to remain with the [P.]'s. After considering all the evidence, I find that thechild [C.C.] is in need of protection. When theparents had the custody of the child, they were unable toprovide for all her needs, even with considerable assistancefrom the Department. As well, the child was exposed to severedomestic disharmony that could have resulted in emotional harmto her. Although the parents testified that recently theirrelationship has improved, I cannot find, from the evidence,that their ability to provide for [C.C.]'s needs hasimproved significantly. From the evidence of Mrs. [P.], andthe medical report of Dr. McKenna, it is apparent that[C.C.] is a child who requires enormous amounts of care andattention on a daily basis. will not review the evidence of the foster mother in detail except to say that few parents could have coped with child like [C.C.] prior to the assistance of Dr. McKenna. After two years, the foster parents were very nearly at the end of their rope with [C.C.], and Mrs. [P.] was near exhaustion. Since [C.C.] has been on ritalin, her behaviour has improved significantly such that she can now attend pre-school and take dancing lessons. However, Mrs. [P.] made it clear that the ritalin did not perform miracles and that [C.C.] continues to require considerable care and patience. I find that thenatural parents are unable to care for [C.C.] particularlygiven her special needs resulting from the attention deficitdisorder diagnosis. The Department is requesting permanent order so that they have more options in planning for [C.C.]'s future. It is absolutely clear to me, however, that it is in[C.C.]'s best interest to remain where she is and tocontinue to have contact with her natural parents. Given the special needs of [C.C.], it is unlikely that an adoption plan would be made, and indeed to remove this child from the [P.]'s home could be extremely damaging and emotionally traumatic for the child. Mrs. [P.] testified that she and her husband were committed to [C.C.] and would care for her until she was 18. She further stated that they love [C.C.] ""like our own"" and will not take in any other foster children as long as they have [C.C.]. It goes against all good sense to make any order which might alter the present arrangement for the care of [C.C.]. Therefore, having determined that the child is inneed of protection, and further having determined that it isin [C.C.]'s best interest to remain with the [P.]'s and tocontinue to have visits with her natural parents, I order thatthe child be placed in the custody of the Minister until theage of 18 years. In so doing, I strongly recommend that thechild remain in the [P.] foster home.

Diduck on his own behalf Lane Wiegers for the Crown DISPOSITION: On Appeal From: Q.B. Crim. 1886, J.C. of Yorkton Appeal Heard: November 5, 2002 Appeal Dismissed: November 5, 2002 (orally) Written Reasons: November 8, 2001 Reasons By: The Honourable Mr. Justice Sherstobitoff In Concurrence: The Honourable Chief Justice Bayda The Honourable Madam Justice Jackson SHERSTOBITOFF J.A. (orally) [1] Mr. Diduck, the procedure in this Court is for the judges to prepare for the hearing of cases by reading all of the record of proceedings in advance of the hearing of the appeal. In this case, all of the members of the Court read your notice of appeal, the relevant portions of the transcript of the trial proceedings, and the Crown factum prior to hearing your arguments today. We are all fully familiar with what happened. [2] We are unanimous in our opinion that your appeal against both conviction and sentence must be dismissed. [3] Your first ground of appeal was that transcripts of court proceedings in previous cases were not available to you, and that the Court would not subpoena certain witnesses whom you wished to call to give evidence on your behalf. We all agree that Mr. Justice Zarzeczny made no error in ruling that all of the evidence to be derived from these sources was irrelevant to the charges against you, being too remote in time, being unrelated to the charges which were the subject matter of the trial, and being unnecessary to establish your state of mind which was adequately established by your own evidence and your summation to the jury. [4] Your other ground of appeal was that your state of mind at the time you made the telephone calls which were the subject of the charges somehow exonerated you from responsibility for them. This defence was put to the jury through your own evidence, through your summation to the jury, and by the following portion of the judge’s summation to the jury: Finally, the accused, Lawrence Diduck, gave evidence on his own behalf at this trial. He testified that he had had number of previous encounters and dealings with the RCMP which caused him to be fearful of them. He alleges he was seriously assaulted and injured during one of those encounters at his home. He testified that he had filed number of formal complaints against the members of the RCMP and that these were being investigated. His evidence was that he was frustrated with and fearful of the RCMP and with the legal proceedings against him generally involving the RCMP and others and it was in these circumstances that when he received the phone message from Constable Rusty Spragg in January of 2001, he made the phone calls and left the two messages he did at the Esterhazy and Langenburg RCMP offices out of- acting out of fear, anger and frustration. In these circumstances for these reasons, he testifies his purpose and intent in the messages overall was to be left alone; it was not his purpose and intention to be threatening. [Transcript pp. 190-91] Your defence, such as it was, was fully and fairly put to the jury which chose not to accept it. Since your defence was fully and fairly put, it cannot be said that you did not have fair trial. [5] As to the appeal against sentence, since the sentence was limited to time already served by you while awaiting trial, it is now moot: that is, there is no issue to be decided. Were we to rule upon its fitness, we would have no difficulty in finding it fit.

Introduction[1] On March 13, 2011, Mr. Plantje was charged with impaired operation of a motor vehicle, contrary to s. 253(1)(a) of the Criminal Code, R.S.C.
[2] The investigation into the events which the charges were based on included a demand from a police officer that Mr. Plantje provide a roadside sample of his breath into an approved screening device (""ASD"").
At trial, Mr. Plantje challenged the reasonableness of the investigating officer's suspicion upon which the officer based his ASD demand.
The trial judge determined the officer's suspicion was not reasonable, which resulted in a breach of ss.
8 and 9 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms (the ""Charter"").
The trial judge excluded the Certificate of Qualified Technician, pursuant to s. 24(2) of the Charter, and Mr. Plantje was acquitted of both charges.

County Realty Ltd., 2006 NSSC 132 Date: 20060421 Docket: S.SN. 256803 Registry: Sydney Between: Pricewaterhouse Coopers Inc., Trustee in Bankruptcy of Alternative Sports Limited v. County Realty Limited, body corporate, incorporated under the laws of the Province of Nova Scotia Defendant Judge: The Honourable Justice Walter R.E. Goodfellow Heard: February 21 and March 31, 2006, in Sydney, Nova Scotia Counsel: Gail Rudderham Chernin, Q.C., for the plaintiff Gary J. Corsano and Robert F. Risk, for the defendant By the Court: [1] Pricewaterhouse Coopers Inc. (hereinafter “Pricewaterhouse”) received voluntary assignment for bankruptcy by the directors of Alternative Sports Limited on September 9, 2005. This assignment was approved by the Superintendent of Bankruptcy on September 12, 2005, appointing Pricewaterhouse and, specifically, Rita Anderson as Trustee in bankruptcy. [2] Pricewaterhouse retained Allan Henderson as a contractual agent to value and liquidate the assets in favour of the creditors of Alternative Sports Limited pursuant to the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act and when he attended at the premises at 216 Charlotte Street, Sydney, Nova Scotia, he found that the inventory was being loaded into a van and he was unable to gain possession of the assets. Mr. Henderson called Rita Anderson who attended on September 12, 2005. [3] In the affidavit of Irving Warner, President of County Realty Limited, Warner acknowledges in paragraph 10 that he was present at the premises on September 12, 2005 when Rita Anderson attended: “she spoke with my employee, Archie Snow, in my presence, and advised him that Alternative Sports was bankrupt and that the inventory was seized.” [4] Mr. Warner had instructed his staff to remove the inventory to another location owned by County Realty Limited, namely, 308 Charlotte Street, Sydney, Nova Scotia, and his employees Archie Snow, Steve Moseychuck and Mark MacDonald began to carry out his instructions before the trustee arrived [5] County Realty Limited refused to turn over the inventory and an application was made for an interim injunction. A consent order dated the 22nd of February, 2006 was granted, directing that Pricewaterhouse would take possession of the assets which have given rise to the action for the purposes of completing an inventory and liquidating the assets in accordance with the normal duties and powers of the Trustee pursuant to the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act. The order provided the Trustee’s entitlement to receive reasonable fees, expenses and disbursements directly associated with the removal and relocation of the assets. The taking of the inventory and its liquidation, with detailed inventory and results of the liquidation, when completed, to be filed with the court. This order was continued. This application for summary judgment which was first heard on February 21, 2006 was continued on March 31, 2006. [6] Civil Procedure Rule 13.01 is as follows: Application for summary judgment 13.01 After the close of pleadings, any party may apply to the court for judgment on the ground that: (a) there is no arguable issue to be tried with respect to the claim or any part thereof; (b) there is no arguable issue to be tried with respect to the defence or any part thereof; or (c) the only arguable issue to be tried is as to the amount of any damages claimed. [Amend. 31/05/02] [7] Section 16(3) of the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act, R.S. 1985, c. B-3, states: The trustee shall, as soon as possible, take possession of the deeds, books, records and documents and all property of the bankrupt and make an inventory, and for the purpose of making an inventory the trustee is entitled to enter, subject to subsection (3.1), on any premises on which the deeds, books, records, documents or property of the bankrupt may be, notwithstanding that they may be in the possession of sheriff, secured creditor or other claimant thereto. [8] Section 20(3) of the Tenancies and Distress for Rent Act, R.S.N.S., 1989, c. 464 states: Where voluntary assignment of his property for the benefit of his creditors, or an authorized assignment under the Bankruptcy Act (Canada) is made by tenant, or where under the Bankruptcy Act (Canada) petition is presented to the court praying tenant by adjudged bankrupt and that receiving order be made against him, there shall be no right of the landlord to distrain or complete his distress for rent except for such rent as has accrued due during the three months immediately preceding such assignment, authorized assignment or petition, provided that where petition for receiving order or for the winding up of an incorporated company is dismissed or withdrawn or for any other reason is not granted the rights of the landlord affected by this subsection shall be deemed not to have been so affected. [9] Section 20 of the Tenancies and Distress for Rent Act works in conjunction with section 73 of the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act in that it is clear that the landlord loses its distress rights on the bankruptcy of the tenant. The landlord has no right to distrain or to complete his distrain for rent as his only right is to claim as preferred creditor for arrears for rent for period of three months immediately preceding the bankruptcy and following the bankruptcy if entitled thereto under the lease and pursuant to section 136 of the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act regarding the scheme of distribution. TEST FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT: [10] The test for summary judgment in Nova Scotia is well established. In Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce v. Tench (1990), 1990 CanLII 2451 (NS CA), 97 N.S.R. (2d) 325 (C.A.), Macdonald, J.A. stated at paragraph 9: The law is clear that plaintiff is entitled to obtain summary judgment if he can prove his claim clearly and if the defendant is unable to set up bona fide defence or raise an arguable issue to be tried see Bank of Nova Scotia v. Dombrowski (1977), 23 N.S.R. (2d) 532; 32 A.P.R. 532... Under the circumstances of this case, if the allegations contained in the statement of defence are correct, they would afford an answer to the bank’s claim. [11] In D.E. Son Fisheries Ltd. v. Goreham (2003), 2003 NSCA 93 (CanLII), 217 N.S.R. (2d) 199, (N.S.C.A.), Cromwell, J.A. stated at para. 2: Summary judgment may be granted to plaintiff if the plaintiff can prove the claim clearly and the defendant is unable to set up bona fide defence or raise an issue against the claim which ought to be tried. Bank of Nova Scotia and Simpson (Robert) Eastern v. Dombrowski (1978), 23 N.S.R. (2d) 523, 31 A.P.R. 532 (C.A.) At 537; Oceanus Marine Inc. v. Saunders (1996), 1996 CanLII 5309 (NS CA), 153 N.S.R. (2d) 267, 450 A.P.R. 267 (C.A.) at para 15. [12] There is no meaningful difference between an “arguable” issue and “genuine” or “bona fide” issue: see Roscoe, J.A. in United Gulf Developments Ltd. V. Iskandar, 2004 NSCA 35, (N.S.C.A.) (CanLII). [13] The position taken by County Realty Limited in its pleadings and evidence is first, that it has set out the pleading requirements taken as correct establish lease between County Realty Limited and Trevor Muller. In other words, that landlord tenant relationship existed between County Realty Limited and Trevor Muller. [14] County Realty Limited also takes exception to the conduct of Pricewaterhouse and in particular, Rita Henderson, as trustee in bankruptcy of Alternative Sports Limited. The affidavit evidence and documentation provided by the trustee in bankruptcy to County Realty Limited establishes prima facie valid appointment as trustee leaving the sole issue before me as to whether or not County Realty Limited has disclosed sufficient facts to place an arguable issue before the court. Gruchy, J. stated well, the defendant’s position in Prenor Trust Company v. Gupta (S.B.) Investments Limited (1991), 1991 CanLII 4509 (NS SC), 105 N.S.R. (2d) 251 (T.D.) quoting the often cited case of Featherstonhaugh v. Featherstonhaugh, 1939 CanLII 311 (ON CA), [1939] D.L.R. 262 (Ont. C.A.) Robertson, C.J. O., stated at paragraph 23: The Defendant needs to show the nature of his Defence and to disclose such facts as may be deemed sufficient to enable him to defend, and it is upon his success or failure in doing so that the fate of the motion must turn. In sense, the usual role is reversed for this special purpose, and the burden of proof, such as it is, lies upon the Defendant and not upon the Plaintiff. Gruchy, J. goes on to state in paragraph 25 as follows: It is clear from reading of Rule 13 and of the cases above cited, an onus rests upon the Defendants to bring forth sufficient facts which would conclude that bona fide Defence or issue exists which ought to be tried. [15] turn now to review that which is advanced by County Realty Limited. The affidavit of Mr. Warner alleges his approval of a rental of the premises to Trevor Muller personally and goes on to acknowledge that no lease agreement was ever signed. Attached to the affidavit of his Agent, Archie Snow, is the legal account from the law firm of LaFosse MacLeod dated October 27, 2005 and number of the entries in that account are acknowledged to be relevant to this action, as follows: Aug-22-05 Office conference with Trevor Muller re: offer to lease. Aug-23-05 preparation of draft lease. Telephone conference with Archie Snow. Extensive revisions to draft lease as per Archie Snow’s instructions. Preparation of personal guarantee for Trevor Muller and Catherine Muller. Aug-24-05 letter to Trevor Muller highlighting areas of the enclosed lease. Telephone conference with Trevor Muller. Aug-25-05 telephone call to Trevor Muller to advise his documents re still here. Voice-mail to Archie Snow providing update. Aug-26-05 telephone conference with Trevor Muller. Clause by clause review of changes he wants to lease. Telephone call to Archie Snow to discuss Mr. Muller’s changes. Telephone call to Trevor Muller advising that Archie Snow would contact him directly. Aug-31-05 telephone call from Archie Snow advising that Mr. Muller has retained Mr. Beaton and lease must be signed tomorrow. Fax to Wayne Beaton, Q.C. Sep-01-05 telephone call to Archie Snow. Advised him have not heard back from Wayne Beaton on Trevor Muller. Sept-06-05 telephone call from Archie Snow [16] The legal bill goes on to recite September 12th, telephone conference County’s Solicitor had with Rita Anderson and Mr. Warner personally. [17] County Realty Limited’s solicitors prepared draft lease and the parties are listed as follows: THIS INDENTURE made this day of August, A.D. 2005. BETWEEN: COUNTY REALTY LIMITED, company incorporated under the laws of Nova Scotia; (hereinafter referred to as the “Lessor”) and ALTERNATIVE SPORTS LIMITED, company incorporated under the laws of Nova Scotia; (hereinafter referred to as the “Lessee”) and TREVOR CLARENCE SCOTT MULLER (hereinafter referred to as the “First Guarantor”) and CATHERINE MULLER (hereinafter referred to as the “Second Guarantor”) WHEREAS the demised premises are to be used by the Lessee for commercial purposes, AND WHEREAS the First Guarantor and Second Guarantor each agree to guarantee the obligations of the Lessee under this Indenture, [18] The proposed term is set out as follows: II LEASE TERM TO HAVE AND HOLD the Demised Premises unto the Lessee for the term of one (1) year, commencing on the 1st day of September, A.D. 2005, and thenceforth fully to be completed and ended on the 31st day of August, A.D. 2006, unless the Lease is sooner terminated or later extended as provided herein. [19] The evidence advanced by Archie Snow in Cross-examination of his affidavit includes the following: Page 8... Q. O.k., but the important thing is, it’s the very next day after meeting with Trevor Muller it’s one day later, the very next day and he refers to an August 22 office conference with Trevor Muller re offer to lease so, he has met with Trevor Muller on the 22nd for an offer to lease, the very next day, preparation of draft lease, talks with you, extensive revisions, preparation of guarantees. So, are you telling me that that didn’t have to do with that lease? A. Mr. MacNeil was never instructed to prepare lease forms. County Realty and A.K.W. Homes, we do have our copy of lease forms. We asked Mr. MacNeil to prepare an offer to lease form with Mr. Muller. Q. So, you didn’t ask John MacNeil to prepare personal guarantees to attach to lease? A. No, we had conversations of the personal guarantees after Mr. Muller, believe, declined to even enter into an agreement, of any which way, shape or form. Q. O.k., that came later? A. That came later, yes. Q. That came later. We’re now at the point where you have the offer to lease and you’ve prepared draft? A. Yes, of the offer to lease form. Page 11 and 12... Q. So, what’s your version? A. Well, Mr. MacNeil called me and told me that Mr. Muller would not sign off on the lease, or something of the sort. My memory is pretty vague, as was on vacation and voice mails...as you can fully respect. Um, he...it seems that John MacNeil was telling me that Mr. Muller was orchestrating the lease, not us as County Realty. Q. So, why did you get billed for it? A. That’s good question and actually, that’s an ongoing issue in itself. Um, this whole bill is an issue with LaFosse MacLeod and Mr. Warner as going forward from today. Um, actually, the lease changes that he wanted to the lease...he wanted many revisions to un, the lease form, but not to our knowledge. Our knowledge was offer to lease, which basically states that he’s going to promise to take possession of property and pay deposit. From that point forward then we would, we would consider lease with Muller from that point forward, however, that never ever became, and where it came into the lease, the drafting of changes to lease, don’t know where that came from. didn’t give instructions for lease to be prepared that’s what I’m saying. Q. Explain to me what you think the difference is between an offer to lease and lease? What are the differences? A. Um, pre-determined possession date of the property with deposit. A. An offer to lease form one pager, if you will, stating that Mr. Muller will take possession of the property on certain date, for certain amount of money. A. Ah, once that is completed and we will enter into lease with Mr. Muller. That was never done and why would ask him to prepare lease without first having an offer to lease form is pretty much not what I’ve been taught. Q. So basically, your explanation is, the offer to lease is precedent to the lease? Q. But you can enter lease without an offer to lease? A. Not in our practice, we don’t. Q. Are you suggesting you didn’t know she was Trustee in Bankruptcy? A. Oh, knew she was Trustee in Bankruptcies. Page 20... Q. O.k. and when you name the parties...if you name company, do you prefer to have personal guarantee of the person? If there’s company that’s leasing from you, do you ask for personal guarantee? A. Ah, no, not necessarily. This particular case, was instructed by John MacNeil, through again, voice mail, that personal guarantee might be in order with Mr. Muller. Q. O.K. and that would be because if you have Mr. Muller personally named as lessee, then you can sue him personally if he defaults, but if you have his company names, you can’t sue him personally, unless he personally guarantees. So, personal guarantee gives you him as the lessee? A. That’s correct. Page 24... THE COURT: So, there’s no agreement at that stage as to the term? ARCHIE SNOW: Yes My Lord, that’s correct. [20] Mr. Snow gives evidence with respect to the invoices dealing with the change of locks at 216 Charlotte Street, and at this point simply interject from the affidavit of Mr. Warner the date Mr. Muller put inventory into the 216 Charlotte St. Was around the 5th of August and Warner states in para. 13. THAT with respect of Paragraph of the Affidavit of Allan Henderson, when Muller failed to pay his rent for the month of August 2005 had the locks changed on the Premises on August 18, 2005. Muller was given the new keys prior to September 2005. Muller continued to fail to pay his rent, and on September 1, 2005, had the locks for the Premises rekeyed. did not have the locks changed between September 8, 2005 and September 12, 2005. Attached hereto as Exhibit “A” are invoices from Bidart Locksmithing and Security with respect to the locks at the Premises. [21] Returning now to the affidavit of Mr. Snow: A. But, where the lease, draft copies of it came from, in terms of how they were drafter, can’t say that gave direction for that. It looks to me, from the bill, and again, can’t really say it’s true that Muller un, was instructing him to get his own legal counsel because he was kind of directing our legal counsel which is not really what was supposed to happen. Q. Hmm, hmm, which he did. Which he did and then he’s given instructions that... let’s even say that it’s an offer to lease. Let’s give you the offer to lease. Let’s say it was an offer to lease, as opposed to lease. Did you give instructions that it should be signed tomorrow? In other words, September 1st? guess. That’s what it looks like. musta give direction that we wanted it signed, sealed, delivered by September 1st, guess. Q. O.k., and then on September 1, John MacNeil places telephone call to you to advise you he has not heard back from Wayne Beaton on Trevor Muller. So, at this point, day by day, you’re concerned, you want something on paper, in writing and you’ve checking with lawyer to see has it been done yet? Q. This is the day the Trustee went down to the premises, September 12th to take possession of the inventory. Yes. Q. And at that point, you called the lawyer? A. Yes. Q. And the lawyer calls Rita Anderson? A. Yes. Q. And the lawyer calls Irving Warner. You put this into evidence. Would you care to tell us what that was about? A. Telephone call from me to John MacNeil; telephone conference with Rita Anderson don’t know what that entails, un, it didn’t include me. Ah, telephone conference with Irving Warner again, that did not include me. Um, and an office conference with LeeAnne MacLeod assume that would have been between John MacNeil and LeeAnne MacLeod? Q. Correct? A. Um, and left voice message for Irving Warner. Again, that did not include me, so the telephone call from me at the beginning of the day was to instruct John MacNeil at...probably Mrs. Anderson arrived on our scene. Q. O.k. Can you elaborate on that? A. Um, left that with Mr. Warner at that time. [22] It is also clear from Mr. Snow’s evidence that no deposit was paid by Muller and no agreement was ever reached with respect to the term of the proposed lease. Mr. Warner’s evidence on expansion of his affidavit made it clear that what was being sought was an offer to lease. He acknowledges no lease was entered into, he wasn’t sure what the term was to be either three or five years, that normally, no one would get in possession without signing lease. He was also upset after changing the locks on the 18th of August, there was apparently another set of locks given and he clearly instructed Archie Snow to get that set of keys back. Warner also denies some of the entries on the bill he received from the law firm of LaFosse MacLeod and says that it is an issue, but acknowledged that he paid it in timely fashion. [23] In determining whether or not the defendant has raised an arguable issue, have limited myself to the evidence advanced by County Realty Limited and have not made any determinations as to credibility in reaching the conclusion that the fundamentals of relationship of landlord tenant have not been advanced by County Realty. There are no facts advanced of agreement as to the term, none as to agreement as to when the lease would commence, no deposit, no consensus on the terms of any lease arrangement. The facts based on the evidence by County Realty Limited, Muller very clearly was only intended to be a guarantor and the lease prepared by County Realty Limited along with the evidence of Snow and the statement of legal fees strongly advances Muller’s position that he was only a guarantor and never intended to be a tenant. [24] The evidence advanced by County Realty is overwhelming that the basic facts required to show consensus on the fundamentals of lease do not exist. The mere statement by the defendant, that particular relationship exists does not constitute meeting the onus on the defendant to bring forth sufficient facts upon which the court could conclude that an arguable issue exists which ought to be tried. [25] Pricewaterhouse Coopers Inc. are entitled to summary judgement including a declaration with respect to the inventory and the existing order shall continue with damages to be determined and assessed in due course. [26] Counsel are entitled to be heard on costs and simply want to add at this stage that had found summary judgement was not established, would have denied County Realty Limited it’s costs because of the manner in which it conducted itself, although did not deal with credibility in making my determination on the issue of summary judgement. Credibility relating to how party conducts itself is relevant to the issue of costs. have no doubt that when Warner referred to having sold the inventory for $5,000. that whatever context he put it in, his intent clearly was to mislead the Trustee. Similarly, his explanation that his employees when they removed part of the inventory in the white van, drove out towards Gabarus, somewhere more than 15 miles from the place on Charlotte Street where they were supposed to be relocating the inventory. Mr. Warner suggests this was just lark and that, simply do not accept, it was clearly part and parcel of his attempt of County Realty Limited to mislead the Trustee and avoid the repossession.",c_2006nssc132.txt,"When the trustee attended at the premises of the bankrupt, he found the bankrupt's inventory being loaded into a van by the landlord; after obtaining a consent order which allowed it to take possession of the assets for the purposes of compiling an inventory, the trustee brought an application for summary judgment against the landlord.

The evidence showed that only an offer to lease had been made, with no lease agreement ever having actually been signed, and that the individual with whom the landlord had dealt was only intended to be a guarantor and never a tenant."

On August 25, 1992, Cheryl was delivered of her baby by caesarian section, following what has been described as an uneventful and even excellent pregnancy.
The defendant, Dr. Gerry P. Urbanski (""Dr. Urbanski"") who had performed the caesarian section delivery operation, was called in and attended to Cheryl's needs.
When satisfied that they had contained the bleeding and stabilized Cheryl as best they could under the exigent circumstances, she was transferred to the intensive care unit, where she could be closely monitored and followed.
However, on October 3, 1992, it became obvious that hemorrhaging had recurred.

Cheryl alleges that Dr. Urbanski was negligent in the performance of his professional duties and services upon her with the result that the hysterectomy, which could otherwise have been avoided, became inevitable.

Tomney, Deloitte Touche Inc., Trustee Julie Rogers-Glabush, for Her Majesty the Queen in Right of Canada, as represented by the Minister of National Revenue, objecting creditor JUDGMENT MAURICE J. HERAUF, July 22, 1999 Registrar in Bankruptcy This discharge application involves another bankrupt who is self employed and through indifference, disregard and neglect does not pay his taxes. This is the second bankruptcy for this bankrupt. The sole unsecured creditor is Revenue Canada with a proved claim of just under $89,000.00 for unpaid income tax and unremitted G.S.T. It should come as no surprise that Revenue Canada was also the major creditor in the first bankruptcy. The bankrupt has horrendous record for non-payment of his tax obligations which stretches back at least 15 years. Not only does the bankrupt not pay his taxes he also does not file his returns. The bankrupt is 43 years of age, in good health and has no dependants. He is a self-employed contractor and has an enviable income. In fact, the only issue at the discharge hearing was the determination of the amount of surplus income available to pay toward conditional order. The trustee calculated surplus income at $435.00 per month and recommended a conditional order requiring the payment of $7800.00. It would take approximately 18 months to complete the terms of the order. The objecting creditor calculated surplus income at $750.00 and requested a four year conditional order providing for monthly payments of this sum. It should come as no surprise that the bankrupt preferred the recommendation of the trustee. have carefully reviewed the financial material on file and considered the submissions of the parties. I have concluded that the bankrupt can safely accommodate a payment of $500.00 per month for three years without jeopardizing his ability to pay toward his current tax obligations. Therefore, there will be an order requiring the bankrupt to pay to the trustee the sum of $18,000.00 for distribution to the unsecured creditors. The bankrupt shall pay this amount by monthly instalments of $500.00 per month commencing September 1, 1999 and continuing on the 1st of each month thereafter until paid in full. Judgement interest will accrue on any payment in arrears. The right of prepayment exists. Since the bankrupt denies any knowledge of his obligation to make regular instalment payments on his self-employment income would be remiss if did not offer the court’s assistance to educate the bankrupt relating to this obligation. Accordingly, there will also be an order that during the term of the conditional order the bankrupt will be required to make regular instalment payments on his self-employment income and comply with income tax and G.S.T. filing requirements. The objecting creditor is entitled to costs of $400.00 payable out of the estate.

No. 1275 of 2005 Judicial Centre: Regina IN THE MATTER OF JUDICIAL REVIEW PURSUANT TO PART 52 OF THE RULES OF THE COURT OF QUEEN’S BENCH AND THE INHERENT SUPERVISORY JURISDICTION OF THE COURT BETWEEN: BRAD GALGER and THE WORKERS’ COMPENSATION BOARD OF SASKATCHEWAN Counsel: R.A. Nordal for the applicant W.P. Dale for the respondent FIAT CURRIE J. October 5, 2005 [1] On December 18, 2000 the medical review panel of the Workers’ Compensation Board of Saskatchewan decided that Brad Galger was not fit for employment. On January 20, 2005 the Board’s appeals committee upheld a 2004 decision of the Board’s case management division that Mr. Galger was fit for employment. [2] Mr. Galger says that the decisions of the Board’s case management division and appeals committee are contrary to s. 64(2) of The Workers’ Compensation Act, 1979, S.S. 1979, c. W-17.1: 64(2) The decision of the majority of the members of the medical review panel is the decision of the panel and is binding upon the board and the worker. [3] Mr. Galger applies to the court for an order: (a) in the nature of certiorari quashing or setting aside the decisions that Mr. Galger was and is fit for employment; (b) as consequence, remitting the matter back to the medical review panel, if required; and (c) as consequence, in the nature of mandamus directing the Board to pay benefits to Mr. Galger in accordance with the decision of the medical review panel. [4] Although Mr. Galger has another avenue of appeal available to him within the workers’ compensation system, he takes the position that the impugned decisions were made without jurisdiction, so that there is no proper decision from which to appeal, leaving him with an application for judicial review as his only remedy. [5] The Board says that, on examination of the circumstances, the decisions are not contrary to s. 64(2), and that in any event Mr. Galger must exhaust his right to appeal before seeking judicial review. [6] Mr. Galger says that the return should include his counsel’s April 5, 2005 letter and the April 13, 2005 reply from the Board’s appeals committee. He argues that the April 13, 2005 letter is clarification of the Board’s position, and that it can be understood only by reference to the April 5, 2005 letter. [7] The April 5, 2005 letter from Mr. Galger’s counsel attaches letter from Mr. Galger’s doctor, and indicates that Mr. Galger is on surgical waiting list. The April 13, 2005 reply from the appeals committee advises that the committee is not changing its January 20, 2005 decision, because nothing in the April 5, 2005 correspondence changes the committee’s conclusion that Mr. Galger is fit for employment. [8] The Board takes the position that the letters are neither part of the impugned decisions nor part of the record. [9] The Board is correct. Rule 669 requires return that includes information up to and including the impugned decision and the reasons therefor. Such information has been provided in the return in this case. [10] The Board’s appeals committee did not create clarification or addendum to its decision or reasons by simply responding to the letter from Mr. Galger’s counsel. In that response there is no decision, and there is no expansion on the January 20, 2005 decision. [11] The return will not be amended to include the documents suggested by Mr. Galger. The panel’s decision [12] On December 18, 2000 the medical review panel issued certificate, the relevant parts of which provided that: (a) Mr. Galger was not fit for employment; and (b) “after proper surgical treatment and surgical fusion it is hoped that the permanent functional impairment will be minimal”. [13] On August 13, 2001 the medical review panel issued an “additional clarification” to its earlier decision. The clarification states: 1) If surgery is booked or planned it should be expedited then functional capacity evaluation should follow his post surgical rehabilitation period. 2) If Mr. Galger wants surgery and it is not planned the panel urges an immediate surgical consultation. 3) If Mr. Galger refuses the recommended surgery (as per the medical review panel certificate of December 18, 2000) then the functional capacity evaluation should proceed to determine his fitness for employment and further evaluation would be required. The Board’s actions [14] Following delivery of the medical review panel’s December 18, 2000 certificate, the Board began to develop the view that Mr. Galger might be fit for employment after all. The Board thought this because Mr. Galger actually was working full-time at the time of the panel’s review. [15] The Board, through its case management division, eventually asked Mr. Galger to undergo functional capacity evaluation, and Mr. Galger did so in May 2003. Following completion of the functional capacity evaluation the case management division evaluated Mr. Galger’s claim, and the division concluded in April 2004 that Mr. Galger was fit for employment. [16] Effective July 1, 2004 the division reduced Mr. Galger’s benefits. That led to Mr. Galger’s appeal to the Board’s appeals committee. In its January 20, 2005 decision the appeals committee upheld the determination that Mr. Galger was fit for employment. This decision has led Mr. Galger to apply for judicial review of both the decision of the case management division and decision of the appeals committee. [17] It is not necessary for me to address Mr. Galger’s argument on the issue of jurisdiction because, however that issue might be determined, his application is determined on the issue of the availability of relief in the nature of certiorari. Availability of relief in the nature of certiorari [18] Mr. Galger acknowledges that he has available further right of appeal in the workers’ compensation system. He may appeal from the decision of the appeals committee to the Board members. [19] Such circumstance was addressed by the Saskatchewan Court of Appeal in Bayne No. 371 (Rural Municipality) v. Saskatchewan Water Corp. (1990), 1990 CanLII 7675 (SK CA), 90 Sask. R. 102. Referring to the Supreme Court of Canada decision in Harelkin v. University of Regina, 1979 CanLII 18 (SCC), [1979] S.C.R. 561, Cameron, J.A. said at paras. [9] We indicated that we were, of course, bound by the statements of principle found in the majority decision in Harelkin’s case. Mr. Justice Beetz, speaking for the majority expressed three opinions of particular significance to the matter at hand. [10] The first had to do with whether, in principle, certiorari goes as of right or grace, even in cases entailing lack of jurisdiction. He said this (at pp. 574-576): “The principle that certiorari and mandamus are discretionary remedies by nature cannot be disputed. The principle was recently affirmed in unanimous decision of this Court, P.P.G. Industries Canada Ltd. v. The Attorney General of Canada, 1975 CanLII 204 (SCC), [1976] S.C.R. 739 at p. 749 ... “The use of the expression ex debito justitiae in conjunction with the discretionary remedies of certiorari and mandamus is unfortunate. It is based on contradiction and imports great deal of confusion into the law. “Ex debito justitiae literally means ‘as of right’, by opposition to ‘as of grace’ (P.G. Osborne, Concise Law Dictionary, 5th ed.; Black’s Law Dictionary, 4th ed.); writ cannot at once be writ of grace and writ of right. To say in case that the writ should issue ex debito justitiae simply means that the circumstances militate strongly in favour of the issuance of the writ rather than for refusal. But the expression, albeit latin, has no magic virtue and cannot change writ of grace into writ or right or destroy the discretion even in cases involving lack of jurisdiction.” [11] The second concerned whether, conceptually, an order which is nullity might nevertheless be appealed, depending on the scope and effect of the appeal provisions bearing on that issue. Of this Mr. Justice Beetz said (at p. 586): “Furthermore, and even if it can be said that the decision of the council committee was nullity, believe it was still appealable to the senate committee for the simple reason that the senate committee was given by statute the power to hear and decide upon appeals from the decisions of the council, whether or not such decisions were null ... Prov. Sec. P.E.I. Egan, 1941 CanLII (SCC), [1941] S.C.R. 396; 76 C.C.C. 227; [1941] D.L.R. 305 ...” [12] The third of the opinions of particular significance to the instant case centred on whether the right of appeal there in issue “constituted an adequate alternative remedy”. Mr. Justice Beetz suggested that that question be addressed with reference, among other considerations, to the nature of the complaint and the right of appeal; the composition, powers and duties of the appellate body; the manner in which it was apt to exercise its powers; and the comparative expedition and cost of proceeding by way of appeal rather than alternatively. [13] In light of the foregoing, we took Harelkin’s case as standing for the following propositions: 1. Certiorari remains “a writ of grace” to grant or withhold as, in the discretion of the court, circumstances suggest. 2. If in the circumstances right of appeal of sufficient scope and appropriate effect exists, then an order, even though it be nullity, is nevertheless appealable. 3. If the right of appeal provides an “adequate alternative remedy”, having regard for the considerations bearing upon that matter, the residual discretion in the court will ordinarily be exercised in denial of certiorari. Only if “special circumstances” are present will the courts then exercise their prerogative power and quash on certiorari. [20] When person has an adequate alternative remedy available that he or she has not pursued, relief in the nature of certiorari is not available to that person except in special circumstances: Bayne at para. 13. Mr. Galger has available to him further right of appeal that he has not pursued. [21] He argues, though, that the decisions that he is fit for employment were made without jurisdiction, so that there is no proper decision from which to appeal. In effect, he argues that each of the decisions of the case management division and of the appeals committee is nullity, depriving Mr. Galger of an adequate alternative remedy. As discussed in Bayne at paras. 11 and 13, however, even if the decision is nullity it still can be appealed. [22] If the appeal available to Mr. Galger in the workers’ compensation system is an adequate alternative remedy, then in the absence of special circumstances he must attempt to have the alleged error of fact remedied through appeal before resorting to judicial review. Adequate alternative remedy [23] The right of appeal from the appeals committee to the Board members does provide Mr. Galger with an adequate alternative remedy. The power of the Board to delegate its powers, and to provide for review of decisions made under the Act, stems from ss. 19, 21-24 and 104(1): 19 Subject to subsection 21.1(4), the board shall sit at any time and conduct its proceedings in any manner that it considers advisable for the conduct of its business and affairs. 21(1) The board may delegate any of its powers or functions to any of its staff and any employer or worker affected by any act of person in the exercise of any delegated power may apply to the board to review, set aside, amend, stay or otherwise deal with the act of that person. (2) The board may, upon an application under subsection (1) or of its own motion, exercise its powers and perform its functions with respect to the delegated power in issue as if the person had not acted in that manner. 22(1) The board shall have exclusive jurisdiction to examine, hear and determine all matters and questions arising under this Act and any other matter in respect of which power, authority or discretion is conferred upon the board (2) The decision and finding of the board under this Act upon all questions of fact and law are final and conclusive and no proceedings by or before the board shall be restrained by injunction, prohibition or other proceeding or removable by certiorari or otherwise in any court. (3) Notwithstanding subsection (2), the board may reconsider any matter that it has dealt with or may rescind, alter or amend any decision or order it has made. 23 The board shall have the same powers as the Court of Queen’s Bench for compelling the attendance of witnesses and examining them under oath, and compelling the production of books, papers, documents and things. 24 The board may cause depositions of witnesses residing within or outside the province to be taken before any person appointed by the board, in manner similar to that prescribed in The Queen’s Bench Rules for the taking of those depositions. 104(1) Any weekly or other periodical payment to worker or dependent spouse of worker payable out of the fund may be reviewed on the motion of the board or at the request of the worker, dependent spouse or employer and, on that review, the board may terminate or diminish the payment or may increase the payment to sum not beyond the maximum compensation prescribed in this Act. [24] Under these provisions the Board has established its appeal process, including final right of appeal to the Board members. The Board has made information available to workers that describes the appeal process. That information includes: (a) Saskatchewan Workers’ Compensation Board policy no. POL 03/96, entitled “Appeals”; (b) Saskatchewan Workers’ Compensation Board policy no. POL 13/91 (amended by ADM03/2000), entitled “Reversing Decisions”; and (c) Saskatchewan Workers’ Compensation Board Fact Sheet, entitled “Appeals: how to have an injury claim decision reviewed”. [25] These materials establish that: (a) worker who disagrees with decision of the appeals committee may obtain “further review” by the Board members; (b) if requested by the worker, the Board review will include personal attendance by the worker; (c) in appeal proceedings worker may be represented; (d) there is no restriction of the subject matter of an appeal to the Board members; and (e) Board members will rule on an appeal with full written reasons. [26] The subject matter of an appeal to the Board members is not limited to points of law, and so on appeal the Board members would be able to consider Mr. Galger’s issue of fact. [27] In the case of the Board there is not, in either the Act or in the information made available by the Board, detailed recitation of procedures relating to an appeal to the Board’s members. Countering that absence, though, are the remarks of Sopinka, J. in Pasiechnyk v. Saskatchewan (Workers’ Compensation Board), 1997 CanLII 316 (SCC), [1997] S.C.R. 890 at pages 913-914: The composition, tenure, and powers of the Board demonstrate that it has very considerable expertise in dealing with all aspects of the workers’ compensation system. Not only does the Board have day-to-day expertise in handling claims for compensation, in setting assessment rates and promoting workplace safety; but it also has expertise in ensuring that the purposes of the Act are not defeated. As Wakeling J.A. commented at p. 301 in his dissenting reasons: [The Board members] are well equipped to draw on background of experience to determine how the Act will best function so as to assure continued consistent development of the intended purposes of the Act. have no reason to doubt they are well qualified to decide the various issues the legislation is designed to present them. [28] The legislature has chosen to establish the workers’ compensation system as an self-contained system, with no right of appeal to the courts beyond the final decision of the Board: s. 22(2). The legislature regarded this as sufficient in matters of workers’ compensation, likely because of the extensive system that it established in the Act. [29] Finally, especially in light of the comments of Sopinka, J. in Pasiechnyk, there is no reason to suppose that the Board members would not effectively deal with the issue raised by Mr. Galger. Conclusion [30] Whether or not each of the impugned decisions was made without jurisdiction and consequently is a nullity, Mr. Galger has an adequate alternative remedy available to him. No special circumstances, that might justify judicial intervention at this time, have been presented. An order in the nature of certiorari is not available to Mr. Galger because he has not yet pursued his right of appeal. [31] The application is dismissed. The parties may speak to costs. J. G.M.

[2] This trial turns very much on the facts of the case that the Court will find having regard to all of the evidence and, in particular, whether Constable Marriott’s evidence concerning what he observed of this alleged street level drug transaction constitutes proof beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused, Mr. Carvery, committed these offences with which he has been charged.

Constable Marriott had the use of expensive binoculars to view the encounter.
[5] In an earlier ruling, I determined that the Crown’s motion for observation post privilege was valid (see 2011 NSSC 283 (CanLII)).

Introduction [1] Christopher Pang Chu was found guilty of conspiring with others to traffic in cocaine contrary to s. 465(1) of the Criminal Code, RSC 1985, C-46, and trafficking in cocaine contrary to s. 5(1) of the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act, SC 1996, 19. He was sentenced to term of 7.5 years in custody and prohibited from applying for parole before the expiry of three years: see Pang Chu, 2014 SKQB 414 (CanLII) [Conviction Decision]. He was granted judicial interim release pending his appeal (see Chu, 2015 SKCA 60 (CanLII), 460 Sask 157). He appeals his conviction only. [2] Mr. Chu’s first ground of appeal is based on the learned trial judge’s refusal to grant an adjournment of the trial to allow review of recently disclosed and discovered documents: see Chu, 2014 SKQB 288 (CanLII), 455 Sask 168 [Adjournment Decision]. In the two days immediately preceding the trial, Crown counsel disclosed the existence of approximately 1,900 documents. Mr. Chu submits that the trial judge should have granted an adjournment to permit proper assessment of the late-disclosed documents. As part of this argument, Mr. Chu submits that neither Crown counsel nor the trial judge could have accurately assessed the relevance of the documents as the judge was not provided with sufficient information to permit such an assessment. [3] Mr. Chu submits that to allow the conviction to stand in the face of all relevant circumstances would amount to miscarriage of justice. He asks that the verdict be set aside and new trial ordered. agree with Mr. Chu’s submissions. To this day, the documents remain undisclosed. This Court is in the same position as the trial judge, which means that we are not in position to assess the undisclosed documents to determine whether the undisclosed information could have affected the verdict. new trial is the only remedy available to the Court. [4] Mr. Chu has other grounds of appeal. He argues the following: (i) the verdict is unreasonable or unsupported by the evidence; (ii) the trial judge erred by refusing to grant stay of proceedings when it was discovered that the police had destroyed number of email messages; and (iii) the trial judge erred by admitting the certificates of an analyst attesting to the fact that substance found in the possession of third party was cocaine and admitting certificate of conviction with respect to that individual. Mr. Chu submits that these grounds of appeal also merit new trial. [5] Since have concluded that the appropriate remedy to address the late and non-disclosure issue is new trial, do not need to address Mr. Chu’s other grounds of appeal. II. Trial Context and the Conviction Decision [6] In light of my decision to order new trial, will review the circumstances of the case as briefly as possible. [7] The Saskatoon Combined Forces Special Enforcement Unit [Special Enforcement Unit] initiated an investigation into cocaine trafficking in Saskatoon in April of 2011. The investigation involved the surveillance of Mr. Chu and number of his associates, the interception of their private communications, and the execution of search warrants in relation to their homes, vehicles, places of association and financial institutions. The surveillance continued until November 9, 2011, when Mr. Chu was arrested. [8] The Crown’s case against Mr. Chu is based on the activities of his associates, telephone intercepts revealing coded language consistent with drug trafficking and the link between blue bag that had been seen in Mr. Chu’s possession on one occasion, and was later found in the possession of known associate. The bag at that time was shown to contain cocaine. [9] As it turns out, when he testified, Mr. Chu’s defence was that he was not trafficking in cocaine, but he was trafficking in OxyContin and steroids and that all of the Crown’s surveillance was directed to the wrong drug in relation to him. He admitted that he had been trafficking in drugs and conspiring to do so, but that the drugs in question were OxyContin and steroids not cocaine. Indeed, four of the officers testified they believed that Mr. Chu was trafficking in steroids (as well as cocaine). [10] In the arguments made to the trial judge on his behalf, it was submitted that there was no direct evidence linking Mr. Chu to trafficking in cocaine or conspiring to traffic in cocaine. For example, the seizure of garbage over an extended period of time and the search of his home and possessions did not reveal any cocaine or cocaine residue. In search incident to arrest, the police discovered steroid kits and cell phones only. [11] The trial judge did not believe Mr. Chu that he trafficked in OxyContin and steroids only. On the basis of the circumstantial evidence, the trial judge drew the conclusion that Mr. Chu was guilty of the charges against him. III. Background to the Adjournment Request and Decision [12] As have indicated, the broad issue on this appeal is whether the trial judge’s refusal to adjourn the trial, or to take other steps to address Mr. Chu’s allegations of s. breach of the Charter, requires new trial. will now provide the background to this issue and analyze the trial judge’s reasons to explain my conclusion. A. What transpired over the weekend prior to the trial [13] The Special Enforcement Unit was not the only group of police officers investigating Mr. Chu and his associates. Another team of officers from the Integrated Proceeds of Crime Unit [Proceeds of Crime Unit] was also conducting an investigation into proceeds or assets that might be derived from Mr. Chu’s and his associates’ activities. Unfortunately, the Crown counsel responsible for prosecuting the within case were not informed that the Proceeds of Crime Unit was working on the same file or, more importantly, that it had amassed large quantity of data referring to Mr. Chu. [14] With the trial fixed for Monday, September 8, 2014, Crown counsel learned about the existence of the work of the Proceeds of Crime Unit, and the existence of second database, in the afternoon of Friday September 5, 2014, only. This revelation took the two Crown counsel to document entitled “Global Document Report” [Index], which is 176 pages long and contains approximately 1,900 entries. [15] The Index is an alphabetically listed document with such headings as “Account Information”, “Affidavits”, “Analysis”, “Application”, “Asset Description”, “Assets”, and continuing through to “Witness Statements”. The first page of the Index indicates its format: ABM DEPOSITS EXHIBIT 2011-0032 ITEM 713 Document #: 375 Task 96 ABM Deposits with backing documents from President’s Choice Financial for Christopher CHU, Account# 48616676 EXHIBIT 2011-00321TEM 715 Document #: 379 Task 96- ABM Deposits with backing documents from President’s Choice Financial for Christopher CHU, Account# 48616700 ACCCOUNT SUMMARY OF HOLDINGS INVESCO DUONG, MICHELLE Document #: 1923 2013/03/18 Task 232- Account Summary of Holdings from lnvesco Canada Ltd, account 15442748 for Michelle DUONG, and Affidavit for Solape ILORI.

[17] Crown counsel discovered the existence of the Proceeds of Crime Unit investigation and the Index when they were preparing Cst. Shurkin (one of their next week’s witnesses) to testify. The specific discovery was that Cst. Shurkin had notes in both the Special Enforcement Unit’s database and the newly-discovered database. Indeed, Crown counsel’s initial discovery revealed 120 pages of evidence relevant to the cross-examination of two upcoming witnesses. Crown counsel immediately provided these 120 pages to defence counsel on Friday afternoon at about 2:00 p.m. [18] After this initial release, Crown counsel began review of the Index. Based on that review, at 5:45 p.m. on Saturday, September 6, 2014, Crown counsel released 27 documents (plus the Index) in electronic form but, because the other documents individually listed in the Index had not been vetted, the Crown was not prepared to allow access to the balance of the 1,900 documents. One of the late-disclosed 27 documents was not actually reviewable by defence counsel until Monday morning because it could not be downloaded due to its file size. B. What transpired in court on Monday morning, the first day of the trial [19] After preliminary matters were dealt with, defence counsel made these remarks requesting an adjournment: [MS. FAGAN] But in any event, I’m in the awkward position, sir, of needing an adjournment this morning, and, frankly and I’ve discussed this with my friend it’s the sheer volume of the disclosure is such that I’m entitled to make the application to adjourn the entire month-long proceedings. Now, don’t know if I’m going to need to do that yet, but what am asking this Honourable Court to do is to allow me until Wednesday, possibly Thursday morning this Court will have my best efforts to review upon receipt of the disclosure from my friend, to review all of it and to and to proceed as scheduled at that point. That being said, sir, know that my friend has two witnesses here today who have travel plans. One is an RCMP officer, the other is civilian. Apparently both have flights booked. My friend has represented to me that what has been disclosed should have no impact on their testimony, should have no impact on what I’m doing. Now, [this is a] difficult representation for me to accept; however, have obtained instructions from my client to allow these two witnesses to testify this morning to accommodate their travel schedules, notwithstanding the fact that I’m certainly entitled to ask that they’re that they be called on different date after I’ve had chance to review full disclosure, but it’s they’re instructions that do have, sir, to accommodate in this regard. (Emphasis added, trial transcript at T6) [20] Crown counsel then explained to the Court what had transpired over the course of the weekend. He explained why they had provided the Index and the documents in these terms: My colleague, Ms. Kirsten and I, upon receipt of that index, then conducted our own review of that index to assess what, if any, further disclosure obligation was triggered as result of reviewing that index. We determined that there were 27 additional documents not previously disclosed in the combined forces database that would trigger our disclosure obligation. And, again, without describing each one in particular, for the most part, they they’re not central to the investigation, but nonetheless, on the question of could we say they’re clearly not relevant? No, we can’t stand up and say that. And so 26 of those documents were disclosed on Saturday. (Emphasis added, at T8) [21] When the trial judge questioned Crown counsel further, the following exchange occurred: THE COURT: And based upon your review of the index, you’ve identified some 27 of those documents as potentially relevant. MR. NEELY [Crown Counsel]: Correct. THE COURT: Although you don’t assess them (INDISCERNIBLE). MR. NEELY: Correct. So to go that’s an overview of where we’re at, think, in terms of the disclosure. was defence counsel one time in my life, and so understand the importance of looking, not just at what the Crown’s putting in, but what the Crown did not put in. THE COURT: M-hm. MR. NEELY: And for that reason, my friend’s request to be able to review that index, think, is submission with some justification. And haven’t told her I’m going to give her 1,900 documents. have told her that if she wants to come over to our conference room, I’m prepared to link up any document that she wants so that she can then assess whether or not I’m correct in saying it’s not relevant. THE COURT: In other words, follow-up on the hyperlinks. MR. NEELY: So some measured response to my friend’s request, think, is appropriate. I’ve indicated to her that have two witnesses with flight plans; civilian, Mark Florence, who is resident of Calgary, who has flight that leaves at the end of the afternoon to go back to Calgary because told him he would likely be the second witness in this trial and should be free to fly back tonight. (Emphasis added, at T9–T10) [22] As to the length of the adjournment, Mr. Neely was prepared to agree to short period of time only: As to whether we come back on Wednesday or Thursday, my preference would be that we come back on Wednesday. That will give my friend two full days to review an index that Ms. Kirsten and conducted our review on, basically in the course of one afternoon, namely, Friday, so that would submit practically speaking, that should give her plenty of opportunity to assess that index to assess whether or not she wishes to take issue with our conclusions about what is or isn’t disclosable. [23] The trial judge then granted the adjournment in these terms: and given Mr. Neely’s indication of willingness to accommodate to certain extent, am, after we hear the two witnesses, going to adjourn the matter. The difficulty is knowing precisely where we’ll be at Wednesday morning, but having said that, would like and I’m going to say we’re just adjourning to 9:45 Wednesday morning. If something particular arises, of course, Ms. Fagan, have absolute confidence that you will be raising that with me then. But I’m also alert to the fact that there may still be some time needed, but there’s also Friday afternoon coming up, and I’m extremely reluctant, given the time that has been scheduled for this trial the difficulty of some 54 witnesses and maintaining that schedule, noting as well as your representation as to the situation of your calendar in the future, I’m extremely reluctant to do other than to provide only such time as per to be necessary to deal with this matter. [24] The trial continued for several hours so that certain out-of-town witnesses could testify. It was then adjourned to Wednesday, September 10, 2014. C. What transpired after court recessed on Monday, September 8, 2014, and in court the following day [25] After court adjourned on Monday, September 8, 2014, Crown counsel invited defence counsel to the Crown offices where she was allowed access to computer, but she was required to show Crown counsel what she wished to review and they reviewed the document with her to see if it contained privileged information. After 20 minutes, defence counsel left the Crown’s office and immediately sent note to the trial judge objecting to the surveillance of her work and asking to see him at his earliest convenience. [26] On Tuesday, September 9, 2014, the Court reconvened at defence counsel’s request to make further submissions on the disclosure issue. She advised the court as follows: To bring the Court up to speed, you’ll recall that yesterday was invited to attend at my friend’s office to review the content of hyper-linked document. It’s 176-page document. In acceding to that offer, was under the impression that would be given privacy in reviewing said materials. When attended at my friend’s office yesterday afternoon to review these materials, it was in the company of both of my learned friends here. They would scroll the documents. would indicate which ones to stop on, which ones wanted to look at. And the Crown was essentially privy to every second that was looking at or otherwise assessing the importance of these documents. lasted about 20 minutes. Sir, in my respectful submission, with my adversary proverbially and literally looking over my shoulder as review disclosure, does not, in my respectful submission, permit for meaningful review within the confines of Section of the Charter. (Emphasis added, at T28) [27] Notwithstanding Crown counsel’s statement on Monday morning that he could not say the documents were “clearly not relevant”, Crown counsel filed brief of law on Tuesday morning asserting the following: (i) number of the documents in the Index compiled by the Proceeds of Crime Unit overlapped with documents in the Special Enforcement Unit database and had already been disclosed; and (ii) the balance of the Index dealt with “money laundering”. [28] Referring to Crown counsel’s submissions, the trial judge called upon defence counsel to provide some basis to say how what appeared to him to be financial records might assist her in her defence of Mr. Chu. Defence counsel’s response was that she could not give an answer without seeing the documents. She assured the court that she was not embarking on “fishing expedition”. The bottom line of her argument, however, was that relevance may be inferred by virtue of the fact that the Crown disclosed the existence of the documents and she would be boxing at shadows to provide any meaningful response. [29] In open court, the trial judge then conducted brief review of the documents, identifying number of them that he believed would have already been disclosed and number of other documents that were financial documents. He asked defence counsel how financial transactions of the accused could be relevant to his defence, particularly when the Crown had given its undertaking that it would not be relying upon any of the documents listed in the Index that had not already been disclosed. The trial judge said the following: And with respect to the financial documents relating to Mr. Chu, if the Crown’s not using them and then say to myself, how could financial transactions of Mr. Chu be relevant? And as the Crown’s brief says in paragraph 31: (As read) To establish breach of disclosure, the applicant must establish reasonable possibility that the undisclosed information could have been used in leading the Crown advancing defence or otherwise decision which could affect the conduct of the defence. That seems to be the cusp, and I’m and know I’ve asked you already, but wanted to come back to it to give you my, shall say, preliminary sense of this global document, to give you an opportunity to address it at focusing on you establishing reasonable possibility that could assist you because that’s what I’m having difficulty with, Ms. Fagan. (Emphasis added, at T43) [30] Defence counsel indicated that she was not going to “reveal the direction” in which the defence was headed by speculating on documents that she had not seen, saying she was “between rock and hard place”. She continued: But would be in dereliction of my duties as defence counsel when document is disclosed to me clearly, my friend’s not in the business of disclosing irrelevant documents. When document is disclosed to me with potentially thousands of pages of information and don’t request it and this this Honourable Court in v. Walker in 2012 indicated: (As read) Merely being insignificant evidence or significant in the Crown’s opinion or not destined to be evidence is insufficient for withholding disclosure. So for me to not bring this application on behalf of my client THE COURT: Well, understand that. MS. FAGAN: highly problematic in my respectful submission, sir. have nothing to add. She reminded the Court that at the last pretrial conference on May 7, 2014, the Crown had assured the case management judge that “disclosure was complete”. She advised the Court that she had been prepared to run the trial on the basis of that assurance. [31] The trial judge then indicated that he would adjourn to consider the matter further, strongly indicating that counsel should be prepared to recommence hearing witnesses the following day. [32] Following the hearing, defence counsel filed letter of objection, stating that, having not seen the documents, she should not be called upon to establish relevance, and asking that the trial be adjourned outright. That letter was filed on Tuesday, September 9, 2014. Ms. Fagan wrote as follows: In accordance with my client’s right to make full answer and defence and his right to fair trial as guaranteed by sections and 11(d) of the Charter would respectfully request that this Honourable Court review the impugned materials and render an informed judicial ruling in this regard. Further compounding the unfairness occasioned by my client is that of the late disclosure of 27 documents provided by the Crown (26 of which were provided on Saturday, September 6, 2014 at approximately 5:45 pm and the last of which was provided at approximately 10:00 pm on Sunday, September 7, 2014). The length of the adjournment granted by this Honourable Court has been insufficient to allow counsel for the Accused to properly review and synthesize this late disclosure (i.e. hundreds of pages). As consequence of the foregoing and for the reasons stated on the record if this matter proceeds to trial tomorrow my client will be unable to make full answer and defence. Further to my application for an adjournment made on September 8, 2014 please take notice that am seeking an adjournment of these proceedings in their entirety. (Bold emphasis in original) [33] Later that afternoon, the trial judge released written decision refusing to adjourn the trial. He said the trial would commence on Wednesday morning, but that he would adjourn at noon on Friday to permit defence counsel to continue to review the documents Friday afternoon and during the weekend. He then offered to hear an application on Monday to seek leave to recall any of the witnesses who had testified if she wished to further cross-examine any of them in light of what she might discover by any continuing review of the documents that she might undertake. [34] The balance of the Adjournment Decision is best reviewed as part of my analysis explaining why find the trial judge erred and why find new trial is warranted. IV. Whether the Judge Errored by Refusing to Adjourn the Trial A. Position of the parties [35] Before asserting they were not relevant, Mr. Chu argues that the Crown “did not conduct any meaningful review of the 1,900 documents” (AF at para 55) and merely relied on the description of each document contained in the Index. Mr. Chu argues that the trial judge’s failure to grant an adjournment denied him fair trial contrary to s. of the Charter and the ability to make full answer and defence contrary to s. 11(d) of the Charter. According to Mr. Chu, when the s. concerns were raised about his inability to review the documents privately, the Crown “reversed” its position and filed written materials indicating the documents were not relevant. He asserts that the trial judge erred by not finding breach of s. of the Charter and, as result, erred by not granting him an appropriate remedy to address the breach. [36] He also argues, apart from any consideration of s. 7, that the trial judge erred by failing to grant an adjournment in light of the fact that defence counsel was taken completely by surprise. In that regard, Mr. Chu also relies on Barrette The Queen, 1976 CanLII 180 (SCC), [1977] SCR 121 [Barrette], and Davis (1998), 1998 CanLII 18030 (NL CA), 159 Nfld PEIR 273 (NLCA) [Davis],[1] for the proposition that even where late disclosure does not result in Charter breach, declaring mistrial, excluding evidence or granting adjournments may all be appropriate remedies. [37] The Crown argues it always maintained that the withheld materials had already been disclosed previously or were irrelevant, noting that Stinchcombe, 1991 CanLII 45 (SCC), [1991] SCR 326 [Stinchcombe], imposes an obligation on the Crown to withhold such materials. According to the Crown, Mr. Chu failed to establish that the material was relevant, and even if it were relevant Mr. Chu cannot demonstrate that late and non-disclosure affected his right to make full answer and defence. [38] The Crown suggests that Mr. Chu’s position is similar to the position taken by trial counsel in Anderson, 2013 SKCA 92 (CanLII), 300 CCC (3d) 296 [Anderson]. In addition, because Mr. Chu did not take up the Crown’s offer to continue to review the documents over the course of the week following the Adjournment Decision, and make further application to the judge, he should be taken to have “abandoned” his application to continue to review the documentation, and he should be precluded from raising the issue before this Court. [39] Finally, the Crown argues, based on Dixon, 1998 CanLII 805 (SCC), [1998] SCR 244 [Dixon], and Taillefer, 2003 SCC 70 (CanLII), [2003] SCR 307 [Taillefer], that if this Court finds that the trial judge erred by not granting an adjournment, we can nonetheless consider whether the verdict can be sustained, and, according to the Crown, the proper application of those decisions should preclude intervention by this Court. B. Analysis [40] The right to disclosure is an element of the constitutional right to make full answer and defence encompassed within s. of the Charter. This right imposes duty upon the police and the Crown to disclose all relevant material pertaining to the investigation of the accused (see McNeil, 2009 SCC (CanLII), [2009] SCR 66). Since this right is grounded in the Charter, the request to adjourn the proceedings is request for remedy under s. 24(1) of the Charter for breaching the obligation to disclose. As such, the trial judge’s decision to refuse to adjourn the trial or grant any other remedy is an order made under s. 24(1). The standard of review to apply to decision under s. 24(1) of the Charter is deferential one (see Bellusci, 2012 SCC 44 (CanLII) at para 17, [2012] [41] Notwithstanding the deferential standard of review, find the trial judge misdirected himself in two ways. First, he erred in his statement of the obligation on the Crown when defence counsel asked for a review of the Crown’s refusal to disclose known documents. Second, he erred by classifying the Index as a Laporte inventory (see R v Laporte (1993), 1993 CanLII 9145 (SK CA), 84 CCC (3d) 343 (Sask CA) [Laporte]) and relying upon it alone to determine whether the Crown had met the burden on it to show the documents were clearly irrelevant. If the judge had not made these errors, he would have found that the Crown’s late disclosure (and non-disclosure) amounted to breach of s. for which remedy had to be granted. 1. The Crown’s obligation on review of disclosure [42] The trial judge provided an overview of the law that he was applying, beginning first with what he believed to be the relevant authorities: [14] The law is clear that once the Crown has justified non relevance in the first instance, it then falls to the defence to articulate basis on why the documents sought should be characterized as relevant and thus subject to disclosure. In R. v. Chaplin, 1995 CanLII 126 (SCC), [1995] S.C.R. 727, 96 C.C.C. (3d) 225, at paragraph 32, the Supreme Court of Canada said: [32] Apart from its practical necessity in advancing the debate to which refer above, the requirement that the defence provide basis for its demand for further production serves to preclude speculative, fanciful, disruptive, unmeritorious, obstructive and time-consuming disclosure requests. [15] While, as defence counsel puts it, the threshold for relevance is low, demonstration of relevance is nonetheless central. In R. v. Mah, 2001 ABQB 322 (CanLII), 288 A.R. 249, Sulyma J. said: [4] The requirement that the Defence provide basis for its demand for further production is, from reading of R. v. Chaplin (supra) applicable to any request and, by R. v. Starr (1998) 1998 CanLII 6760 (MB CA), 123 C.C.C. (3d) 145 (Man. C.A.); [1998] S.C.C.A. No. 141 (S.C.C.) applies where the Crown has declined to produce material on the basis of lack of relevance or privilege. This is not matter of onus, but rather an overriding principle that the Defence must provide basis for its demand for further production. As will be seen in consideration of the specific requests in this case, the Crown only contests that basis has not been provided in few of the matters raised. (Emphasis added, Adjournment Decision) [43] He reviewed Anderson and Laporte, concluding as follows: [23] am satisfied by my review of the Global Document Report [the Index], which classify as equivalent to Laporte Inventory, the submissions of Crown counsel with respect to the efforts they have undertaken to disclose the relevant documents therefrom and the failure of defence counsel to demonstrate reasonable possibility that the undisclosed documents could be used to meet the case for the Crown, advance defence or otherwise assist in making decision would affect the conduct of the defence that it is appropriate for me to exercise my discretion and to find that the Crown has met its disclosure obligations. The nature of the undisclosed documents are not, in my opinion, relevant to the issues in this trial. (Emphasis added) [44] In my respectful view, the trial judge erred by placing a burden on defence counsel to demonstrate the relevance of existing documents that the Crown refused to disclose. Chaplin, 1995 CanLII 126 (SCC), [1995] SCR 727 at para 32 [Chaplin], draws clear distinction between the “Procedure Where Existence of Information is Established” (paragraphs 25 to 29) and “Procedure Where Existence of Material is Disputed” (paragraphs 30 to 33). The trial judge referred to that part of Chaplin that addresses the Crown’s obligation when the defence alleges that other documents exist without knowing whether they actually are in existence. If Mah, 2001 ABQB 322 (CanLII), 288 AR 249, can be taken to speak to the issue of disclosure of existing documents, would not follow it. [45] In series of decisions leading up to Chaplin, the Supreme Court of Canada heard appeals intended to address the proper procedure where the existence of document or information is not in doubt but the Crown resists disclosure: Duarte, 1990 CanLII 150 (SCC), [1990] SCR 30; Dersch Canada (Attorney General), 1990 CanLII 3820 (SCC), [1990] SCR 1505; and Durette, 1994 CanLII 123 (SCC), [1994] SCR 469. These are wiretap cases, but in Chaplin, Sopinka J. relied upon these decisions to comment upon the “Catch 22” position of the defence when the Crown refuses to disclose information known to exist, but does not provide sufficient information to assess relevance: [27] In Dersch, supra, for example, the accuseds had been given notice that the Crown intended to adduce evidence obtained as result of Criminal Code wiretap authorizations made as part of the investigations into the charges being tried. The accuseds applied for an order for access to the contents of the sealed packets containing the affidavits in support of the authorizations, claiming that they were needed for them to make full answer and defence. In restoring the order of the trial judge to grant the application, this Court noted that the accuseds could not gain access to the affidavit unless they could prove the grounds for such access, and could not prove such grounds unless they had access. (Emphasis added) [46] In Chaplin, this Catch 22 prompted Sopinka J. to write the following: [25] In situations in which the existence of certain information has been identified, then the Crown must justify non-disclosure by demonstrating either that the information sought is beyond its control, or that it is clearly irrelevant or privileged. The trial judge must afford the Crown an opportunity to call evidence to justify such allegation of non-disclosure. As noted in R. v. Stinchcombe, supra, at p. 341: This may require not only submissions but the inspection of statements and other documents and indeed, in some cases, viva voce evidence. voir dire will frequently be the appropriate procedure in which to deal with these matters. (Emphasis added) [47] Shortly after the Supreme Court of Canada released Stinchcombe, and before Chaplin, this Court established procedure to review the Crown’s refusal to disclose in Laporte. According to Laporte, the Crown is required to produce “a written, itemized inventory of the information in its possession, identifying those items which it intends to disclose and those which it does not, and containing, in respect of the latter items, statement in each case of the basis upon which the Crown proposes to withhold disclosure” (at para 18). The Crown should describe each item “with sufficient detail that counsel will be enabled to make reasoned decision as to whether to seek disclosure or not”. [48] As Ottenbreit J.A. indicated in Anderson, the courts in Saskatchewan have continued to follow the procedure set out in Laporte. Although it is not mandatory and it is not inconsistent with Chaplin, it is tool to help determine whether the Crown has met its disclosure obligations (see paragraph 97 of Anderson). Ottenbreit J.A. confirmed, however, that the Crown “has to justify non-disclosure” (at para 96) in circumstances where the Crown refuses to disclose documents known to exist. [49] When the trial judge relied upon the failure of defence counsel to demonstrate reasonable possibility that the undisclosed documents were relevant, he erred. He was required to call upon the Crown to demonstrate that the documents were clearly irrelevant. The Crown’s solution at trial, which was to allow defence counsel to review the documents in their presence during the first weekend of the trial, does not affect this analysis. 2. Misdirection as to the status of the Index [50] As Chaplin holds, where the existence of document is not in doubt, the burden is on the Crown to bring itself within an exception to its obligation to disclose. In this case, that meant the Crown had to demonstrate that the documents were “clearly irrelevant”. There were several ways in which the Crown could have discharged that burden. Given that the Index was discovered two days before trial, Crown counsel chose to meet its obligation by producing the Index on the first day of trial, calling it Laporte inventory and providing little else. [51] Notwithstanding the Crown’s submissions, this is not case like Anderson where the trial judge concluded Crown counsel was “unable to satisfy the defence’s demands because [they] were such that they were incapable of being met” (trial transcript at T1006). Nonetheless, the analysis in Anderson is highly relevant to this appeal. Speaking for the Court in Anderson, Ottenbreit J.A. demonstrated that when counsel take divergent views of the Crown’s obligations it is necessary to return to first principles beginning with Stinchcombe. [52] In Stinchcombe, Sopinka J., writing for the Court, wrote at length regarding the Crown’s obligation to disclose all information (subject to certain named exceptions). The Crown “must err on the side of inclusion” but “it need not produce what is clearly irrelevant” (at 339). Sopinka J. made it clear that “The initial obligation to separate ‘the wheat from the chaff’ must therefore rest with Crown counsel”. [53] In Egger, 1993 CanLII 98 (SCC), [1993] SCR 451, Sopinka J. again made it clear that the burden is on the Crown to justify non-disclosure: The Crown’s disclosure obligation is subject to discretion, the burden of justifying the exercise of which lies on the Crown, to withhold information which is clearly irrelevant or the non-disclosure of which is required by the rules of privilege, or to delay the disclosure of information out of the necessity to protect witnesses or complete an investigation: Stinchcombe, supra, at pp. 335–36, 339–40. As was said in Stinchcombe, supra, at p. 340, “[i]nasmuch as disclosure of all relevant information is the general rule, the Crown must bring itself within an exception to that rule”. (Emphasis added, at 466) [54] As have indicated, this Court in Anderson held that Laporte inventory is not the only means by which the review process may begin, but in the case at bar, the Crown put forward the Index, asserting that it was Laporte inventory and urged the Court to accept it as such. [55] In my respectful view, the Index is not a Laporte inventory. Quite simply, the Index was prepared for a different purpose. Calling the Index a Laporte inventory was a means to try to salvage the trial dates, but the Index does not provide “sufficient detail that counsel will be enabled to make a reasoned decision as to whether to seek disclosure”. It does not indicate the basis upon which disclosure is resisted. This is not what the Supreme Court of Canada had in mind when it imposed an obligation on the Crown to disclose all information, excluding that which is “clearly irrelevant”. [56] The trial judge considered the Index in some detail, but in my view, he erred in describing the Index: [19] Crown counsel advises and defence counsel does not dispute that many of the approximate 1,900 documents in this database are also found in the CFSEU [Special Enforcement Unit] database and thus are among the documents that have been previously disclosed in these proceedings. Examples of such documents include police investigation and surveillance reports, affidavits and exhibits on various applications for court orders, search warrants, production orders, restraint and management orders, CPIC documents with respect to various individuals and the like. [20] Defence counsel confirms she does not seek duplicate disclosure. Crown counsel has specifically represented to the Court and to defence counsel that they will not be seeking to use in these proceedings any document listed in the IPOC Global Document Report [the Index] except to the extent that such documents have already been disclosed. [21] The balance of the IPOC database contains documents that are records of financial transactions, banking transaction, income tax records, information relating to assets owned, acquired or disposed of, tracing of funds and assets, ISC records, SGI customer profiles, corporate registry searches, and correspondence relating to financial matters or investigations involving significant number of individuals including the accused. (Emphasis added, Adjournment Decision) [57] While it was common ground that there were documents in common between the two databases, the difficulty was in knowing the numbers and in knowing where the overlap lay. The trial judge made the assumption that all that was left was the financial information. Even assuming for the moment that financial records of known associates in conspiracy trial are automatically “clearly irrelevant” without examination, the fact is, as Mr. Chu’s counsel on appeal demonstrated, there are other documents not disclosed and not common to both investigations, and which were not financial documents. [58] Comparing the list of documents that Crown counsel disclosed during the weekend prior to the trial with some of the listed items on the Index is one way to illustrate this point. The 27 documents that were released on Saturday, September 6, 2014, are listed in an appendix to the Crown’s factum on appeal. That list is as follows (pages 219 to 220): Description of Late Disclosure Documents 1. Doc 1810 (6 pgs) financial analysis of banking records by Cory Oliver. 2.

For example, the following appears in the Index under the heading “Member Notes” and can be found on pages 165–166 of the Crown factum: MEMBER NOTES HICKS, KYLA CST Document #: 1826 2011/08/18 Task Member Notes of Cst Kyla HICKS HUNTER, AMY CST Document #: 1587 2011/05/30 Task 171 Member Notes of Cst Amy HUNTER Document #: 1755 2011/11/08 Task 211 Member Notes of Cst Amy HUNTER regarding suspicious banking transaction made by Joanne HO and Blane MCDONALD at the Credit Union in Watrous, SK KERR, JASON CPL Document #: 1754 Task 210 Member Notes of Cpl Jason KERR regarding inquires made to construction companies involved in work at 1014 Ledingham LN, Saskatoon, SK Document #: 1346 2012/01/09 Task 171 Member Notes of Cpl Jason KERR LERAT, MIKE CPL Document #: 1694 2011/08/03 Task Member Notes of Cpl Mike LERAT Document #: 1734 2011/08/04 Task Member Notes of Cpl Mike LERAT Document #: 1822 2011/08/17 Task Member Notes of Cpl Mike LERAT Document #: 1823 2011/10/06 Task Member Notes of Cpl Mike LERAT PIPRELL, AARON CST Document #: 1827 2011/08/30 Task Member Notes of Cst Aaron PI PRELL SHUKIN, DARCY SGT Document #: 1318 2011/06/08 Task 171 Member Notes of Sgt Darcy SHUKIN TAYLOR, BRENT SGT Document #: 1248 2012/01/09 Task 171- Member Notes of Sgt Brent TAYLOR WINTERMUTE, ROBIN SGT Document #: 1825 2011/09/12 Task Member Notes of Sgt Robin WINTERMUTE (Box emphasis added, compare above) [60] Again, with respect to the above, none of the Member Notes, other than those of Cst. Hunter, were disclosed and it was only after production that defence counsel learned that this document spanned 510 pages (see the boxed entries above). [61] Another way to illustrate why the Index does not meet the requirements of Laporte inventory is to consider some of the individual items in greater detail apart from any comparison with the disclosed list. During the hearing of the appeal, Mr. Chu’s counsel took us through the Index. He invited us to look at the description of approximately 57 documents. This is representative sample of those documents (see AF at 98–103): GENERAL WARRANT AND ASSISTANCE ORDER RBC 2011-09-08 Document #: 1564 2011/09/08 Task 122 General Warrant and Assistance Order on the oath of Cst Amy HUNTER regarding the covert entry to examine the contents of the safety deposit box of Youlong THAI located at 154 1st AVE S, Saskatoon, SK (RBC) TORONTO-DOMINION BANK 2011-11-02 Document #: 1056 2011/11/02 Task 167 General Warrant and Assistance Order on the oath of Cst Amy Hunter regarding the banking/financial institution records and data for Youlong THAI, Christopher Pang CHU, Christopher PANG, and 101146259 Sask Ltd GENERAL WARRANT, ASSISTANCE ORDER SEALING ORDER CIBC 2011-09-01 Document #: 1352 2011/09/01 Tasks 114, 116, 118 and 120 General Warrant, Assistance Order and Sealing Order, on the oath of Cst Amy HUNTER, signed by Judge Q.D.

Mr. Chu was charged with conspiring to traffic in cocaine and possessing cocaine. His defence turned out to be that he was not guilty of either of those crimes but that he was possessing and trafficking OxyContin and steroids. It would seem to me that banking information linking Mr. Chu and his associates could not be classified as “clearly irrelevant” without more. On their face, any of the documents associated with other drugs would also not be clearly irrelevant. [63] Presenting the Index on the first day of trial, and expecting defence counsel to determine not only what is new but also to determine facial relevance of what remains, without even direct and unsupervised access to the hyperlinked documents, would be an impossible task for defence counsel and therein lies the real problem. Crown counsel, defence counsel and the Court were in dilemma. Given the timing and quantity of the disclosure, everything was telescoped down to short bridge of time, leaving few options. The trial judge is to be commended for wanting to make sure the trial dates were not lost, but what had transpired meant that an adjournment had to be granted or other steps had to be taken to attempt to provide remedy under s. 7. In another case, with more time, Crown counsel might have been able to work with document like the Index. In Anderson, for example, it appears that document similar to the Index formed the basis for disclosure, but the parties spent upwards of six days in hearings over several months canvassing several disclosure motions and ultimately resulting in additional disclosure being made. [64] As Ottenbreit J.A. indicated in Anderson, the review exercise when the Crown refuses to disclose known documents is complex one: [64] As practical matter, during review of the Crown’s disclosure obligations prior to trial or during trial, trial judge must look at myriad of relevant factors touching on whether the Crown has fulfilled its obligation in good faith and in timely manner. Without providing an exhaustive list, this could include looking at the essential elements of the offence, the complexity of the investigation, the volume and type of disclosure already provided, what the Crown refuses or is unable to provide, preliminary assessment of how the further disclosure sought is relevant in the sense of assisting the accused, whether it is part of the case to meet, the interaction between the Crown and defence, the behaviour of the Crown and defence, the timing of disclosure and the nature of the defence requests for disclosure. The interplay of these factors is case specific. [65] Referring to the non-exhaustive list mentioned by Ottenbreit J.A. in Anderson, the investigation in the within case was complex so much so that Crown counsel was not even aware of the parallel police investigation. The timing of the disclosure could not have been more problematic. It is clear that defence counsel was not being obstreperous. She did not go fishing for additional disclosure. She accepted the Crown’s assurance that disclosure had been complete four months earlier and was prepared to proceed to trial on what she had. [66] Thus, I conclude that the trial judge erred by (i) misapplying the test in Chaplin, (ii) imposing a burden on the defence, and (iii) concluding that the Crown had met its disclosure obligations by providing the Index. In light of the Crown’s late and non-disclosure, the judge erred by not granting an adequate remedy to address the s. 7 breach. 3. Effect of Dixon and Taillefer [67] Notwithstanding any error on the part of the judge to find s. breach or to grant remedy in relation to it, the Crown asks this Court to sustain the result on the basis that Mr. Chu was nonetheless able to make full answer and defence having regard for the principles set down in Dixon and Taillefer. Illes, 2008 SCC 57 (CanLII), [2008] SCR 134 [Illes], is also relevant. In Illes, the accused learned of an additional statement after trial, which became the subject of fresh evidence application on appeal. LeBel and Fish JJ. for the majority wrote the following: [24] With respect to the fresh evidence not available to the defence at trial due to the Crown’s failure to disclose, new trial is the appropriate remedy under s. 24(1) of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms if the accused can show that his right to make full answer and defence was thereby violated. In order to discharge this burden, the accused can show either “that there is reasonable possibility that the non-disclosure affected the outcome at trial” or that it affected “the overall fairness of the trial process” (R. v. Dixon, 1998 CanLII 805 (SCC), [1998] S.C.R. 244, at para. 34 (emphasis in original)). Understandably, given the volume of material, there is no fresh evidence application in this Court, but this fact has consequences for the analysis of the Dixon–Taillefer issue. [68] As the Supreme Court of Canada made clear in Dixon, different principles and standards apply in determining whether disclosure should be made before conviction and in determining the effect of failure to disclose after conviction: [31] For instance, where the undisclosed material is available for review at trial, the presiding judge will evaluate it in relation to the Stinchcombe threshold to determine whether the Crown breached its obligation to disclose by withholding the material. If it has, an order for production or perhaps an adjournment will be the appropriate remedy. Obviously, these remedies are no longer available after conviction. At this stage, an appellate court must determine not only whether the undisclosed information meets the Stinchcombe threshold, but also whether the Crown’s failure to disclose impaired the accused’s right to make full answer and defence. Where an appellate court finds that the right to make full answer and defence was breached by the Crown’s failure to disclose, the appropriate remedy will depend on the extent to which the right was impaired. Where, as here, the accused was tried before judge alone, the judge has provided thorough reasons for the decision, and the undisclosed evidenced is available for review, an appellate court is particularly well placed to assess the impact of the failure to disclose on the accused’s ability to make full answer and defence at trial. (Emphasis added) [69] Based on Dixon, where an appellant’s ground of appeal is based on failure to disclose, it is open to an appellate court to decide whether the undisclosed information meets the Stinchcombe threshold and, further, whether the Crown’s failure to disclose impairs the accused’s right to make full answer and defence. Both of these questions, however, require the appellate Court to examine and review the undisclosed information to determine the impact it might have had on the decision to convict. [70] In this case, however, we are in the same position as the trial judge: we are left looking at the Index to determine whether the Crown has met its obligation to disclose all documents, except clearly irrelevant ones. Thus, it is still not possible for the Court to determine which of the documents listed in the Index have already been disclosed and no further description of the documents has been provided. In my view, having regard for the burden on the Crown when it refuses to disclose documents that are known to exist, it is not possible to answer that question, which means there must be new trial. [71] In light of the power that Dixon and Taillefer speak to, it may also have been open to the trial judge to address defence counsel’s concerns about the lack of privacy in reviewing the Index and to grant longer adjournment. It may even have been appropriate for the trial judge to refuse the adjournment and, having regard for the standard of review indicated in Dixon, to direct Crown counsel to prepare more detailed list while the trial continued and to make further rulings as any subsequently disclosed information might require. [72] Even in the face of the trial judge’s decision refusing an adjournment, and without any further directions from the judge, there may have been other ways for the matter to have been handled. Crown counsel might have continued to review the documents listed in the Index, clearly identifying what had already been disclosed and vetting the balance of the documents, including preparing summary of them if it were determined that they did not meet the Stinchcombe test. The trial continued over some 18 days intermittently over one-month period. [73] These options, however, are not before this Court. After receiving the Adjournment Decision, which issued on September 9, 2014, Crown counsel was, of course, entitled to do nothing further, but it does mean that this Court cannot rely on Dixon or Taillefer to perform the trial judge’s function. This Court’s remedy for the s. Charter breach can only be new trial. C. Authority apart from considerations of s. and s. 24(1) of the Charter to review the trial judge’s decision refusing the adjournment [74] If the Court were to find that the trial judge did not err by failing to grant an adequate remedy under s. 24(1) for the infringement, Mr. Chu’s counsel, on appeal, asked the Court to find that the trial judge erred by not granting an adjournment apart from any consideration of s. of the Charter. In the event that am in error with respect to my conclusion that the Crown’s late and non-disclosure required more adequate remedy under s. 24(1), will address this alternate basis for the same result. [75] As support for his position, Mr. Chu’s counsel relies on Barrette and Davis. The majority in Barrette held that decision on an application for an adjournment is discretionary decision that may be reviewed on appeal if it is based on reasons that are not well-founded in law. The Barrette majority described this right of review as “especially wide when the consequence of the exercise of discretion is that someone is deprived of his rights, whether in criminal or in civil proceedings” (at 125). Barrette, of course, is pre-Charter decision. [76] In Davis, the Court of Appeal considered whether the defendant had been entitled to stay of proceedings “on the basis of inadequate and untimely disclosure by the Crown of an intention to call expert evidence respecting post-traumatic stress syndrome in sexual assault cases and respecting toxicology”. The Court recognized, following Stinchcombe, “that the obligation to disclose is derived from the rights of an accused to fair trial and to make full answer and defence which are now constitutionalized by virtue of ss. and 11(d)” (at para 9). The Court of Appeal noted, citing O’Connor, 1995 CanLII 51 (SCC), [1995] SCR 411 [O’Connor], that as there is no standalone right to disclosure found in the Charter, not every failure to make disclosure will necessarily involve Charter breach or entitle an accused to s. 24 remedy. According to the Supreme Court, the basic remedy for improper non-disclosure is an order for disclosure (see O’Connor at para 11). [77] The Court of Appeal commented that even where there has been no breach of the Charter in respect of disclosure, “the court nevertheless has an obligation to ensure that the accused’s right to fair trial is preserved and in that connection the court must always consider the impact and the manner and timing that the receipt of Crown evidence might have on the ability of the accused to receive fair trial” (Davis at para 12). [78] The Court in Davis noted that crafting remedy for Charter breach involves consideration of what is appropriate and just and that “an adjournment will often be the only remedy necessary to deal with an issue of late disclosure” (at para 22). However, the Court also noted that adjournments are the sort of thing that “even without Charter breach, could be made, in the interests of trial fairness whenever the submission of untimely evidence takes the defence by surprise” (at para 21). [79] In O’Connor, L’Heureux-Dubé J. analyzed the Court of Appeal’s conclusion that the jurisprudence “favoured maintaining distinction between the Charter and the common law doctrine of abuse of process”. Justice L’Heureux-Dubé found at paragraph 60 that individual rights to trial fairness and the general reputation of the criminal justice system were fundamental concerns that underlie both the common law doctrine of abuse of process and the Charter. At paragraph 69, she commented as follows: [69] Remedies less drastic than stay of proceedings are of course available under s. 24(1) in situations where the “clearest of cases” threshold is not met but where it is proved, on balance of probabilities, that s. has been violated. In this respect the Charter regime is more flexible than the common law doctrine of abuse of process. However, this is not reason to retain separate common law regime. It is important to recognize that the Charter has now put into judges’ hands scalpel instead of an axe tool that may fashion, more carefully than ever, solutions taking into account the sometimes complementary and sometimes opposing concerns of fairness to the individual, societal interests, and the integrity of the judicial system. [80] Ultimately, L’Heureux-Dubé J. concluded that “the only instances in which there may be need to maintain any type of distinction between the two regimes will be those instances in which the Charter, for some reason, does not apply yet where the circumstances nevertheless point to an abuse of the court’s process” (at para 70). [81] Insofar as this second “abuse of process” path remains open where breach of s. is not found, it may be another path permitting the review of discretionary decision as the Court in Davis recognized. recognize that the articulation of second path is somewhat circuitous in that the law underlying an adjournment decision and the impact on trial fairness are both captured by the same underlying facts. Nonetheless, note that this Court continued to acknowledge the authority of Barrette in the post-Charter era: Ironchild (1984), 1984 CanLII 2666 (SK CA), 30 Sask 269 (CA); and see Rak (1999), 1999 CanLII 12229 (SK CA), 172 Sask 301 at para (CA). In Ironchild, Tallis J.A. stated that the right of review “must be weighed conscientiously and delicately along with the public interest in the orderly administration of justice” (at para 13). [82] On this basis, would be prepared to hold that the trial judge’s decision to refuse an adjournment or provide another adequate remedy would, in this case, amount to an abuse of process necessitating new trial. Having regard for the following (i) the Crown’s assurance that disclosure was complete on May 7, 2014, (ii) the timing and volume of disclosure, (iii) the seriousness of the charges, (vi) the requirements of proper review procedure, and (v) the co-operative approach of defence counsel the trial judge erred by not adjourning the trial outright or for sufficient time for both Crown and defence counsel to devise procedure to address the revelation as to the existence of the second database. V. Conclusion [83] The conviction is set aside and a new trial ordered. “Jackson J.A.” Jackson J.A. concur. “Lane J.A.” concur. “Jackson J.A.” for Ottenbreit J.A. [1] An appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada was dismissed in 1999 CanLII 638 (SCC), [1999] SCR 759, but the Supreme Court did not comment on the disclosure issue or the comments of the Newfoundland Court of Appeal with respect to that issue.",d_2016skca156.txt,"HELD: The appeal was allowed.

That interim order provided ongoing spousal support for Mr. Lawson’s wife, the respondent, Tamara Rees, in the amount of $10,000 per month; gave Ms. Rees exclusive possession of the family home; provided for shared parenting of their son and awarded child support to Ms. Rees of $2,726 per month. Mr. Lawson has appealed only those portions of the interim order relating to spousal support and exclusive possession of the family home. He has made all of the payments required by the order, except for the spousal support arrears. Ms. Rees has filed garnishees to collect those arrears. [2] The order for spousal support was made in the face of written agreement, pursuant to which Ms. Rees gave up her rights to spousal support. The parties were married on February 3, 2012, but had lived together since June 2010. They separated in March 2015. They have one child of their relationship who is three years of age. Ms. Rees has second child from another relationship who resides with her. The Chambers judge found Mr. Lawson’s income for child support purposes to be $349,993 per annum. Ms. Rees was unemployed. [3] The application leading to the interim order was heard on July 22, 2015. The Chambers judge did not render his decision until January 20, 2016. He ordered Mr. Lawson to pay spousal support to Ms. Rees commencing August 1, 2015. Accordingly, Mr. Lawson was in arrears of spousal support from the time the order was rendered. [4] Even though Ms. Rees was living in the family home, there was evidence, which the Chambers judge accepted, that Mr. Lawson was making significant payments with respect to that home to cover the mortgage, taxes, insurance and utilities ($4,476 per month). At para 59 of his judgment, the Chambers judge concluded: Therefore am ordering interim spousal support payments of $10,000 per month commencing August 1, 2015. Since the petitioner will be expected to pay all the bills associated with the matrimonial home in which she is living out of this amount except for the house insurance, and in August, September and October 2015 the respondent paid the bills for the matrimonial home, in each of those three months his spousal support payment will be $5,524 ($10,000 $4,476). As he stopped paying the bills for the family home at the end of October 2015 except for the house insurance, his November payment and all payments thereafter will be $10,000 per month until further court order. [5] Mr. Lawson contends there was no evidence to support the Chambers judge’s finding that he stopped paying the bills for the family home at the end of October 2015 and that that in fact was not the case. [6] Mr. Lawson now seeks stay with respect to the enforcement of the spousal support arrears only. He argues the amount of those arrears are in issue, that he should be credited up to and including January 2016 for his payments with respect to the family home and that there is merit to his appeal both with respect to Ms. Rees’s entitlement to and quantum of interim spousal support given the brief duration of the marriage (three years) and the prenuptial agreement signed by her. Mr. Lawson is concerned that if he is successful on his appeal, Ms. Rees would have no ability to repay any spousal support to him. He argues Ms. Rees had no income at the time of the application and that the main asset subject to division, pursuant to The Family Property Act, SS 1997, F-6.3, is the family home. That home was valued by Mr. Lawson in his property statement as of the date of application at $700,000, but its net value after payment of the mortgage ($566,718.08) and the homeline ($93,250) is only $40,000. Against Ms. Rees’s share of the family home would have to be credited the $25,000 she took from the line of credit after the separation. III. analysis [7] Rule 15(1) of The Court of Appeal Rules provides that the service and filing of notice of appeal does not stay the execution of an order for spousal support. Pursuant to Rule 15(2), judge of this Court has the power to give directions with respect to staying proceedings. [8] The principles pertaining to applications to lift stay of proceeding are well-settled. In making decisions with respect to such applications, the Courts objective is to prevent injustice and to ensure the results are as fair and equitable as possible. As stated by Lane J.A. in Ochapowace First Nation Araya (1994), 1994 CanLII 4598 (SK CA), 123 Sask 311 (CA) at para 11: The purpose [of lifting stay] is to minimize prejudice pending the appeal and to balance the competing interests of the respondent who has been successful against those of an appellant who ought not to be prejudiced simply by appealing. In my view, the same objectives apply when imposing stay, namely, to prevent injustice, to ensure the result is as fair and equitable as possible for all sides, to minimize prejudice and to balance the competing interests. [9] In this case, am satisfied stay should be imposed with respect to the enforcement of the spousal support arrears created by the interim order. First, there is an arguable issue that the Chambers judge’s conclusion that Mr. Lawson’s payment of expenses pertaining to the family home ceased after October 2015 was not supported by the evidence before him. Second, there is also an arguable issue with respect to the effect of the written agreement on the granting of interim spousal support and the quantum of that support given the circumstances of the parties, including their incomes, expenses, financial obligations (payment of family debt) and the fact they share custody of their son. Third, if the order is enforced, Mr. Lawson may be prejudiced. This is so because Ms. Rees’s means are very limited and thus there is a real possibility she would not be able repay any “overpayment” of spousal support. Fourth, Ms. Rees would not be unduly prejudiced by the imposition of stay as Mr. Lawson is paying ongoing support (spousal and child) of $12,726 per month and Ms. Rees, by her own admission, has taken $25,000 from the line of credit. Fifth, the imposition of stay with respect to only the spousal support arrears balances the competing interests at stake in the appeal. IV. conclusion [10] Mr. Lawson’s application to impose a stay with respect to enforcement of the retroactive spousal support arrears created by the January 20, 2016 interim order is allowed. That stay shall remain in place until the hearing of the appeal. To be clear, the stay does not affect ongoing spousal support payments or their enforcement. [11] Costs with respect to this application shall be left to the panel hearing the appeal. “Ryan-Froslie J.A.” Ryan-Froslie J.A.",d_2016skca37.txt,"HELD: The application was allowed and the stay of the enforcement of retroactive spousal support was granted.

Shealagh Mooney For the Plaintiff James R. Kitsul For the Defendant JUDGMENT DEMONG, Introduction [1] Reliable Truck Trailer Inc., hereafter referred to as ‘Reliable’, is mobile vehicle and associated equipment repair company situated in Pense, Saskatchewan. In the summer of 2015 it entered into an oral agreement with Super Save Disposal (Saskatchewan) Inc., hereafter referred to as ‘Super Save’, in which it agreed to provide, on ‘call out’ basis, repair services for Super Save’s fleet of trucks and associated equipment. When required, it would also provide shop supplies and parts to effect those services. [2] Between the summer of 2015 and June of 2016, it provided shop supplies, parts, and services on number of occasions. Early in the relationship, Super Save paid Reliable’s invoices as they were presented, but in or about November of 2015 it ceased to pay invoices as they became due. Reliable inquired as to the reasons why its invoices were not being paid, and it received what might best be described as less than clear and cogent explanation, other than that Super Save felt that some of the charges were too high. Some of these invoices were negotiated, reduced, and paid, and others were simply left unpaid without explanation. [3] Eventually Reliable demanded payment of its outstanding invoices and Super Save offered much smaller sum of money in satisfaction of those accounts. Reliable was not prepared to accept the lesser amount and it now brings this action to recover the amount that it says is due. It says that it provided goods and services on 22 separate occasions and invoiced Super Save total of $18,380.42. It was paid only $8,614.17. It seeks to recover the difference, which equates to the principal sum of $9,766.25. It seeks prejudgment interest on that amount and its legal costs for having to bring this action. [4] Super Save has defended the action and maintains that the amount that was charged for some of the goods and services that were provided was greatly in excess of the amounts that it should have been charged, and that, therefore, the amount sought was unreasonable. It argues that in the absence of an express term in the agreement as to the amount that could be charged for each of the goods and services that were provided, Reliable is not free to charge whatever it chooses to charge. It argues that this Court should determine the amount that is due by importing into the contract, an implied term, to the effect that the parties agreed to charge, and pay, reasonable price for the goods and services that were provided. [5] Reliable concedes that there was no overarching agreement on the totality of the prices to be charged for goods and services, but maintains that there had been, for short period of time, convention that had developed whereby Super Save agreed to four things. First, it alleges that the parties, either expressly or by inference, agreed that Reliable could charge minimum three hour call out charge on each occasion that Reliable was called out to provide services. Second, it argues that Super Save agreed to let Reliable charge an hourly rate for travel time to and from any given worksite. Third, it argues that it should be allowed to charge for the time it took to locate and obtain certain parts that it needed to do the repairs, (known as ‘parts call out’), and, that Super Save should also be required to pay for the actual time incurred by Reliable to source and obtain those parts. Fourth, it alleges that by virtue of the fact that Super Save did not originally take issue with Reliable’s practice of charging for each small product that it used in the course of providing mechanical services, it is now estopped from claiming that Reliable was not at liberty to charge for these ‘shop supplies’ at an amount in excess of ten percent of the total invoice. [6] In reply, Super Save adamantly denies that there was ever an express or implied agreement to allow Reliable to charge minimum three hour ‘call out fee’ for the services it provided, or to charge for travel time without express pre-approval. Second, it says that it made it absolutely clear to Reliable that it should, firstly, access Super Save’s own products, and if these were unavailable, it should have contacted Super Save. This would allow Super Save the opportunity to contact supplier to provide part in short order and at reduced cost. It argues that Reliable effectively padded its accounts by purchasing at higher rates and charging for unneeded travel time to obtain those additional products. Third, it says that Reliable has charged it for greater quantity of shop supplies than what was necessary to provide good and reasonable repair services. It argues that the amount it has been charged for these supplies should never have exceeded the industry norm that is to say, an amount not in excess of ten percent of the total services that were invoiced, to maximum of one hundred dollars. Finally, it argues that there were occasions in which Reliable charged for time that it did not expend in the performance of its duties. It argues that Reliable is subject to an overarching principle under this contract one of good faith. Since Super Save could not monitor Reliable’s time on each occasion that it performed services, Reliable had to ensure that the time it charged was accurate, and if it did not, then it has breached its contract with Super Save. The Law [7] I accept that the law demands, that in the absence of an express term in a contract which stipulates a price to be paid for goods, or services, or both, an implied term that the parties agreed to pay a fair and reasonable price for those goods and/or services be imported into that agreement. This Court has dealt with this principle, otherwise known as contractual quantum meruit, on countless previous occasions. Authority for this principle of law can be found by reference to our Court of Appeal’s decision in CH2M Hill Energy Canada, Ltd. Consumers’ Co-operative Refineries Ltd., 2010 SKCA 75 (CanLII), 362 Sask 104. [8] also accept that in ascertaining what might constitute fair and reasonable price to pay for goods and services, court is free to consider, as the litigants have invited me to do, fee which an industry would consider to be customary. [See Generally: Saskatchewan Government Insurance Medynski (Lakeland Towing), 2012 SKQB 157 (CanLII), 396 Sask 104 [Medynski]. Medynski identified other factors for consideration, including the cost to the claimant providing the service, the value placed on the service by the recipient, the contract price, and, what the recipient had previously paid for the same service but because the parties have not founded their arguments, or led evidence on these latter factors, they do not come into play in this decision. [9] also accept that the principles surrounding the law of estoppel by convention have been articulated and summarized by our Supreme Court in Ryan Moore, 2005 SCC 38 (CanLII) at para 59 [2005] SCR 53. Those essential principles demand that before estoppel by convention can be applied, the parties’ dealings must have been based on mutual assumption of fact or law, created by statement, conduct, or implied by silence, whereby one party has conducted itself (or acted) in reliance on that shared assumption so as to change its legal positions. In so doing, the party has suffered detriment, such that it would be unfair or unjust to allow one of the parties to resile or depart from the common assumption. [10] Finally, note that Reliable, as plaintiff in these proceedings, carries the burden of proof, on balance of probabilities, to convince the Court that it is entitled to the quantum of damages that it seeks. The Evidence, Findings of Fact, and Analysis [11] This Court finds itself, once again, embarking on what is, in essence, an accounting, based on an oral agreement, to be undertaken long after the provision of goods and services, based not necessarily on what either party had thought were the respective rights and obligations of the other, but rather, based on the evidence of experts who played no role in the provision of those goods and services. To any erstwhile reader of Provincial Court judgments, would urge you to give some consideration to setting down, in written form, those essential terms that will define any contractual relationship that you may wish to entertain. [12] Before discussing the accounting that is necessary, I wish to deal with the plaintiff’s argument regarding estoppel by convention. While I appreciate plaintiff counsel’s clear and cogent legal analysis of this area of law, I am not satisfied that the plaintiff has provided a sufficient evidentiary foundation upon which that legal argument can be predicated [13] While the parties agreed on flat labour rate of $85.00 per hour, the parties disagree on four significant things. First, the plaintiff says that it understood that it could charge for travel, but the defendant says that this was never part of the agreement (unless discussed beforehand where significant travel was anticipated). Second, the plaintiff was of the view that it could charge for three hour minimum attendance, but the defendant adamantly denies that this was agreed to. Third, the plaintiff maintains that it could charge for miscellaneous, but rather nominal shop supplies, at an identified value per part regardless of whether or not the quantum charged for those parts exceeded ten percent of the total invoice, but the defendant says that it did not agree to this term. Fourth, the plaintiff says that it could, when necessary, source larger but still rather nominal supplies (and charge for the larger retail price) without seeking pre-approval from the defendant, something which the defendant states was absolutely not in the agreement. [14] have heard evidence from each party asserting their respective views on these issues, and each of the parties present credibly. Because the evidence is in direct contradiction, it is incumbent on the plaintiff to lead some additional evidence to meet the burden of proof necessary to show that convention developed whereby the defendant habitually paid on the terms articulated by the plaintiff. [15] There was no evidence led as to precisely when the contract commenced, and therefore, have no evidence as to how much time elapsed, nor do know how many invoices may have been presented by the plaintiff and approved by the defendant, before the defendant started to take issue with the invoices. am, therefore, unable to determine how long the supposed ‘convention’ of paying these assorted costs occurred. Summer in Saskatchewan runs from June 21st until September 21st. When did the contract commence? While the parties both acknowledge that concerns were first raised in November of 2015, had three previous invoices been submitted, or was it ten or fifty or more? The Court has no way of knowing. [16] It is clear that prior to November of 2015 the defendant did not take issue with the invoices that were being submitted. The defendant has given evidence that this is precisely because the defendant thought the prices were within the confines of the agreement that it says it entered into to the effect that they would not take issue with fair and reasonable price. [17] It was only in November of 2015 that the defendants felt that they were being charged too much. None of the pre-November invoices were submitted into evidence. If they had been, and if they confirmed that convention had developed whereby the plaintiff was charging minimum of three hours for job that took less time; or that travel time was being included; or that there was specific charge for miscellaneous parts that exceeded fair and reasonable price; or that retail prices and downtime for obtaining parts were charged without the express authorization of the defendant, then an evidentiary foundation would exist for the plaintiff’s position, but as have said, none of these invoices were tendered into evidence. [18] Any argument advancing estoppel by convention must, at minimum, show the existence of mutual assumption, that is to say, practice or convention that had developed, over sufficient time, to convince court that the plaintiff would have relied upon this practice to its detriment. Unfortunately, while the plaintiff asserts that the convention had developed, the defendant denies it. Where is that additional evidence which would tip the balance in favour of the plaintiff? There is none. There is only an assertion which, in turn, has been denied by the defendant. [19] Nor am satisfied that the defendant’s failure to identify precisely why they were paying some accounts, but not others after November of 2015, would be evidence of the estoppel by convention that the plaintiff seeks to advance. say this because find as fact that the parties did not share the same mutual assumptions. The defendant felt that the charges would, simply put, be fair and reasonable, albeit at stated rate of $85.00 per hour. The plaintiff felt that it could charge differently, and in manner already described earlier in this judgment. Because no evidentiary foundation has been established to satisfy me that there was mutuality of assumption on the manner of invoicing for goods and services rendered, am not prepared to consider the estoppel by convention argument advanced by the plaintiff. [20] Even if this evidence had been led, I would still have reservations in accepting this argument, because I have heard no convincing evidence of detriment reliance. Plaintiff’s counsel has invited me to conclude that had the defendant not complied with its obligation to pay in accordance with these assumptions, then the plaintiff would have turned to alternative and more lucrative work. But there was no evidence presented in court on this point. That is to say, I did not hear any representative of the plaintiff assert that the plaintiff had the opportunity to seek more lucrative work, but declined to accept that more lucrative work, in reasonable reliance of an understanding that the defendant would pay the amount of money that it was seeking on the terms that it thought existed under the agreement. In fact, the evidence leads me to conclude otherwise. Notwithstanding the defendant’s ongoing concerns with the invoices that were submitted, and notwithstanding the defendant’s directions to reduce accounts on occasion, and notwithstanding that many invoices were not paid for an extended period of time, the plaintiff stood ready and willing to continue to work for the defendant. well understand plaintiff counsel’s desire to have me find the existence of detrimental reliance, but cannot find it on the evidence presented, and am not prepared to infer its existence. It would be as simple to draw an inference in favour of the defendant to the effect that the terms of the agreement as posited by the defendant, were being followed by the plaintiff up until November of 2015, when the plaintiff started to charge for goods and services in different manner. [21] Because I cannot, on the evidence, identify the express terms of the contract stipulating the price to be paid for the various goods and services that were provided, I am obligated to import an implied term to the effect that the parties agreed to charge, and pay, a fair and reasonable price. Twenty-two invoices are in dispute. Each of the parties have presented their own reasons why they feel the invoices as presented were either fair or inflated, and each called an expert to speak to what fair and reasonable price would be for each of the goods and services that were provided. Those experts have, in turn, looked to each of the invoices that are in dispute and have provided their opinion as to whether that particular invoice was fair and reasonable, and if not, what the price should have been, and why. [22] Before going through each invoice, wish to make certain findings which will assist in that endeavour. First, find that the parties were in general agreement that parts which would cost significant amount of money would not be purchased by the plaintiff unless it had first discussed the matter with the defendant. This seems to be reasonable industry standard. would expect that mechanic would exercise some discretion and contact client to advise of significant but unexpected cost for particular part. The problem is that no evidence was led as to where that price point would be, and can certainly understand the difficulty on the part of the plaintiff, on each and every occasion, in attempting to contact the defendant to ascertain whether or not he could, or should, source the part himself or seek the assistance of the defendant. While the defendant has offered oral evidence on what might have constituted the discounted price that it could have obtained if it had sourced the part rather than letting the plaintiff source the part, none of this evidence was supported with satisfactory evidence as to what that discounted price would actually be, and, in my view, these discounted amounts were only offered as an estimate. Therefore, am unwilling to discount invoices for this reason alone. That is to say, will not consider the defendant’s argument that reduce one or more invoices simply because the plaintiff incurred additional time and arguably higher retail cost to acquire certain parts what has been identified in the invoices as ‘parts call out’. [23] Second, accept the defendant’s evidence as it relates to those shop supplies that are necessarily included in any repair service. The defendant has led evidence to the effect that incidental goods, identified generally as shop supplies, such as brake cleaner, lubricants, washers, nuts, and bolts and other sundry items are not, in the repair industry, generally charged on piece meal basis, but rather are incorporated into an invoice as constituting the supplies component of the services delivered. These are, invariably, valued at ten percent of the total services charged, to maximum of one hundred dollars. accept the defendant’s expert evidence in this regard and will consider this sensible and practical protocol when assessing fair and reasonable quantum to be assessed for each invoice. [24] Third, am satisfied that in businesses such as the plaintiff’s, the industry anticipates that either travel time to and from the work location is regularly billed and paid for, or alternatively, that minimum period of time is charged for the call out. The evidence does not, however, suggest that both of these are normally charged. Were this so, there would be an element of double recovery. By example, an oil change may only take one hour. To charge three hour minimum charge for this service and then charge an additional one-half hour travel time to and from the vehicle in question, at stated rate of eighty-five dollars an hour, would mean that client is paying the equivalent of four hours, or $340.00 for an oil change, something which the defendant properly points out as completely unrealistic. Similarly, the plaintiff is, think, correct from an industry standard point of view, when it argues that it would be equally unreasonable for defendant to call out service provider to travel one-half hour to vehicle on the road side to change tire, and then drive home for one-half hour, all the while employing not only the plaintiff but his vehicle, and be charged only $42.50 for the time it took to change the tire. This would equate to an effective hourly rate for the employment of person and supporting supply vehicle for rather nominal rate of $28.50 per hour. [25] The evidence before the court suggested that the industry does regularly charge minimum number of hours per call. The defendant suggested that it would be between one and three hour minimum. The plaintiff suggested two to four hour minimum. am satisfied that three hour minimum charge, would, on the somewhat limited evidence provided to this Court, be reasonable industry standard. [26] Finally, where the remainder of the expert evidence conflicts, prefer the evidence provided by the defendant’s expert. The plaintiff’s expert was previous partner of the plaintiff, having sold his share of the company to Mr. Baran year earlier. This caused me concern as to his willingness to be objective. In addition, the evidence that he gave, more often than not, was given in an off-the-cuff manner, often without explanation or clarification. The bald assertion, for example, that an invoice looked ‘okay to him’ or ‘seemed fair’, without any further explanation, was not particularly helpful to the court. By comparison, the defendant’s expert took the time to explain why he felt that particular repair service took particular amount of time. [27] With these considerations in mind, have looked to the calculations and allowed three hour minimum charge out fee. have allowed an additional hour on parts call out and have allowed the actual price paid for those parts obtained. have limited the shop supplies to ten percent of the labour component of the invoice, and where the parties’ evidence conflicts as to the number of hours that should have been charged, have preferred the evidence of the defendant, subject to three hour minimum charge. have reviewed each invoice and make the following adjustments, which are inclusive of taxes: Invoice Amount Charged Adjusted Amount 431 $577.67 $308.55 432 $981.20 $514.25 526 $517.48 $352.55 578 $645.16 $308.55 583 $1,850.20 $1,291.40 595 $1,994.85 $1,131.35 597 $570.63 $359.98 598 $500.50 $361.35 599 $1,466.30 $884.95 600 $639.79 $322.85 601 $505.86 $308.50 605 $1,081.57 $617.10 606 $362.17 $308.55 607 $366.30 $312.68 608 $328.07 $308.55 609 $322.57 $308.55 610 $1,074.22 $529.91 611 $477.70 $308.55 612 $322.57 $308.55 617 $1,502.46 $813.45 622 $617.31 $361.35 623 $845.63 $580.80 Total Charged $18,702.99 Adjusted $10.902.32 [28] I find that a fair and reasonable price to be paid for the goods and services provided by the plaintiff to the defendant for the period of time for which the plaintiff went unpaid equates to the sum of $10,902.32. As it has been agreed between the parties that the sum of 8,614.17 was paid, there remains due and owing the sum of $2,288.15. award prejudgment interest on that sum from June 30th of 2016 in the further sum of $22.70. [29] The results of this trial have been mixed. The plaintiff has received some but not nearly all of the money that it was seeking. The defendant has been successful in reducing the amount of money that was sought, but not entirely. The plaintiff has not quantified its costs, but the defendant asks that this Court grant it out of pocket expenses that it incurred in having to retain an expert to give evidence on the issue of fair and reasonable price to be paid for the goods and services rendered. The defendant properly points out that this trial had to be adjourned on one occasion because the plaintiff had not adequately prepared, and that it had, therefore, incurred the cost of having his expert attend not once, but twice. [30] The defendant has submitted two statements of account from their expert. The first, for his initial attendance, equates to $1,032.30 broken down as $250.00 for travel from Grasswood, Saskatchewan, and eight hours at unit price of $85.00 per hour, for acting as an expert witness for the further sum of $680.00. Taxes were charged in addition to these sums. The second account is in the sum of $1,853.48 which includes $250.00 for travel to Regina and back, and two full eight hour days at $85.00 per hour for trial attendance. [31] While success is mixed, the defendant has properly pointed out that good faith performance of contract is an organizing principle of contract law, and as our Supreme Court noted in Bhasin Hrynew, 2014 SCC 71 (CanLII), [2014] SCR 494 parties to an agreement have common law duty to act honestly in the performance of contractual obligations. The defendant points out that while the accounts rendered by the plaintiff started to feel inordinately high commencing in November of 2015, it was not until sometime later that one of the managers of the defendant watched video recording of the plaintiff work for only couple of hours, and subsequently submit bill for greater number of hours. found that evidence credible, and the plaintiff provided no meaningful explanation. am satisfied that one of the reasons that the parties were unable to resolve this matter, and why this trial had to proceed, was to show that there was compelling evidence of the plaintiff’s failure to comply with its duty of honesty, and its corresponding tendency to pad an invoice. [32] am prepared to award portion of the costs that the defendant is seeking. am prepared to award the cost of the expert’s travel to and from Grasswood (a round trip distance of 500 kilometers) at per kilometer rate of $.42 for each of the two occasions that he was required to attend. disregard the eight hours billed for giving evidence on the first occasion as no trial proceeded at that time. award the further sum of $340.00 to reflect what consider to be reasonable two hours for the expert to prepare to give his evidence, and another two hours for his attendance at trial. In total award the defendant costs in the sum of $760.00 which will be set off against the plaintiff’s damages award. [33] In conclusion, award the plaintiff the sum of $1,550.85, which sum is to be paid immediately. P.

The application is opposed by one of the creditors, namely, Oak Bluff Estates Ltd. (""Oak Bluff"").
At the meeting of the unsecured creditors to approve the proposal, six unsecured creditors voted against the approval representing approximately $430,000 of the indebtedness of the Gustafson.
Forty-four unsecured creditors voted in favour of the proposal, representing approximately $1,800,000 of the indebtedness and thus the statutory requirement for the approval of the proposal was met.
Only Oak Bluff, representing approximately 3% of the indebtedness, appeared in opposition to the application for Court approval.

Respondent James A. Musgrave for the Appellant Roy F. Redgrave for the Respondent D. Bruce Clarke and Pamela J. Clarke-Priddle for the Respondent Trustee Appeal Heard: December 9, 1997 Judgment Delivered: February 13, 1998 THE COURT: The appeal is dismissed, per reasons for judgment of Freeman, J.A.; Pugsley and Cromwell, JJ.A., concurring. FREEMAN, J.A.: The respondent LaserWorks Computer Services Inc., a dealer in supplies for laser printers, made a proposal to its creditors under the provisions of the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act, R.S.C. 1985, c. B-3 (the BIA). A competitor, Datarite, operating through the appellant 3004876 Nova Scotia Limited, acquired the claims of eighteen creditors and voted them over the objections of LaserWorks at the meeting of creditors, defeating the proposal. Only two of the remaining sixteen creditors opposed the proposal. Acceptance required votes representing majority in number and two-thirds in value of the class of unsecured creditors present in person or by proxy. The Registrar of Bankruptcy of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia in Bankruptcy, Tim Hill, found: Upon the vote being taken, fourteen creditors with total claim value of $206,531.65 voted in favour of the proposal. Twenty creditors with total claim of $140, 370.00 voted against the proposal. Thus 41% of creditors representing 59% of the claims voted pro, and 59% of the creditors with 40.5% of the claims voted con. The proposal was defeated, subject to the resolution of the objections before the court today. At the hearing into the objections the Registrar, after hearing evidence from the appellant's solicitor Victor Goldberg, who was not counsel on the appeal, disallowed the appellant's votes. He found the proposal had been accepted by the votes of the other creditors. His decision was upheld by Justice Stewart on an appeal to the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia in Bankruptcy. Issues and Standard of Review The overriding issue is whether the court's inherent supervisory jurisdiction should be invoked to interfere in proposal to creditors under the BIA when it appears the statutory process is being used for purposes not contemplated by Parliament. The appellant submits it was true appeal before Justice Stewart, and not hearing de novo, on the authority of Re McCulloch Estate (1992), 1992 CanLII 2799 (NS SC), 13 C.B.R. (3d) 201 Tr. Div.) and Cockfield Brown Inc. (Trustee of) v. Reseau de Television TVA Inc. (1988), 1988 CanLII 875 (QC CA), 70 C.B.R. (N.S.) 59 (Que. C.A.) On further appeal to this court the grounds are whether Justice Stewart erred in: 1. Failing to reverse the Registrar's finding that 18 creditors of LaserWorks assigned their rights to the appellant; 2. Sustaining the Registrar's finding that Datarite engaged in an improper purpose in acquiring and voting the claims of the 18 creditors; 3. Sustaining the Registrar's finding that the Appellant's purpose in acquiring and voting the claims was relevant; and 4. Concluding that there was an abuse on minority of class of unsecured creditors and that duty in this respect was owed by the appellant. An appeal lies to this court under s. 193 of the BIA which reads in part: 193. Unless otherwise expressly provided, an appeal lies to the Court of Appeal from any order or decision of judge of the court in the following cases: (a) if the point at issue involves future rights; ... (e) in any other case by leave of judge of the court of appeal. The appellants assert future rights are involved and no leave is necessary. The respondents take no issue with this. Neither is issue taken with the jurisdiction of the Registrar and Justice Stewart to deal with the matters in question pursuant to the BIA. The issue is whether they erred. The appellant's submission with respect to the standard of review is that: the Registrar's discretion will not be disturbed on appeal unless he failed to consider or misconstrued material fact or violated principle of law. If the Registrar did not appreciate the nature of the evidence before him, it was open to the Supreme Court to substitute its discretion for that of the Registrar. There is also authority that the Registrar's decision should not be disturbed unless it was clearly wrong: Re Achilles (1993), 23 C.B.R. (3d) 20 B.S.S.C.). It cites Industrial Acceptance Corp. v. Lalonde, 1952 CanLII (SCC), [1952] S.C.R. 109 p. 120; Re Gilmartin bankrupt), [1989] nan All E.R. 835 (Ch. D.) p. 838; and Re Barrick (1980), 36 C.B.R. (N.S.) 286 (B.C.C.A.) p. 290. In Industrial Acceptance Estey J., writing for the Supreme Court of Canada, held at page 120 that: judgment rendered in the exercise of judicial discretion under s. 142 ought not to be disturbed by an appellate court, unless the learned judge, in arriving at his conclusion, has omitted the consideration of or misconstrued some fact, or violated some principle of law. The respondent LaserWorks urges that this court should only substitute its own discretion when the Registrar is clearly wrong. Apparent failure by the Registrar to appreciate the nature of the evidence before him is too low threshold: The court in Re Barrick ((1980), 36 C.B.R. (N.S.) 286 (B.C.C.A.)) substituted its discretion for that of the trial judge only after ruling that he misapplied legal test. Justice Taggert, at page 290, gives three reasons the Court of Appeal should substitute its discretion for that of the trial judge: In these circumstances, it would seem to me that the learned judge has not applied the correct test, has not given the effect that ought to be given to the trustee's report and has not appreciated the nature of the evidence which was before him. In these circumstances, think we are justified for substituting our discretion for that of the trial judge. On that basis the respondent submits the first three grounds of appeal fail. The Trustee under the Proposal submits that ""the Appellant has not satisfied the onus upon it in this appeal to overturn the decision of the Honourable Justice Stewart to decline to substitute her discretion for that of the Registrar."" The respondent also referred to the principles stated by McLachlin, J., in Toneguzzo-Norvel (Guardian Ad Litem of) v. Savein and Burnaby Hospital (1994), 1994 CanLII 106 (SCC), S.C.R. 114 at page 121, which this court has followed consistently: It is by now well established that Court of Appeal must not interfere with trial judge's conclusions on matters of fact unless there is palpable or overriding error. In principle, Court of Appeal will only intervene if the judge has made manifest error, has ignored conclusive or relevant evidence, has misunderstood the evidence, or has drawn erroneous conclusions from it: see P. (D.) v. S. (C.), 1993 CanLII 35 (SCC), [1993] S.C.R. 141, at pp. 188-89 (per L'Heureux-Dube J.), and all cases cited therein, as well as Geffen v. Goodman Estate, 1991 CanLII 69 (SCC), 1991] S.C.R. 353, at pp. 388-89 (per Wilson J.), and Stein v. The Ship ""Kathy K"", 1975 CanLII 146 (SCC), [1976] S.C.R. 802, at pp. 806-8 (per Ritchie J.). Court of Appeal is clearly not entitled to interfere merely because it takes different view of the evidence. The finding of facts and the drawing of evidentiary conclusions from facts is the province of the trial judge, not the Court of Appeal. These principles apply in bankruptcy matters, and provide guidance when, as here, the Registrar's findings have been upheld by judge of the Supreme Court. The Registrar's Decision The Registrar based his decision on the following findings: Before turning to deal with these submissions, it is essential that make some findings of fact. In large part the facts are uncontested. No affidavits were filed, but counsel agree that may rely on the minutes of the meeting of creditors, the testimony by Mr. Goldberg upon the section 163(2) examination, and the list provided by Mr. Goldberg in compliance with his undertaking on the examination. find that Datarite through its solicitor approached some but not all of the creditors of Laserworks with the intention of obtaining an assignment of those creditors' claims and consequently rights to vote on the proposal. The claims were obtained and the votes utilized to defeat the proposal. This would have the effect under section 57(a) of the BIA of placing LaserWorks into bankruptcy by virtue of deemed assignment. can only conclude that the purpose of Datarite was to effect the bankruptcy of LaserWorks. It is reasonable supposition that the purpose was to remove competitor from the marketplace. find that it was the intention of Datarite to put LaserWorks in bankruptcy. further find that the motive was to lessen competition. In my view, Datarite was engaged throughout in an improper purpose not contemplated by the BIA, the purpose of which is far removed from the use to which Datarite put it. It is apparent that the Registrar, in speaking of ""purpose"", included both motive or intent and the steps taken to give effect to that motive or intent. While the record is somewhat sparse, as counsel have remarked, there was evidence in support of these findings. am not satisfied that the Registrar failed to appreciate the nature of the evidence before him or that he was clearly wrong, or alternatively that he omitted the consideration of or misconstrued some fact, or violated some principle of law. The questions before this court relate to the effect of these findings. The Registrar disallowed the votes of the eighteen creditors represented by the appellant because he considered they had been cast for an improper purpose. In the absence of authority specific to proposals to creditors, he applied jurisprudence related to bankruptcy petitions, stating: It has long been held that the court will not grant petition in bankruptcy where the petition is filed for an improper purpose: Re E. De La Hooke (1934), 15 C.B.R. 485 (Ont. S.C.); Re Pappy's Good Eats Limited (1985), 56 C.B.R. (N.S.) 304 (Ont. S.C.); Dimples Diapers Inc. v. Paperboard Industries Corporation (1992), 15 C.B.R. (3d) 204 (Ont. G.D.); Re Shepard (1996), 1996 CanLII 18061 (MB QB), 40 C.B.R. (3d) 145 (Man. Q.B.). In Hooke the petitioner obtained an assignment of judgment against the debtor for the sole purpose of filing petition in bankruptcy and of removing the debtor as business competitor. In that case, as is the situation in this case, there was no evidence that the debtor had any business dealings with the party seeking to place the debtor in bankruptcy. The petition was dismissed. In Hooke the court made extensive reference to the decision of the House of Lords in King v. Henderson, [1898] A.C. 720. The comments of James, L.J., at p. 732 are particularly germane here: After what Lord Justice Cotton has said, in which entirely agree, people will probably think twice before they buy debts for the purpose of taking bankruptcy proceedings. Lord Justice Cotton had commented that the proceedings in bankruptcy were not taken to obtain payment of the debt, but rather the debt was purchased for the purpose of taking the proceedings. would simply add that in tight of the decision make here persons should certainly think twice before they purchase debts in order to defeat proposal. It is my opinion that the eighteen creditors are tainted with the improper motive of Datarite. In Pappy's Good Eats the petition was filed by creditor with genuine claim. The creditor entered into an agreement with three franchisees of the debtor. This agreement provided that the creditor would prosecute the bankruptcy proceedings while the franchisees financed the proceeding in exchange for share of the dividends. The motive of the franchisees was to bring about bankruptcy so as to terminate the franchise agreements between them and the debtor. The court found that there had been an improper use of the bankruptcy legislation. The effect of the agreement was to embroil the creditor in the improper objectives of the franchisees who were intermeddling in the proceeding. This tainted the whole proceeding. Clearly where the object of the intermeddling party is to bring about the bankruptcy of the debtor an improper purpose is present. The court will act to prevent such an abuse of the legislation. The other cases have referred to, Dimples Diapers Inc. and Shepard also deal with bankruptcy petitions instigated for an improper collateral purpose. In Dimples that purpose was to recover trademark and business opportunity. In Shepard that purpose was to obtain control of certain shares. While this case does not involve bankruptcy petition, it does involve the placing of Laserworks into bankruptcy. In my view, it would be wrong to allow Datarite to do in the proposal process what it cannot do by petition. Datarite's intention was to place Laserworks in bankruptcy. The motive was to remove competitor. That motive reveals an improper purpose. The court will not allow to be done by the back door what cannot be done by the front. By entering into this arrangement with the numbered company the eighteen creditors have tainted themselves and become embroiled in the improper purpose of Datarite. Their votes cannot stand. If Laserworks has the right to be free of this type of interference the Court must be able to fashion remedy. This court does have the inherent jurisdiction to supervise the bankruptcy process and consequently the conduct of creditors where that conduct constitutes an abuse of the provisions of the BIA. While creditors can certainly vote in their own best interest, they may not collude with third party to place debtor in bankruptcy for an improper purpose. Such activity lacks commercial morality and offends the integrity of the bankruptcy process. While Datarite was not permitted to vote the claims it had acquired, they remained debts of the insolvent debtor. Justice Stewart The first ground of appeal to this court, the issue of whether the claims of 18 creditors were actually assigned to Datarite, does not appear to have been ground of appeal before Justice Stewart. On the next two grounds of appeal, whether the Registrar failed to appreciate the evidence before him in concluding that Datarite's purpose in acquiring and voting the 18 claims was an improper one, and whether such purpose was relevant consideration, Justice Stewart, in upholding the Registrar, took different route to arrive at the same conclusion. She stated: Although stated in the context of voting by debenture holders when the majority had votes to modify the rights of the debenture holders in clause, the statements of principle by Viscount Haldane of the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council in British America Nickel Corporation v. M. J. O'Brien, 1927 CanLII 470 (UK JCPC), [1927] A.C. 369 at p. 371 are, no less, here applicable: To give power to modify the terms on which debentures in company are secured is not uncommon in practice. The business interests of the company may render such power expedient, even in the interests of the class of debenture holders as whole. The provision is usually made in the form of power, conferred by the instrument constituting the debenture security, upon the majority of the class of holders. It often enables them to modify, by resolution properly passed, the security itself. The provision of such power to majority bears some analogy to such power as that conferred by s. 13 of the English Companies Act of 1908, which enables majority of the shareholders by special resolution to alter the articles of association. There is, however, restriction of such powers, when conferred on majority of special class in order to enable that majority to bind minority. They must be exercised subject to general principle, which is applicable to all authorities conferred on majorities of classes enabling them to bind minorities, namely, that the power given must be exercised for the purpose of benefitting the class as whole, and not merely individual members only. And later at p. 373, noting this to be principle which does not depend on misappropriation or fraud, stated: but their Lordships do not think that there is any real difficulty in combining the principle that while usually holder of shares or debentures may vote as his interest directs, he is subject to the further principle that where his vote is conferred on him as member of class he must conform to the interest of the class itself when seeking to exercise the power conferred on him in his capacity of being member. The court, applying the principle stated by Viscount Haldane, should not sanction scheme if it appears that the majority have not voted bona fide in the interests of the class as whole. Justice Quilliam in an unreported decision of the High Court of New Zealand, Re: Farmers' Co-Operative Organization Society of New Zealand Limited (M 12/97, August 1987) in addressing the very issue of company whose proposal had been defeated by the votes cast by some of its direct competitors, in circumstances where the majority had the right to bind the minority by statute relied on the principle enunciated in British American Nickel Corp. Inc. v. O'Brien, supra, during the objection to votes application before him. He concluded the votes should be discounted as their votes were cast out of self-interest and not in the interest of the class of creditors as whole, or of the company. Unlike the present case, he did not determine there was specific activity of an improper purpose other than recognizing the votes were cast by creditors in direct commercial competition with the company. The Registrar, on his finding of facts, was not faced with preexisting creditor voting as it wished for whatever reason. He was faced with unique set of circumstances where he found the appellant shelf company and Datarite, competitor of Laserworks, involved selective, secret arrangement with creditors against Laserworks, an arrangement that would hurt some creditors and favour other creditors, although as competitors rather than as creditors, given its purpose of removing Laserworks from the market place and diverting from it, its asset, the market share, so it could be available to Datarite, all of which would result in the balance of the creditors receiving little, if anything, and Laserworks having been deemed bankrupt. Justice Stewart found that Datarite was not entitled to use its votes for motives unrelated to the best interest of the creditor group and only pursuant to its own self interest in removing potential competitor from the market place without regard to the interests of the other members of its class, the other voting creditors. She concluded: The Appellant is not entitled to use its votes to achieve this improper purpose. The Registrar's decision prevents an abuse on minority of the class of unsecured creditors and in so doing upholds fundamental and viable in the circumstances principle of class voting. He did not err in concluding improper purpose is relevant. On the fourth ground she found that while there had been no collusion by the eighteen creditors sufficient to deprive them of the right to vote, the Registrar was justified in determining that in the circumstances Datarite controlled the way the claims were voted. She upheld the Registrar's decision and declined to interfere with it. Assignment The First Ground The appellant submits that the judge erred when she declined to address and reverse the Registrar's finding that 18 unsecured creditors of LaserWorks assigned their rights to the appellant. On proper appreciation of the evidence, it submits, no assignment took place. It states in its factum: The appellant did not take issue with the Registrar's finding that four of the 18 creditors received payment for them prior to the vote .... Each of the four creditors provided executed assignments and proxies to Mr. Goldberg, and each assignment was completed by payment. The 14 remaining creditors did not receive payment for their claims prior to the vote, and the appellant submits that the teamed Registrar failed to appreciate the evidence in this regard when he concluded that the claims of these 14 creditors had been assigned to the appellant before the vote was taken. LaserWorks submits that the Registrar did not decide whether or not the claims voted by Datarite were assigned: The conclusion of the Registrar with respect to the assignment issue is: Given my findings with respect to the intent and motive of Datarite, find it unnecessary to consider whether Datarite should have exercised vote or 18. The reference to vote or 18 relates to the assignment of claims. If the 18 claims had been assigned to the Appellant, the authorities establish that only one vote could be cast on the proposal. The Registrar found it ""unnecessary to consider"" this issue. We submit that the Registrar would need to consider the issue before making decision. It seems reasonable that the Registrar did not intend to decide whether the claims were assigned because it would not determine the question before him. Even if the appellant were restricted to voting as one creditor, leaving majority of creditors in favor of the proposal, the value of the claims voted by the appellant was sufficient to defeat the proposal and thus achieve the appellant's objective. If the claims had been assigned to the appellant, the voting rights would have been merged and the appellant could only cast one vote for the value of the claims it had acquired. If the creditors retained their own claims, the appellant could have voted once for each creditor for whom it held proxy. There is authority for this proposition and the parties seem in agreement with it. The rationale is clear. Each creditor has vote, to be exercised in person or by proxy. If the claim is assigned, the assignor ceases to be creditor. It loses its right to vote in person or to control the vote of the proxy. The assignor becomes creditor and is able to vote its claim, no matter the amount of the claim. If it acquires the claims of other creditors the amount of its claim increases, but it does not pluralize itself. It remains one creditor, entitled to one vote. The appellant referred to Toia v. Cie de Cautionnement Alta Inc. (1989), 77 C.B.R. (ICS.) 264 (Que. S.C.). The respondent insurance company paid out 19 claims against bankrupt under performance bond; each claimant signed release and subrogated its claims to the respondent, which filed 19 proofs of claim. The Official Receiver permitted 19 votes but the Quebec Supreme Court reversed this, allowing only one vote. The appellant purports to distinguish Toia because ""there the respondent completed the assignments by payment prior to the vote."" In my view it is of small importance whether the appellant bought for cash or on credit. The situation seems clear when creditors authorize votes on their behalf by proxy: each creditor is entitled to its vote and the proxy may cast votes for several creditors. It is equally clear when creditor assigns its claim to another creditor: the assignee creditor has only one vote. This was the case with the four creditors whose assigned claims were accepted and paid for by the appellant. It is less clear with respect to the remaining fourteen creditors who had executed assignments to the appellant. The appellant says they had not yet been accepted, pending proof of the claims. However they had to be proven before they could be voted, and their values were proved for the purpose of calculating their percentage of the total of the unsecured claims. Any condition on the assignment would appear to have been met. The intention of the parties must be determined: did the appellant vote those claims on its own behalf, or as an agent exercising the rights of the original creditors by proxy? If it had been necessary for the Registrar to decide this question, there was evidence before him that the original creditors had given control over their claims to the appellant by entering into enforceable contracts to assign them. That is, while the appellant voted the claim in the form of proxies, in fact it had acquired sufficient interest in the claims to vote them in its own right, as assignee, as though the assignments had been fully executed. It is clearly an improper practice for an assignee to purport to vote as the proxy of creditor which has assigned its claim, thereby ceasing to be creditor. If Datarite was otherwise entitled to vote at the creditor's meeting, it had one vote for the full value of the claims it had acquired. It was not justified in voting by proxy. I would dismiss this ground of appeal. Evidence of Datarite's purpose the second ground Mr. Goldberg testified as follows to Datarite's purpose in buying claims and voting against the proposal: Q. Can you tell me the benefit the numbered company will get in the bankruptcy of LaserWorks? A. Well, the purpose of the numbered company hopefully in buying the claims is that it'll buy the claims at reduced price and get full payment one day. The appellant states that Mr. Goldberg's evidence was uncontradicted, and submits: It is respectfully submitted that the Registrar was clearly wrong in his appreciation of the evidence. The learned Judge concluded that the Registrar made finding of credibility with respect to Victor Goldberg's evidence on this issue. However, the Registrar's decision does not indicate that Mr. Goldberg's evidence on this key issue was even considered. The Registrar simply failed to address Mr. Goldberg's evidence on this issue at all. It is therefore open to this Honourable Court to substitute its discretion for that of the Registrar. It is submitted that the Registrar could only find an improper purpose on the record by overlooking the only piece of direct evidence before him on Datarite's intentions. Mr. Goldberg was obviously only stating his client's ostensible intentions, not its true ones. The Registrar in fact had commented on Mr. Goldberg's evidence after quoting passage from the minutes indicating how he had responded to certain questions. He said: It is not unfair to say that Mr. Goldberg was obtuse to very great degree. While this does not necessarily confirm suspicion as to the motives of his client, it does explain the concern expressed by the principals of LaserWorks. The evidence before the Registrar included the proposal itself, which shows total liabilities of $585,459 of which $247,651 was unsecured, $334, 838 secured and $2,970 preferred. Assets totaled $306,158 including book debts of $170,000, leased vehicles 95,958, stock in trade $18,500, cash in the bank (which was the principal secured creditor) $8,000 plus fixtures, furnishings and equipment. Virtually all of the assets would be subject to security. The overall deficiency is shown as $279,301. It is difficult to see basis for Mr. Goldberg's client's optimism that it might get full payment for the claims it bought at reduced value, or indeed, to see any significant source of dividends for unsecured creditors, on bankruptcy. Datarite had not been creditor of LaserWorks before the proposal. There was evidence, however, that it had been competitor. The Registrar was entitled to consider the evidence as whole in making findings of fact and drawing inferences that led him to the conclusion that: ... Datarite's intention was to place Laserworks in bankruptcy. The motive was to remove competitor. That motive reveals an improper purpose... In my view the Registrar did not fail to appreciate the evidence nor otherwise err in arriving at this conclusion. Neither did Justice Stewart err in upholding him. I would dismiss this ground of appeal. Is Purpose Relevant? The Third Ground. (i) The Statute The appellant submits that the trial judge erred in upholding the Registrar's decision that Datarite engaged in an improper purpose in acquiring and voting the claims of the 18 creditors, and that its purpose was relevant. In view of the conclusion on the second ground that the Registrar did not err in finding improper purpose, the appellant is left with the relevancy argument. It argues that the authority relied on by the Registrar, De La Hooke, Pappy's Good Eats, Dimples Diapers and Shepard, arises under s. 43(7) of the BIA which deals only with bankruptcy petitions: 43(7) Where the court is not satisfied with the proof of the facts alleged in the petition or of the service of the petition, or is satisfied by the debtor that he is able to pay his debts, or that for other sufficient cause no order ought to be made, it shall dismiss the petition. (emphasis added.) It cites the discussion of the discretion thus created in Houlden Morawetz, Bankruptcy and Insolvency Law of Canada (3d) at p. 2-50: Section 43(7) permits the court to dismiss petition if it concludes ""that for any other sufficient cause no order ought to be made"". Section 43(7) confers discretion; the exercise of that discretion must be founded on sound judicial reasoning based on credible evidence and must be exercised judicially according to common sense and justice in manner which does not occasion miscarriage of justice. Section 43(7) clearly does not create the supervisory jurisdiction of the court over the bankruptcy regime; it is simply concrete application of discretionary power inherent in the scheme of the BIA. Each step in the bankruptcy process, whether initiated by creditor's petition for receiving order or debtor's assignment for the benefit of creditors, is supervised by court officials or the court itself. For example s. 108 in Part V, the Administration of Estates, relates to ""any meeting of creditors"". At the meeting which gave rise to this appeal the chairman applied s. 108(3): 108(3) Where the chairman is in doubt as to whether proof of claim should be admitted or rejected, he shall mark the proof as objected to and allow the creditor to vote subject to the vote being declared invalid in the event of the objection being sustained. Section 187(9) provides broad directive: 187(9) No proceeding in bankruptcy shall be invalidated by any formal defect or by any irregularity, unless the court before which an objection is made to the proceeding is of opinion that substantial injustice has been caused by the defect or irregularity and that the injustice cannot be remedied by any order of that court. The short answer to the question raised by this ground of appeal is that motive or purpose is relevant to court authorized to remedy substantial injustice. The appellant takes the narrow position that proposals are outside the discretionary supervisory jurisdiction of the court because they are not specifically included in s. 43(7) or some equivalent provision. This submission cannot be sustained. There is similarity between creditor's petition for receiving order under s. 43 and refusal of proposal. In either case it is something done by creditor or creditors that places the debtor in bankruptcy, likely against its will. But proposal is also similar to an assignment: the debtor has itself resorted to protection under the BIA and its proposal will be deemed to be an assignment unless it succeeds in persuading its creditors to accept it in their own best interests. The appellant submits that s. 54 is the provision in the proposals Part of the BIA which corresponds with s. 43(7). S. 54 provides: 54(1) The creditors may, in accordance with this section, resolve to accept or may refuse the proposal as made or as altered at the meeting or any adjournment thereof. While s. 43(7) provides an occasion for the exercise of the court's supervisory jurisdiction, an examination focused on the merits of the petition itself, s. 54(1) does not. Such an examination of proposal is not necessary at that stage. The validity of the claims voted at the creditor's meeting at which the proposal is accepted or refused is subject to the court's scrutiny under s. 108(3). If the proposal is refused by regular vote of creditors it vanishes and further examination is unnecessary; the debtor is deemed under s. 57(a) to have made an assignment in bankruptcy and the matter proceeds as on an actual assignment. If the creditors approve the proposal, it is then examined on its merits under s. 59, which provides: (1) The court shall, before approving the proposal, hear report of the trustee in the prescribed form respecting the terms thereof and the conduct of the debtor, and, in addition, shall hear the trustee, the debtor, any opposing, objecting or dissenting creditor and such further evidence as the court may require. (2) Where the court is of the opinion that the terms of the proposal are not reasonable or are not calculated to benefit the general body of creditors, the court shall refuse to approve the proposal, and the court may refuse to approve the proposal whenever it is established that the debtor has committed any one of the offences mentioned in sections 198 to 200. Proposals are therefore just as much part of the bankruptcy regime, and just as subject to the supervision of the court exercising an equitable jurisdiction under the statute, as petitions and assignments. In Whiteman v. UDC Finance Ltd., [1992] NZLR 684, Hardie Boys J., writing for the New Zealand Court of Appeal with respect to the New Zealand Insolvency Act, which varies in detail but not in principle from our own, said at p. 691 that proposals are merely the other side of the coin to petition for adjudication. The only distinction between petitions and proposals in the exercise of the court's supervisory jurisdiction is that under the scheme of the BIA occasions for judicial scrutiny occur at different stages of the process. In the present appeal, court intervention was occasioned by objections to proofs of claims affecting the right to vote at the creditors' meeting considering the proposal. The correct procedure was followed, and the objections were considered by the Registrar who had jurisdiction under s.187(9) to remedy substantial injustice. Motive or purpose is not relevant to objections to proofs of claim based on statutory exceptions under the BIA. These are established in several sections, including s.109(1), persons who had not duly proved and lodged claim; s.54(3), relative of the debtor (who may vote against but not for proposal); 109(4), the debtor as proxy for creditor; s.109(6), creditor who did not deal with the debtor at arm's length (with exceptions); s.110(1), person with claim acquired after the bankruptcy unless the entire claim is acquired; s.111, creditor with claim on or secured by current bill of exchange (subject to conditions); s.112, creditor holding security (subject to conditions); and s. 113(2), trustee as proxy (subject to restrictions). See also s. 109, the trustee as creditor. (It will be noted that many of these exceptions arise from circumstances that could give rise to conflict of interest. This will be considered further under the fourth ground of appeal.) However the statutory exceptions are not code exhausting the forms in which substantial injustice may manifest itself. Objections will be sustained under s. 108(3) if they result from crime or tort against the debtor or crteditor. In the present appeal, and in the authorities cited by the Registrar, the substantial injustice assumes the guise of tortious behavior, to which motive is relevant. In the s. 108(3) context the commonest torts, or instances of substantial injustice arising from tortious behavior, relate to abuse of process and fraud. However conspiracy to harm was also found in Dimples Diapers. Tortious or tort-tike behavior falling short of fully developed tort susceptible of formal proof or definition can nevertheless result in substantial injustice, particularly for persons at point so vulnerable they must resort to insolvency protection. (See Shepard.) In my view that is why Parliament chose the language it did in s.187(9): to create discretionary jurisdiction in courts that is not fettered, for example, by the high standards required for establishing such torts as abuse of process in other contexts. What remains to be considered is the threshold level of the substantial injustice which will result in remedial action by the court. (ii)The Authorities The four cases cited by the Registrar establish that the threshold is crossed when the BIA is used for an improper purpose. An improper purpose is any purpose collateral to the purpose for which the bankruptcy and insolvency legislation was enacted by Parliament. Farley J. held in Dimples Diapers that: the Bankruptcy Act, R.S.C. 1985, c. B-3 has as its purpose the provision of ""the orderly and fair distribution of the property of bankrupt among its creditors on pari passu basis"". (L.W.Houlden and C.H.Morawetz, Bankruptcy Law of Canada, 3rd ed. (looseleaf) (Toronto: Carswell, 1989) at p. 1-3 [A&4].... In the cases cited the improper purpose takes the form of abuse of process or tortious behavior closely analogous to abuse of process. In each case the court reacted to what could be seen as substantial injustice. The remedy of choice arising under s. 43(7) is refusal of the petition. The appropriate remedy in the present case is rejection of the tainted votes. In vigorous judgment in Dimples Diapers Farley J. dismissed the bankruptcy petition because it was brought for an improper purpose, to recover the diaper trademark and business opportunity, and awarded damages for abuse of process and conspiracy against three creditors. He held at p. 219: .. The tort of abuse of process consists in the misuse of legal process for any purpose other than that which it was designed to serve. It is immaterial in establishing abuse of process that the process was properly commenced or founded by the defendants and it does not matter that the process be concluded in the instigator's favour. The improper purpose is the gravamen of liability. See Unterreiner v. Wilson (1982), 1982 CanLII 1814 (ON SC), 40 O.R. (2d) 197, 24 C.C.L.T. 54, 142 D.L.R. (3d) 588 (H.C.), at p. 203 [O.R.], appeal dismissed (1983), 1983 CanLII 1968 (ON CA), 41 O.R. (2d) 472, 146 D.L.R. (3d) 322 (C.A.), and J.G.Fleming, The Law of Torts, 7th ed. (Sydney: Law Book, 1987) at pp. 591-592. Potts J. In R. v. Cholkan Co. v. Brinker (1990), 1990 CanLII 6865 (ON SC), 71 O.R. (2d) 381, C.C.L.T. (2d) 291, 40 C.P.C. (2d) (H.C). at p. [C.P.C.] said: Most recently, Montgomery J. writing for the divisional Court in Bentham v. Rothbart (1989), 36 O.A.C. 13 (Div. Ct.), stated: The constituent elements of the tort of abuse of process are: (a) collateral improper purpose such as extortion; and (b) definitive act or threat in furtherance or purpose not legitimate in the use of the process. Montgomery J. was clearly using ""extortion"" as an example only. Any crime or tort would be an improper purpose. In de la Hooke the petition was dismissed when petitioning creditors, who had had no business dealings with the debtor, obtained an assignment of judgment debt he owed for the sole purpose of filing petition in bankruptcy to remove him as business competitor who was using similar trade name. Registrar Cook cited number of leading English cases relevant to the circumstances of the present appeal. These included King v. Henderson, [1898] A.C. 720 at p. 731 which considered abuse of process or fraud on the court; Ex Partre Griffin; in re Adams (1879), 12 Ch. Div. 480 in which worthless debt was purchased to take proceedings in bankruptcy to force the debtor to give up just debt, causing Brett L.J. to remark, ""a viler fraud have never heard of""; Ex parte Harper; In re Pooley (1882), 20 Ch. D. 585 at p. 692 in which buying debt to force bankruptcy in order to get rid of trustee was found ""a gross abuse of the bankruptcy laws;"" and In re Debtor [1928] Ch. 199 at p. 211 in which the bankruptcy laws were used for the collateral purpose of extortion. In Pappy's Good Eats petition was denied when three franchisees of the debtor, who were not creditors, contracted with the petitioning landlord who had $65,000 unsatisfied judgment against the debtor, to pay the landlord's costs to petition the debtor into bankruptcy so they would be relieved of obligations under their franchise agreements. Henry J. held the effect of the agreement was to ""embroil the petitioning creditor in the improper objective of the purchasers who as non-creditors have no status in these proceedings and are intermeddling in it. The whole proceeding is inescapably tainted; the petition must be dismissed."" He found that ""the abuse occurred when the parties agreed or arranged improperly to use the facility of the Act to advance the objectives of the franchisees to cause injury to the debtor."" In Shepard it was found that the purpose of the petitioner was to gain control over certain shares of the debtor, an important business advantage. ""It is not appropriate or indeed, correct in law, to have the courts facilitate such an objective when the objective is very clearly the main purpose of the application."" This finding is consistent with finding of substantial injustice resulting from abuse of process. (iii) The Present Case It is most significant that the appellant was not creditor of LaserWorks prior to the proposal. Intermeddling by strangers to the pre-existing debtor creditor relationship for an improper purpose was determinative factor in Pappy's Good Eats. The practice of buying dubious claims against an insolvent for purposes foreign to the bankruptcy process was denounced in the English cases cited in de la Hooke. The Registrar in the present case understandably looked askance at it. Few legitimate reasons come to mind for buying into bankrupt estate. When somebody does so, it is matter of common sense to assume, subject to correction, they intend to use the bankruptcy process for some purpose it was not meant for. In the present case it was readily apparent that mischief was afoot. The ""orderly and fair distribution of the property of bankrupt among its creditors on pari passu basis"" was not the purpose behind the acts of the appellant. The appellant made separate approaches to each of the eighteen creditors whose claims it succeeded in acquiring. It negotiated separate deal with each for varying considerations presumably seen to be more advantageous to the creditor than reliance on the proposal. From most of them it obtained an agreement, an executed assignment and proxy. It purported to vote the proxies of former creditors whose claims had been assigned to it. Its purpose was not an orderly recovery of debts from the debtors assets but to limit competition by the debtor in its own marketplace by rejecting the debtor's proposal and forcing it into bankruptcy. The appellant was acting on its own making sharp use of the provisions of the BIA for its own advantage. There was no evidence that the co-operating creditors were part of conspiracy with the appellant to injure the debtor. Otherwise the tort of conspiracy to injure could be found where the predominant purpose of the appellant's conduct is to cause injury to the plaintiff, whether the means used by the defendants are lawful or unlawful: Canada Cement LaFarge Ltd, v. British Columbia Lightweight Aggregate Ltd., [1983] S.C.C. 452. It is undeniable that the appellant caused injury to the debtor not negligently but deliberately. The debtor made its proposal to avoid bankruptcy; bankruptcy therefore must have been seen by Laserworks as more injurious alternative than acceptance of the proposal by the creditors. Laserworks had the heavy burden of persuading its creditors that their best interests lay in approving the proposal; it did not have the impossible burden of dissuading financially stronger competitor bent on using the provisions of the BIA to destroy it as competitor. The appellant derailed the proposal procedure to force the debtor into bankruptcy. Using bankruptcy to cause injury, thereby eliminating the debtor as an entity capable of competing in the marketplace, is abusive of the purpose of the BIA. It does not qualify as ""the orderly and fair distribution of (its) property."" Annihilation of an individual business or company may be an unfortunate consequence of bankruptcy, an unavoidable side-effect, but it is not the purpose of the BIA. Use of the Act to accomplish such an objective is in my view so abusive of the purpose of the legislation as to engage the supervisory jurisdiction of the courts under s. 187(9). It is substantial injustice to be remedied. No distinction in principle is possible between the present case and the four cited by the Registrar. He identified the problem and he applied the remedy. He was upheld on appeal in the Supreme Court. I would dismiss this ground of appeal. Class voting The Fourth Ground In upholding the Registrar Justice Stewart added string to his bow by introducing the class voting analysis of Viscount Haldane in British American Nickel. In light of the holdings respecting the second and third grounds of appeal, it is not necessary to the outcome to decide this ground. The appellant submits that the trial judge was wrong in concluding there was an abuse on minority of class of unsecured creditors and that duty in this respect was owed by the appellant: nan There was no abuse on minority of the unsecured creditors and no duty was imposed on the Appellant to cause votes to be cast in the best interest of the class. Without such duty the learned Judge was without authority to consider Datarite's motives and the votes in question should have been allowed. In British America Nickel Viscount Haldane stated that where power is conferred on special class, majority in exercising power to modify the rights of minority must exercise that power in the interests of the class as whole. nan But their Lordships do not think that there is any real difficulty in combining the principle that while usually holder of shares or debentures may vote as his interest directs, he is subject to the further principle that where his vote is conferred on him as member of class he must conform to the interest of the class itself when seeking to exercise the power conferred on him in his capacity of being member... In the present case the minority creditors saw their alternative of furthering their best interests by voting in favour of the proposal disappear when the votes amassed by the appellant were exercised, not in the interest of making the most favourable recovery from combination of distribution of the assets of LaserWorks and its continuance in business as customer or potential customer, but in the interests of removing competitor of Datarite. Justice Stewart was concerned that the other creditors, as well as the debtor, suffered from the abusive use of the provisions of the BIA. Of the sixteen creditors who did not assign their claims to Datarite, fourteen voted in favour of the proposal. The rationale for Viscount Haldane's conclusion in British America Nickel was carefully reviewed by Hardie Boys J. in Whiteman v. UDC Finance Ltd. The court found it should not intervene in the refusal of proposal by creditors including several who were being sued by the debtor, and who therefore had collateral interest in seeing him out of business. Hardie Boys J. cited the same passage quoted above by Justice Stewart from Vicount Haldane's judgment. It concludes that there is restriction on powers conferred on majority of special class in order to enable that majority to bind minority: .. They must be exercised subject to general principle, which is applicable to all authorities conferred on majorities of classes enabling them to bind minorities; namely, that the power given must be exercised for the purpose of benefiting the class as whole, and not merely individual members only. Hardie Boys J. considered Re Farmers' Co-operative, which was also cited by Justice Stewart, in which votes of several creditors who were competitors of the debtor were disallowed .. In later development of the same matter, but not now involving the Court's sanction under s. 205, Gallen J. accepted that the Court has an overriding control, not limited to the approval stage under s. 205, and may restrict right to vote where the equities of particular situation require it: see [1992] NZLR 348. It is unnecessary for present purposes to decide whether these cases were correctly decided, for even if they were, the principle is not of unlimited application, and does not apply to the exercise of voting rights generally. This is clear from what Viscount Haldane said in the British America Nickel case. Immediately after the passage already quoted, his Lordship said Subject to this, the power may be unrestricted. It may be free from the general principle in question when the power arises not in connection with class, but only under general title which confers the vote as right of property attaching to share. Thus in Pender v. Lushington (1877) Ch. D. 70, 75-76 Jessel MR said there is: no obligation on shareholder of company to give his vote merely with view to what other persons may consider the interests of the company at large. He has right, if he thinks fit, to give his vote from motives or promptings of what he considers his own individual interest. While the voting rights conferred by Part XV of the Insolvency Act are not akin to ""right of property attaching to share"", they are rights conferred without reservation. There is no requirement for class voting; there is instead general right conferred equally on all creditors. The rationale of the principle does not apply. It is well settled that the motive (short of fraud) of petitioning creditor, no matter how reprehensible, is irrelevant to his right to obtain an order of adjudication: King v. Henderson [1898] AC 720, Re King, ex parte Commercial Bank of Australia Ltd. (No. 2) [1920] VLR 490. The motive of creditor voting on proposal, really the other side of the coin to petition for adjudication, can be no different. That is not to say that there may be no remedy in an extreme case, such as fraud or mistake. But certainly where, as here, there are perfectly legitimate reasons for opposing the proposal, creditor is not to be denied that right because he may have some other motive as well... If the exception made for fraud is broadened to ""substantial injustice"" would take Hardie Boys J.'s conclusions to be fair statement of the law in Canada as well, as applied by Canadian courts in the cases cited by the Registrar. The New Zealand court included mistake as well as fraud as an exception. creditor is not to be deprived of the right to vote for wrongful motives alone; motive must be coupled with tortious act to support finding of improper purpose. Canadian case supporting broad interpretation of the right of creditors to vote on proposals is Re Bedard Louis Inc. (1991) 1991 CanLII 3533 (QC CA), 22 C.B.R. (3d) 218. The debtor sued three creditors who had sought to seize his goods before judgment for amounts far exceeding their claims against him. One creditor petitioned for receiving order, and the Quebec Superior Court rejected the debtor's argument that the petitioner was not creditor because of the large undecided actions. The debtor was declared bankrupt and later filed proposal. The trustee refused to let the three creditors vote at creditors' meeting considering the proposal because of possible conflict of interest. The Superior Court allowed an appeal against the trustee's decision, and the Quebec Court of Appeal upheld the Superior Court, holding (headnote) that: No provision of the Act authorizes the trustee to exclude creditor whom he considers to have conflict of interest. The debtor's action for damages against the creditors, which constituted debt not yet payable, did not strip the creditors of their status of ordinary creditors. By the proposal, the debtor presented the creditors with terms of payment which were different from those provided legally by contract. The Act was intended to allow the voting of all duly acknowledged creditors. Exceptions to that rule were properly specified in the Act and none of them pertained to creditor against whom debtor had filed legal proceedings. The Proposals Part of the BIA recognizes only two classes of creditors, secured creditors who are presumably protected by the security they hold, and unsecured creditors, all the others. This does not appear to meet Viscount Haldane's criterion of special class bound to exercise its voting rights for the benefit of the class as whole. That concept seems surplus to and difficult to reconcile with the scheme of the BIA where, as the Quebec Court of Appeal found in Bedard, all duly acknowledged creditors are entitled to vote as they please, subject to exceptions set out in the Act (and the exception for tortious or criminal behavior.) As remarked above, those exceptions reflect the manner in which Parliament dealt with conflicts of interest which might arise in the context of voting on proposals. Parliament has obviously legislated on the subject and cannot be assumed to have created by implication an exception for general, unspecified, conflicts of interest. The mere fact that creditor is also competitor of the debtor or otherwise in conflict of interest with the debtor does not give rise to statutory exception. The scheme for protecting minority creditors adopted under the BIA was not class voting concept but rather system of specific exceptions coupled with discretionary power in the courts to remedy substantial injustice. It is not necessary to make final determination on this point. The rational of Justice Stewart's decision is found in her adoption of the Registrar's conclusions as to improper purpose in the following passage: The applicant is not entitled to use its votes to achieve this improper purpose. The Registrar's decision prevents an abuse on minority of the class of unsecured creditors and in so doing upholds fundamental and viable in the circumstances principle of class voting. He did not err in concluding improper purpose is relevant. That is, while the Registrar's decision was consistent with considerations of class voting, he was upheld on his findings of improper purpose. I would dismiss the fourth ground of appeal. Conclusion The appellant attempted to abuse the provisions of the BIA by using them to intermeddle for an improper purpose with the proposal of a debtor to its creditors, giving rise to a substantial injustice. This affected not only the debtor but the remaining creditors who supported the proposal. The Registrar made no error in discerning this from the evidence and in exercising the court's discretionary jurisdiction to remedy substantial injustice. He was upheld on appeal to the Supreme Court. The appellant's actions are not to be condoned. I would dismiss the appeal with costs which I would fix costs at $3,000 plus disbursements to the Respondent and $3,000 plus disbursements to the Trustee. Freeman, J. A. Concurred in: Pugsley, J.A.

Counsel: E.F. Anthony Merchant, Q.C. for the plaintiffs Robert Leurer, Q.C. and Markus Kremer for the defendants JUDGMENT KEENE J. October 30, 2015 I. THE CLAIM, DEFENCE AND APPLICATIONS [1] The original plaintiff, Mr. Sandoff, issued his claim under The Class Actions Act, SS 2001, C-12.01 on October 8, 2013. This claim was subsequently amended and will refer to the amended paragraph numbers. The claim seeks damages against the defendants, Loblaw Companies Limited and Loblaws Inc. [Loblaws]. The claim in part states: 10. This claim concerns the misleading and deceptive advertising of “Low Sodium” beverages by Loblaws and seeks to recover damages on behalf of those who purchased the Defendants’ “Low Sodium” beverages (the “Class” or “Class Members”) but ultimately received beverages which were no lower or not appreciably lower in sodium than other, non-“Low Sodium” products. 17. The Low Sodium Products do in fact have minimal sodium content; however, their sodium content is equivalent to, or greater than, that of comparable alternative products, and not “low” in relative sense. 18. The application of the Low Sodium Label to Low Sodium Products is deceptive and misleading in that it implies the presence of reduced, healthier amount of sodium when, in fact, the sodium content of the Low Sodium Products is similar to, if not greater than, the sodium content of other, regularly packaged products who do not include Low Sodium Label (the “Misrepresentation”). 19. On August 29th, 2013 at approximately 6:53 p.m., the Plaintiff purchased Low Sodium Product, and more specifically, PC Diet Cola (Caffeine-Free) (UPC code 6038309182) drink, from the “Independent” (Your Independent Grocer) store located at 1341 Broadway Avenue in Regina, Saskatchewan (“Plaintiff Sandoff’s Purchased Product”) was purchased on the Plaintiff, Jason Sandoff’s, behalf. The packaging of the Plaintiff Sandoff’s Purchased Product indicated that it was Low Sodium Product, and the Plaintiff believed he was purchasing Low Sodium Product. 20. On December 12th, 2014 at approximately 3:55 pm, Cindy Retallick purchased Low Sodium Beverage, specifically PC Diet Cola (Caffeine-Free) (UPC code 6038378705) drink, from the Real Canadian Superstore located at 4450 Rochdale Boulevard in Regina, Saskatchewan (“Retallick’s Purchased Product”). 21. The packaging of Retallick’s Purchased Product indicated that they were Low Sodium Products. [Alterations as they appear on amended claim] [2] By way of clarification “PC” is brand manufactured and sold by Loblaws. Ms. Retallick was added as plaintiff in the amendment. [3] The claim goes on to make claims of negligence, breach of warranty, violations of the Competition Act, RSC 1985, C-34, violations of various provincial consumer protection legislation, other statutory violations (i.e. the Consumer Packaging and Labelling Act, RSC 1985, C-38 and the Food and Drugs Act, RSC 1985, F-27), unjust enrichment, waiver of tort and exemplary and punitive damages. [4] Loblaws served its statement of defence and application for summary judgment (with supporting affidavit of Ms. Sherry Casey) on September 24, 2014. The defendants deny any liability to the plaintiffs or any member of the proposed class on the basis that the “low sodium” label is factually correct and that no reasonable person would have assumed that the “low sodium” label meant that the PC Low Sodium Beverages are lower in sodium than other alternate products. [5] The plaintiffs abandoned their claims under negligence, sale of goods legislation, and breach of warranty after hearing the oral submissions of defence counsel. [6] The original plaintiff, Mr. Sandoff, filed his notice of application for certification on September 16, 2015. This notice was amended during the hearing held before myself. The parts of the notice that were amended (save for some minor changes) are as follows: (b) defining the class as “Individuals who purchased “Low Sodium” beverages “all persons in Canada who, on or after October 8th, 2011, purchased Diet Cola, Low Sodium, Caffeine Free or PC Club Soda, Low Sodium (“Low Sodium Beverages”) from Loblaws in Canada.” nan (d) stating the nature of the claims asserted on behalf of class members for breach of consumer protection and sale of goods legislation, breach of warranty, negligence the Competition Act, and waiver of tort on the grounds that: (1) the Defendants made deceptive and misleading advertisement and representation by selling “Low the Low Sodium” Beverages which the Defendants knew or should have known were no lower or appreciably lower in sodium than other non-“Low Sodium” beverages. nan (f) certifying the following issues as common issues: (1) Are “Low Low Sodium” Beverages from Loblaws lower or appreciably lower in sodium than other, non-“Low Sodium” beverages [soft drinks]? (Amended third time by consent post hearing.) (2) Did the Defendants engage in conduct that constitutes deceptive acts or practices contrary to the application applicable consumer protection or sale of goods legislation, by marketing or selling the Low Sodium Beverages that were advertised as “Low Sodium” but we no lower or not appreciable lower in sodium than, non-“Low Sodium” beverages? [Alterations as they appear on amended application] [7] The plaintiffs have filed the affidavit of Ms. Retallick, David Landry and two affidavits of Rhonda Harper (which are essentially the same). As stated above, the defendants rely on the affidavit of Ms. Casey. II. THE FACTS AS PLED AND ADMITTED [8] As set out above, the plaintiffs admit that the “Low Sodium Products” do in fact have minimal sodium content (See para. 17 of the amended claim). [9] Controversy arose during the hearing as to the extent of the defendants’ admission of para. 16 of the plaintiffs’ amended claim (See para. 2, statement of defence). Paragraph 16 of the amended claim states: 16. PC incorporates messaging on the packaging of some items which denotes them as having “Low Sodium” (the “Low Sodium Label”), including but not limited to the following items (“Low Sodium Products”): Example UPC a) Diet Cola Low Sodium, Caffeine Free (2L) b) Diet Cola Caffeine Free (2L) Caffeine Free (can) c) Diet Cola Caffeine Free (12 pk) Caffeine Free (can) d) PC Club Soda Low Sodium (2L) e) PC Club Soda Low Sodium (can) f) PC Club Soda Low Sodium (12 pk) 15 mg [Emphasis Added] [10] It appears that when defence counsel drafted the statement of defence they understood this paragraph to mean that all of the listed items were indeed labelled “Low Sodium”. Unfortunately, the draftor of the statement of claim did not add the PC brand name to each listed drink nor did he add the description “Low Sodium”. Somehow this led counsel for the plaintiffs to believe there had been an admission by the defendants that the listed drinks were “identical” except one drink was labelled “Low Sodium” and another drink was not. This resulted in the plaintiffs arguing in their brief on summary judgment: 1. The Defendants acknowledge that they have put identical products on the market but labelled these identical products differently. There is expert evidence submitted by the Plaintiffs explaining how this is misleading to consumers. The expert evidence of the Plaintiffs in uncontroverted. 2. The facts are undisputed. manufacturer put two identical products on the market but labelled them differently. Intuitively, it is clear that this is misleading. The only reason to label and market identical products differently is to create the illusion that the identical products are different. 3. While the Defendants have gone to great length to try and confuse the issue, the issue is simple. It is misleading to label identical products differently. (Plaintiffs’ brief re: summary judgment dated August 24, 2015) [11] The reply brief on the summary judgment application filed by the defendants challenged this assertion (paras. 20-23). In my opinion at that stage it should have been apparent to the plaintiffs that no such admission had been made. Despite this the plaintiffs persisted in this interpretation of their para. 16 of the claim and continued to rely on the supposed admission. [12] Clearly the defendants did not intend to make any such admission. The wording used by the plaintiffs in para. 16 of their claim is plain and obvious. Paragraph 16 can only be interpreted to mean all of the drinks (no matter how the plaintiffs chose to describe them) are labelled “Low Sodium”. Again, the wording is: “the packaging of some items which denotes them as having “Low Sodium” (the “Low Sodium Label”), including…”. This can only mean the items listed have the low sodium label. note there are only two types of beverages listed here, Diet Cola Low Sodium Caffeine Free and PC Club Soda that are packaged in different sized beverage containers. This accords with Ms. Casey’s affidavit evidence (See: para. of her affidavit) that there are only two products sold by Loblaws with the low sodium label namely Diet Cola Caffeine Free and PC Club Soda labelled low sodium (although as set out above packaged in different sized containers). Ms. Kendall Lee Mackay’s affidavit supports this as well (see para. of her affidavit). [13] Further, because of this turn of events granted counsel for the plaintiffs 14 days to provide evidence that my understanding is not correct. received nothing. Therefore, am confident that defence counsels’ reading of para. 16 is correct and proper admission was made (i.e. all the listed beverages have the “Low Sodium” label) and the plaintiffs’ argument set out in their brief has no factual basis. III. AFFIDAVIT EVIDENCE Ms. Casey’s Evidence [14] Ms. Casey’s affidavit provides the following uncontroverted evidence: Loblaws produces and markets two “low sodium” products: PC Club Soda Low Sodium and PC Diet Cola Caffeine Free/Low Sodium (para. 5); The Canadian Food Inspection Agency [CFIA] regulates the compositional and labelling standards for all foods sold in Canada. CFIA is governed by the regulations under the Food and Drugs Act, RSC 1985, F-27, the Food and Drugs Regulations, CRC 870 [Food and Drug Regulations] and the Consumer Packaging and Labelling Act, RSC 1985, C-38 (para. 16); Loblaws, using the labelling requirements provided on the CFIA website, ensures all of its food products are correctly labelled in accordance with the Food and Drugs Regulations (para. 17); Labelling food “low sodium” is considered to be “nutrient content” claim under the Food and Drugs Regulations. Nutrient content claims are statements which describe, directly or indirectly, the level of nutrient in specific food or beverage that will permit the manufacturer to make particular claim. Nutrient content claims are permitted, provided that the product meets certain compositional and labelling requirements. The CFIA website specifies labelling requirements for nutrient content claims and also specifies the placement and content of all advisement on food (para. 18); The Food and Drugs Regulations allow manufacturers to label soft drinks as “Low Sodium” if the drinks contain less than 140 mg of sodium per 355 ml. PC Low Sodium Beverages contain approximately 20 mg per 355 ml or 14% of the sodium limit set out by the Food and Drugs Regulations for products labelled as “low sodium”. This amounts to 1/7 of what would be permissible (paras. 19-21); Loblaws requires its vendors to conduct nutrient testing on their products to validate the label information. This is to ensure that the compositional requirements of PC products continue to meet the requirements imposed by the Food and Drugs Regulations (para. 22); The packaging of PC Low Sodium Beverages not only indicates the products are “low sodium” but also includes nutritional facts label that describes the actual amount of sodium in each product. All PC Low Sodium Beverages and all other beverage products sold in Canada by Loblaws’ competitors have such labels/and or packaging (para. 23, exhibit c); Loblaws has never branded or represented PC Low Sodium Beverages as being lower in sodium than other beverages even though they are lower in sodium than many other products made by Loblaws’ competitors. PC Low Sodium Beverages (containing 20 mg of sodium/355 ml) are lower in sodium than many competitors (paras. 26, 28-29, exhibit D); On average the PC Low Sodium Beverages are no more expensive than comparable products and Loblaws does not charge extra for low sodium soft drinks (paras. 32-33). [15] note that Ms. Casey has reviewed the claim. She has senior position at Loblaws that appears directly connected to the type of issues and allegations set forth in the claim. She details her background and indicates her education, employment and oversight role regarding the PC product line. Overall, her evidence was direct, useful and on point. As stated, do not see any of her evidence as being contradicted or diminished in any fashion. Mr. Sandoff [16] Mr. Sandoff did not file an affidavit in response to either the summary judgment application or the certification application. note (as set out above) that para. 19 of the claim states that Mr. Sandoff did not actually buy the soft drink. It appears an unnamed person did. Perhaps that is why we heard nothing more from Mr. Sandoff. Ms. Retallick [17] Ms. Retallick did file an affidavit ostensibly to support the certification application (see para. 32 of her affidavit). She describes purchasing (four days before the amendment to the claim was made) the PC Low Sodium Beverage as follows: She states she purchased Low Sodium Beverage, PC Diet Cola (Caffeine Free) (UPC code 6038378705) confirming para. 20 of her claim (para. of her affidavit); Ms. Retallick goes on to depose (paras. 5-7 of her affidavit): 5. The packaging of the beverage indicated that it was “Low Sodium” Beverage, which suggested that was purchasing beverage that was lower in sodium than beverages that were not labelled as “Low Sodium”. 6. Other similar beverages sold by PC and other manufacturers, available at that store, did not claim to be Low Sodium Beverages. Purchasers would reasonably understand based on the Defendants difference in labelling, that the Purchased Beverage contained less sodium than other PC beverages that did not advertise that they were Low Sodium beverages. 7. did not obtain beverage which was materially lower in sodium content than other beverages that did not have the Low Sodium Label. [18] Defence counsel points out in their brief filed July 27, 2015: 18. It is important to note that Ms. Retallick does not allege that: (a) She purchased the PC Low Sodium Beverages because it was labelled “low sodium”; (b) She was misled by the “low sodium” label; (c) The PC Law Sodium Beverage was higher in sodium than she expected it to be; or (d) The attributes of the product she obtained (as opposed to the relative attributes of competing products) were in any way different from those she had been led to expect. [Emphasis in original] [19] Ms. Harper provided two affidavits for the plaintiffs. The affidavits are essentially the same and need only consider the September 18, 2015 affidavit. [20] Defence counsel critically describes the content of Ms. Harper’s affidavit as follows: 19. The Plaintiffs also rely upon purported expert report from Rhonda Harper. It is important to note that Ms. Harper conducted no independent research or surveys in order to prepare her report. There is no indication that she had spoken to either Plaintiff or single member of the proposed class. The majority of her affidavit summarizes the contents of academic articles about marketing and consumer behaviour. Affidavit of Rhonda Harper, sworn February 20, 2015 (“Harper Affidavit”). 20. In only one paragraph of her affidavit does Ms. Harper purport to give an expert opinion: 18. In the case at hand, it is my expert opinion that the Defendant knowingly leveraged the national awareness campaign for sodium-reduction among Canadians, misrepresented its product as “low-sodium” versus the other in its category and misled consumers into purchasing its product based on this claim. Consumers collectively would expect difference in “low sodium” product from others in the line as being meaninfully [sic] higher in sodium. The messaging is not that it is low, and so are other similar products, but that it is meaninfully [sic] lower. Harper Affidavit, para 18 [Defendants brief filed July 27, 2015] [21] find myself in agreement with this criticism. reading of her exhibited report supports the conclusion that she did not specifically direct her mind in meaningful fashion to the claim, the Canadian statues or regulations or in short, the matters at hand. Her conclusion set out in para. 18 of her affidavit seems to be without proper foundation or basis. Again, defence counsel properly sums this up in their brief: 21. The first sentence of the paragraph quoted above represents conclusion with respect to the ultimate issue in this case, whether Loblaws misled consumers. The closer an expert opinion comes to expressing view with respect to the ultimate issue in case, the more stringently the criteria of reliability and necessity must be applied, as it risks usurping the role of the trier of fact. In this case, Ms. Harper has provided no basis for her conclusion. She has no knowledge of Loblaws’ intentions, yet states that it “knowingly” misrepresented its product. She has not spoken to single consumer of the PC Low Sodium Beverages, yet states that they have been misled. In these circumstances, her opinion can be given no weight. Sekhon, 2014 SCC 15 (CanLII) at paras 43 to 48 and at paras 74 to 76 (dissenting on other grounds) 22. Like the affidavit of Ms. Retallick, however, the balance of this paragraph is significant for what it does not state. Specifically, Ms. Harper does not claim that: (a) Loblaws has made any statement that is not factually accurate; (b) Loblaws has ever stated that the PC Low Sodium Products are “lower” in sodium than any other products or are the “lowest sodium” products available; or (c) Consumers who buy PC Low Sodium Beverages are misled as to the sodium content of the product that they are purchasing, as opposed to mistakenly assuming that certain other products are higher in sodium. [Emphasis in original] [22] Therefore, place little weight in her opinion. There is no evidence that the plaintiffs were misled about the sodium content of the drink they purchased, nor did they rely upon the low sodium label when making the purchase and find they did not suffer any damages. IV. THE ISSUES AND ANALYSIS Is Summary Judgment Appropriately Heard Before Certification? [23] Since there are two applications (the defendants’ application for summary judgment and the plaintiffs’ application for certification) am called upon to determine which application should be considered first. [24] The defendants submit that this case is suitable for summary judgment prior to certification because the facts are not disputed and the determination of single legal issue will decide whether the plaintiffs have tenable cause of action. [25] The defendants state that pre-certification summary judgment application is appropriate if there is no genuine issue for trial because: a. The plaintiffs have failed to show genuine ability to prove one or more factual elements to legal cause of action; b. The complaint lacks legal merit; or c. The defendants have an obvious defence to the claim. [para. 26 of the defendants’ brief on summary judgment dated July 27, 2015] [26] It seems that the plaintiffs are in agreement that this case is suitable for summary judgment and note from their brief filed in response to the summary judgment application: 7. It is very unusual for summary judgment to be suitable in the class action context. This is the one in hundred class action case where summary judgment is suitable. 8. The test for summary judgment is met in this case because the application turns on straight forward question of law and the relevant facts are undisputed. In Hryniak v. Mauldin, 2014 SCC (CanLII) [Hryniak] the Supreme Court of Canada sets out two separate issues to address when considering if summary judgment is appropriate (i) whether genuine issue exists; and (ii) if genuine issue does exist, whether its resolution requires conventional trial. 9. Here there is genuine issue. The genuine issue is whether or not it is misleading to label identical products differently. Although genuine issue exists, its resolution does not require conventional trial…. [Emphasis Added] [27] Unfortunately (for the plaintiffs) it seems they have simply misconstrued their own pleadings and seized upon what they believed (but as stated above, incorrectly) was an admission that then emerged as the singular plank in their case. [28] However, dispute the deflation of this argument, the plaintiffs continued with their defence to summary judgment and with the certification hearing. will quickly add at this point that the plaintiffs’ submission that they should receive summary judgment in favour of their claim is clearly without merit. There is no evidence to support this. will continue with the consideration of the defendants’ application for summary judgment to dismiss the claim. [29] agree with defence counsel that there is considerable authority for this Court to hear summary judgment application prior to the certification application. At this point, wish to note that it is only the named plaintiffs that would be subject to this dismissal. There is no application before me with respect to the claims as class as whole. It would be potentially open for other representative plaintiffs to come forward, by issuing new claim under The Class Actions Act. [30] In Roberts Properties Inc. Saskatchewan Power Corp., 2014 SKQB 245 (CanLII), 453 Sask 115 [Roberts], Justice Dawson granted the defendants’ application to strike claim brought under The Class Actions Act pursuant to former Queen’s Bench Rule 173(a), (c) and (e) prior to certification. The plaintiffs in our case argue that Roberts and Filson Canada (Attorney General), 2014 SKQB 164 (CanLII), 447 Sask 219 [Filson], affirmed 2015 SKCA 80 (CanLII), relied on by the defendants, should be distinguished because there are different Rules in play in those cases than here. agree that the Rules may be different but the principle is the same (i.e. the request to dispose of claim before certification). Accordingly, find Roberts and Filson support the defendants request to have the summary judgment application heard and determined before the certification application is determined. [31] Additionally, note other jurisdictions have allowed summary applications to precede the certification hearing. note Justice Martin’s comments in Stewart Enterprise Universal Inc., 2010 ABQB 259 (CanLII), 489 AR 153 where the court stated: 36 While it may be preferable to deal with most applications at the certification hearing, there are sometimes good and compelling reasons for them to be addressed earlier. Efficiency and judicial economy are important, but they are not the only values. Further, motions taken before the certification hearing may in fact contribute to efficiency, judicial economy by narrowing and streamlining the issues and reducing the number of parties. The Alberta Court of Appeal in Tottrup v. Alberta (Minister of Environment), 2000 ABCA 121 (CanLII), 255 A.R. 204 at para. emphasized that robust rules are required for pretrial applications that seek to resolve claims. While that case did not involve the CPA, robust rules ensure plaintiffs have valid causes of action that are properly plead, which both operate to conserve court resources. 37 In addition, it is essential that the process is fair to all parties. In Dutton at para. 26 the Supreme Court noted the important role class actions play in today's world, but also stated that ""[t]he class action offers means of efficiently resolving such disputes in manner that is fair to all parties."" nan 39 Numerous factors will bear on the exercise of discretion and the assessment of efficiency, economy and fairness. Among them is how quickly the matter is proceeding and whether the certification hearing is being pursued in accordance with the presumptive time lines in the legislation. Defendants in potential class-action have at least the same interest as defendants in individual actions in the timely resolution of disputes. The Rules of Court provide defendants with variety of tools to address claims made against them and defendants ought to remain free to choose the timing of their applications as part of their general ability to advance their case. While first past the post system is not the answer, as it values form and speed over substance, plaintiff concerned with litigation by instalments may help forestall that possibility by making an application for certification within the suggested time frame. (See also: Jackson Canadian National Railway, 2013 ABCA 440 (CanLII), [2014] WWR 427; Player Estate Janssen-Ortho Inc., 2014 BCSC 1122 (CanLII) at para 174; and P. (W.) Alberta, 2014 ABCA 404 (CanLII), [2015] WWR 430). [32] Accordingly, I am quite comfortable in following this judicial authority and determining the defendants’ summary judgment application prior to having to decide the plaintiffs’ application for certification. Defendants’ Application for Summary Judgment [33] The applicable Queen’s Bench Rules are: 7-2 party may apply, with supporting affidavit material or other evidence, for summary judgment on all or some of the issues raised in the pleadings at any time after the defendant has filed statement of defence but before the time and place for trial have been set. 7-5(1) The Court may grant summary judgment if: (a) the Court is satisfied that there is no genuine issue requiring trial with respect to claim or defence [34] Regarding Rule 7-5(1)(a) (i.e. genuine issue) Justice Karakatsanis in Hryniak Mauldin, 2014 SCC (CanLII), [2014] SCR 87 stated: 49 There will be no genuine issue requiring trial when the judge is able to reach fair and just determination on the merits on motion for summary judgment. This will be the case when the process (1) allows the judge to make the necessary findings of fact, (2) allows the judge to apply the law to the facts, and (3) is proportionate, more expeditious and less expensive means to achieve just result. [35] Justice Barrington-Foote in Tchozewski Lamontagne, 2014 SKQB 71 (CanLII), 440 Sask 34 [Tchozewski] writes: 30 The central question posed on Rule 7-2 application, accordingly, is whether summary judgment will achieve what Karakatsanis J. calls (at para. 28) the ""principal goal"", and Popescul C.J.Q.B calls ""the overarching consideration"" (at para. 49, Pervez): that is, fair process that results in just adjudication of the dispute before the court. The answer to this question calls for an analysis of the affidavit and other evidence presented and the issues raised by the application, in the context of the litigation as whole. In Hyrniak, Karakatsanis J. breaks that analysis down into discrete steps and key principles ""roadmap"" based on the various elements of the summary judgment rules. In brief, the key elements of that roadmap, in the context of Rule 7-2 application, are as follows: nan 3. The issue is not whether the summary judgment process is as thorough or the evidence is as complete as at trial. It is whether the judge is confident he or she can find the facts and apply the relevant legal principles so as to fairly resolve the dispute. If the judge has that confidence, proceeding to trial is generally not proportionate, timely or cost effective. process that does not give the judge confidence in his or her conclusions, on the other hand, is never proportionate. (Hryniak, paras. 50 and 57) [36] The Tchozewski case provides “roadmap” to be used in summary judgment cases (see para. 30). [37] I find the following facts are not in dispute (i.e. the plaintiffs have not provided contrary evidence and I accept evidence provided by the defendants): i. The plaintiffs acknowledge that the PC Low Sodium Beverages contain minimal sodium (Ms. Casey’s evidence is that they contain 14% of the sodium permitted); ii. The plaintiffs have not provided evidence that Loblaws made any comparative claims stating that its PC Low Sodium Beverages were lower in sodium than any other beverages whether they were made by Loblaws or competitors; iii. The plaintiffs have not contradicted or challenged Ms. Casey’s evidence that all PC Low Sodium Beverages sold in Canada (as well as any competing beverages) have nutritional label setting out the amount of sodium the beverage contains for the consumer to read. [38] Loblaws correctly submits (p. 12 of the defendants’ brief of law for summary judgment): (d) The Plaintiffs have led no evidence that: (i) The Plaintiffs personally were misled in any way by the “low sodium” label; (ii) Any consumers were misled as to any of the attributes of the PC Low Sodium Beverages (as opposed to the relative attributes of competing products); (iii) The Plaintiffs relied upon the “low sodium” representation when purchasing the PC Low Sodium Beverages; or (iv) The Plaintiffs have suffered any damages. [39] have come to the same conclusion as the defendants when they state: 41. In light of this substantial agreement between the parties, the only issue in this action, and on this application, is whether reasonable customer would be misled by “low sodium” label about the attributes of product so labelled. This is legal question to be decided on an objective standard. [Defendants’ brief dated July 27, 2015] [40] Defence counsel in their brief examined this issue and submit: 42. While the Plaintiffs assert several different causes of action in the Statement of Claim, there is considerable overlap among the elements required to establish each claim. In particular, each one requires the Plaintiffs to prove one or more of the following: (a) That the “low sodium” label is inaccurate (i.e. that Loblaws has made “False Representation”); (b) That reasonable customer would have been misled by the “low sodium” label into believing that the PC Low Sodium Beverages were lower in sodium than competing products and that this would have caused the customer to be misled about the attributes of the PC Low Sodium Beverages (i.e. that Loblaws has made “Misleading Representation”); and (c) That the Plaintiffs relied upon the “low sodium” label to their detriment and suffered damages as result (i.e. that the Plaintiffs have suffered “Damages”). 43. Based upon uncontroverted evidence on this motion, the Plaintiffs cannot establish any of these elements and the Statement of Claim raises no genuine issue requiring trial. [Defendants’ brief dated July 27, 2015] [41] Again, agree with and come to the same conclusion as defence counsel that: The plaintiffs have not proven the “low sodium” label is inaccurate; There was no misleading representation about PC Low Sodium Beverages. It appears plaintiffs’ counsel offers the novel argument that because Loblaws competitors do not label their beverages as “low sodium” that results in consumers being misled by Loblaws. cannot accept this premise. Surely truthfully and accurately labelling your product (even though your competitor chooses not to) does not mean you are misleading anyone. Again, note it was the cornerstone of the plaintiffs’ claim that identical products were labelled differently (i.e. one saying low sodium and the other identical product not so labelled). can envision how that may potentially be misleading, but this is not the case before me (see above para. 12). find that there was nothing misleading about the packaging complained of; Consumers could have checked the nutritional labels in any event to read the sodium levels and used their own common sense to make informed decisions; and • There is no evidence that either plaintiffs (or for that matter any member of the proposed class) suffered any damages as a result of purchasing the PC Low Sodium Beverages. The plaintiffs bought what they expected (or could reasonably expect) to receive: low sodium beverage at essentially the same price as other soft drinks. [42] have set out above my finding that there is no genuine issue regarding trial. However, because the plaintiffs pled broad range of statutory breach allegations (although perhaps reducing their claim in the amended notice of application for certification) will go through these claims. Alleged Breach of the Food and Drugs Act or the Consumer Packaging and Labelling Act [43] The plaintiffs alleged that Loblaws breached the Food and Drugs Act, the Food and Drugs Regulations and the Consumer Packaging and Labelling Act. [44] The Food and Drugs Act states in s. 5(1): 5. (1) No person shall label, package, treat, process, sell or advertise any food in manner that is false, misleading or deceptive or is likely to create an erroneous impression regarding its character, value, quantity, composition, merit or safety. [45] The Consumer Packaging and Labelling Act provides in s. 7(1): 7. (1) No dealer shall apply to any prepackaged product or sell, import into Canada or advertise any prepackaged product that has applied to it label containing any false or misleading representation that relates to or may reasonably be regarded as relating to that product. [46] find that the plaintiffs’ claims cannot succeed under the above statutes. The “low sodium” label on the PC Low Sodium Beverages is neither false representation, misleading representation or deception. As found above: the sodium content meets the requirements to be properly called “low sodium” and in fact is about 1/7 of the maximum level. Alleged Breach of the Competition Act [47] The plaintiffs plead s. 36 and 52 of the Competition Act. In reverse order, the statue provides: 52. (1) No person shall, for the purpose of promoting, directly or indirectly, the supply or use of product or for the purpose of promoting, directly or indirectly, any business interest, by any means whatever, knowingly or recklessly make representation to the public that is false or misleading in material respect. nan 36. (1) Any person who has suffered loss or damage as result of (a) conduct that is contrary to any provision of Part VI, or… may, in any court of competent jurisdiction, sue for and recover from the person who engaged in the conduct or failed to comply with the order an amount equal to the loss or damage proved to have been suffered by him, together with any additional amount that the court may allow not exceeding the full cost to him of any investigation in connection with the matter and of proceedings under this section. [48] Accordingly, s. 52(1) creates quasi-criminal offence and s. 36(1) creates civil right of action. To be successful, the plaintiffs must show: i. Loblaws committed the offence described in s. 52 of the Competition Act; ii. The plaintiffs reasonably relied upon their misrepresentation; and iii. The plaintiffs suffered damages as result (See Magill Expedia Canada Corp., 2010 ONSC 5247 (CanLII) at para 108). [49] find that the plaintiffs claim under the Competition Act cannot succeed because: As set out above the “low sodium” label when attached to PC Low Sodium Beverages is neither false representation nor misleading representation; Ms. Casey’s evidence establishes that Loblaws carefully informs itself of the regulations and indeed follows these directions. There is no evidence that the defendants acted “knowingly or recklessly” in labelling the PC Low Sodium Beverages as “low sodium”. Therefore, any claim arising out of s. 52 of the Competition Act would be dismissed; Reasonable reliance is requirement for successful claim under s. 36 of the Competition Act. The plaintiffs seem to concede there was no “reliance” in this case and thereby dropped their claim in negligence. However beyond that, find that no reasonable person could have relied upon the “low sodium” label to conclude that the PC Low Sodium Beverages had characteristics different from those that the product actually has. Therefore, there is no prospect that claim under s. 36 of the Competition Act could have succeeded; As set out above the plaintiffs have not proven they have suffered any damages which is also required under s. 36 of the Competition Act; Additionally, Wakelam Johnson Johnson, 2014 BCCA 36 (CanLII) at paras 90-92, [2014] WWR 7, establishes that s. 36 of the Competition Act provides the exclusive remedy for breaches of s. 52 of the Competition Act. Therefore, the plaintiffs have no right to seek restitutionary remedies (such as unjust enrichment) for breaches of the Competition Act. Alleged Breaches of Consumer Protection Legislation [50] The plaintiffs claim that Loblaws has violated number of pieces of consumer protection legislation (See paras. 43-51 of the amended claim). These statutes are listed in para. 43 of the claim as: 43. The Plaintiffs pleads and relies rely on the provisions of consumer protection legislation in jurisdictions across Canada (collectively, “Consumer Protection Legislation”) including” a. Business Practices and Consumer Protection Act, S.B.C. 2004, c.2 (“BC BPCPA”); b. Fair Trading Act, R.S.A. 2000 c. F-2, as am (“AB FTA”); c. The Consumer Protection Act, SS 1996, c. C-30.1, as am. (“SK CPA”); d. The Business Practices Act, C.C.S.M., B-120, as am. (“MB BPA”); e. Consumer Protection Act, 2002, S.O. 2005, c. 30, Sched. A., as am. (“ON CPA”); f. Consumer Protection Act, R.S.Q. c. P-40.1, as am. (“QC CPA”); g. Consumer Product Warranty and Liability Act, S.N.B. 1978, c. C-18.1 (“NB CPWLA”); h. Business Practices Act, R.S.P.E.I. 1988, c. B-7, as am. (“PEI BPA”); and i. Consumer Protection and Business Practices Act, SNL 2009, C-31.1 (“NFLD CPBPA”). [Alteration as it appears in amended claim] [51] find that all of the above statutes require the plaintiffs to prove that the supplier has made representation that was untrue, deceptive or misleading. For the reasons already provided, these claims under these Acts cannot succeed. Additionally, reading of the cited British Columbia, Alberta, Saskatchewan and Newfoundland and Labrador statutes reveals the plaintiffs would have to establish that they have suffered damages or loss as result of the violation of the applicable Acts. have already found that the plaintiffs have not provided any evidence of this. [52] The plaintiffs seem to cling to the Business Practices and Consumer Protection Act, SBC 2004, of British Columbia arguing “reliance” is not required in British Columbia under s. 172 of that Act (See tab of the plaintiffs’ extracts of argument). However, that argument fails. Defence counsel skilfully took the court through series of cases in oral argument regarding this issue. accept the answer to this issue as set out in the defendants certification brief at para. 81. similar requirement applies under sections 171 and 172(3)(a) of British Columbia’s Business Practices and Consumer Protection Act. It has been held in number of cases that claims under section 171 require proof of individual reliance, causation and loss. Claims under section 172(3), by contrast, are of public nature, and not intended primarily to provide individual remedies. While section 172(3)(a) of the Act permits court to order supplier to restore money to person in the case of certain contraventions of that Act or its regulations, such order are only available if the plaintiff can establish: (i) the existence of constructive trust over an identifiable fund of money; or (ii) that they have personally suffered loss or damage cognizable in law. The Plaintiffs in this case cannot establish either requirement. Any revenues earned by Loblaws from the sale of PC Low Sodium Beverages will have been comingled with other funds, and the Plaintiffs have failed to plead that they have suffered compensable damages as result of the marketing of these products as “low sodium”. Clark Energy Brands Inc., 2014 BCSC 1891 (CanLII), at paras 41, 47 and 126. Ileman at paras 52 and 60 to 61; Wakelam at para 69. [53] Therefore, have concluded that there is no genuine issue requiring trial regarding: i. Any alleged breach of the Food and Drugs Act, or the Consumer Packaging and Labelling Act by Loblaws; ii. Any alleged breach of the Competition Act by Loblaws; and iii. Any alleged breach of any applicable consumer protection legislation by Loblaws. Waiver of Tort, Unjust Enrichment, and Punitive and Exemplary Damages [54] have grouped these claims here and find that none would apply or could be sustained in this claim. particularly note the claim for punitive or exemplary damages has no basis. Ms. Casey’s affidavit sets out that Loblaws mindfully followed the regulations as prescribed. cannot see how they could be held accountable for punitive or exemplary damages. Conclusion Regarding Summary Judgment Application [55] The plaintiffs seem to have placed all of their eggs in one basket when they boldly declared: “it is misleading to label identical products differently”. This was not in any way supported by their pleadings or any affidavit evidence. On that basis alone the summary judgment dismissing their claim should be granted. There is simply no genuine issue requiring a trial. However, have gone through the claim of the plaintiffs and found that none of the claims pled or found in the notice of application for certification ultimately produce genuine issue for trial. Following Justice Barrington-Foote’s comments in Tchozewski, find that am confident that have found the facts and applied the relevant legal principles and can fairly resolve the dispute on the basis of the materials before me. Proceeding to trial is not necessary and would not be proportionate, timely or cost effective. Therefore, I grant the defendants’ application for summary judgment dismissing the plaintiffs’ entire claim. Application for Certification [56] Since I have granted the defendants’ summary judgment application, I do not need to decide the plaintiffs’ application for certification. To complete this matter, because the plaintiffs’ claim is dismissed, I must therefore dismiss the application for certification as well and so order. [57] The defendants claim costs for their summary judgment application. They have been successful. The parties have made extensive comment in their briefs regarding costs. This seems to have been top of mind for all counsel. recognize the cost issue applies to both the summary judgment application and the dismissed certification application that heard. [58] am guided by the recent decision of Justice Schwann in Harvey Western Canada Lottery Corp., 2015 SKQB 102 (CanLII), [2015] WWR 391 where she states: 64 There is strong appellate authority in support of the proposition that s. 40 of the CAA does not prohibit an award of costs on pre-certification applications. (Alves 116; Englund v. Pfizer Canada Inc., 2007 SKCA 62 (CanLII), 299 Sask. R. 298 (Sask. C.A.)) 65 Roberts Properties Inc. v. Saskatchewan Power Corp., 2014 SKQB 245 (CanLII) (Sask. Q.B.) is the most recent decision where this issue arose. Following thorough overview of appellate level cases on this issue, Dawson J. reaffirmed the principle that s. 40 of the CAA does not preclude an award of costs on motion to strike which she found not directly connected to the certification application. Instead, the application to strike was subject to the general rules in relation to awarding costs. She said at para. 92 Although the reasoning in Campbell, supra, is interesting, the Saskatchewan jurisprudence establishes that s. 40 of The Class Actions Act does not operate to prohibit an award of costs, where separate application is considered by the court prior to certification, even if they are argued at the same time. In the Alves trilogy (2011 SKCA 116, 2011 SKCA 117 (CanLII) and 2011 SKCA 118 (CanLII)), there were several applications in the larger context of class action proceeding that were heard before the certification application, but after the motion or certification was filed and served, and while the certification motion was before the court. Justice Richards made it clear that s. 40 did not constitute bar to awarding costs in such circumstances. [Emphasis added] 66 The within application is clearly pre-certification and not directly tied to the certification hearing. Accordingly, applying the prevailing jurisprudence, s. 40 of the CAA is not an impediment to an award of costs. [59] Accordingly, see no reason why the defendants (Loblaws) should not receive their costs for their successful summary judgment application and so order. In regards to the certification hearing, prefer not to order any costs although that application was heard in its entirety. do note that the plaintiffs abandoned major plank in their claim (negligence) after hearing the oral presentation of defence counsel. However, despite this, have decided not to order costs for the certification application.",e_2015skqb345.txt,"HELD: The court granted summary judgment for the defendants.
It held that it could determine the defendants’ application prior to the plaintiffs’ application for certification.
The court found that the facts were not in dispute and there was no evidence that the plaintiffs or any members of the proposed class had suffered any damages.
The plaintiffs’ argument that it was misleading to label identical products differently was not supported by their pleadings or any affidavit evidence.
There was no genuine issue requiring a trial.
The court reviewed the various alleged breaches of statute and dismissed them.
It was not necessary to decide the application for certification."
